   <p>The new Jewish Douglas Park Theater, for this season, opened last evening in a very impressive manner, and the stars, Misha &amp; Lucy German, together with their New York company, have for the first time, appeared before an overcrowded audience in W. Siegel's powerful melodrama, "Rachel's Children" which met with great approbation. All actors were received with loud applause at their first performance. Upon concluding the 2nd act, an enthusiastic ceremony was carried through in honor of the troupe which was showered with bouquets of flowers by organizations and individual patriots.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0324.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The representative of the Jewish Actors Union, Rueben Gooskin, who came especially to the opening of the first cooperative union theater in Chicago, greeted the audience of the premiere - performance, appealing for their support for the new Jewish theatrical undertaking and promised the audience an interesting and mirthful season.</p>
   <p>A special performance of "Rachel's Children" will be dramatized this evening in the Douglas Park Theater for selected guests and representatives of the Jewish press.</p>
