   <p>Zuckerberg back from New York - Will soon open his new bag of tricks.</p>
   <p>Something new is expected in the theatrical world. Hrshel Zuckerberg (the Prime Minister) of the Empire, who was visiting New York for the last two weeks is returning, with packs and bags of new tricks for the Chicago Jewish theatre goers.</p>
   <p>In the Chicago theatrical circles, it is well known, if Zuckerberg is returning from a trip in the east, he must bring with him something new, something surprising. Zuckerberg tells what he has accomplished in New York. First of all he divided the heritage with Edwin A Relkin. Relkin will be the King of the East and Zuckerberg the King of the West. Zuckerberg will send out companies, from Chicago to towns and cities in the west. Zuckerberg's power in the west is well known by Relkin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0273.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For next season Mr. Zuckerberg engaged a well known actress for the Empire, which is a loss for New York, and that is the famous soubrette, Dora Weisman.</p>
   <p>As to plays, Mr. Zuckerberg has arranged with the Author's League of New York, which permits him to present in Chicago all the plays that are being played in New York.</p>
