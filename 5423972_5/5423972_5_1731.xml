   <p>Tales have been spread lately about the "Jewish Folk School." Everyone expresses his opinion without any further investigation.</p>
   <p>The chief arguments against us are two-fold: The first is a patriotic one. "Because we Jews invade the public schools through our Jewish school, the other nationalities might imitate us. This would endanger the unity of Americanism." To this we reply that America does not object to parochial schools, Catholic college, etc. So why should we not enjoy the same freedom? The second argument is of a somewhat different nature. Our Rabbis contend that no religion is taught. To this accusation we wish to reply by giving an explanation of our nature as well as of our aims.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1732.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We, of the Jewish Folk School, are delegates elected by the Poale Zion and National Workman's Verbund branch, #6 and #77. Our aim is Jewish education. We have been requested to open a Jewish Folk School, which would teach Hebrew, Jewish history, ethics, songs and literature, as well as the geography and history of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Our aim is not to teach the Commandments, nor the fringed garment prayer, confirmation, etc. These subjects can be taught the children by our Rabbis.</p>
   <p>If we do not teach religion, we nevertheless explain the Jewish Tonach and the holy days to the children, nor do we withhold from them the religious poetry to be found in Tonach and in our holy days.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1733.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When we undertook to open such a folk school we were faced by two obstacles. First of all we would have to rent an entire building, including janitor's services. Our financial situation made such a thing impossible. Secondly, even if we should have had the financial means, the essential of a folk school, would still have been lacking. Then we would at most have been able, to open only one such school. But we have about 40,000 Jewish children in Chicago, ranging from six to 14 years of age. About 5,000 of this number receive a Jewish education in the Talmud Torahs and various confirmation schools. Thus 35,000 Chicago Jewish children are deprived of a Jewish education and do not even know the Hebrew alphabet. Such unfortunate children are truly outside the pale of society.</p>
   <p>When we contemplatedthe formation of folk schools, we hoped to be able to use the public schools in the evening. As the board of education would not <pb facs="5423972_5_1734.jpg" n="4"/>allow religious instruction, we would have to omit it. We thus approached the Chicago Board of Education through its member, Mr. Harvey Lipsky. In the meantime our request to use the John Smythe School at 13th Street and Blue Island Avenue, was approved. But our deficit there runs from $60 to $70 a month. We have appealed to the Federated Charities for aid. We hope that soon all our opponents will also say "Amen."</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
