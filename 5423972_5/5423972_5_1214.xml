   <p>There will be a conference tomorrow--at the Jewish Theological College--of all synagogue presidents of Chicago to consider the membership drive of that institution. Presidents or representatives of synagogues who will not come to the conference tomorrow are neglecting their duties in the worst way. Orthodox synagogues which do not take part in such work as helping the Jewish Theological College may be safely ignored, because they are not synagogues, they are not congregations, but only little praying houses which have no Jewish interests except praying. At tomorrow's conference at the Jewish Theological College there should be present not only representatives of the big synagogues but also representatives of the small synagogues, <pb facs="5423972_5_1215.jpg" n="2"/>because the small synagogues have the same duties as the big ones. The small membership of a synagogue is no valid excuse for its not fulfilling its duties. The membership drive of the Jewish Theological College will surely be a success if all presidents or representatives of all Orthodox synagogues of Chicago are present at the conference, because every president of a synagogue, no matter how small it is, can enroll thirty members for the Jewish Theological College. Every Jew in Chicago who is a member of an Orthodox synagogue must also become a member of the Jewish Theological College. This can easily be realized if all the rabbis and synagogue presidents start to work earnestly.</p>
   <p>Do then your duty! Do you expect our pseudo socialists to support the Jewish Theological College? Do then your duty and see to it that the rabbis should also do their duty. They should be the first ones to take a part in this work.</p>
