   <p>Jewish Pioneers in America, by Anita Libman Lebeson, a resident of Hubbard Woods, although just off the press, already is receiving the highest praise from historians and leaders in American Jewry. Not only is this volume an outstanding document portraying the part Jews have played in the growth of this continent, starting with the Jewish sailors who accompanied Columbus, but it reads like a romance - a romance woven together from hitherto unknown important historical facts.</p>
   <p>The book is written in a convincing and yet restrained manner, which carries with it both authority and appreciation on the part of the reader that this Chicago woman has handled her subject in an amazingly impartial and capable manner.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1078.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Lebeson truly is a product of Chicago and its environs. She came to this city in her early childhood with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Morris Libman of 540 Briar Place. She was graduated from the University of Illinois in 1913, where she received the degree of Bachelor of Arts. As a result of her excellent scholarship she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Kappa Delta Pi.</p>
   <p>While doing graduate work at the University of Illinois, she carried on researches in the Jewish participation in the development of the Mississippi Valley. She also did considerable research work for the Illinois Historical Survey and the Illinois Centennial Commission. She has contributed many learned discussions to the Mississippi Valley Historical Review.</p>
   <p>During the academic year 1918-1919, whe was a member of the faculty of the history department at the University of Illinois. For five years after that, <pb facs="5423972_5_1079.jpg" n="3"/>Mrs. Lebeson was on the history faculty of the John Marshall High School, where she earned for herself the reputation of being one of the leading history teachers in the Chicago public school system.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lebeson traces the travels of pioneer Jews with Cortez through the dense forests of Mexico, those who pierced the South American Wilderness, braved the swamps of the West Indies and penetrated into the far reaches of the North American continent under the English, French, Dutch, and Portugese flags. The story opens with the discovery of America. It links the dark dismal days of the Inquisition with the new vistas opened up by the discovery of the Western continent. Many highly interesting aspects of Colonial life are introduced. The participation of Jews in the Revolutionary movement, in the War of 1812, as patriots, privateers, soldiers, officers and financiers is chronicled.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1080.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The 19th century struggle for equality and recognition is recorded. The Reform movement is traced historically and Jewish efforts at American colonization are noted. The illustrations are especially well chosen. Some of them are very rare and never have been reproduced before in any volume of history. There is a wood cut of the Jews of the Inquisition first printed in 1492, a map of Newport which was used by the British Admiralty in 1776, showing a number of places of Jewish interest. In addition there are two rare and early maps of South America and the New World.</p>
   <p>For those who desire to read further than Mrs. Lebeson's sparkling narrative, there is a thorough and completely documented appendix, containing footnotes and a detailed bibliography. The appendix itself as a work of historical research has been highly commended by historians. Her husband, Herman Lebeson, is a well known food chemist in Chicago.</p>
