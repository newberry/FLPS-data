   <p>The patronizers of the Yiddish theater may be prepared for many surprises the coming season. The Yiddish theater in New York as well as in Philadelphia and Chicago, has made rapid strides during the last year, and has become a great Jewish institution. There are twelve permanent Yiddish theaters in New York, besides there are two Yiddish vaudeville houses, always playing to capacity houses. There are in Chicago now three Yiddish theaters. Even St. Louis has now a permanent Yiddish theater of its own. All told there are at least twenty Yiddish theaters in the United States. All these Yiddish theaters are headed by men and women who know the business, and who are devoting all their time and energy to the development of the Yiddish stage. Recently a few New York Yiddish impressarios have imported new stars from Europe, and have thus enriched considerably the artistic staff of the Yiddish theaters. There is a tendency in Jewish theatrical circles in New York to bring over from Europe the great Jewish <pb facs="5423972_5_0115.jpg" n="2"/>actors of the German stage and to engage them for the Yiddish stage in America. Needless to say the Yiddish theaters will only gain in prestige and reputation from the co-operation of the great German Jewish artists. The greatest Yiddish tragedians living, Madame Bertha Kalish, who is said to be one of the greatest seven actresses of our time, has also returned to the Yiddish stage after an absence of several years. The many newcomers and those who have returned to the Yiddish stage, will certainly contribute to raise the artistic level of the Yiddish theater, and will make it worth while, even for non-Yiddish speaking Jews to patronize the Yiddish theater.</p>
   <p>The Yiddish theatergoing public in Chicago will also be satisfied to learn that the managers of the two principal houses in Chicago Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Glickman, have done their very best to secure for their houses good casts, and a stock of good plays to be produced here during the coming season. Mr. Bernstein who is himself one of the most famous comedians on the Yiddish stage, has secured the service of the well-known tragedienne, Madame Melvina Lobel, and of Miss Nellie Kessman, a comedienne full of vivacity and gracefulness. Mr. Glickman has brought <pb facs="5423972_5_0116.jpg" n="3"/>with him from New York an all-star cast, including Miss Dora Weissman, an able and versatile actress, who has often taken audiencies by storm, Mr. Isadore Meltzer, an eminent comedian, Mr. David Popper, and Mr. and Mrs. Teitlbaum, and many others. For the first time in the history of the Chicago Jewish theater we will have here two great houses, vying with one another in the production of good plays and in good acting. This will only serve to attract the Jewish theater-goers and to make them patronize more the Yiddish theater.</p>
   <p>Needless to say that a good Yiddish theater is a great asset to every Jewish community, because the Yiddish theater is not only a temple of art, but is also a valuable social factor in the community. Many Jewish organizations live and thrive because the Jewish theater enables them to be financially independent and to continue their activities. The Yiddish theater is instrumental in securing tens of thousands of dollars for Jewish charitable and philanthropic purposes, and therefore it is a blessing to the community. The better equipped a Yiddish theater is, the better a social philanthropic agency it is, and therefore the development of the Yiddish theater must be looked upon with satisfaction by all those who take an interest in Jewish life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0117.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There are said to be some ten million Germans in America. There is not one independent German theater in the United States. There are only three million Jews in America, and there are twenty independent Yiddish theaters in the United States. This is very characteristic of the tendency of our people, and it goes to indicate that we cling to our institutions.</p>
   <p>We hope that our Yiddish theatergoers in Chicago will patronize the Yiddish theaters, and that the latter will do their very best to satisfy the public, and to make it consider the Yiddish theater a great American Jewish institution.</p>
