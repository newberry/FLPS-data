   <p>Abe Cohan, editor of the Jewish Forward, has written a very enthusiastic and inspiring recension about the "Man With the Portfolio."</p>
   <p>It is perhaps the first Jewish play to make a tremendous hit in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>The action takes place in the Soviet union, and portrays very vividly the life in present Russia.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cohan writes:</p>
   <p>"There were moments in which the enthusiasm waxed so high that the people almost jumped from their seats, as if the whole building would crash as a result of the unexpected surprises and thrills.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0064.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the third act, when Granatov delivers his speech, Mr. Schwarts reaches the highest stage of dramatic art. He is simply brilliant in that part. Miss Stella Adler is also very unusual in her role. Madame Appel was superb in her part; she simply bewitched the audience with her charm and artistry.</p>
   <p>On the whole the play was interesting and worthwhile in every respect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cohan is recommending every Jew in Chicago not to fail to see this extraordinary production, "The Man With the Portfolio."</p>
