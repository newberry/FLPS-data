   <p>With the opening of the Peoples Relief Bazaar this evening in the Ashland Auditorium, an historic event will be recorded in the annuals of Jewish philanthropy in Chicago. The profits will go for children education and for tools to cultivate the soil in Europe.</p>
   <p>The bazaar will open at 7 P. M. sharp. A musical program will take place at 8. P. M.</p>
   <p>Belle Bendu, the principle assistant of the Chicago Grand Opera ballet, arranged beatiful ballets for the evening. Loretta Dikoff, together with the two wonder-children, Miriam Foy, eight, and Jane Chucan, seven, will be the main dancers of the Russian Ballet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0489.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Several organizations, regardless of what nature, have registered to aid the bazaar. The Workmen's Circle; The International Ladies Garment Union; The Waiters Union; The Bakers Union; The Jewish Candy Jobbers; The Douglas Day and Night Nursery; The Northwest Side Mothers League; The Bealystok Countrymen; and several other large and small organizations have united for this great and noble relief work.</p>
   <p>In addition to the ballet, a very interesting program of songs will be carried through, in which such musical talents as Nicholas Karlas, Bessie Goldstein, the Colored Carusoe, Arthur Lylard, and others will participate. The numbers that will be sung, will unite all nations and will be in various languages.</p>
   <p>Raphael Spiro, talented violinist will play "Kol Nidre" and other classical selections.</p>
