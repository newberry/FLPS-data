   <p>The reactionary [newspaper, the Daily Jewish] Courier again falsely accuses the Cloakmakers' Union [of internal dissensions]. The Courier, however, received a sharp and well-earned answer to its lies from Comrade Max Brodsky, the secretary-treasurer of Local 100, International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. The answer speaks for itself. Brodsky said: "I deny all the statements that were published in the Courier under my name. I am absolutely not responsible for yesterday's scribbling in that paper, in which an attempt was made [by the Courier] to justify itself by using my name. I want to state that whatever the Courier writes about me is a lie.</p>
   <p>"First of all, the Courier wanted to show that I was a candidate for secretary-treasurer of the Joint Board on the left-wing ticket. It also attempted to prove, in a rather torturous manner, that two opposing groups can be found in the Joint Board, a left and a right wing. I deny these statements. Furthermore, the Courier stated that Schoolman, and those who supported Rosen's candidacy for secretary-treasurer, compelled me to withdraw my candidacy for <pb facs="5423972_5_0868.jpg" n="2"/>secretary-treasurer of the Joint Board. This is not true. The truth is as follows: Brother Fogel, manager of the labor department of the Joint Board proposed that both candidates should withdraw in order to avoid certain misunderstandings. I immediately accepted the proposal of Brother Fogel and resigned. When I was later renominated, I refused to accept the nomination. Brother Rosen, however, remained a candidate, and the result was that Brother Conefsky was elected. This is the truth; not that written by the Courier."</p>
