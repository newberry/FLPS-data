   <p>The socialist school for children organized by the Douglas Park branch of the Socialist party is very successful.</p>
   <p>Yesterday morning 125 children were present, 35 more than a week ago Sunday. The teacher sang socialistic songs adapted to American melodies with the children. According to the impression of the teacher the children are progressing rapidly. The committee of the Douglas Park branch controlling this school made a party for the children. They had ice cream, cake and candy. The children amused themselves, and went home happy and satisfied.</p>
   <p>The Douglas Park branch also organized the parents of the children attending this school. The parents pay a twenty-five cents entrance fee, and ten cents per month. This money goes towards the fund for purchasing books and music for the school. All socialist parents are duty-bound to send their children to the socialist school every Sunday at 10 o'clock in the morning at the clubrooms, 3225 West Twelfth Street.</p>
