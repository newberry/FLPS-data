<title level="a">BEAUTIFUL BALL SUNDAY EVENING FOR HEBREW INSTITUTE</title>.
</bibl>

   <p>One of the grandest balls will take place "Simchath Torah" in the luxurious hall of the New Jewish Institution, which was just purchased. ALL ARE EXPECTED.</p>
   <p>Sunday evening - "The Eve of Rejoicing in "The Torah", in the beautiful and spacious hall of the newly purchased Hebrew Institute, a ball will be given, which is the final act of the glorious festival, which continued the entire Mid-Week of Succoth, at the park of the Hebrew Institute. The Arrangement Committee, which bears the responsibility to make this affair a success, assures the public that this ball will be different from any ever held for the benefit of a Jewish Institution.</p>
   <p>The hall is beautifully decorated and will be brightly illuminated. It has a great capacity, assuring everyone of the maximum degree of comfort. There will be a fine orchestra, and the dancers will have a grand time.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jewish youth of Chicago should take advantage of this opportunity and come to the ball en masse, for not only will they enjoy themselves, but they will also share in this noble Institution-The Hebrew Institute, which was founded with the sole objective of implanting Judaism and American Patriotism among the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>To miss this affair will mean to lose an evening of merriment, of which you may have sweet memories in the years to come. Jews of all walks of life will participate in this affair, and this offers an opportunity, to meet people, whom you have not seen for a long time, and whom you will not be able to meet elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The need for the Hebrew Institute is deeply rooted within the hearts of Chicago Jews, and it is therefore, our sincere hope that this ball will be a success.</p>
   <p>Remember the ball Sunday evening, where you will surely enjoy yourself and help lead a Jewish Institution to success.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is located at Taylor, Little and Sybley Streets; All cars take you there.</p>
