   <p>The board of education of the city public schools has realized for sometime that it is important for children [of foreign language groups] to know their people's language and history. Therefore, the members of the board of education, recognizing the truth of this statement, have concluded that every child, in order to develop [correct] ethical attitudes, should study the language and history of his group.</p>
   <p>To carry through this important reform is a rather difficult, and almost impossible, task. Therefore, the board of education, accepting the proposal of its member, Mr. H. A. Lipsky, decided to conduct the following experiment: classes in Hebrew and Jewish history are to be held at the John Smith school located at 13th Street between Blue Island Avenue and Woller Street. These classes will be supervised by an educational committee representing the board of education and the branches of the [Jewish] National Workers' Alliance and the Poale Zion [Socialist Zionist Party]. [The alliance and the Poale Zion] have undertaken the task of arranging the courses and furnishing competent <pb facs="5423972_5_1769.jpg" n="2"/>teachers.</p>
   <p>The classes will open Monday, July 28. Registration begins today at the Palace Opera House, 9 A.M. to 1 P.M., and will continue during the remainder of the week at the same place, 7 P.M. to 9 P.M.</p>
