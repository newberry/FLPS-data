<title level="a">THE PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE HEBREW THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Rabbi Saul Silber</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Those who are interested in the Hebrew Theological College, who have great plans for its improvement, and who are willing to bend every effort to guarantee its development and success, must, first of all, have some data on the material that the Theological College possesses. By "material," we mean the students of that institution.</p>
   <p>At present there are 235 students attending the Hebrew Theological College and 145 students in the Yeshivah Etz Hayim [a branch of the Theological College]. The students of the Yeshivah Etz Hayim are divided into six Talmud classes, taught by three Talmud teachers.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Theological College has divided 90 students into six classes, <pb facs="5423972_5_1335.jpg" n="2"/>conducted by four eminent rabbis. Four other teachers have been engaged to teach the students of both institutions the Bible, grammar, Hebrew, and history. The students are superior individuals and there are a significant number of them who have the qualities and characteristics of our ancient sages.</p>
   <p>The students are too young to have a broad knowledge and understanding of the Talmud and its commentaries. About twenty-two students also attend university classes where they distinguish themselves. Everyone who sees them recognizes them as the blessed children of God. About sixty students of the Theological College have either been born or have been reared in America, and among them, there are some from as far west as Houston, Texas and as far north as St. Paul.</p>
   <p>From what has already been said, we believe that we can gain some understanding, although incomplete, of the material that the Hebrew Theological College <pb facs="5423972_5_1336.jpg" n="3"/>has at the present time. We say at the present time, because we must not, under any circumstances, have a fixed opinion. Another educational institution must be organized within the Hebrew Theological College, viz., a teachers' seminary. When this institution is organized, the number of students will increase.</p>
   <p>Now that we know something about the material of the Hebrew Theological College, we can discuss the spirit prevailing in the College and also the basis upon which the board of education will try to develop the institution.</p>
   <p>We hope that the dominating spirit within this institution will be purely religious and nationalistic--the very same spirit that has dominated Judaism throughout the centuries of our history and which has been the backbone of our people.</p>
   <p>These two elements [religion and nationalism] are identical. One nurtures the <pb facs="5423972_5_1337.jpg" n="4"/>other, and we are convinced that the religious and nationalistic spirit will inspire all the Jews of Chicago who wish to elevate the Crown of the Torah and the national honor; who wish to work tirelessly for the development and success of the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>The purposes and objectives of the Hebrew Theological College will be to train the qualified members of the growing generation to be real, conscientious, and upright Jews, and to extend to those among them who will choose this sacred work as their lifework, every opportunity to attain their objective.</p>
   <p>We believe that it is necessary to point out these basic principles to which the students must adhere in order to become real, conscientious, and upright Jews:</p>
   <p>1. They must learn to love God from the depths of their souls.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1338.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>2. They must study the Torah diligently and arduously with all the vigor that they have, and they must lead lives in harmony and accord with its religious, moral, and ethical precepts.</p>
   <p>3. They must try to understand the Jewish people and their problems; to feel their tragic history; to dream their dream; to sacrifice for them when sacrifices are necessary.</p>
   <p>A true Jew is one who is "true in himself" and is at peace with the outside world. A true Jew is one who possesses a Jewish mind plus a Jewish heart. Both intellect and character must be woven from the fabric of the Torah.</p>
   <p>Because the word, Torah, has recently become so elastic and has been misused, we wish to define it. The "Torah," which begins with Moses and extends, like a strand of pearls, to Rabbi Akibah and his contemporaries, and the "Torah" from Moses Maimonides to the great Gaon of Wilno will be studied in written and oral form--the "Torah," which seeks to raise man <pb facs="5423972_5_1339.jpg" n="6"/>from the animal level, to eradicate bestial passions from the human heart and to implant morality and virtue therein; the "Torah" which carries man on the wings of an eagle to celestial spheres; the "Torah" which seeks to free him from his earthly chains; the "Torah" which seeks to solve the eternal riddle of the universe....; the "Torah" which seeks to establish the relationship of friendship between the Creator and Man.</p>
   <p>All students, particularly those who wish to become rabbis and teachers, will follow this course and we shall devote more time and skill to teaching these students because their task will be to elevate Judaism and to defend it against any threat.</p>
   <p>So far, we have discussed, in general [terms], the spirit which the board of education will eventually have to mold. We believe that we must also discuss the organizational system and the details of the curriculum of the Hebrew Theological College, with which the board of education will have to busy itself.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1340.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The board of education will be divided into three committees: one for the Yeshivah Etz Hayim, one for the Theological College, and one for a Teachers' Seminary. These committees will meet every Monday and plan the co-ordinating principles for the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>The tasks of the board of education are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. It must engage competent teachers approved by the officers of the institution.</p>
   <p>2. It must hold the teachers responsible for their work.</p>
   <p>3. It must draw up a complete curriculum for the respective teaching departments and consult with the faculty as to the time required for study.</p>
   <p>4. The board of education will have to give much of its time, at present, <pb facs="5423972_5_1341.jpg" n="8"/>to organizing the following studies: Bible, grammar, language, history, and other classes.</p>
   <p>5. It will have to convince the students that it is concerned with secular studies also, and that it is their duty to know these studies and not simply an optional choice.</p>
   <p>6. It will have to introduce an additional number of organizational questions into the classes, and to fix the "boundaries" between the suitable candidates for the Hebrew Theological College who could and should enter the Yeshivah, and the requirements of the Theological College for those who will continue their studies.</p>
   <p>The board of education will have to fix the "boundaries" where one department ends and another begins. These "boundaries" are essential and we will call them the "boundaries of the Torah".</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1342.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>7. The board of education will have to examine the students to see what progress the students have made and to find out the reasons why some students are behind in their studies and try to help them; it will have to award prizes for essays on the Talmud and other subjects.</p>
   <p>8. It will have to divide the semesters and academic years, and determine the amount of time to be spent on the various courses. (We recommend three years for the Yeshivah, five years for the Teachers' Seminary, and seven years for the Theological College.)</p>
   <p>9. The board of education must become interested in the subjects that the students study in the universities and must see to it that the students who take an academic course should take up subjects which will be in harmony with the tasks and ideals of the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>10. It must formulate the "wisdom of Israel" that is to be taught to the <pb facs="5423972_5_1343.jpg" n="10"/>students.</p>
   <p>11. It must immediately engage a teacher of public speaking and voice training for those students who have recently come from overseas, in order to improve their accents which are often very harsh.</p>
   <p>12. It must enter into close contact with the students; it must select among them the most gifted and encourage them in their studies; it must make them conscious of their great undertaking and inspire them to continue the sacred work that they are engaged in, and instill in their hearts love for the Torah and fear of God.</p>
   <p>13. It must become interested in the material condition and welfare, and in the physical condition of the students.</p>
   <p>A subcommittee of the board of education should confer with the Budget committee <pb facs="5423972_5_1344.jpg" n="11"/>and jointly determine the [amount of] financial support to be given to the students.</p>
   <p>We believe that we have covered the temporary needs of the Hebrew Theological College and we hope that the worthy rabbis and gentlemen of the board of education will exert every effort so as to carry through all the points herein mentioned.</p>
   <p>We wish to state, although it is out of place [here], that the expenses of the Hebrew Theological College amount to $30,000 a year, but for the forthcoming year $50,000 will be required for several improvements which are urgently needed.</p>
   <p>We look to the future joyfully and hopefully, because we are proud of the edifice which the Orthodox Jews have built; we know that the board of directors is ready to do its duty and to exert all its efforts for the <pb n="12"/> success of this institution, which has such wonderful and highly-gifted student material.</p>
   <p>We feel that the Hebrew Theological College will become a center of the "Torah" and of [Theological] Science, under whose banner the best elements of our youth of Chicago and the Middle West will rally to quench their thirst for the Word of God. Built in the western part of America and supported by the Jews of these states, the Hebrew Theological College will kindle a bright fire whose flames will eventually warm many Jewish hearts. The light of the West [Hebrew Theological College of Chicago] will bear witness that the Lord reigns over Israel.</p>
