   <p>The building for the Hebrew Theological College will soon be ready. An organization to manage the institution will be functioning even before the doors of the building are open. The constitutional committee, which was appointed to draft the constitution and bylaws [for the institution] held several meetings and unanimously adopted a draft for a constitution. This draft will certainly be approved by the general assembly because the draft says plainly that the Hebrew Theological College is an Orthodox institution, which is to serve as an educational and spiritual center for the Orthodox Jewry of Chicago and the Middle West.</p>
   <p>This is a clear and broad program. It will be the task of the educational council to realize the program in all its details. This program will satisfy all the groups of the Chicago Orthodoxy. It will satisfy the Orthodox Jews because the program lays particular stress upon the study of the Talmud and its <pb facs="5423972_5_1370.jpg" n="2"/>Commentaries. It will satisfy the scholars because it includes Jewish studies in its curriculum--Hebrew literature, Jewish history, and Jewish philosophy. It will satisfy the practical members of the community who are not as much interested in the creation of a spiritual center in Chicago as they are in the creation of a teachers' seminary, so that the Talmud Torahs now in existence, as well as those which will be established in the future, will have well-trained, well-educated teachers.</p>
   <p>The program of the Hebrew Theological College, as stated in the draft of the constitution, has taken into consideration all the spritual requirements of the community. The College can, therefore, appeal to all the Jewish groups of Chicago. We hope that all the Chicago Jews will support the Hebrew Theological College, which is a necessary and noble institution.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, the present board of directors and the general assembly will adopt the constitution. We will soon have a well-organized body in Chicago, upon which the Hebrew Theological College can depend. The Chicago Jews now have to finance the building of the Hebrew Theological College, so that it can open its doors at the beginning of next semester.</p>
