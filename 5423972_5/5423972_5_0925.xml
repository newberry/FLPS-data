   <p>Not less than 15,000 Chicago Jewish workers participated in the holiday. There were great ovations for the speakers and for Rosa Raisa, the great opera star. The memory of this event will remain in the minds of the participants for years to come.</p>
   <p>On New-Year Eve, Tuesday December 31st, 1918, over 15,000 Chicago Jewish workers congregated at the Large Coliseum to celebrate the publication of the Forward in Chicago. The proceeds from the sale of the first edition was contributed to the people's relief. By 8:00 o'clock the hall was filled to capacity and even standing room was not available. Soon the platform was filled with honored guests. The first speaker on the program was J. Louis Engdhal, Editor of the Chicago Socialist. The applause was terrific. The next speaker was <pb facs="5423972_5_0926.jpg" n="2"/>Seymour Stedman, a noted attorney who defended five defendants for socialistic propaganda, in federal court. Other speakers were as follows: Mr. Radriges, Robert Howe, the former Editor of the World, K. Marmar , former Manager of the World, Morris Ziokind, Representative of the Workers Ring, L. Beneson, representative of the United Jewish Workers Alliance, H. Shnide, representative of various other workers organization. Toward the end of this great event, a few more of the most highly honored guests, were introduced as speakers, Alderman B. Vladek, General manager of the Forward, and Judge Jacob Peukin, President of the Forward. The applaud for these two speakers was great beyond description. After the enthusiastic crowd finally quited down, the famous Prima Donna, Rosa Raisa, of the Chicago grand opera entered the hall. The audience simply went wild, happiness and applause beyond reason looking at the girl genius from Bialestock Russia. She sang Russian Melodies and other songs from the old Fatherland. She concluded her concert with the most beautiful of Jewish songs, Eli, Eli.</p>
