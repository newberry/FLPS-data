   <p>The annual banquet of the Hebrew Theological College last night was an impressive affair. About four hundred men and women, among them the most prominent members of the Jewish Orthodox Community, filled the great hall of the Hebrew Theological College where the banquet took place.</p>
   <p>Harry A. Lipsky was toastmaster. The speakers were: Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon, Simeon Kramer, who spoke in Hebrew, Max Shulman, Sam Ginsburg, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, and Rabbi Saul Silber. All speakers stressed the great importance of the Hebrew Theological College for the future of Jewish Orthodoxy in America.</p>
   <p>The guests responded generously to the appeal in behalf of this great and worthy institution. The sum of fifteen thousand dollars was raised in cash <pb facs="5423972_5_1241.jpg" n="2"/>and pledges.</p>
   <p>The brothers Paul and Adolph Broide gave a check for a thousand dollars to honor the memory of their father, Rabbi Broide, and their mother.</p>
   <p>Eight people have each pledged a scholarship of five hundred dollars a year for the Hebrew Theological College. The eight people were: Louis Bomash, Samuel Phillipson, Israel Balaban, in the name of his deceased daughter Ida, John Risman, Mendel Zeuin, the children of Ben-Zion Leizerowich, S. P. Platt, and E.
