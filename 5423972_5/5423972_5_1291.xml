   <p>Thank God, we already have in Chicago a Hebrew Theological College where three hundred young men are engaged in study from early morning till late at night. The institution is internally, as well as externally, a pride for Chicago, especially a pride for the Chicago Jewry who built the Hebrew Theological College and who maintain it with due respect. If everything goes well, we will have in three or four years hence three or four hundred young men there. Chicago--the Ir Hanadchas (a city [that] strayed away, the inhabitants of which fell into idolatry) of yesterday--will become the center of Torah tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The world, however, does not consist of Torah alone, but of Torah plus respect. Just as we already have a Hebrew Theological College, we are now in need of another, and much larger, institution, viz., a College of <pb facs="5423972_5_1292.jpg" n="2"/>Respect. The Hebrew Theological College is only for a few hundred young men, but the College of Respect should serve the whole Chicago Jewry--young and old, adults and minors, poor and rich, educated and illiterate. The president of the Hebrew Theological College is a rabbi--and it is proper that a rabbi be the president of a Torah institution. As president of the College of Respect, I would name my friend and sympathizer, Mr. Mathew, a man with great approbation for age and education.</p>
   <p>Chicago is now a city with a large Jewish population. It has a number of Jewish charities which do a great deal of charitable work. The Chicago Jewish community is also engaged in spiritual and intellectual work. The only thing lacking to make it the most beautiful Jewish community in America is a College of Respect. You must admit that if the Chicago Jewish community would have self-respect, if the various Jewish groups in Chicago would have respect for one another, many things would not occur that do occur and that does not add prestige to us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1293.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If the laymen would have respect for the rabbis, they would, under no circumstances, assent that the rabbis do things they should not [do], as for example, organize communal work, help maintain the synagogue, enroll new members--i.e., do the work of trustees. If the laymen would have respect for the rabbis, the rabbis would not receive starvation wages--and if they would not receive starvation wages, they would not have to make any "funeral orations" or seek Hechshors [to supervise Kosher food] nor would they have to do some other work which I shall not mention at this time.</p>
   <p>If the rabbis would have respect for themselves, for the educated laymen and for the younger generation, they would learn English and would, if need be, speak in English. Then the youth would understand them and they would understand the youth, and the question of two rabbis for one synagogue--one for the old and one for the young--would never arise.</p>
   <p>If the rabbis would have respect for themselves and for the laymen, they <pb facs="5423972_5_1294.jpg" n="4"/>would adhere to the principle: You should keep your camp holy, and they would clean house. A few dubious characters would lose their jobs--so who cares? Where does it say that rabbinism is a profession for people who should not and must not be rabbis? If the rabbis would have respect for themselves, they would speak well of each other--and the rabbis of Chicago would form a mutual admiration society. Today it is just the opposite.</p>
   <p>If the synagogue presidents or leaders of the community would have respect for themselves as well as for the public at large, they would distinguish between Jewish time and central time, and only adhere to the latter. When a meeting is called for eight o'clock central time, everybody should come at eight o'clock central time and not at eight o'clock Jewish time, which is actually ten o'clock central time. The meetings would then be punctual and productive. No one would hold speeches and the agenda would be covered in forty-five minutes.</p>
   <p>If the butchers would have respect for themselves and for their customers, <pb facs="5423972_5_1295.jpg" n="5"/>they would not sell Trefe (unkosher) for kosher meat, and if the customers would have respect for themselves they would not buy any Trefe bargains from Trefe butchers--and the butcher would be forced to be either a Kosher butcher or become a watchman.</p>
   <p>If parents would have respect for their own parents and for their children, they would bring up their children in a Jewish atmosphere--they would hand down the spiritual and moral heritage to their children and the Jewish spirit would prevail in the Jewish homes of Chicago. If the children would have respect for their parents, the girls would not go into the painting business and the boys would not hang out in the pool rooms and would not run amuck after good times.</p>
   <p>If our theater managers would have respect for the Jewish theater and for themselves they would not feature any trashy plays and would not always appeal to the tear-wells of old women, but they would feature artistic and masterly plays. If the Jewish public would have more respect for the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_5_1296.jpg" n="6"/>theater, they would patronize the theater more frequently and thereby compel the management to put on good plays.</p>
   <p>If the Chicago Jews would have respect for Palestine and for the Jewish people, we would not have to have all that clamor about the Keren Hayesod (exchequer of World Zionist Organization) Drive and the Keren Hayesod leaders would not have to spend all their time in collecting the Keren Hayesod pledges. If the Chicago Jews would know how disgraceful it is to Palestine and to the Chalutzim (pioneers in Palestine) in making drives with so much hullabaloo, there would be no drives and more money would be raised without them.</p>
   <p>If the synagogue presidents would know how ugly it is to have an organization that does nothing, they would act differently and today there would have been a communal office with a secretariat and the Chicago Jewish Orthodoxy would now be organized.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1297.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>In short, the Jewish community lacks a bit of respect, and respect can be learnt. It is therefore necessary to establish a College of Respect. There are enough qualified men in Chicago for the office of president of such an institution. If my good friend, Mr. Mathew, will not accept the job, H.G. Steinberg is a suitable candidate. If not Steinberg, there are many other candidates. The main thing is to build the institution--a large College of Respect--and then the salvation will come for the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
