  <body>
   <p>To the list of local Jewish welfare workers was added a new and prominent member in the person of Solomon Goldberg, an inventor of hairpins. Mr. A. L. Stone, chairman of the membership committee, introduced the new welfare worker at a meeting [of the council] of the Hebrew Institute, where methods of raising money to cover the deficit were discussed.</p>
   <p>After listening to brief talks by the President Jacob Loeb, Attorney Lipson, Morris Rosenwald and others, Mr. Goldberg surprised those present by his first move as a Jewish welfare worker. He announced that he would join the institute and would pay $500.00 annual dues for himself, and $250.00 for each of his two sisters. This however was not the most surprising event of the evening. Later he declared that he would pay ten years dues in advance, and promised to underwrite one third of the Institute's annual deficit.</p>
   <p>Those present greeted the member warmly. Many of the old members pledged additional dues in order to cover the Institute's deficit.</p>
