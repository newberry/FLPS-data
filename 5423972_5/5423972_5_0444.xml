   <p>Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>A People's Stage Needed.</p>
   <p>Experience has demonstrated conclusively that the people seek spontaneously, to express themselves, their ideals and aspirations in dramatic form. The Institute encourages all such expression and hopes to establish a dramatic center where the study and production of the best in the drama will be encouraged.</p>
   <p>A dramatic club with dramatic study classes has been formed and an effort is to be made to gather around this a clientele of sincere lovers of the best in dramatic art. The stage needs elevating and this organization will, in time, spread the leaven that will affect the entire community and make it worth-while for actors and managers to present the best things possible for this enlightened body of patrons of the theater. Opera as well as drama will find a place on the people's stage. The production of good music and classic opera, <pb facs="5423972_5_0445.jpg" n="2"/>at such rates as will attract people of moderate means and at the same time, furnish an opportunity for those interested in music to study and produce music, will be the work of a division of the Players Club, which will devote itself exclusively to the object of providing a musical education for the people, by the people themselves.</p>
