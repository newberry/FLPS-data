   <p>In a desire to accomplish an act, serving a useful purpose in memory of her husband, Mr. Emma Schur, of Chicago, announced her generous contribution in connection with the contemplated construction of the Institute in the Lawn-Dale District, in the form of the installation of a specialized library on Judaica, the social sciences, and general reference library. Seventeen-thousand dollars have been contributed for the purpose. The library is to be known as the Herman Schur Reference Library.</p>
   <p>The donor, in transmitting the gift, expressed the hope that the usefulness of the library will be demonstrated and that on future occasions, as they may arise, she may be given an opportunity to consider further contributions for this purpose in case they become necessary. When the announcement was made at the meeting of the Board of Directors last Thursday evening, the enthuasiasm was so great on the part of the members of the Board, that an additional $2,000 was contributed towards the library: $1,000 by our President, Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, and another $1,000 by Mr. John Wineberg.</p>
