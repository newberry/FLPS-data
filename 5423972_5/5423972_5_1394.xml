   <p>Thanks are due to Mr. Salk, the president of the Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel for his plan to help the Hebrew Theological College, and at the same time not hinder the work of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. Mr. Salk's plan is that the synagogues should come to the aid of the Hebrew Theological College as a body. Mr. Salk has already won the support of the presidents of almost all of the big synagogues on the West Side. I hope that the presidents of the synagogues in other parts [of the city] will also support his plan. Then each synagogue will contribute directly, from its treasury, from two hundred to a thousand dollars to the Hebrew Theological College, so that the institution can be built. If each Chicago synagogue does its duty and brings to the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone, which will take place next Sunday, a check of from two hundred to a thousand dollars, then the construction work will be continued. Then my friends Mr. Ben Zion Leizerowich, the president of the institution, <pb facs="5423972_5_1395.jpg" n="2"/>and Mr. Eisenstein, the treasurer, will stop annoying me. The essential thing is that the construction work should not be interrupted.</p>
   <p>I hear that Abe Kaplan, president of the Moteler Synagogue is getting ready, and that he will come to the cornerstone ceremony with a check for two hundred dollars. If a small synagogue like the Moteler can give two hundred dollars for the Hebrew Theological College, how much should the big synagogue give? You tell us, gentlemen, you presidents of synagogues.</p>
