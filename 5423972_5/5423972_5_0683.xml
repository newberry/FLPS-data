   <p>sullen and disillusioned, until at last he took the Bible and found the passage "Eli, Eli, Lomo Azavtoni?" (Oh, God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!)</p>
   <p>From these beautiful words Mr. Sandler created his world-famous song.</p>
   <p>The first to sing it was Mrs. Karp, who had a great success. The song, published without the authors's name passed from mouth to mouth and became popular among both Jews and non-Jews as a folk song.</p>
   <p>Years later "Eli, Eli" became popular in the music world, and strange as it seems, Mr. Sandler, the author, was unaware of this fact.</p>
   <p>He retired from the music world entirely to live with his family in the Bronx, where he established himself as a clothing salesman, and only during the High Holidays he used to conduct choirs in the synagogues. As the years passed by, he was totally forgotten as a Jewish song-writer.</p>
   <p>One evening his daughter, coming home from an operatic concert in the Metropolitan Theatre, related to her father how Sophie Braslow had delighted <pb facs="5423972_5_0685.jpg" n="3"/>her audience by singing the beautiful "Eli, Eli."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sandler although realizing the <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>tness of his song saw that it was rather too late to have it <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>When several days later, Mr. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, popular Jewish playwright, met Mr. Sandler in the street, he almost <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ded the latter for not taking legal action for the rights of his song. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>he <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> explained that song music publishers clai<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> it to be a <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, and that they <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>any changes in it that it is <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to recognize the original "Eli, Eli." Mr. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>omer and the children and friends of the author insisted <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> that the modest Mr. Sandler was <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> the incident public. Finally he agreed to publish the story of "Eli, Eli" in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sandler is almost sixty years old old his <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> was great when he learned that his beloved song had been <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. The original "Eli, Eli," is very rhythmical and harmo<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>us.</p>
   <p>It is about time that <gap unit="chars" extent="2" reason="illegible"/>ny musicians and music lovers who appreciate this remarkable co<gap unit="chars" extent="2" reason="illegible"/>sition mention and honor this humble and sincere musician's name.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0686.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Jacob Koppel Sandler, although a clothing salesman and off-time choir leader during the holidays, deserves recognition as the author of this immortal song.</p>
