   <p>Hebraists and all those who are interested in keeping the flame of Judaism from being extinguished in our young generation are expected to come to Temple Judeah, Independence Boulevard, Tuesday evening. The Marshall Hebrew Club will present a Hebrew play entitled "Doctor Chiruk".</p>
   <p>What is the Marshall Hebrew Club? It is a student organization of the Hebrew classes in John Marshall High School, and is under the supervision of the competent Hebrew teacher, S. Seligman, the author of the play. The Hebrew classes in the John Marshall High School were inaugurated at the request of Harry M. Lipsky, when he was a member of the Board of Education. Thanks to Mr. Lipsky, such classes were also opened in the Medill High School.</p>
   <p>Our purpose in writing this is to induce you to attend this Hebrew performance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0421.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>By doing so you will not only encourage the boys and girls to continue their study of Hebrew, which will inspire them when they become older to accomplish something for Judaism, but you will also show the community to what extent you support the extra funds with which the Hebrew classes are taxed.</p>
   <p>That the boys and girls who attend the Hebrew classes in John Marshall High School are marching on the road to Judaism can be seen by the generous donations that they are giving for Jewish national undertakings and for local charity. They have contributed quite a sum to the Hebrew Hayesod (exchequer of the World Zionist Organization) and to Moes Chitim (fund to provide the poor with food on Passover). They also stand on guard to protect, as well as elevate, the Jewish honor. In these classes, they attend lectures on Jewish history and religion. This season's lectures were given by Rabbi Almond, Rabbi Fram, Rabbi Cohen, Rabbi Daskal and Mr. Lipsky.</p>
   <p>Samuel Skolnik, Harry Herkik, Anna Wolak, Dorothy Frankel, Alvin Berman, Janet <pb facs="5423972_5_0422.jpg" n="3"/>Goodman, Ben Brodsky, and John Albert will participate in the play. Let us give them a hearty welcome at their premiere. Thus we shall promote love and respect for Judaism in our generation.</p>
