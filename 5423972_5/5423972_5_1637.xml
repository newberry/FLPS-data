   <p>Dear Editor of the Courier: In regard to the recent letter [addressed to the Voice of the People] by Mr. N.S. Fineberg, in which the writer criticizes Mr. S.B. Maximan's program [on Jewish education], I confess that I am somewhat bewildered. Mr. Fineberg argues that Mr. Maximan goes too far in wanting to eject the poor, antiquated methods of Jewish education and introduce immediately a new and sound system. Fineberg argues that a change in the educational system must be brought about gradually, and that we must continue to teach beginning school-children [Yiddish translations of] such stories as "Puss in Boots" and "Cinderella". I scarcely need to point out to Mr. Fineberg the fact that we have, in our own Yiddish literature, excellent stories for children, and that we need not lead children to believe that we must resort to non-Jewish literature. Besides, the time available for Jewish studies is so inadequate that we should limit Jewish stories to biographies of great Jewish men, historical episodes of Jewish interest, etc., which are a far cry from such primers as "Puss in Boots" or "Cinderella". In <pb facs="5423972_5_1638.jpg" n="2"/>his article [of August 10, entitled "For the Improvement of Jewish Education"] Mr. Jonah Spivak does not even make mention of this material as being suggested by Mr. Maximan in the latter's suggestion of a change in the methods of Jewish education. Mr. Spivak merely conveys Mr. Maximan's program, which calls for unity among all institutions of learning, the establishment of a school for training teachers, the founding of a parent educational organization, kindergartens, and libraries.</p>
   <p>I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Maximan. I have heard Drs. A.B. Yudelson and A. Levinson refer to him as a very intelligent young man and a capable pedagogue. But when I read Mr. Spivak's article I could see clearly that Mr. Maximan understands very well the weakness of our system of education, and that he does not want to cover this weakness with a salve so that it may dry the surface and fester underneath--he wants to strike at the cause of the disease.</p>
   <p>A famous educator, upon being asked when a child should start school, answered, <pb facs="5423972_5_1639.jpg" n="3"/>"Several years before his mother is born." This remark coincides with Mr. Maximan's contention that, if our educational system is to show improvement, the first ones to be educated must be the parents and the teachers.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Yitzchok ben Izzak</p>
