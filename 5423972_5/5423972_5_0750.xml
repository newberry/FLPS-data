   <p>Dear Editor of the Jewish Courier:</p>
   <p>The necessity of a Jewish center in Chicago, where different Jewish groups are able to get together and express their views on various topics, freely, and at the same time feel that they are in a Jewish, national atmosphere, has been solved by the opening of the Hebrew Institute. This center has been recognized by all right-thinking Jews as a necessary function in the Jewish community here. But here, with the assistance of your paper, I wish to draw the attention of the officers of the Chicago Hebrew Institute to an absolutely necessary department which ought to be added soon to the institution, and that is a Jewish library. It should be a collection of various books, magazines, and newspapers, which should satisfy the mutual and spiritual needs of the Jewish masses and of which they have been sadly lacking.</p>
   <p>Good Jewish literature cannot be obtained in every place. I have been a frequent visitor to the Hebrew Institute; I have walked around the building, but no sign of a library is to be found there. However, you will find <pb facs="5423972_5_0751.jpg" n="2"/>there some unnecessary clubs and dance halls where boys and girls get together and have a good time.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>B. Katzen - 480 Morgan street.</p>
   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I read the article of Rabbi Holtzman of Brooklyn, N. Y., about the education of Jewish children, and I think that the rabbi's plan is alright. But how many times have already been written, and plans formulated, about the pitiful neglect in giving the young generation a Jewish education? Look at the Gentiles! How they take care of matters concerning the spirit, and the religious education of their children! They see to it that their religion should be strengthened, while in our midst it is getting weaker and weaker. It is appalling to think of how many thousands of grown-ups as well as small children had or have no Jewish education at all, and Judaism is entirely strange to them. Many of them even go so far as to ridicule and to laugh at anything dealing with Judaism. They laugh at it because they <pb facs="5423972_5_0752.jpg" n="3"/>don't know anything dealing with Judaism. They have not learned about our history, our religion, and about our language. Our Jewish elders, parents of children, are contributing money to the building of more synagogues, but for whom are they building them? Only the older ones go there to worship and to meet friends, but no young people can be seen there. Why don't we try to build something for them?</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is also a Jewish training school, and as such it should have been the first to open such classes where a Jewish education should particularly be given. Good and competent Jewish teachers who understand and are well versed in the English and Hebrew languages, and who have a thorough knowledge in Jewish history from its inception to the present time, should be intrusted with the education of Jewish youth. They are the ones who chould be capable of instilling enthusiasm and love to the Jewish people and Judaism. Zionist clubs for children would not help anything. Only daily classes where a national spirit will be present at all times, and where the customs and mores of the Jewish people can be taught, will alleviate the trouble.</p>
