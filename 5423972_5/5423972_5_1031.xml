   <p>I have before me the first issue of the Hebrew magazine Barkai (Morning Star), a four-page pamphlet, ordinary size, printed in Chicago. There is a "Declaration of Policy" on the front page, which "Declaration" says: "If we will it, there can be a daily Hebrew newspaper in Chicago". I look at the barometer (sic) and see that it is only eighty-five, so that it is not the heat of the sun that has affected my mind. A daily Hebrew newspaper in Chicago where there are about three and one-half dozen Hebraists--I wonder how the Jews can be so innocent and impractical!</p>
   <p>In the magazine there is a translation of the proclamation issued by the Zionist leaders of Chicago, which was published a few days ago in the Courier. The Hebrew translation was done in the office of the Barkai. The translator is perhaps a very fine man, but he does not know Hebrew. The term "League of Nations" is incorrectly translated. The sentence "open the gates of Palestine" is incorrectly <pb facs="5423972_5_1032.jpg" n="2"/>translated. In general, the translation was very poorly done. The translator deserves, for this translation, nine thousand blows, but the author of the article "Theodore Herzl" deserves not nine but sixty thousand blows because, while it is bad to talk nonsense in Yiddish, it is still worse to talk nonsense in Hebrew.</p>
   <p>To sum up: if one cannot, if one does not understand and does not know, one should not undertake, or else one is a fool from the land of fools.</p>
