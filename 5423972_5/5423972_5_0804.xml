   <p>Leon Zolotkoff, who was among the first Yiddish journalists in America, is also widely regarded as one of its most eminent ones. Out of the forty-three years which he has spent in this land, he has given at least forty to Chicago. The Courier was not the only medium through which he emitted the brilliant sparks of his intellect. He was responsible for bringing many other Yiddish dailies and weeklies into being: The Yiddish Tageblatt, Die Yiddishe Gazetten vun die West, Der Yiddisher Call, and the Jewish Record. Of all these publications, Zolotkoff was the first editor. Throughout his journalistic career he pursued the same policy which is characterized by a strong devotion to Jewish nationalism, a tendency to guide his readers towards the higher and finer aspects of life, and a tone of dignity and distinction. If we are to accept the American standard of journalism, Zolotkoff might not be called a journalist. His style is too fine and delicate, his imagination too strong, his humor too subtle, his metaphors are too nicely colored, there is too much flourish to his sentences, the whole is too finely polished, in short it is much too literary to be determined journalism. If I were to make comparisons, I can think of no other stylist than Lord Macaulay, with whom to liken Zolotkoff, the only difference being that the latter perhaps gives less attention to polish and is not <pb facs="5423972_5_0805.jpg" n="2"/>quite as perfect as the Englishman. Besides, Zolotkoff is less the artist and more the idealist. He is no space-filler, he writes only when he has something of importance to say, with the result that he produces a composition whose meaning is unmistakably definite, complete, and incisive.</p>
