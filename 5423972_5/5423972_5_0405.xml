<title level="a">JEWISH INSTITUTE PLAYERS WIN ROCKEFELIER McCOFMICK SILVER CUP IN THE DRAMA LEACUE TOURNAMENT</title></bibl>

   <p>The high spot of the week in Chicago, particularly in the history of the Institute Players of the Jewish People's Institute, was the winning of first honors in the Drama League Tournament held at the Goodman Theater last Sunday night.</p>
   <p>The presentation of "The Dollar" by David Pinski was awarded the highest single honor of the Tournament for its brilliant staging and presentation. The Silver Cup that has always been awarded annually, was never won twice by any organization. It was a happy company and director that brought, after a stirring competition, the cup back again to the Jewish People's Institute.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0406.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The contest was participated in by Greater Chicago organizations. This included suburban companies. Sixteen Little Theaters competed and represented independent and college groups. The method of procedure was the selection of the four best productions for a final showing. In the final showing the selection of one from the four was made in behalf of the Institute.</p>
   <p>Last year the Institute Players won the cup with "The Tenth Man". This triumph comes at the height of the Institute Players most successful, artistic season.</p>
   <p>The settings were designed by Clive Rickabaugh. In the cast were Rose Scapp, Molly Kramer, Clarice Weiner, Charles Swadesh, Herman Brodsky, Eli Page, Ralph Schoolman, Louis Gitloz, Sam Addams and Ralph Silverstein. Besides winning the trophy, the Institute Players were awarded honorable mention for the best diction.</p>
