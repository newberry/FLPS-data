   <p>Upon today's conference, to be held at the Palmer House by many prominent citizens--a conference that has been called by well-known public workers--depends the future of the only intellectual institution which the Jews of Chicago have created, the Jewish Theological College. The Reform Jews have not done anything in the field of intellectual life of the Jewry of Chicago. Their activity [has been] and is even now limited to philanthropy. That the Orthodox Jews have built such an institution as the Jewish Theological College is a sign of awakening. The future of such an institution depends upon its foundation. If it is put at the very beginning upon a solid financial foundation, then it can and it will develop into a great institution. If its financial foundation is not a healthy one, it will never become what it should become, because it will share the fate of art--it will beg, it will always be in financial difficulties, and it will never <pb facs="5423972_5_1212.jpg" n="2"/>permit its leaders to get rid of material worries. We do not have too many public workers in Chicago. If the small group of Jews which is interested in the Jewish Theological College and which devotes itself to its problems should always have material worries, then this group will soon either get tired and withdraw from work or it will become so absorbed in financial matters that it will not have the time and opportunity to devote itself to the spiritual problems of the institution. It is self-evident that everything must be done not to let such a situation arise.</p>
   <p>This institution is now entering the third year of its existence. During the first two years it was something new to Chicago. The Jews reacted to it as toward a novelty, but now it ceases to be a novelty. The jubilation is over and now everyday life begins. The moneys which were raised for the institution during the first two years of its existence cannot be raised during the third year. We must cease to depend upon miracles and good luck. The institution must have a steady and regular income to be free from material worries. This is possible if there could be found in <pb facs="5423972_5_1213.jpg" n="3"/>Chicago a thousand Jews, each willing to make a yearly contribution of twenty-five dollars to the institution. The existence of the institution could be assured with these twenty-five thousand dollars and other income that it has.</p>
   <p>We hope that most of the Jews who have received the invitation to come to today's conference at the Palmer House will accept the invitation. They are not being asked for money; their advice to and good will toward the institution is wanted. We want them to help solve the financial problems of the institution now, so as not to have worries tomorrow. An institution like the Jewish Theological College, having an annual budget of eighty thousand dollars, must not find itself in financial difficulties if it is to be as effective as it should be. If it will be put today upon a solid foundation, it will grow to an unexpected, undreamed-of degree. It will be the only Torah institution in the world free from any material worries. Come today to the conference and do your duty to the Torah and Jewish studies in Chicago!</p>
