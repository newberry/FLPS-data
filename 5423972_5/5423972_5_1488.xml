   <p>A Chicago layman, a learned, intelligent and highly respected Jew, writes the following: "Your struggle in behalf of the public control of public institutions, and against fake institutions that cost the community many thousands of dollars every year, will be effective only when you outline briefly your demands, which are the demands of the public. In the long drawn-out dispute, the reader forgets the essence of the argument. Formulate your demands in such a way that every Jew in Chicago will understand the issue involved."</p>
   <p>I shall gladly fulfill the wish of my correspondent. The whole controversy can be expressed in a few words: give an accounting!</p>
   <p>In the name of those who contribute money and who have given money to <pb facs="5423972_5_1489.jpg" n="2"/>Rabbi [Ephraim] Epstein for the Slobodka Yeshivah [theological seminary in Lithuania], for his Hebrew Theological College [referring to the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago] and for other purposes, which I shall mention another time, I demand that an accounting be submitted to the public. His empty, naive sermons from the pulpit, harmful and cheap intrigue will not help him at all. He can neither distort nor obscure the real issue.</p>
   <p>Although the Slobodka Yeshivah went out of existence five years ago, Epstein and his assistants and agents have continued to collect money for that institution. The public wants to know what became of the money which was collected all over town, especially from naive old women.</p>
   <p>For years Rabbi Epstein has collected money, right and left, for his Hebrew Theological College. I can prove that checks made out to the Hebrew Theological College have been deposited in the bank in Epstein's personal account, and I also know that he paid the teachers of the Hebrew Theological College out of <pb facs="5423972_5_1490.jpg" n="3"/>his personal account. At any rate, the Hebrew Theological College did not have its own bank account as long as Epstein was the sole administrator. I know that Rabbi Epstein is a very poor bookkeeper and mathematician. The public, however, wants to know how much money he collected for the Hebrew Theological College, from whom, for whom, how he spent the money, etc.</p>
   <p>I have not hitherto posed the question so bluntly because a committee of twenty, headed by Mr. James Davis, undertook to investigate the Hebrew Theological College. When Epstein was invited to appear before the committee, he declared that he would not permit an investigation. He was kind enough to say that Mr. Davis could visit the College, and see how the boys were studying, but that he would permit no investigation into what was what. The committee of twenty, however, had only one purpose: to investigate and find out what was going on. The members of the committee have accepted their appointments with the understanding that they would be able to find out the truth.</p>
   <p>Why does Rabbi Epstein refuse to permit an investigation? Has he something to <pb facs="5423972_5_1491.jpg" n="4"/>hide? Why does every other institution in Chicago say to the public: "The books are open for inspection"? Why does Epstein refuse to allow the truth to come out? People who have nothing to hide, do not fear the truth. Institutions that conduct their business legitimately, have nothing to fear from an investigation, especially, when rumors begin to circulate.</p>
   <p>In the United States Congress, an investigating committee is immediately organized as soon as rumors begin to circulate about this or that governmental department. The American government has never restrained Congress from making an investigation. Why, then, does Ephraim Epstein fear an investigation? What sort of a trick has he done that he fears the truth?</p>
   <p>I know why Ephraim Epstein fears an investigation at the hands of representatives of the community. I know why he despises truth, and I will certainly tell my readers the facts. The day is still long; eventually Congregation Anshe Kneseth <pb facs="5423972_5_1492.jpg" n="5"/>Israel will find out what kind of a rabbi it has, and the city of Chicago will discover the type of "righteous" Jew it has nurtured.</p>
