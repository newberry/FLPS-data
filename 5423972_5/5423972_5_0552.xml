   <p>p. 8 - The dedication of the synagogue to be erected by the Tipheret Zion Congregation at 588 N. Lincoln Street, took place yesterday.</p>
   <p>The first Jewish speaker on this occasion was Rabbi Brody. He said: "It is the Lord's will that priests serve as teachers of the people. Nations are supposed to supplement these teachers, but fail at times to perform their duty.

   <p>Rabbi Brody appealed to his fellow-believers, wealthy or poor, or whatever their nationality might be, to have one object in mind, namely, unity.</p>

   <p>The third speaker was Judge Gibbons. He said in English: "The history of the Jews reveals that theirs was a mighty contribution to the world's civilization in those dark days of 2,000 years ago." He pointed to the close contact in everyday life, between the Jews and the Christians. To become good Christians is then only possible, when the lofty ideas of Judaism are accepted. Cooperation between Jews and Christians is of vital importance....</p>
