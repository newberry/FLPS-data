   <p>The Players Club. by Lester Alden.</p>
   <p>The Players Club was organized October 1, 1910, with the purpose in view of instituting a dramatic department in connection with the activities of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, conducted under the direction of a professional and experienced director.</p>
   <p>The new season (the seventh) opened September 6, with a most encouraging enrollment of students. These young people are so imbued with the spirit of enthusiasm and love for the study of drama, that their interest becomes identical with that of the head of the department, whose aim is to establish a standard in this brand of art unequalled at any institution of the nature of the Chicago Hebrew Institute. Its results speak for themselves when, on the second Sunday of every month (excepting Summer), performances are given on the stage of the Institute, which, for completeness of detail in diction, enunciation, expression and acting are excelled only on the professional stage.</p>
