<title level="a">RABBIS AND PROMINENT CITIZENS MEET AGAIN TO DISCUSS RABBI GORDON'S DECISION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The first effect of the decision rendered by Rabbi Gordon on Friday regarding the Talmud Torahs and the United Jewish Charities, was felt on Saturday night at a meeting of the rabbis' Educational Council, at which Rabbi Gordon was present. The meeting decided, after a long and heated debate, to abide by the decision, but, at the same time, to persuade the Charities to recognize the Educational Council, of which Rabbi Ephraim Epstein is the chairman, and to put Dr. [Alexander] Dushkin under the jurisdiction of the Educational Council. A committee headed by Mr. Gray, appeared yesterday afternoon at the Courier for consultation regarding the new situation. Later members of the committee of five, which was elected last Tuesday at the conference, some prominent citizens who were present at the conference, Judge [Harry] Fisher and Mr. B. Horwich, also came in.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1231.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There was a long and stormy debate in which nearly all those present participated. Mr. Sam Ginsburg, president of the Association of Synagogues, proposed that a committee of three should attend tomorrow's meeting of the rabbinical council and persuade it to postpone the enforcement of Rabbi Gordon's decision until it becomes clear that the Charities do not want and do not intend to interfere in [Jewish] education. A group of prominent citizens will attend today's meeting of the rabbinical council.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sam Ginsburg had a long discussion yesterday afternoon with Rabbi Gordon about the whole affair. It seems that Rabbi Gordon was misinformed. He did not know that the Charities do not and must not interfere in purely educational matters.</p>
   <p>The following letter, dated February twentieth, 1924, written by Mr. James Davis, chairman of the Committee on Education of the Charities to Mr. B. <pb facs="5423972_5_1232.jpg" n="3"/>Leizerowich, president of the Montefiore Talmud Torah, shows the present policy of the charities in regard to Jewish education.</p>
   <p>"Mr. B. Lazar, president,</p>
   <p>"Moses Montefiore Hebrew Schools.</p>
   <p>"My dear Mr. Lazar: At a meeting which took place in our office on Wednesday, February twentieth, at which representatives of our committee and of your board of directors were present, agreed upon the following points:</p>
   <p>"The Charities' Committee on Education will continue to grant the Moses Montefiore Schools the monthly subsidy of one thousand three hundred thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents. The Committee will also assign a special sum of money to cover the deficit of your schools for the months of January, February, March, and April, 1924, on the following conditions:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1233.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"1. The Washburne Avenue Talmud Torah is to be closed entirely until the end of this semester and its students transferred either to the Miller Street or the Winchester Avenue Talmud Torah. The present premises of the Washburne Avenue Talmud Torah are absolutely unfit for school purposes.</p>
   <p>"2. The monthly salary of the principal, Rabbi J. Greenberg, is to be suspended until the end of this semester, unless Rabbi Greenberg can and will devote his time and attention to the management of your schools.</p>
   <p>"3. The Committee on Education is to have the right to supervise the finances of your school, both the income and the expenses. It will not be necessary for the students themselves to bring their tuition to the school. Instead we will organize 'school visitors', who will not only collect the tuition, but will also investigate the causes of the child's absence from school, and report to the parents about the child's work at school. The <pb facs="5423972_5_1234.jpg" n="5"/>Committee will be in a position to begin this work not later than March first, so that in the new semester, the work will proceed smoothly. The Committee has guaranteed, in order to be sure that the schools do not suffer any loss of tuition, that the amount of tuition for your school will be no less than it was perviously.</p>
   <p>"4. During the period between the Feast of Esther and Passover, the Committee is to begin an intensive campaign to increase the enrollment in your schools. The teachers and directors of your schools are urged to help us in this work for the public good.</p>
   <p>"5. The board of directors of your schools is to be responsible for the management of your schools as it was in the past, but no changes in the budget of the schools are to be made without the consent of the Committee. A monthly report on the income and expenses of your schools should be <pb facs="5423972_5_1235.jpg" n="6"/>presented to the Committee.</p>
   <p>"6. Your board is to have the right to appoint teachers as it does at present, but all new appointments of teachers and other members must be approved by the Committee in order to insure the appointment of the best and most capable teachers for the Jewish education of your children.</p>
   <p>"7. Your board is to decide upon the matters of curriculum, method of teaching, and the spirit of the school. Your board is to be the supreme authority in these fields. The duty of the director of the Committee on Education--whose office can be compared to that of a superintendent of schools--will be to visit your schools and classes, and, together with the teachers and board members, he will consider the problems relating to your school management and teaching methods.</p>
   <p>"8. Your school janitors, in order to make sure that your schools are kept <pb facs="5423972_5_1236.jpg" n="7"/>clean and that the strictest sanitary precautions are observed, are to be responsible to a 'chief janitor' whom the Committee will appoint. We agree to cover all costs which you will have in remodeling or repairing the schools in order to keep them clean and sanitary.</p>
   <p>"In signing this agreement, our intentions have been honest. We were sure that the few minor demands which we presented to you were for the good of your schools and their pupils, but when we tried to carry out the accepted decisions, particularly the one relating to tuition, we found that you put great and unnecessary obstacles in our path. When we called your attention to those unnecessary and useless obstacles, you told us that you had consulted with the rabbis and had resolved to postpone the execution of the plan we had agreed upon.</p>
   <p>"We, therefore, inform you that if by March first, we cannot begin our work <pb facs="5423972_5_1237.jpg" n="8"/>for your schools, collect tuition, visit the homes of the students, as we agreed to do, and if you continue to put obstacles in our way and do not let us execute the various clauses of our agreement, we will understand that you want the Jewish Charities to withdraw their support from your schools.</p>
   <p>"Sincerely,</p>
   <p>"Committee on Education of United Jewish Charities,</p>
   <p>"(signed): Alexander M. Dushkin, director,</p>
   <p>"(approved): James Davis, chairman."</p>
