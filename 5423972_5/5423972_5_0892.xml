   <p>Chicago has seven Jewish newspapers, beside those coming from New York. We have made this discovery by observing the N. W. Ayer and Sons, "American Newspaper Annual and Directory." This is one, of the many directories published in America. The method by which these directories are compiled, is the following: When they receive a name from any newspaper, they write to the Newspaper Company requesting them to send an affidavit of their circulation and other information.</p>
   <p>These directories do not merely rely upon the affidavits, but want to know whether it is a statement of the publisher or an A. B. C. (Audit Bureau of Circulation) statement. They clarify, in their explanations, that only the A. B. C. statements are certain and the other statements from the Post Office, etc., are worthless.</p>
   <p>We find in the last American Newspaper Directory that Chicago publishes six Jewish newspapers, with the exception of the Forward, and those of New York, and <pb facs="5423972_5_0893.jpg" n="2"/>here we submit them and their "circulation" as they appear in the directory: Jewish Call (daily) Independent - 19,000, Jewish Courier (daily) Independent - 42,040, Jewish Press (daily) Ind. Republican - 23,000, Jewish Progress (daily) Independent - 14,000, Jewish Record, Independent - 28,000, Jewish Tenies, Independent - 17,000.</p>
   <p>The Jewry of Chicago know that half of these newspapers are not in existence, and that the second half does not have the circulation they assert, but some inexperienced gentile advertisers are unaware of this, and they therefore patronize these newspapers. They print a half dozen copies, on the day they receive an advertisement, forward one copy to the advertiser and the others are kept in reserve, in case an advertiser requests another copy. The news and articles of these newspapers are always the same; therefore, they have no expenses and as much as they receive is a total profit.</p>
   <p>The Forward circulation statement is approved by the A. B. C. Why does not the <pb facs="5423972_5_0894.jpg" n="3"/>"Courier" belong to the A. B. C.? The answer is clear: Exact figures must be submitted to the A. B. C.</p>
   <p>The Forward repeats its challenge, and is willing to deposit $1,000 in any bank, that the Forward sells twice as many copies in Chicago than the "Courier" and all other newspapers (Jewish) put together.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Daily Forward is the only Jewish Newspaper in Chicago that is a member of the A. B. C.</p>
