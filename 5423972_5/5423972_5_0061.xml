   <p>Maurice Schwartz, director and actor of the Art Theatre of New York, made a big hit in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In spite of bad conditions, the Art Troupe performed to crowded houses.</p>
   <p>The financial success was equally as great as the moral one.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schwartz played here Scholom Ash's beautiful drama, "Uncle Moses," "The Man with the Portfolio," "Bloody Laughter," and Leon Cobrin's "Riverside Drive," a very impressive drama of Jewish Life in America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schwartz and his troupe were received with great enthusiasm by Chicago Jewish theater lovers. It shows that art lovers were very thirsty for better <pb facs="5423972_5_0062.jpg" n="2"/>plays and better acting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schwartz and his company were very pleased with the hearty ovations and applause received from the Chicago public.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Schwartz's departure from Chicago, the famous Jewish comedienne, Molli Picon, and her company will be the guest artists for only five performances.</p>
