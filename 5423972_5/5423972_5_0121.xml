   <p>There was a time in Chicago when no one dreamed of one respectable Yiddish Theatre, let alone two. The first will be, as usual, Glickman's "Palace" and the second will be the "Imperial" Theatre, located at Madison St. and Western Avenue.</p>
   <p>The "Imperial" Theatre has been rented by Joseph Kissler and the Comedian, Bernard Bernstein. The contract was signed last Wednesday.</p>
   <p>For the main Engineer for the new theatre, negotiations are going on with Jacob Polis. If he will agree, he will become General Manager of the theatre, the main figure in the lobby, and the boss of the box-office.</p>
   <p>And now but one question remains: What actors will compose the companies of both the "Palace" and "Imperial" theatres.</p>
   <p>The duel to secure the best actors and actresses will occur between Glickman &amp; Bernstein on the New York battlefield. Naturally, the one with <pb facs="5423972_5_0122.jpg" n="2"/>the best weapons and the most ammunition, will win the fight.</p>
   <p>Mr. Glickman has announced that already he has signed the Comedian, Isador Meltzer, Becky Frank, and Mr. and Mrs. Teitlebaum of the Vilna Troupe.</p>
