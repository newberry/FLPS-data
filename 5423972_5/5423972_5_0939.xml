   <p>A luncheon was given yesterday afternoon in the La Salle Hotel in honor of Mr. Louis N. Hammerling, president of the Foreign-Language Newspaper Association of America. Publishers and editors of the foreign-language newspapers in Chicago, and Americans prominent in various fields, over a hundred in number, attended the luncheon. The luncheon was given on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Association. Mr. Hammerling has been at the head of the organization since it was founded.</p>
   <p>The speakers at the luncheon were: Mr. Merrick, of the National Security League; United States District Attorney Klein; Mr. Schtreckman, of the Liberty Loan Committee of the Seventh Federal Reserve District; Mr. Gerringer and Mr. Palandeck. They all praised Mr. Hammerling for his brilliant leadership of the Association and for his patriotism as well as the patriotism shown by the foreign-language newspapers of America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0940.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The last speaker was Mr. Hammerling himself. He thanked those present for the friendship and support which they had given him. And with his usual enthusiasm and candor, he assured them that in the future as in the past, he would fulfill his obligations as an American patriot and conscientious businessman.</p>
   <p>The publishers and editors present also passed a resolution expressing their loyalty to America and assuring President Wilson that they would support him in every undertaking to help win the war against militarism and autocracy.</p>
   <p>The resolution was drawn up by the committee which arranged the luncheon. John F. Smulski, Harry A. Lipsky, V. Gerringer, Hector Durande, Peter Lambroz, Alexander Johnson, John R. Palandeck, and Reverend Francis Gordon were members of the committee.</p>
   <p>The luncheon in Chicago is one of a series of luncheons that is being given in honor of Mr. Hammerling in several large American cities. Being a national <pb facs="5423972_5_0941.jpg" n="3"/>figure in this country, he has met many people, outside of the publishing field, such as prominent American businessmen and high public officials who know him because in the newspaper world of this country, he has done such fine work for the foreigners.</p>
