   <p>Mr. H. L. Meites informs me officially, semiofficially, and unofficially that he has left for New York and Washington to gather material for his book on the history of the Jews in Chicago. I have explained to Mr. Meites that history is a description of life in the past, and since the Jews of Chicago have no past in this city--neither their parents nor their grandparents lived here--there cannot be any talk of a history of the Jews in Chicago, but rather of a Chicago-Jewish record, notes, chronicle--call it what you will. Maybe this is what Mr. Meites means; if so, he called his child by a wrong name.</p>
   <p>However, if he means to compile a record of the Jewish community in Chicago, he will perform an excellent and necessary piece of work. He will be doing a great service to the Chicago Jews, a service which will not soon be forgotten.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1101.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I will give Mr. Meites a few tips when he returns from his trip to New York and Washington. I worked once in some archives and I was also engaged for a few years in a historical seminar in a big university. Those "tips" might be of use to him because they can save him a great deal of work. If Mr. Meites has patience, he can read an article of mine on Jewish history in the Hebrew magazine, Heosid, another article of mine on history and historiography in the Menorah journal, and a third article by me in the Berlin magazine, East and West of July, 1912. I was once interested in this subject. Mr. Meites knows where he can reach me if he wants to save himself time and energy.</p>
