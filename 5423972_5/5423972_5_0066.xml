<title level="a">A LEXICON ABOUT THE JEWISH THEATER</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Jewish writers in America have for a long time cherished the idea of compiling a Jewish Theater Lexicon. It was felt that the Jewish actor who is participating in the creation of Jewish culture in America, should have his name perpetuated in a book in order that one might know who he was, what he had accomplished, what brought him to the Jewish stage and what he had contributed to the development of the Jewish theater in general.</p>
   <p>However, those who attempted to write the lexicon were confronted with all sorts of difficulties. In order to accomplish the task it is absolutely necessary for the writer to possess unusual energy, patience, and the persistence of a real idealist. He must have confidence in himself and be able to perform everything he undertakes. Such a person is Mr. Zalman Silverzweig, the author and editor of the Yiddish Theater Lexicon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silverzweig worked for more than ten years on the compiling of the lexicon. He gathered material not only from old archives in libraries but from personal friends among actors and friends of actors. He traveled in almost every country <pb facs="5423972_5_0067.jpg" n="2"/>of the world where Jewish dramas are played. Everywhere he went Mr. Silverzweig gathered information, not only concerning real stars but about mediocre actors. To him the actors were not alone important but also the whole structure of the theater.</p>
   <p>We must praise him for accomplishing such a remarkable piece of work. The first book of the lexicon has just been released from the press. It contains names of actors and actresses from A to Z. By reading the first volume one can readily see the importance of this work for those desiring to study or to get information on the history of the Yiddish theater, as well as for those who interest themselves in the Jewish theater in general.</p>
   <p>Anyone who has ever written about the Jewish theater, or its actors, knows very well how difficult it is to gather information on this subject. We lack data about the Jewish theater; the information is buried in private archives where nobody is able to get at it, and much information is lost; there are no bibliographical notes. But this problem has finally been solved by Mr. Silverzweig.</p>
   <p>Should one want to write a more extensive biography about Jacob Adler or Sigmund Magulesco, one will find plenty of material and bibliographical notes in the <pb facs="5423972_5_0068.jpg" n="3"/>Jewish Lexicon.</p>
   <p>In other nations such a work is not accomplished by one man but by a group of men, each a specialist in his field. This (work) is almost like an encyclopedia and it seems well-nigh impossible for one person to have accomplished such an enormous task.</p>
   <p>Numerous items are included such as history, drama, literature, folklore, science and art. We regret that this work is of inferior quality. We must not blame the author for not being able to present a more perfect work. On the contrary we must give him credit, for after all he was the first one to conceive the idea of the lexicon and to achieve its goal. One obvious fault is the stress laid on dates while more important details are omitted, such as the roles played by the actors.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silverzweig remarks in his preface that he is not a theater critic, that he only writes about the achievements of the actors but is unable to discuss the quality of their acting. Another error made by the author was in allotting the same space to noted actors and to those of minor standing. The editor of a lexicon must be impartial, but one must recognize facts and extend to the great actors the deserved amount of attention.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0069.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>For instance, very vague information is given about Leon Blanc, who was very well known. The lexicon only mentions where he was born and when he came to the United States, but nothing about his contributions to the Yiddish stage. The same may be said about other noted actors and actresses, such as Bina Abramovitz, Celia Adler, Anna Appel, Bertha Gersten, etc. The question arises, will readers in Europe get a clear conception of our actors in America, and their relative importance? The editor should take these points into consideration before the last two books are published.</p>
   <p>A lexicon is not written in order to satisfy the public, but has a definite purpose - to give facts about and praise for those who earned it. Mr. Silverzweig has been very careful, in most instances, in giving dates. He gives a full list of plays, published and unpublished, indicating the time where and when each play was performed, but occasionally forgets, or perhaps neglected, to give the dates; which gives the impression that it is a haphazard piece of work.</p>
   <p>I am only trying to point out a few errors made by the author which could have been avoided very easily. I am not trying to belittle the value. Mr. Silverzweig deserves much praise and recognition.</p>
