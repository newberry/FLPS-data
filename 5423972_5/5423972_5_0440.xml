   <p>Dramatic Class.</p>
   <p>The dramatic class of the Players Club of the Chicago Hebrew Institute was conducted on the same basis as it was last year, namely, under the direct auspices of the club. Seven plays were presented in the course of the season, which were very well attended. Recently a children's department was started. It is too early, however, to forecast any results for this new activity if properly conducted, however, there seems to be a good field for work of this sort. We regret to report that the relationship of the club to the Institute has as yet, despite our efforts, not been as clearly defined as we would wish to have it.</p>
