This theatre is located at Halsted street and Jackson Blvd. and will open for business Christmas week, This will be an exclusively Jewish theatre. Mr. Glickman is very optimistic over this new venture. He promises to have the very best of talented Jewish actors on the stage, He would not make any promises as to his beinga co-player on the stage with the other actors but he assures the public that he will always present a first class company of players. Also, from time to time he will present new blood and talent of the greatest in dramatic art.</p>
   <p>Mr. Glickman, before departing for New York yesterday stated, that the Jewish Societies of Chicago are the ones who were instrumental in his starting a Jewish Theatre in Chicago. It is because the success of the theatre benefits that the different synogogues and charity organizations have by their untireing efforts induced Mr. Glickman to venture a Jewish theatre.</p>
