   <p>The "Courier"has sent one of its people with an ukase to Mr. M. A. Goldberg, president of the Kehillah Jacob Synagogue - "We will drive your Rabbi out of town."</p>
   <p>The Rabbi whom the "Courier" threatens to drive out is Rabbi Samuel Shach, who, in his Sabbath sermon sharply voiced his protest against the "bossism" of the "Courier" and its attacks upon the Rabbinate for not allowing themselves to become political pawns.</p>
   <p>The "Courier" also wishes to drive out Rabbi Rubenstein of Beth Hamidrash Lorbanim (Theological Seminary) because he also protested in his sermon against the cheap act of the "Courier."</p>
   <p>Another "Courier" man went to the president of the Anshe Kinesseth Synagogue, M. Salk, and stated to him that the Rabbi, Ephraim Epstein is unable to teach, <pb facs="5423972_5_1046.jpg" n="2"/>that he is not fit for his position, and that he must be driven out of the city.</p>
   <p>The "Courier" wants to drive out Samuel Levin, president of the Yeshivah, because he and the other Yeshivah leaders, Israel Shechtman, Israel Shoenhime, Thos. Pizer, Joseph M. Newberger, Wolf Dolgin, Abraham A. Saperstein, Cliezer Adler, P. S. Blumenthal, and Israel Sabink, have openly protested against the policy of the paper. They also rejected the proposal by the editor of the "Courier" that he become a professor of philosophy in the Yeshivah for $2,000 a year.</p>
