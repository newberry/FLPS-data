   <p>The sex play "Should a Woman Deceive?" made such a big hit in the Lawndale Theater last week, that it was held over for another week....</p>
   <p>The Lawndale Theater was crowded. No doubt Chicago Jewry was very eager to see a play like this for they never saw one like it. They have read much about sex plays performed in New York on the Jewish stage and even there such plays were stopped numerous times in order not to offend respectable citizens.</p>
   <p>This play is not so spicy as its name suggests. One recognizes that it is a very wholesome drama, and there is nothing vulgar or burlesque in it. The only thing that is exciting is the heroine's confiding of her life secrets to her best friend - about her marriage 8 years before and about remaining childless as a result of having too many abortions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0071.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The story of this drama, written by Jacob Goldin, tells of a woman, happily married, but childless as the result of abortions, whose husband, very much in love with her, yearns for a child. She decides to go to Florida for a holiday, telling her husband that she is pregnant, and there she adopts a baby.</p>
   <p>Her doctor, who is in love with her, threatens to tell the truth to her husband unless she will yield to him.</p>
   <p>A year later she herself tells her husband that the baby is an adopted one. At the final curtain, the audience still does not know, "Should A Woman Deceive?"</p>
   <p>The husband and wife are still in love with one another; why then, does he want to leave home rather than accept the adoption of the baby?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0072.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Why do they not discuss their problems frankly? Why was he silent all those years, and why did she not tell him about her wholesale abortions?</p>
   <p>When the big scandal occurs over the affair with the doctor, the husband accepts the adopted son as his heir. The directing by Jacob Cohen is up to par.</p>
   <p>Although advertised in the newspapers as a family drama, it should be classified, rather, as a melodrama with surprises and miracles. The leading role is most exquisitely played by the well-known actress, Celia Adler... The male lead is played by David Paper. He plays his role artistically, but somewhat too melodramatically.</p>
   <p>The third important role, that of the doctor, is played by Abraham Teitelbaum...</p>
