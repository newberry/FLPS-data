   <p>We are finally going to have a center of Jewish learning in Chicago, in the form of a "Beth Medrosh L'Torah." This will include a Talmudic High School, a Talmudic College, and a Hebrew Teachers' Training Seminary. This institution, which is necessary for the continuation of Judaism in Chicago, was one of the most discussed subjects during the past few years. It caused heated discussions, fiery debates, controversies, and hot blood, because of the persistence of the one and negligence of the other, and because of the determination of the one and the indifferent attitude of the other. It was hard to convince the representatives of Orthodox Jewry in Chicago that without the centralization of forces in the field of Jewish education, and that without the establishment of a Jewish cultural center in the form of this institution, Judaism in Chicago would by sheer necessity, have to undergo a process of attraction, and that in the end it would fall to pieces. It <pb facs="5423972_5_1478.jpg" n="2"/>is true that it was not an easy job to carry out this proposition, because of a difference of opinion held by the main elements in the Orthodox ranks regarding the object of this institution. It is needless to say that the Orthodox leaders were not ready to add more financial burdens to those they are already bearing. Now the leaders of the Orthodox community finally seem to be convinced that such an institution is of utmost importance for the very existence of Judaism in Chicago, and that its establishment cannot be delayed, especially in view of the fact that the Talmudical educational establishments already in existence are practically homeless and must be housed.</p>
   <p>Finally, the leaders of the community have cast the die, and have not only decided to establish an institution, but to proceed to raise funds for erecting a new building. We are delighted to see that one in the community has already come to the aid of the cause in a most noble manner, <pb facs="5423972_5_1479.jpg" n="3"/>before the appeal was actually made, and has contributed two thousand dollars towards the building fund. His example will be inspiring and will cause others to do likewise.</p>
   <p>We remember arguments against the erection of a building at the present location but nevertheless we cannot favor any delay in the work. None can guarantee better times than the present, and cheaper labor in the future, and since the institution is necessary, a home should be built for it at once. It may not be expensive and luxurious, merely a simple structure, but a home must be established. The appeal for this institution should be made before other organizations, such as the relief and the Keren Hayesod, make their appeals. For the time being, we assume that twenty-five thousand dollars should enable them to go on with the work, and then at the completion of the building, twenty or thirty thousand dollars more could be raised to pay off debts.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the institution should not neglect to make plans for <pb facs="5423972_5_1480.jpg" n="4"/>teaching, and the organization staff. This "Beth Medrosh L'Torah"must have a Teachers' Training Seminary as well. We admit, it is not an easy job to establish a Teachers' Seminary in Chicago, but it must be established because it is absolutely necessary. We may or may not be able to import rabbis from abroad, but we certainly do not want to import teachers from abroad, because "green" teachers cannot do the work properly, even if they teach Hebrew in the Hebrew vernacular. We will have to train our own teachers, not only for Chicago but for the entire Middle West. We must also work out plans of organization, so that the final goal may be attained, of having a Talmudic High School, a Talmudic College, and a Hebrew Teachers' Training Seminary combined. The Talmudic College may also serve as a Rabbinical Seminary, if the students are ready to embark upon a Rabbinical career, and can comply with all the requirements of a candidate for the Rabbinate. While we may or may not have the privilege of possessing a Rabbinical Training School in Chicago, we cannot do without a Teachers' Seminary, and if we wish to have it established soon, we must appoint as soon as possible a board of education and a board of organization to co-operate in working out plans for the activities of the institution.</p>
