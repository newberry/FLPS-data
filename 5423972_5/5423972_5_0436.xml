   <p>Children's Biblical Plays.</p>
   <p>A panorama of historical character and events, commemorated and hallowed by ages of uninterrupted observance, is conjured up on our common-place stage by the young actors of the Jewish Festival Club through the presentation of Biblical plays at seasonable times. An illusion of ancient Egypt, Persia, Babylon, of the far-famed vineyards and stately palms of Judea, of the Patriarch's humble tent and the splendor of an oriental court, of times when both divine prophecy and artistic culture formed the attributes of our people, is carried across the footlights, communicating a sense of beauty and pleasure to the impressionable minds of thousands of Jewish children who attend these performances.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, there has been little or no systematic development along the lines of specifically Jewish juvenile entertainment. The supply of Biblical plays and authentic entertaining material is limited, and after a few <pb facs="5423972_5_0437.jpg" n="2"/>successive presentations the stock is exhausted. It is because of this fact that function of such a club becomes a valuable asset of Jewish education. The members, though largely composed of children, are enabled through the resources of Biblical lessons and general studies to contribute many useful and beautiful ideas which are frequently incorporated in our plays with good advantage.</p>
   <p>The following outline will illustrate the general progress of a play. About a month prior to the production, a survey is made of all historical, traditional and customary observances relating to the particular festival. All the dramatic material on hand is read and discussed; from which the best is selected, and what is lacking, is supplied by home talent during rehearsals. Great care, however, is taken not to overtax the capacity of the youthful mind with cumbersome detail, relying more upon the natural dramatic instinct of the child, especially the Jewish child, to whose highly developed intellectual and emotional perception <pb facs="5423972_5_0438.jpg" n="3"/>the Biblical narrative combining the allegory of wonderland with historical truths, is especially adopted. The Sabbath school girl versed in her history finds no difficulty in portraying a Hannah, and in the same way does the boy fresh from the Hebrew school identify himself easily with the character of either Abraham or Isiah, with whose words and deeds he is familiar. Of late the character of our plays have undergone a decided change. Coinciding with the Peace Program, adopted by all the children's classes of the Institute, the children of the Festival Club have eliminated every play on which the heroism of war is eulogized. In dramatizing the Maccabean victory, it is the spirit of devotion and self sacrifice that forms the theme of the play rather than the display of martial valor, and whenever it is possible to do so, instead of the customary battle scenes and battle hymns, the gentle message of the dove of Peace has been substituted. It may be added, in conclusion, that the methods adopted by this unique branch of Jewish educational training have proved highly effective.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0439.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The club, which is now completing its second year, has a record of celebrating every national holiday, besides special performances and individual readings and recitations. The membership is unusually large, attendance is regular, and the audiences that nearly always fill the hall to its capacity have been appreciative and enthusiastic, justifying a continued and greater effort in the future.</p>
