   <pb facs="5423972_5_0922.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lawyer Jacob Underman was chosen to draw up a constitution for the Press Club.</p>
   <p>The meeting terminated with a banquet in honor of Mr. Jacob Fishman, managing editor of the Morgan Szurnal(Morning Journal), who answered in response to the members numerous greetings with an inspiring speech, in which he touched upon the general Jewish situation and Jewish politics in Paris, from where he has but recently returned.</p>
   <p>Another banquet speaker was Dr. S. M. Melomed, editor of the Courier. Among other things he said:</p>
   <p>"Jacob Fishman is one of those rare Jewish Journalists in America who possess such healthy outlook on mankind and intellectual ethics as to <pb facs="5423972_5_0923.jpg" n="3"/>make them simply amazing. That is why all his colleagues and friends have so much confidence in him, a fact which puts him in the position where he can influence people without much effort."</p>
   <p>"As an individual, Mr. Fishman is very interesting and pleasant. He embodies within himself the dry cold sharp intellect of the Lithuanian Jew and the inspiring warm-hearted animation of the Polish Jew."</p>
