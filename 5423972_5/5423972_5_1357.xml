   <p>When a large Jewish community in Europe decides to build a home for a certain institution, it assigns a certain sum of money for that purpose, calls in architects, and asks them to present plans. A contractor gets the order to build, as soon as a plan is approved. A few years ago, the Jewish community of Berlin decided to erect a new building for a college of Jewish studies, a Hebrew Theological College. Work on the building began as soon as a decision to build was reached. The building was finished within six months.</p>
   <p>In America, where the Jewish communities are not organized, where all the community work is done by a small group of people, the situation is entirely different. It takes a number of years to consider and discuss building plans. The work on a building does not proceed smoothly even after it has begun. The work has to be stopped, the process of construction interrupted, because there <pb facs="5423972_5_1358.jpg" n="2"/>is not enough money to finish the building. This is a shameful condition which has a demoralizing effect upon the community and upon the individual.</p>
   <p>In Chicago they have been building a Hebrew Theological College for the past six months. It is unquestionably a very important institution; it is so important that it is difficult to understand how Chicago got along without one up to now. Ordinarily, the construction work should have taken less than six months, but the representatives of the Hebrew Theological College did not have an organized community behind them to guarantee the financing of the building. Summer was over before the few dollars needed to go on with the construction were raised. Now the summer is over and the building is still unfinished because there is no money.</p>
   <p>Such a state of affairs would be understandable if Chicago were a small Jewish community of a few thousand Jews, but Chicago is the second largest Jewish community in the world. Chicago has more Jews than Berlin and Frankfurt-am-Main combined. It is a shame and a disgrace that Chicago, which is one of the <pb facs="5423972_5_1359.jpg" n="3"/>richest Jewish communities in the world, should display such a niggardly spirit, the spirit of a miser. The reputation of Chicago Jews does not gain anything from such an attitude.</p>
   <p>Fifty or sixty thousand dollars is all that is needed now to finish constructing the building. Chicago Jews moan and sigh, but they are not contributing the relatively small sum that is needed for this great community undertaking. The representatives of the institution are compelled to organize a bazaar as a means of raising the few necessary dollars. Assuming that the bazaar will be very successful, that it will bring in a large sum--say thirty thousand dollars--that will still be insufficient.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the community have resolved to make a united appeal during the coming holidays in behalf of the Hebrew Theological College and the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] in order to assure the completion of the building and the opening of the institution. The great importance of the institution and the fact that it is now in a very critical financial condition forced the <pb facs="5423972_5_1360.jpg" n="4"/>Keren Hayesod workers to agree that the Keren Hayesod appeal should also include an appeal for the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Orthodox Jews should be sad; they should be ashamed of the fact that the financing of the Hebrew Theological College is dependent upon a bazaar and upon an appeal in the synagogues. There are two hundred thousand well-to-do Orthodox Jews in Chicago, who can afford to give from two hundred to two thousand dollars for the Hebrew Theological College; nor would such a contribution impoverish them. They did not do so, but forced the Torah to beg--through bazaars and through synagogues--which is no honor to Chicago Jews.</p>
   <p>Now that it has been decided to organize a bazaar for the benefit of the Hebrew Theological College, now that it has been decided to include in the Keren Hayesod appeal an appeal for the Hebrew Theological College, every Orthodox Jew in Chicago should see to it that both undertakings are successful, because upon the success of both undertakings depends the future development of this important institution.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1361.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let every Chicago Jew do his duty, in this eleventh hour, to the Hebrew Theological College. Let every Chicago Jew realize that once we have begun to build a Hebrew Theological College, we must finish it. We must not stop in the midst of our work. Chicago Orthodoxy must not become morally bankrupt.</p>
