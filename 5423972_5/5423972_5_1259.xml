   <p>One hears a great deal about Talmud Torahs in Chicago nowadays, about the children who attend, about the necessity of establishing new Talmud Torahs, about a new Educational Council, about the thousands of Jewish children who do not receive a Jewish education, and so on, but nothing whatever is heard about the teachers in Talmud Torahs. I believe that I know all the Jews in Chicago who are worth knowing, but I do not know the Hebrew teachers, with the exception of two or three of them. I have some connection with Hebrew in Chicago but I do not know the Hebrew teachers of Chicago because they are never seen at any Jewish gathering, because they are not Jews who take their Judaism seriously. This is a serious accusation but I must make it. Only three teachers, out of the fifty or sixty Hebrew teachers in Chicago, are members of the Zionist organization. To whom should Zionism be more dear than to a Hebrew teacher? Who should be more interested in general Jewish affairs <pb facs="5423972_5_1260.jpg" n="2"/>than a Hebrew teacher, whose task it is to educate a generation of Jews? Why don't we see Hebrew teachers at Jewish meetings, at Zionist meetings? What do the Hebrew teachers do with the free time that they have? The Hebrew teachers owe us a reply to these important questions. If they want us to respect them, if they want to have any influence, they will give up their boycott of everything that is actively Jewish and will begin to participate in Jewish work.</p>
