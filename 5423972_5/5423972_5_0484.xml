   <p>After years and years of planning, preparation and building, the great Century of Progress is open in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The stage on which "A Romance of a People" will be presented, the largest of its kind in the world, was dedicated recently with simple ceremonies. Those who saw the stage, its beauty and its immensity, were awe stricken and stood there in bewilderment. Oman and Lilienthal, the architects, who conceived and are supervising the building of this beautiful stage, are doing a piece of work which will remain in Jewish history for generations. It is absolutely the finest of its kind ever built, and may justly be proud of their accomplishment. One of the most interesting exhibits on the Fair grounds is Solomon's Temple and the Tabernacles, built according to the description in the Bible, the dedication of which will take place Saturday night. The exhibit will doubtless be the magnet point for countless thousands of Jews and Gentiles who are interested in Biblical lore and want to see exact production of that famous temple built by King Solomon.</p>
