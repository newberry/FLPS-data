   <p>The Chicago Culture Club or better known in short as C. C. C., has celebrated the opening of its new home in the Lindy Building, 75 W. Randolph Street, Saturday night.</p>
   <p>The opening was a nice one and successful. A colorful program was carried through in which participated such renowned artists as Theodore Katz, violinist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Shuess, the pianist; Alexander Kipnio, bass of the Chicago Opera Company; the dramatic soprano, Mina Isaieva and other talented performers. Short and brief talks given by the organizers and main officials of the club, such as Israel Bloom, president; Louis Schaefer, vice president; and I. B. Eury, secretary.</p>

   <p>This club, organized only a few years ago, has made great progress in the few years of its existence. It attracted Chicago's Jewish and most prominent intelligence. The club now has over three members and is starting a campaign for more.</p>
   <p>The club devotes most of its time to cultural activities, and every season gives a complete series of lectures on literature, art and science. This season, the series of lectures will start to night with Henry Seidel Kanby, one of the greatest authorities on literature in America. He is the editor of the only literary weekly journal in America. The Saturday Review of Literature.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kenby will lecture, tonight, on the subject "Contemporary American Criticism." This club occupies a whole floor beautifully decorated, in the Lindy Building. A fine atmosphere is created there.</p>
