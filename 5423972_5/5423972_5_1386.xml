<title level="a">FOR A JEWISH EDUCATIONAL CENTER ON THE SOUTH SIDE</title><title level="a" type="sub">by J. Loebner</title></bibl>

   <p>South Side Jews, who are Orthodox by inclination, should all support the organization which has undertaken to establish the Jewish Educational Institute for the purpose of teaching Hebrew and other Jewish studies to children of public-school age. This Institute will also engage in social, civic, patriotic, and cultural activities. The Institute is now located at 114 East 59th Street. It is expected to become a center of Jewish influence and communal progress.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews of the South Side have needed such a central headquarters for a long time. There are about six thousand Jewish children on the South Side, and most of them go around idle because there is no place for them to study. Only three per cent of the six thousand receive a Jewish education in the schools maintained by the synagogues. That is why a group of Jews on the South <pb facs="5423972_5_1387.jpg" n="2"/>Side have organized to solve the problem. The number of such Jews should increase from day to day so that the Institute can become what it ought to be. They need men there who know how a Jewish child should be educated. They are quite serious about their undertaking. It is sufficient to say that Dr. A. B. Yudelson, an amiable individual and a scholar in Jewish and secular education, has been elected president of the Jewish Educational Institute.</p>
   <p>The institution when completed--which we hope will be very soon--will have a large auditorium, lecture rooms, classrooms, game rooms, ladies' parlor, gymnasium, and swimming tanks. The institution will thus have sufficient space and equipment so that the children can play in their free time.</p>
   <p>The building, which will not belong to any particular congregation but to all the Jews of the South Side, will cost about a quarter of a million dollars. One-third of that sum must be raised between now and November first. The <pb facs="5423972_5_1388.jpg" n="3"/>ground for the institution will be bought in a suitable neighborhood. The following people are working industriously for the erection of the building: Dr. Yudelson, Nathan D, Kaplan, Fred Bernstein, Samuel Levy, Morris Krieger, Lee Cohen, and Leah Levinson.</p>
   <p>Orthodox Jews of the South Side! Give a helping hand to the above-mentioned leaders and contribute your share of money to help realize a plan which will lead your children into the Jewish way [of life]. As far as you personally are concerned, the building may become of such importance to you as a social center that you will not be able to get along without it, just as you are not able to get along without the synagogue where you pray. Write or get in touch with Dr. Yudelson at the address given above.</p>
