   <p>At last we have in Chicago an organization which aims to create one large center for the Torah, and to institute a methodical system with regard to Talmudic instruction. The organization wants to put the whole Talmudic education in Chicago on a broad and solid basis. It wants to give the Chicago-Jewish youth an opportunity to study so that later they can teach and make teaching their career. The students of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah will be able to become Hebrew teachers, rabbis or simply scholars. They will not be compelled to choose this or that career. They are free to become whatever they please. The main point is that they should study and should study hard. The Beth Medrosh L'Torah will also make it possible for them to acquire a general and professional education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1475.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Should a student of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah wish to become a Hebrew teacher, then he will get a thorough training in theoretical and practical pedagogy, in the Hebrew language, in literature, in Jewish history, and so on. Should someone wish to become a rabbi, then he will get a thorough education in the Talmud and its commentaries, homiletics, religious philosophy, Jewish history and literature, Jewish institutions, Jewish archeology, and so on. Every student of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah will be able to develop his talents and will have his choice of a career. Should he decide that he does not want to make a career out of his knowledge but wants to study for the sake of study, it will be so much the better.</p>
   <p>If the Chicago Jews understood the importance of this institution and its great possibilities as a center of the Torah for Chicago and the whole Middle West, then this Beth Medrosh L'Torah might become one of the most important institutions in the country, of which all the Jews in America might be proud.</p>
   <p>The first thing that this institution needs is a home, a building of its own for the seminary and for the classes. The sum of one hundred thousand dollars <pb facs="5423972_5_1476.jpg" n="3"/>is needed to erect such a building, and the Orthodox Jews in Chicago must provide that sum. A good beginning has already been made. One of the leaders of the institution gave two thousand dollars from his own pocket towards the building fund. The other leaders of the Chicago Jews should also do their duty, if the Torah is dear to them and if they want to see Chicago become the center of the Torah.</p>
   <p>When people come to you in the interests of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah do not send them away empty-handed, but give as much as you can for the institution, because you are giving money for a great and sacred cause, and you are helping to build a spiritual center in Chicago.</p>
