<title level="a">WORKMEN'S CIRCLE SCHOOL DIRECTORS HEAR INTERESTING REPORT OF THE SCHOOLS IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Comrade S. Holland, chairman of the Central School Committee, opened the meeting, declaring that last week the term of the Workmen's Circle Schools in Chicago ended. On this occasion it was of interest to listen to reports by teachers and principals.</p>
   <p>Comrade Carson, teacher at the Northwest side school, reported as follows:</p>
   <p>The school has 130 children, and is divided into six classes, from first grade to graduating class. A group of children will graduate on the 15th of February. To honor this occasion a special performance is to be presented. On that evening twenty-five pupils from all the Workmen's Circle Schools will graduate, whence they will enter the Workmen's Circle High School. The school also has a youth club, which meets every Sunday afternoon. The children are preparing essays for an album, which will appear at the graduation concert.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1170.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every Saturday afternoon a reading is given by the older children. They read the works of Peretz, Sholom Alechem and Raisin.</p>
   <p>Comrade Carson also explained that this year has seen more life and intensity by the Parents' Association, thanks to the activities and loyalty of Comrades Seidel, Neier, and Simkin.</p>
   <p>The average of monthly tuitions paid last year was $160, but this year the average reached the sum of $186 a month.</p>
   <p>Various cultural work is done in and around the school, and classes are being conducted as usual.</p>
   <p>Comrade Kaplan, teacher of the Douglas Park Workmen's Circle School, reported that the school now has 110 children, who are divided into six classes. All possess the proper knowledge, according to their division in the classes: He also has nine pupils who graduated from the school, and whom he is now instructing in social questions and problems. At <pb facs="5423972_5_1171.jpg" n="3"/>the high school, he teaches twice a week, Sunday afternoon and Wednesday evening.</p>
   <p>The total monthly tuition amounts to $150. Last year it amounted to $170 per month.</p>
   <p>Comrade Waldman, teacher of the Crawford School, which opened recently, reported that there are ninety children in the school: 55% are boys, and 45%, girls, between the ages of six and twelve. Half of the parents are members of the Workmen's Circle. Entertainment was provided for young and old when the school was opened. Tuition in the amount of $130 has been received so far.</p>
   <p>The school, though recently opened, stands a good chance to double the number of its pupils in the very near future.</p>
   <p>Comrade Waldman also declared that Chicago in general and the Crawford <pb facs="5423972_5_1172.jpg" n="4"/>neighborhood in particular is badly in need of a kindergarden school.</p>
   <p>Comrade Barsley, teacher of two schools, in Albany Park and South Chicago, reports that the work is very satisfactory. The South Chicago School is in existence now over five years.</p>
   <p>Upon the request of the parents of the Albany Park School, the latter was converted into a daily school.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to an end, and the school directors were enthusiastic over the excellent work of the teachers and principals, as shown in their reports.</p>
