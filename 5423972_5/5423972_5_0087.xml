   <p>Have you ever heard a dead man speak, speak about everything, business, war, love, and even about the other world? If you have never heard a dead man speak and you want to witness such a miracle, you now have the opportunity. This opportunity is given to you at the Palace Theater, where they are presenting Sholom Asch's newest play, "The Dead Man".</p>
   <p>Since the friends of "literature" are always complaining that they get too little "literature" and too much melodrama, Mr. [Elias] Glickman decided to play a trick on them; he would give them an opportunity to see a "literary" play, and not just any literary play, but Sholom Asch's "The Dead Man". The author himself says that it, "The Dead Man," will usher in a new period in the Jewish drama and in the Jewish theater--and when a merchant says that <pb facs="5423972_5_0088.jpg" n="2"/>his merchandise is good, it certainly must be good.</p>
   <p>Anyway, Mr. Elias Glickman has a sense of humor--otherwise he would not have presented this very "literary" play in his theater. Well, boys, you wanted literature--here you have literature, a work by a great Jewish writer--and much good will it do you.</p>
   <p>"The Dead Man" is a "literary" play written by Sholom Asch. A play--whether literary or not--should have action and the hero of this play is a corpse. A corpse can do only one thing: lie in the grave. Now, imagine, what can a corpse do on a stage? Anybody can play the role of a corpse. You just lie down on the floor, they cover you with a black cloth--and you lie quietly. You do not cough, you do not moan, and you are considered dead. But when a dead man talks, walks, moves around, dreams, together with a living girl, about love--it indicates that the author did not know how to make real people say the same things. A writer who knows how to create living <pb facs="5423972_5_0089.jpg" n="3"/>human beings, does not have to dig corpses out of graves.</p>
   <p>A writer who has dug out a corpse and put him on the stage, should not have made him wear a soldier's uniform. If the corpse wears a soldier's uniform, he should not talk like a hoarse corpse but like a soldier....well, like a dead soldier. You know how a dead soldier speaks? It doesn't make any difference how he speaks or what he says--it will be correct and natural. Mr. Teitelbaum, who played the role of a dead man, played it correctly and naturally, and if he had played it in a melodramatic style, like Leon Blank, it still would have been natural and correct--can you prove it wrong?</p>
   <p>The only good things about Sholom Asch's "The Dead Man" are the music and the scenery. But the music does not fit the play and the scenery fits neither the play nor the music. Otherwise, everything is fine: a dead play, a dead man, ancient dead ideas, dead dialogue....how can dead people speak living dialogue?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0090.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Sholom Asch deserves a banquet for having written a three-act play; "The Dead Man" doesn't have a fourth act. If there had been a fourth act, the audience, too, would have died and then we would have had a dead theater and the undertakers would have had a good time. It is a pity they did not perform an autopsy upon the "dead man" before they dragged him out of the grave onto the stage--they would not have been able to resurrect him and the dead man would not have spoken to us.</p>
   <p>My friend Glickman wanted to square accounts with the literature-hungry theatergoers, and, upon my word, he has succeeded admirably. Here is literature for you and do not pester me.</p>
   <p>Now, having witnessed this "literary" play, I must ask Zolotarevsky to pardon me. Zolotarevsky, you are a second Shakespeare and I am going to see your "The Price Of A Divorce".</p>
