   <p>Recognizing the fact that the drama is one of the most, if not the most, democratic of the arts, the Institute has always given the theatre the presentation of good plays and the development of latent acting talents and a prominent place in its program of activities. But in its marvelously equipped new home on Douglass Boulevard and St. Louis Avenue, the Institute is going to do something more than just this.</p>
   <p>The theatre in this new building marks a departure in non-commercial dramatic enterprises. Indeed there are few theatres, even in the commercial field of the legitimate drama, that are a match for it so far as stage arrangements, acoustics, seating capacity, comfort and atmosphere conducive to the presentation and enjoyment of plays are concerned. This coupled with the additional rehearsal facilities, the zeal, experience and ability of Kenneth Croft, the director of dramatics, and the enthusiastic actors of the Players Club, assures the community of many seasons of rare and delectable theatrical entertainment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Moreover, there is in the new building a poetically picturesque roof garden which will also be used by the dramatic department for the staging of plays. Two plays, one a serious drama and the other a light comedy, will be produced there this summer. Rehearsals on these pieces have been in progress for some time now and the casts are very nearly ready for public presentation.</p>
   <p>The cast for "39 East" by Rachael Crothers, scheduled as the opening piece for the new theatre proper, is almost complete--there remain but four parts to fill. Among the plays being considered for subsequent production are, "The Truth About Blaydes" by A.A. Milne, "We Moderns" by Israel Zangwill, and a number of extra-ordinary, one act pieces by Conrad Seiler, Pinski and others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Croft needs a few more persons, particularly men, to complete his acting staff. This means an exceptional opportunity for progress and development for young people who have set their minds on stage careers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0417.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Another, and equally important division of the Institute's activities in the field of the drama is that of the presentation of Yiddish plays. This is under charge of the Yiddishe Literarishe un Dramatishe Gesselshaft, which organization has established an enviable reputation for itself among the Yiddish speaking element of the city by virtue of its excellent production of first rate plays.</p>
   <p>For the coming season this Yiddish speaking group is securing a director from New York and scheduling two productions a week in the theatre of the new building. The Yiddish players promise to give the community the best the Jewish drama has to offer.</p>
