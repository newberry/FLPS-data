   <p>Chicago is the only major Jewish community in the world without an academic Jewish library open to all who are engaged in Jewish scholarly work. Philadelphia has several good Jewish libraries, New York has several, Cincinnati and Washington have good Jewish libraries, but Chicago has none, and because there is not such a library in Chicago, those Jewish scholars who are anxious to do scholarly work must go to other cities to do it, or they do not do it at all. The establishment of a Jewish library in Chicago to serve primarily the purposes of Jewish learning and Jewish research work is of prime importance to the intellectual interest of the community, and an attempt can be made now to establish such a library in conjunction with the Beth Medrosh L'Torah [Hebrew Theological College]. The Beth Medrosh L'Torah is supposed to be an academic institution, and if it is not <pb facs="5423972_5_0730.jpg" n="2"/>deserving of its name, it will be deserving of it within a very short time because sooner or later it will have to engage academic teachers, and the institution will be transformed into a regular Jewish faculty. However, a Jewish faculty without an academic library is impossible. The students must be trained in research work and they cannot do it without an academic library. It is, therefore, obvious that it is the duty of the Board of Directors of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah to lay as much stress on the establishment of a good library as on any other branch of activities. It is as important as the teaching staff. We, therefore, suggest that the authorities of the Beth Medrosh L'Torah lose no time in organizing a special library committee, the object of which shall be to concentrate its activities on the development of the already existing library, so that it can become a truly academic library.</p>
   <p>Such a library must possess three types of books; Hebraica, comprising the best works of Hebrew literature from the Bible to the present day; Judaica, <pb facs="5423972_5_0731.jpg" n="3"/>the literature on Jews and Judaism from Philo to the present day; and a good theological and philosophical library. To procure these books a sum of ten thousand dollars is necessary, and when the library will possess at least the fundamental books of Hebraica and Judaica, Jewish scholars in Chicago who are interested in various branches of Jewish learning will be in a position to do the work right here in Chicago, and the library will not only stimulate and further the cause of Jewish learning in Chicago, but it will make Chicago a center of Jewish academic activities. It is a disgrace that a community like Chicago, second to the largest Jewish community in the world, is a nonentity as far as Jewish learning is concerned. No great Jewish book, with the exception of Shure's Nesach Israel, is connected with the name of Chicago. The Jewish bibliographer will tell you that Chicago is unknown as a center of Jewish learning. An end must be made to this disgraceful state of affairs, and only an academic library such as we propose, can make an end ot it. There are now in Chicago any number of young Jewish fellows who neglect their scholarly interests because there is no Jewish library at their disposal where they can do scholarly work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0732.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The cause of Hebrew learning is the main sufferer, but the ambitious young Jewish scholars suffer too. We cannot possibly imagine an academic Jewish institution, such as the Beth Medrosh L'Torah will soon be, without an adequate library. Even these students of the institution who contemplate devoting all their ability, time, and energy to a study of the Talmud and Rabbinica, must have an adequate library at their disposal, but we dare say that a great many of the students will be interested in other branches of Jewish learning as well, in philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, [who will be] without an academic Jewish library open to all who are [in need of a] library to serve their specific purposes.</p>
   <p>Now that the financial strain of the institution has been somewhat relieved by the results of the membership drive, and will be more relieved in the near future, the Board of Directors must tackle at once the library problem, because within a year or so, some of the students of the institution will be ready to do research work, and they must be given the opportunity to <pb facs="5423972_5_0733.jpg" n="5"/>do this work. It is true that a library is more than a collection of books. The books must be housed somewhere and must be cared for by somebody, but the main thing, are the books. When the books will be here, it will be easy to convince the public to give a certain sum of money for a library building, but the first attempt should be made to secure books or money to buy books. This attempt should be made at once.</p>
