   <p>The "Jewish Courier" wants to deliver the Local Kehillah into the hands of the Political Bosses.</p>
   <p>In former times, when chaos ruled the Jewish world in Chicago, just as chaos ruled in the general local political life of the city, the "Courier" did not find it difficult to sell itself to the political bosses. A "Hebrew Republican League," or a "Hebrew Democratic League" was organized, stationary bearing the names of Jewish politicians and their henchmen was printed, and then the following proposal was made to the political boss: "We are the representatives of Chicago Jewry; if you will make a deal with us, we promise to deliver the Jewish vote to you."</p>
   <p>But those times are passed. The political bosses demand greater assurance than a Hebrew League. The "Courier" mob immediately began working, but the task proved no easy one. The Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities has been taken out of the "Courier's" control. The "Courier" has no longer any influence nor authority in this united body of all orthodox organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1050.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, it decided to organize a Kehillah and to control this Kehillah so that it would be able to approach the politicians for a deal for the Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis and the prominent citizens realized in time, the intentions of the "Courier." "You will not be permitted to sell the Torah," was their cry, and they have undertaken to defend themselves against such political trickery. The "Courier" had not thought that the Rabbis would display such courage for it had always claimed to carry the Rabbinate in its vest pocket. The editor of the "Courier" began to terrorize the Rabbis with his prostituted pen. He went so far as to call the Rabbis, idiots, inefficient ones, beggars, fanatics, collectors, politicians, bolsheviks, anarchists, fools, obscurrantists, spiritual cripples, ignoramuses, weak minds, rascals, a disturbing element, small teachers with big beards, etc.</p>
   <p>The first Rabbis who came out against the "Courier" were Rabbi Carden of the Sheri Torah Anshe Mecrob Synagogue and Rabbi Epstein of the Anshe Kinesseth Israel Synagogue, the large orthodox congregation in Chicago.</p>
