   <p>"What does the Talmud Torah do for the education of Jewish children?" I asked Mr. Levin.</p>
   <p>"The Talmud Torah educates a Jewish nationalistic generation," answered Mr. Levin. "We want our children to know the source of their origin. They should realize that they are and should remain Jews. In the Talmud Torah, the children acquaint themselves with the contents of the Torah, the greatness of our prophets and this instills Jewish customs into them and keeps them in closer contact with their parents. The success of this task required a great deal of effort and hard work. In the Talmud Torah there were teachers who were under the impression that the Talmud <pb facs="5423972_5_1677.jpg" n="2"/>Torahs here are the same as those in Europe. They did not realize that the American children go to nice public schools, where the teachers understand them, and where they are treated with love and tenderness. When the children would go to the Jewish school and the teacher would act too strictly, they would stop coming to the Talmud Torah. Those who remained studied without zeal; but today the children like the Talmud Torah. The old customs are done away with now the children are being treated with sympathy and this had a great effect on the children. They are more enthusiastic in their studies. They consider the Talmud Torah as being no worse than the public school, because the modern teachers understand them so well and treated them as the public school teachers do.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1678.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Several years ago fifteen out of a hundred children would attend the Jewish school, now ninety out of a hundred are enthusiastic about attending the Talmud Torah.</p>
   <p>"They find that the atmosphere is different than it used to be and the teacher is very friendly toward them. As luck would have it, we were successful in obtaining suitable teachers, who understand the task of Jewish education. They serve with all their heart and soul the idea of instilling into the hearts of the Jewish children a love and a respect for the Jewish people......The children are taught the beauty and the splendor of the Jewish religion and of Jewish history......</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1679.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"One of the important facts of the Talmud Torah is that we not only teach the children Judaism, but we refine the behavior of the children in the poverty stricken vicinities.</p>
   <p>"It is possible that no one has every thought that the children who are raised on the street learn all the bad habits of the street, " continued Mr. Levin.</p>
   <p>"They not only fail to come to the Talmud Torah, but they also neglect the public school. These same children, after studying in the Talmud Torah for a time, have confidence in us and their character changes entirely. They become natural and their conduct becomes humane. The West Side Talmud Torah became so famous that children come here to study from the south and from the Lawndale district. Not only poor children, but also those whose parents have means come to register in this Talmud Torah.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1680.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"The work of this school is not limited to children only, but is extended to parents. Until of late the parents took very little interest in the children's Jewish education. They knew only one thing, that the children must go to the Jewish school. If the child failed to learn anything, the teachers were blamed. Truthfully speaking, however, education of children, especially Jewish children, depends a great deal on the home and the parents. Father and mother must see to it that their children go to the Talmud Torah; a child must always be encouraged......</p>
   <p>"What does the Talmud Torah do for the poor children in the present hard times, when their fathers are not working. They cannot come to learn without sufficient clothing, barefoot and hungry?" I asked Mr. Levin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1681.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"We visited the Jewish well-to-do people and explained the situation and we achieved more or less satisfactory results," answered Mr. Levin.</p>
   <p>"We have gathered nearly one hundred pairs of shoes and distributed them among the more needy children. Clothing, also was sent to some of the children, and for the hungry children, tables are set twice daily and food given them before they start their studies. Two hundred of the six hundred and two children eat here every day," he ended.</p>
