   <p>Chicago Hebrew Institute Agricultural School Completed Its Third Year of Activities.</p>
   <p>This department has operated most successfully for the last three years, and has passed its experimental stage. We hope that in the near future we will be able to conduct this school throughout the year. Day classes are held during the week days from 2 to 5 P. M. One hour is devoted to class work and two hours to work in the garden. Evening classes in Agriculture and the Sciences, for adults, are held during the week days from 7:30 to 10 P. M.</p>
   <p>Working in the garden develops Physical Health, Mental Power and Moral Strength. The department aims to develop the trinity of Knowing, Feeling and Doing things. Growing a garden, coming in contact with the soil, and working in the open air develops the best characteristics of boys and girls and of men and women. The more Man is seen as a part of Nature, as her <pb facs="5423972_5_1651.jpg" n="2"/>finest flower, the more meaning does Nature come to have for him. She becomes indeed his Alma Mater.</p>
   <p>Seeing and observing the changes in plant life, the pupils learn in part to realize that their own life is also a process, that they must care for themselves as they care for a beautiful flower. They have learned a lesson in Character Building, in Dignity of Labor, in Good Citizenship and in Social Work. The pupils deal with real, actual, essential things, problems, and events, which develops in them Practical Knowledge and Ability. They are learning to Do things. The Department aims to interest and inspire its members with the Bible of Nature which gives incentive to Creative and Constructive Thoughts as well as Action. The class and gardening work is under expert instruction, strictly scientific and cultural.</p>
