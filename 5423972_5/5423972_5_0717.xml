   <p>During the latter part of October, 1892, a memorial meeting was held in Metropolitan Hall, Jefferson and O'Brien Street, to lament the death of the great Hebrew poet, Leon Gordon, who had passed away earlier in the month. Among the speakers were, Dr. Bernard Felsenthal, Dr. Herman Eliasoff, S. A. Schneider, and Leo Zolotkoff.</p>
   <p>Many hundreds of Chicago's Maskilim gathered at the hall to pay homage to the memory of one who had bewailed the sorrows and sufferings of the Jews in stanzas and verses as poignant as those of Jehudah Halevi. It was an opportune moment to think again of Hebraic Literature. At the close of the meeting, a few of the leading Jews privately agreed, among themselves, to call a meeting in the near future for the reorganization of the Hebrew library.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0718.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Two weeks later, a conference was called in a private residence on Judd Street, where a literary society was formed and arrangements were made to collect all the old volumes of the old library and to procure proper quarters to house the new library.</p>
   <p>When the settlement of the West Side Jews reached out further west, and the fine homes on Ashland Boulevard, Marshfield, and Winchester Avenues, bore "Mezuzes" on their door-posts, the library sold its home on Johnson Street and secured a new and more ostentatious site on Ashland Boulevard near Polk Street.</p>
   <p>The "Shochre Sfath Over" served the Jewish community of Chicago faithfully from the date of the death of the great Hebrew poet, Leon Gordon in October 1892, until the realization of his dream when Palestine became the homeland of the Jewish people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0719.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The British Government, through Lord Balfour, officially declared that Palestine was to belong to the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>In the latter part of 1917, when our young men went forth to fight for the democracy of the world and the Jewish youth also for the possession of Palestine, the Hebrew- Literary Society and its library was practically deserted, except for the few men that were left behind. And so the building was sold, the books moved to the Douglas Park district, finally stored away, and the "Chebrah Shochre Sfath Over" ceased to exist.</p>
