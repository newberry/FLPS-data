   <p>In Chicago, they fought for a Hebrew Theological College for about two years--for a spiritual center for the Jews of Chicago. After long disputes, controversies, meetings, and private negotiations, it was decided to build a home for the Torah in Chicago, a home which would serve as a spiritual center for all classes and all types of students: for young people who want to become scholars and for older people who wish to continue their studies. There cannot be any doubt that Chicago needs such an institution. No Orthodox Jew in Chicago denies the need of having a Hebrew Theological College--the only cultural institution of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Such an institution would have been built a long time ago, if the Reform Jews had been convinced that it was necessary to have one. It would have been organized and financed long ago, and it would have been open by now. However, the Orthodox Jews of Chicago are easy-going people; they take <pb facs="5423972_5_1372.jpg" n="2"/>their time. They have been building the Hebrew Theological College for the past six months, but the building is not yet finished. There is no money! They talk a great deal about the Hebrew Theological College, which will certainly be an ornament for the Jews of Chicago, but it is not organized yet and its future is not assured, either financially or intellectually. They still do not know who will be at the head of the institution, what will be taught there, who the teachers and deans will be, how much and what will be taught to the pupils, whether it shall be a purely professional school or a general spiritual center--a sort of a free academy for Talmud, Jewish studies, and so on.</p>
   <p>It seems to us that now, when the Hebrew Theological College is being built, it is time that we became serious and began to do something toward solving the various problems in connection with that institution, but, so far, this has not happened. A few men have done all the work that has been done up to now: the collection of the money to build the institution, organizing the building activity, taking care of the newspaper publicity--but one swallow never makes a summer. All the sacrifices of the indefatigable Messrs. Ben Zion Leizerowich and Eisenstein are not sufficient to put the institution <pb facs="5423972_5_1373.jpg" n="3"/>upon a solid foundation. Not only is more money needed, but, first of all, more people are needed. It is also necessary that the few active workers for the Hebrew Theological College should, at least, propose plans for further constructive work.</p>
   <p>Why don't they call a meeting to elect an educational council so that when the doors of the institution are opened, we won't have to grope our way in the darkness but will know what we have to do?</p>
   <p>It is natural that the few rabbis who are interested in the Hebrew Theological College should desire, first of all, to put their rabbinical stamp upon the institution. They are rabbis, and it is only natural that they should consider the institution from their own point of view. They should not be blamed or criticized. Were a few Hebrew literati interested in the institution, they too would consider it from the point of view of their activity. The community, however, has greater and wider interests in the Hebrew Theological College. The name itself tells us what kind of an interest the community has in the home for the Torah. This is a very broad conception:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1374.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It means Torah with all that the word implies--it means education, Jewish studies, and so on.</p>
   <p>If those working for the Hebrew Theological College don't begin to plan, to organize, to work out the details, then there will remain only one group, the rabbinical group, which will have a definite plan, and the Hebrew Theological College will then become a seminary. The Hebrew Theological College should be a seminary, but it must also have other classes and divisions.</p>
   <p>There was a seminary in Chicago two years ago as well as ten years ago. The fight during the last few years was not about a seminary but about a Hebrew Theological College, which would be more than a seminary, which would be a seminary, a pedagogical institute, and a free academy for Jewish studies.</p>
   <p>It is time to become serious about the Hebrew Theological College. It is high time for the workers of the institution to formulate plans for the future. It is time to formulate study plans for the Hebrew Theological College in order to avoid difficulties in the near future, and in order to be able to begin work as soon as the College opens its doors.</p>
