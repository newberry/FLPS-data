   <p>The rapid growth of the Douglas Park community shows us the aesthetic taste and the desire for a higher standard of living, which is innate among Chicago Jews, who for years past have spent their lives in the West Side Ghetto, on Maxwell and Jefferson streets. As soon as the opportunity presented itself, the Jews pulled out of that district and built up a beautiful community around Douglas Park. In a very short time, many cultural institutions were built, such as synagogues, a Kosher hospital, an orphans home, a home for the aged, children's Hebrew classes, etc.</p>
   <p>But the committee appointed by the city to look after the spiritual and moral development of our youth, and whose aim and duty it is to furnish libraries and other educational institutions for residents in the different parts of the city, the Public Library Board, has entirely neglected our <pb facs="5423972_5_0741.jpg" n="2"/>community, with a population of over 50,000 inhabitants. And furthermore the community is still growing larger and larger. This is a district that has ten public schools with an average of at least 1,000 in each school. There is a high school also in the district. The Jewish people of such a large district lose lots of time and are very much inconvenienced by having to travel on more than one street car, to get to the main library downtown for their book necessities.</p>
   <p>The Poale Zion and the National Workers Alliance have taken upon themselves to influence the Board of the Chicago Public Library to open up a branch library on the West Side with enough reading rooms to accommodate the Jewish inhabitants in this district. A committee for that purpose has been appointed. Messrs. K. Mahmer and I. Stillman are at the head of this <pb facs="5423972_5_0742.jpg" n="3"/>committee which is called the Douglas Library League. This league has, with its energetic hard work, gotten up a petition with over 5,000 names, which will be presented to the Library Board by Mr. Phillip Seaman, the Superintendent of the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>The work of this league is more than appreciated by the citizens of this district. All the public schools, high schools, and the Catholic schools with all their superintendents are earnestly promising to cooperate with the league in this undertaking. The Chicago press is also cooperating and everyone is full of hope that our thickly populated Douglas Park district will soon have the long desired branch library.</p>
