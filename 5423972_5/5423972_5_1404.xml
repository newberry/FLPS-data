   <p>[Translator's note: The major part of this editorial was not transcribed as the contents do not fall within the scope of this project.]</p>
   <p>In a few days the corner stone of the Jewish (sic) Theological College of Chicago will be laid, and we have reason to hope that within a few months or so the building will be erected and the great enterprise completed. And then what? Then we must concentrate all our efforts on the establishing of at least ten more Jewish public schools in Chicago, and the same men who are now engaged in the building up of a Theological Seminary must give their time and energy for the building up of our Chedorim and Talmud Torah system, otherwise the next generation of Chicago Jewry will consist of a few learned and a mass of ignoramuses, and this is scarcely an ideal and healthy state of affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1405.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We do not object to the method of establishing an educational system from the top. It has been done in many countries and has proved to be successful, but we must do like the other peoples have done and wind up the work with the developing of a public school system, and only then will the Jewish (sic) Theological College in Chicago be a blessing to the community.</p>
