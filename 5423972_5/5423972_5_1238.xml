   <p>At last we have, or we are going to have an educational council in Chicago, which will have some authority, and which will be composed of representative Jews from all parts of the city. In the educational council there will be seven members from the Jewish Charities of Chicago and seven other Jews whom the board of education of the United Jewish Charities is to select from a list of twenty-five. This list will be compiled by a committee of five, which has been appointed by Jewish representatives of the city, and the seven names chosen, will be submitted to the board of education of the United Jewish Charities of Chicago. In this way, we will have an authoritative educational council of the city, which will represent the Charities, the Talmud Torahs, the rabbis, the synagogues, the zionist organization, the Conservative Jews, and so on. We should be able to accomplish miracles in the city in the field of educating the Jewish youth with such an educational council and with a man <pb facs="5423972_5_1239.jpg" n="2"/>like Dr. Dushkin as a pedagogical expert.</p>
   <p>The educational council will be organized soon and then the serious work will begin. It is to be hoped that from now on, great changes will take place in the Jewish educational work of Chicago.</p>
