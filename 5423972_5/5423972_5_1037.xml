   <p>There are seventeen thousand Jewish students in America, and only a very small number of them can read Yiddish or Hebrew; there are twenty-five thousand Jewish men and women with an academic education, and only a small number of them can read Yiddish or Hebrew; there are also a large number of intellectual Jewish men and women who are unable to read Yiddish or Hebrew.</p>
   <p>There are, in America, about thirty Jewish weeklies printed in the English language. These weekly newspapers serve communal and social purposes, and help in the development of the local institutions and communities, but they are not good reading material for the educated. For the most part, these Jewish weeklies are entirely colorless. They lack outspoken views on Jewish questions, because they wish to have the sympathy of both the Orthodox and Reform Jews, and not having any outspoken views on Jewish <pb facs="5423972_5_1038.jpg" n="2"/>problems, they are only a gathering of general Jewish news. They still cling to their old grind organ--by combating anti-Semitism--by constantly complaining that the anti-Semites are not fine people. This will not attract the Jewish intellectuals in America to Jewish work, nor will the seventeen thousand Jewish university students in America become more educated or more sagacious Jews.</p>
   <p>Many of the Jewish weeklies in the English language are not only colorless, but they are positively assimilative, and openly preach national apostacy. They are appealing pretentiously to Americanized Jews and to the Americanized Jewish youth. Just as the Americanized Jewish youth, and especially the intellectual youth, knows very little about Jewish literature, Jewish history, Jewish ideals, and Jewish life, so it accepts the assimilative propaganda as the teaching of American Judaism, and thus the circle of assimilation becomes steadily wider and deeper.</p>
   <p>There isn't, in America, a single Jewish organ in the English language that <pb facs="5423972_5_1039.jpg" n="3"/>serves the interests of historical Judaism, nor brings the Americanized Jewish intelligentsia closer to Jewish life and Jewish worldly thought.....</p>
   <p>American Jewry is the only large Jewish group in the world that hasn't a single Jewish organ in the Jewish and American sense. The great Jewish daily newspapers in America are national organs, but they are read only by Jews able to read Yiddish. A national organ for Jews unable to read Yiddish does not exist, and the establishment of such an organ is an absolute necessity. Such an organ is needed to attract the Americanized Jewish intelligentsia to Jewish life and Jewish worldly thought, and is also necessary for the enlightenment of other people.</p>
   <p>When an American statesman, politician, or editor wishes to know what is going on in the Jewish camp, or what the Jewish brain thinks about certain questions, he is unable to get this information from the thirty Jewish weeklies because they are colorless and devoid of subjects of interest to the Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1040.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The English Jews, only a quarter of a million in number, have three great national organs: The London Jewish Chronicle, the Jewish Guardian, and the Jewish Review. The German Jews, only a half a million in number, have several distinguished national organs of various propensities, and even the poor Rumanian Jews have a national organ, but the American Jews haven't any.</p>
   <p>Today, when the Jewish nation is living through such a horrible crisis; when all the Jews of the entire universe are dependent upon American Jewry, a great Jewish national organ in the English language is a twofold necessity. When the Americanized Jews, who do not read Yiddish, fulfill their duty to our people, they must be acquainted with the Jewish problems and needs. This task--the work of enlightening the Americanized Jewish educated classes about the problems and needs of our people, is that of a national organ in the English language, which should serve the interests of historical and national Jewry. Such an organ must naturally have a double function, to wit: to arouse the Jewish minds and hearts, and to fight against everything that is indifferent or disruptive in our life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1041.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Without such an organ, American Jewry must witness a heavy loss of its forces. Those who would participate in Jewish life stand aloof, because they do not know anything about Jewishness and are not acquainted with the problems and needs of our people.</p>
   <p>Such an organ, once established, will be of great value, and will not be dependent on subsidies, because it will be unique through the fact that it will appeal not only to the local Jews, but to the educated Jews throughout America as well. There are, in America, twenty-five thousand educated Jewish families which would certainly welcome such an organ.</p>
   <p>These are the moral, intellectual, and material points of view, which have induced a group of educated Jewish leaders in Chicago to approach the question of establishing a national Jewish organ, published in the English language, for the Americanized Jewish intelligentsia.</p>
   <p>Chicago has a fine and highly developed Jewish press, and if it should <pb facs="5423972_5_1042.jpg" n="6"/>be supplemented by a national Jewish organ, then Chicago will be the journalistic center of American Jewry.</p>
