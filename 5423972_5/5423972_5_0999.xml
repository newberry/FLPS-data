   <p>The Jewish public of Chicago should be grateful to Rabbi Shloime-Chaim for his decision to investigate many very important matters. Rabbi Shloime-Chaim is the most honest and most Orthodox rabbi in Chicago and in the whole world. He has recently shown that he is the most efficient rabbi--the most suitable person to take charge of meeting the needs of all the Jews in America, Russia, Poland, Lativa, etc. His uncompromising fight against intermarriage will go down in Jewish history as outstanding. Rabbi Shloime-Chaim offered a prize of $5.00 for an article on the subject of intermarriage. This alone proves his great deeds.</p>
   <p>According to the Jewish Standard, which is published by Rabbi Shloime-Chaim, he will, in the near future, investigate the Carmel Kosher Sausage Company and determine whether it is controlled by the Carmel Wine Company.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1000.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We have over 100,000 Jews in Chicago; we have rabbis and shohatim--and no one ever thought of establishing this fact. The scandal is far greater when we consider that Rabbi Simon Harry Album, who issued a permit to the Carmel Kosher Sausage Company, had failed to establish this fact but left it up to Rabbi Shloime-Chaim!</p>
   <p>Rabbi Shloime-Chaim also started to find out whether the proprietor of the Vilno Sausage Company owned the Vienna Sausage Company--for if two companies, one kosher and the other nonkosher are run by the same proprietor it is very doubtful whether the so-called kosher company is really kosher. At present everybody, beginning with Congregation Anshe Emeth and concluding with Kehillath Anshe Mayriv, knows the distinction between the Vilno and Vienna Sausage Companies.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Shloime-Chaim was also worried about the "tens of thousands of dollars" <pb facs="5423972_5_1001.jpg" n="3"/>which the Courier gets from various Jewish institutions--and this is no trivial matter! Why should the Courier get thousands when there is a Rabbi Shloime-Chaim who is willing to accept hundreds? After all, any child who knows addition and subtraction knows that hundreds are less than thousands.</p>
   <p>We recognize the importance of these investigations and we would like to recommend to Rabbi Shloime-Chaim that while he is investigating he should also investigate who was the Orthodox rabbi who was mistaken for a gentile because of the views he expressed about Orthodoxy?--who was the rabbi who permitted himself to walk into a drug store during the Day of Atonement to drink a phosphate before he went to make his speech? These are the things he should investigate. The Jews of Chicago will certainly be grateful to Rabbi Shloime-Chaim if he would enlighten them about these matters--especially when he requires no remuneration for his work.</p>
   <p>While speaking of the Jewish Standard we cannot help but express our regret, <pb facs="5423972_5_1002.jpg" n="4"/>together with those of other readers of the newspaper, that while the publisher and editor were celebrating Hanukah they could not write the Jewish news. However, their consolation lies in the fact that next week they [the readers] will again be in a position to read the beautiful language and thoughtfully composed news of the Jewish Standard.</p>
