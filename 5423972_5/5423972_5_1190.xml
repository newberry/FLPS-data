  <body>
   <p>Lovers of the Hebrew language will be glad to learn, that the College of Jewish Studies has arranged for a course of lectures in Social Psychology to be given in Hebrew. The lecturer, Dr. A. S. Waldstein, has just completed a work on that subject and will devote his first series of four lectures to the elements of this science.</p>
   <p>These lectures will be given at the Jewish People's Institute, 3500 Douglas Boulevard, on Monday evenings. The first lecture is to be given Monday, February 20th, and the others will follow on the three subsequent Mondays. A fee of $1.00 payable in advance, will be charged for the entire series. Registration is open now at the College of Jewish Studies, 1800 Selden St., or at the Jewish People's Institute.</p>

   <p>Recently several efforts have been made to organize the various interested in promoting the Hebrew language and culture. The College is doing its share by training about one hundred adults in the language and literature of our people. It is expected, that this new attempt at offering courses of secular interest in Hebrew, will attract all the lovers of our ancient tongue, and thus help strengthen the activities of the various Hebrew speaking clubs.</p>
   <p>The exact topic of the first four lectures will be announced shortly.</p>
