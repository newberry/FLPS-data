   <p>The group of young persevering Jews who form the Jewish Educational League, a league which conducts classes in Hebrew at the John Smythe School, is certainly entitled to the encouragement and support of the Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>These Hebrew classes are not misrepresented by the name of "Jewish People's School," so that now a real Jewish People's school is conducted in the John Smythe School. In this school many Jewish children are taught to be faithful to their people, language, and traditions. Everything that is being done to rear Jewish children as Jews, should be encouraged and supported.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1702.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In America we have neglected Jewish education so badly that if we leave it in the state it is in now for a few decades more, we will have no children to rear. We will hear the Jews mentioned only when some ugly act, committed by a man bearing a Jewish name, will be published.</p>
   <p>There is only one way to preserve the Jewish race, and that is to implant in the hearts of the Jewish children love for their people, knowledge of the Jewish language, and an acquaintance with Jewish history and traditions. All this is being realized in the various Talmud Torahs (school of religious love) and Jewish national, conservative, and radical schools. Every undertaking to aid these schools should be supported.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew classes in the John Smythe School are devoted to this objective. As is the case with all good things, the committee which cares for the <pb facs="5423972_5_1703.jpg" n="3"/>financial side of these classes, is always short of funds, and for this reason it is arranging a concert and ball for next Sunday evening in the Chicago Hebrew Institute. May everyone help make this ball a financial success, thereby making possible these Hebrew classes in the John Smythe School.</p>
