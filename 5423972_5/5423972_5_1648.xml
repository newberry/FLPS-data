   <p>In contrast to the Hebrew School where ninety-five per cent of the attendance are boys, the Sabbath School records show that more than ninety-five per cent are girls. In other words, the old traditions that straight Hebrew, as we might term it, is the province of a boy, and that the girl need not learn any more than merely to be able to read fairly an ordinary prayer, still prevail.</p>
   <p>We, however, took advantage of the fact that the girls come to the Sabbath School, to instruct them in Bible history, Jewish ethics, and Hebrew, in a manner which causes us to be proud of these girls when they graduate from our school after a number of years. Primarily, our object in this entire department is to create a sense of honor and loyalty for the Jew, by teaching the fine, ethical principles laid down by our great men.</p>
   <p>We have at present eight classes, one of them conducted by a former graduate <pb facs="5423972_5_1649.jpg" n="2"/>of our school, and two post Biblical history classes. The attendance averages over 200 at each session. There is a regular system of promotion leading to graduation and the graduates are encouraged to continue their studies by means of the Post Biblical History Class, which is conducted after the regular class hours.</p>
   <p>A number of the students in this class have made a record as competent school teachers and only a few days ago we held a first reunion of all of the graduates of the past four years, with a hope of interesting them in continuing their studies on a more advanced scale. We have a group who are interested in Practice Teaching and in Translation.</p>
