   <p>The People's Relief Committee tendered a banquet in honor of its national chairman, Judge Perkin of New York, Saturday evening in the Morrison Hotel (Rose room) where hundreds of friends of the People's Relief Committee assembled to listen to various committee reports and to hear Judge Perkin on "The Work of the People's Relief Committee."</p>
   <p>Despite the presence of prominent labor leaders and other great personalities, such as Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers; Sam Levin, manager of the Joint Board of the Amalgamated; Benjamin Schlessinger, manager of Forward; Mrs. Diskin and Cacier from the Women's Auxiliary of the bazaar; D. Gustor, manager of the Actors' Union of New York; Leon Hanock, of the United Hebrew Trades; Mr. Lurie, chairman of the People's Relief Committee of Chicago; Levitas, representative of the Jewish Socialist Alliance; L. Berenson, representative of the Workmen's Circle, and many other men and women of various organizations, the audience was satisfied with a detailed speech by Judge Perkin and a business speech by the chairman of the bazaar, Abraham Minkus, who dealt <pb facs="5423972_5_0492.jpg" n="2"/>with the question of the bazaar for the children of Poland and other countries, from a pure business standpoint.</p>
   <p>Mr. Minkus compared the work of the bazaar with the establishment of a corporation, and the directors as shareholders who must eliminate expenses and begin profiting as soon as the doors of the bazaar open. And in order to show that he means business, he announced that he and his partner, Mr. Katz, donate $500 as their contribution to the bazaar, and have already collected $3,000 in cash and $1,000 in merchandise.</p>
   <p>This speech made a great impression on those who were able to follow the noble example of the two partners, Mr. Minkus and Mr. Katz, and contributions of considerable sums were immediately made.</p>
   <p>The following have donated to the bazaar: Mr. Witz, $200; Mr. Lurie, chairman of the People's Relief Committee of Chicago, $200; Dr. Franklin, $200; Mr. Laskinski, $200; Peter Sussman, toastmaster of the banquet,$200;</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0493.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Fogel,$100; Mr. Waldman, $100; Ladies Auxiliary P. W. A., $25; Mrs. Minkus and Mrs. Katz, $25; Mrs. Lurie, $50; Mr. Kaplan, $50; Mr. Gordon, $25; Mr. David, $25; Mr. Miller, $25; Mr. Cacer, $25 and Mr. H. Miller, $25.</p>
   <p>Mr. H.Miller represented the cleaners and dyers who have a committee to help the bazaar and he reported that J. L. Friedman, president of the Cleaners and Dyers, has already collected $1,500 for the bazaar.</p>
   <p>S. Kaplan, of the Bialystok Verein, reported that they had already collected $1,500 for the bazaar.</p>
   <p>They have a grand total of $10,000 thus far, besides the merchandise which was collected by various committees.</p>
   <p>The banquet was not only a business gathering to accumulate money for the People's Relief. Besides the spiritual enjoyment that was derived from the speeches, those present had the pleasure of listening to two world renowned cantors, Kevartin and Rottman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0494.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The toastmaster of the evening, Peter Sussman, opened the banquet and introduced Mr. Lurie, chairman of the Chicago's People's Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feder gave a brief summary of the activities of the various bazaar committees and he stated that $15,000 will be collected before the opening of the doors of the bazaar.</p>
