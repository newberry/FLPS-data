   <p>A conference was held Wednesday night in reference to a local daily publication, and the following resolutions have been adopted:</p>
   <p>To recommend Comrade Litvak as editor of the daily paper, to the publisher of the Jewish Labor World; to inform the workers that the Daily Labor World will have its first appearance on Labor Day, Monday September 1; to raise a fund of two thousand dollars by Labor Day; to immediately send an appeal to all Workmen's Circle branches and trade unions in the country for the Daily; and to inform the Forward not to come to Chicago to publish a local newspaper; and to organize a large publishing association.</p>
   <p>It was also determined that this conference shall hold its meetings every Second and Fourth Sunday morning at 1125 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_0979.jpg" n="2"/>
