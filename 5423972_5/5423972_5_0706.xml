  <body>
   <p>Chicago has a very welcome guest in the person of the famous teacher and master, Mr. Schmoel Isaacs, of New York, father of that active Jewish Chicago community worker, Mrs. Benjamin Davis, and the late Dr. Isaacs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schmoel Hillel Isaacs, was born 88 years ago in Rutsk, Subalker County, Russia. He studied the Torah with those great scholars, Mr. Moshe Laib, of Kutno, and Mr. Yehuda Bachroch.</p>
   <p>When he was 22 years old he came to America and settled in New York. He spent most of his life there, and now he comes to Chicago.</p>
   <p>He is the author of many books that have become famous beyond the pale of Jewish Literature. His Almanac and General and Jewish Permanent Calendar were cited and explained in the Scientific American of March 7, 1892; in <pb facs="5423972_5_0707.jpg" n="2"/>the New York Sun of September 14, 1893, and in the Seminar of March 1894.</p>
   <p>Mr. Isaacs also wrote many articles for the American Jewish press as well as educational subjects for the monthly journal Torah from Zion, printed in Palestine. Many of his articles from this Palestinian organ were later published as separate pamphlets, Passover Theme, and My Twin Brother Tzeevia, being among them. His "Monthly Conceptions," pertains to the Jewish calendar. He covers the deep subject of the Rhombom in Halochus Kidush Hachudosh.</p>
   <p>Chicago's educators and writers now have the privilege of meeting personally this noted scholar. He may be visited at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Benjamin Davis, 6120 Drexel Avenue.</p>
