   <p>The closing of Bernstein's Imperial Theater last Friday was not entirely unexpected. This year, the Jewish theater business in Chicago, as is true all over America, has not been particularly good, because of the general economic crisis. Mr. Bernstein has increased the budget of the Jewish theatre to such an extent that the additional expenses cannot be met because of the competion prevailing among the theaters. He has strained all his resources to maintain this very expensive institution, but, unfortunately, he lacks the [necessary] means. He proposed to the actors that they continue the season on a co-operative basis, and offered his services, without pay, so that the eventual profit would belong entirely to the actors. The delegate of the Jewish actor's union, R. Guskin, could not accept this proposition because the "co-operative principle," in theater enterprises, is contrary to the rules of the union. The Imperial Theater was then closed, and many of the scheduled benefit performances were <pb facs="5423972_5_0107.jpg" n="2"/>transferred to Glickman's Palace Theater.
