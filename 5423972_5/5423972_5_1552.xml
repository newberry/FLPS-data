   <p>Yesterday we discussed the importance of the Jewish kindergarten, in the interest of which a movement has been started among the nationally minded, intelligent Jewish men and women of the Northwest Side. We shall now discuss in detail the closer relationship between parents and teachers that such a kindergarten will effect, as well as the desirable influence it will have on the child.</p>
   <p>Under the present system in the public schools, of which our Hebrew Schools are a poor imitation, it is impossible for the teachers to become acquainted with the parents and the home environments of each individual pupil. The older children are sent to the Hebrew school--if any concern for their Hebrew education is shown at all. The parents never visit the institution nor do they even know what the teacher looks like.</p>
   <p>According to pedagogic rules, every child needs individual attention. But this <pb facs="5423972_5_1553.jpg" n="2"/>cannot be given unless the teacher is acquainted with the parents and with the life history of the child, not only with its spiritual aspect but with its physical aspect as well.</p>
   <p>It is important to know, for instance, whether the food which the child eats is wholesome, varied, well-cooked, and digestible; whether the underclothes are changed often; whether the child takes a bath at least once a week; whether he breathes through his nose; whether he sleeps a sufficient number of hours; whether he is inclined to be diligent, etc. It is necessary to know these things and dozens of other things in order to guide the child in the right direction.</p>
   <p>But as has been stated, in the case of Hebrew schools (old-fashioned, or modern) and even in the case of public schools, the teachers do not know the parents, nor do the parents know the teachers. Usually the mother is busy with the smaller children and has no time to devote to such a luxury [as getting acquainted with the child's teacher]. The teacher, on the other hand, has too much to do as it is, is poorly paid, and, therefore, is only too glad to finish her work as soon as possible and go home.</p>
   <p>The case of a mother entering her child in a kindergarten is different however.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1554.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At this stage the child is still small and is still practically in the mother's charge. She does not send him out of her sight, but usually brings him to the kindergarten herself. The natural result is that the parent and teacher meet, and their common interest in the development of the child [is acknowledged].</p>
   <p>No thinking person will deny that to be a father and a mother is a definite life career that must be studied. The tragic part of it is, however, that men and women are often called to fill this job who have no understanding of the situation, and what's worse, who do not realize the responsibility entailed therein.</p>
   <p>Such responsibilities are divided into two classes. The first consists of physical care, such as, good food, clothing, physical exercise, and other things that have chiefly to do with the physical welfare of the child. The second class consists of the finer duties which do not lend themselves to such simple and easy explanations. The first thing to remember is that "examples are of far greater value than 'must's and 'must not's'" and "to strive for the children to be that which you want them to be". Children are great mimics, and, as the parents conduct themselves, so do the children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_5_1555.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There is probably no greater career in life than that of being a father or a mother, but to be a good father and a good mother it is necessary to devote the proper amount of time to it.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately most parents are not aware of all their duties to society. Hence their influence on the child, instead of being educationally good, is harmful.</p>
   <p>But when the naive mother will come into daily contact with experienced teachers and educators, who will, in a casual way, explain to her how adults should conduct themselves at home so that it will not be disgraceful for the child to imitate them, then the home will take on a different appearance.</p>
   <p>In a certain sense, a Jewish kindergarten will make Jewish homes that are not sufficiently Jewish or sufficiently sociable, more Jewish and more sociable.</p>
   <p>A Jewish kindergarten is also important because of the Jewish "children's world" that will be developed there. In the home there is little concern about the <pb facs="5423972_5_1556.jpg" n="5"/>child's amusement; and, as is well known, a child cannot amuse himself as well with grown folk as he can with other children. And there [in the kindergarten] the foundation of a true Jewish national life that will be an adornment and a pride to the Jewish name, will be laid.</p>
