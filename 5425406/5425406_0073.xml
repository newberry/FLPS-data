      <p>It is a well known fact that our Slavic people is the hardest to agree
with other people's opinion. no matter what question is put up. We will
stubbornly stick to our opinion. even if we perfectly understand that
such opinion is wrong.</p>
      <p>The study of our people here, in America, convinces us that a great many
changes have been made under the moon, but our character and our nature
of being stubborn remained unchanged, despite new customs, circumstances,
etc.</p>
      <p>Here is a plain illustration: Right here, in America, we have over
200,000 people of our race, but believe it or not, a group of 700 Socialists want to rule our entire population. 0f course, we will resist and
we will win our political freedom, but at the same time we are not surprised 
at all at the courage of the socialists when we see so much disagreement 
and deep misunderstanding existing among our leaders. This
<pb facs="5425406_0074.jpg" n="2"/>
disagreement has no base, and is nothing more than a result of a play of
"who will outsmart who?" But the masses must, as usual, pay for this.</p>
      <p>We are sincerely warning our leaders that it will be in their interest
as well, as it will bring lots of good to our community if they stop
harmful egoistic propaganda; otherwise the undesirable Socialists will
really gain influence among our people.</p>
