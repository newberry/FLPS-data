      <p>The Delegate Committee of the Socialist Party of Cook County, session held
June 13, 1909, at 180 S. Washington St., Chicago, Ill., endorsed the following
resolution:</p>
      <p>To the Cook County Delegate Committee, Grievance Committee Report in the case
of 10th and 11th Ward Branches of the South Slovenian organization vs. Glas
Svobode.</p>
      <p>The evidence submitted to the grievance committee is to the effect that the
paper, Glas Svobode, is not a socialist paper.</p>
      <p>Its manager and owner, Martin Konda, admitted that it is an independent and free
thought advocate, and that he is not a member of the socialist party.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, as said, Glas Svobode has been listed by other well established
party organs, and also supported by and through party commendation, and in view
of the above unquestioned evidence, we, the Grievance Committee, find that said
paper is not a socialist paper in the sense that other papers of the Socialist
Party are (although it has in the past shown an apparent friendship and support
<pb facs="5425406_0153.jpg" n="2"/>
to the Socialist Party). We, therefore, recommend that the county secretary be
instructed to send a copy of this resolution to the national secretary of the
Socialist Party, who will submit it to the socialist press.</p>
      <p>Fraternally submitted,</p>
      <p>L. W. Hardy, J. N. Born, A. Fishman. A. A. Patterson, Jas. P. Larsen, Committee.</p>
      <p>Indorsed and accepted by the Delegate Committee, Socialist Party of Cook County,
session held June 13, 1909.</p>
      <p>G. T. Fraenckel, Sec'y.</p>
