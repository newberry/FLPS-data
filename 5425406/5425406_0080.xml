      <p>The Jugoslav Socialist Federation had its beginning in 1900, when the first socialist 
branch of Slovene workers was organized in Chicago. Its members took the
leading part in establishing a corporation, starting with a paper, which was
friendly to the Socialist movement and mainly educational in purpose.</p>
      <p>The task for them at the time was too heavy and the result therefore a failure.
The branch was dissolved for two years. However, in 1903 the branch was restored
and has been active ever since. With the appearance of Proletarec in 1906 and
even before, because of the help of the weekly, Clas Svobade, other branches
sprung up in various Slovene settlements.</p>
      <p>In 1906 and 1907 advanced workers of the Croat and Serb nationalities organized
themselves in the Socialist branches. In December 1909 a preparatory conference
was held in Chicago for the purpose of establishing a Jugoslav Socialist Federation.
All Jugoslav nationalities were represented (Slovene, Croat, Serb, and Bulgarian).
<pb facs="5425406_0081.jpg" n="2"/>
The first convention was held July 4 and 5, 1910 in Chicago, at which time the
Federation was born.</p>
      <p>Mahlone Barnes represented the Socialist Party at this conference.</p>
      <p>The growth of the Federation after its inception was very fast. During and after
the war, however. many critica1 situations occurred. Our membership dwindled,
branches disappeared, and two publications were lost. One, because it changed to
a communistic paper, and the other was discontinued. Proletarec remained; advancing
the cause, represented by the Federation.</p>
      <p>It survived those stormy days and continued its struggle in the interest of the
workers. Its eighth regular convention will be held in Detroit, Michigan, May 30
being the opening date. It will be in session three days.</p>
      <p>The future looks bright, because it belongs to the Socialist movement and Socialism.</p>
