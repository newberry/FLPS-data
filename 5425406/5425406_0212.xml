      <p>The other day Martin Zeleznikar, president of the Slovenian National
Benefit Society, issued a certain statement which is not as correct as it
should be.</p>
      <p>He plainly announced that their organization is the biggest of its kind
in this country. We are not interested in his opinion nor jealous of their
organization's business or growth, but what really interests us and brought
his statement to our attention is his accusation of our fanaticism, as well
as his advice not to believe in the Roman God. We are not against religious
tolerance because, living in this free country, we are used to that, but
a broadcast of this nature coming from a person of the Catholic faith, is
really surprising. Furthermore, we believe in everybody's liberty to
believe or not to believe in certain doctrines, and cannot approve Mr.
Zeleznikar's unholy propaganda, just to reject religion or faith in God
as something worthless and unnecessary for the life of our Slovene people.</p>
      <pb facs="5425406_0213.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>Mr. Zeleznikar and his followers from the Slovenian National Benefit Society
may believe that their society is really as big as the whole world, but this
opinion does not give them right to muscle into other people's faith, nor
have they the authority to question the masses's belief in God. Being
members or even leaders of a big national organization does not make them
big enough to absorb or fully understand religious ideals and doctrines.</p>
      <p>Amerikanski Slovenec and its followers will guard their unbroken faith
and will fight for their religious ideas to the last limit.</p>
