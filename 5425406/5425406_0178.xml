      <p>It has been said quite often that Pioneer Lodge No. 559, S.N.P.J., (Slovenia
National Benefit Society) originated Nov. 13, 1925. The charter bears the inscription 
of twenty young men and women who gathered on that day to plant the
seed which has flourished and blossomed into success in the field of activities
and membership.</p>
      <p>Nature has planted us amidst a pleasing environment and atmosphere, in which we
have found sparkling life and social activities aplenty. Good will and contentment 
has reigned with us always, and what we did not inherit we procured for ourselves.</p>
      <p>The whole wide world should know that the Pioneers were the first English speaking 
fraternal lodge of any Jugoslav fraternal society in the world. Is this
boasting? Well, not exactly; but we wish to bring out the importance and significance 
of - "the first in the entire world". That phrase has probably more
meaning than any consideration you have ever given it. Have not the Pioneers
reason to feel proud? We can safely say that our relations with the parent organization 
have always been most respectful, and as we have often said, it is
their existence and their comfort which has necessitated such actions as we have
undertaken. A bright and unsurpassed future can be visualized. We can see the
Pioneer Lodge of 1942, the largest of any lodge under the fold of the Slovenska

Narodna Potporna Jednota. Its membership must reach one thousand. Do you know 
why this is possible? Because we have adopted a broadminded program which will
reach everyone; because of our willingness to cooperate to the fullest extent; 
and because we have the spirit and the knowledge of our power. We shall carry 
on until we reach our goal.</p>
      <p>We all realize the importance of the struggle, likewise its handicaps; but by
turning every opportunity into a reality and favoring those who labor to make
our very existence easier, we shall eventually surpass our prediction.</p>
