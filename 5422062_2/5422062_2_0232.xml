   <p>Because of the proximity of the date set for the election all political centers have been active in winding up the campaign.</p>
   <p>At the offices of the Greek-American regular Democratic organization, workers were busily rushing through the final details of the campaign. Everybody has been working very late to finish the pre-election business. Among the many victims of overwork in this most important political crisis, in which the future of the country is at stake, is the "flier" of Mr. George Laskaris, publisher-editor of Proodos, that is, his dilapidated automobile, which after many year's use and abuse will soon go for a one way ride to the junk-shop.</p>
   <p>Two or three days ago Messrs. George Kyriakopoulos, John Prassas, Demetrios Gerouies, George Laskaris, and others were trying to arrive on time at a political meeting in this vehicle and Mr. Kyriakopoulos became so much disgusted that he offered to bet that he could reach the destination sooner by <pb facs="5422062_2_0233.jpg" n="2"/>walking. So he got out and walked to the meeting. Needless to say, he won the bet, arriving before the others.</p>
   <p>We beg to announce, and we ask you to keep it secret, that the large sign, one of the remains of the Proodos contest, which was hanging over the door of the office has fallen down, luckily not on the publisher-editor's head. So no damage resulted from the accident.</p>
