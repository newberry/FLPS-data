  <body>
   <p>The appointment of Attorney G. A. Kyriakopoulos as an assistant City Prosecutor was announced by City Prosecutor Rosinia.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kyriakopoulos, who lives at 4048 North Major Avenue, will be assigned to the Boy's Court where he worked under the Dever administration. He served as an assistant State's Attorney in 1918.</p>
   <p>(Tribune, May 24, 1931)</p>
   <p>In discussing Mr. Kyriakopoulos' appointment, some of the Greek-American citizens seem to think that it is attributed to his personality and splendid record made in the same office during Dever's administration.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0559.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some feel that it is due to his leadership as the spokesman of the Greek-Democratic Club of Cook County, and others feel that it is both ability and leadership. All of his Democratic friends are perfectly satisfied with the appointment which is well done and no doubt will mark a record of success during Mr. Kyriakopoulos' term of office.</p>
   <p>More power to you, George.</p>
