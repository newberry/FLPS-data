   <p>Among the other types of Greek stores in the old Greek neighborhood of Halsted Street--which, by the way, was, at one time, the largest Greek community in America--there are four noteworthy confectionary shops. Their names are typically Greek and are familiar to nearly all the Hellenes of the Middle West: the "Syros," "Phoenix," "Athenian," and "Smyrna". The owners of these four shops have won the faith and respect of their many patrons through conscientious service and exemplary conduct. Their candies and pastries play important roles in the Greek family today. They are a "sweet" influence in favor of the maintenance of Greek cooking and eating habits.</p>
   <p>We are not, therefore, worried concerning their value to the community. What interests us is how they may increase the remuneration which they receive from the community which they have so unselfishly served. Naturally, stores selling the niceties of life have suffered from the effects of the depression more than others. What we want to do is to bring the profits of our confectioners up to <pb facs="5422062_2_1407.jpg" n="2"/>the level of those of other merchants.</p>
   <p>The sum total paid by the four shops for a year's rental amounts to $4,080; electricity and gas cost $1,365 annually; telephones cost $240 annually; and $900 is spent annually on miscellaneous items such as licenses, permits, repairs, replacements, etc. Therefore, the sum total of their operating costs is $6,385 per year.</p>
   <p>Now, if all of these four separate establishments were united into one large firm its operating expense would probably drop to the comparatively small sum of $2,500. In other words, a saving of $3,885 would be immediately achieved. This additional fund would enable the firm to pay a decent wage to every employee and provide the four partners with a sizeable increase in weekly salary. Under the present system all this is impossible, and the owner usually works for nothing.</p>
   <p>This is not the entire story. Expenditure of capital not only would be <pb facs="5422062_2_1408.jpg" n="3"/>lessened, but purchasing costs would be greatly reduced. Large amounts of products cost, proportionately, many times less than small amounts of the same.</p>
   <p>Our respected confectioners must realize the truth of the above assertions. They must examine them with the sound economic part of their mind and not with the egoistic part. All the minor difficulties of such an arrangement could be easily smoothed out. We want an acceptance of the principle which has been used so successfully by American businessmen.</p>
