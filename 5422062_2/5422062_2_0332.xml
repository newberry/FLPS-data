   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>After giving to the candidates of the two leading parties an opportunity to present their respective qualifications for office, and after having duly weighed and considered their respective claims for election, the Achaian League presents to its members and their friends the following recommendations:</p>
   <p>For President of the United States we strongly urge the re-election of Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>During the past nearly four years, President Wilson has demonstrated conclusively that he is the friend of the people who have to work to live.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0333.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He gave to all of the Government employees an eight-hour day; he gave to the railroad men an eight hour day; he increased the pensions of the old soldiers; he created an income tax law to compel the rich to pay a tax on their large incomes and thus bear their share of the cost of government, thereby relieving the poorer people from an unjust burden; he put an end to child labor by making it unlawful to make little children, both boys and girls, work in mines and mills and factories, thus giving them an opportunity to grow up healthy and to go to school. He established Federal Reserve Banks so that the moneyed interests could no longer corner all the money and bring on panics and hard times; he established Farmers Loan Banks, so that the farmer could borrow money at home to move his crops without being dependent on the big bankers in New York. He guided his country skillfully through all the complications caused by the war in Europe and the revolution in Mexico, and by his patience and wisdom has kept this country from the bloodshed, cost and horrors of War, so that the men of America are today at work instead of dying in the trenches and the American homes are happy and prosperous.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0334.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We find the Republican candidate, Mr. Hughes, while he was Governor of New York State, opposed an income tax law, vetoed a bill giving to women school teachers equal pay with the men school teachers, vetoed a two cent railroad fare bill, vetoed a five cent street car bill to Coney Island (the Company was charging 10 cents each way, and he let them continue to charge it) and generally indicated very clearly that he was not in sympathy with the working classes; we feel that Mr. Hughes would be a dangerous man to place in the White House, particularly as he has in his public speeches stated that had he been President instead of Wilson he would have gone to War.</p>
   <p>In order that President Wilson may continue in his work for the people, it is necessary that he have a Democratic Congress. Hence, we urge you to vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress in your District.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0335.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>James McAndrews, Congressman for the Sixth District, should be re-elected, as he is the type of man America needs in Congress. The work of Congressman McAndrews shows the caliber of men the Democrats send to Washington to help the President. Vote for the Democrat in your District.</p>
   <p>For Governor of the State of Illinois, we endorse the present Governor, Edward F. Dunne. His opponent on the Republican ticket represents the money interests and would be an unsafe man to place in power, unsafe for the best interests of the laboring and toiling masses of the people.</p>
   <p>We also endorse Attorney General P. J. Lucey, for re-election because of his excellent management of his department during the past four years.</p>
   <p>For State's Attorney we recommend Maclay Hoyne, who has in the past four years fearlessly attacked crime and criminals, not only the common burglars <pb facs="5422062_2_0336.jpg" n="5"/>and highwaymen, but grafters and crooks in all walks of life, even daring to expose the police and the City Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoyne should be returned to office so that he can complete the work he has begun.</p>
   <p>Those of you who may have had to "give up" to policemen, "inspectors" and other grafters appreciate what it means to have a State's Attorney who can and does prosecute these crooks. Vote for Hoyne.</p>
   <p>For the Sanitary District we unhesitatingly recommend Thomas M. Sullivan for President and Trustee. During six years of service as Trustee of the Sanitary District, Mr. Sullivan has done much for the public good, personally and officially. Vote for him.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0337.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Most of the Democratic candidates for State, County and Judicial positions have already served the public, have made excellent records, and we can conscientiously recommend them for re-election.</p>
   <p>We suggest that you place an "X" in the circle at the top of the Democratic column, and thus insure having your vote counted for the men we have endorsed.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Attest:</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis</p>
   <p>Sec'y</p>
   <p>The Achaian League.</p>
  </body>
