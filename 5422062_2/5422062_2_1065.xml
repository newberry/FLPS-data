   <p>Will the Government, through measures taken, succeed in restoring economic equilibrium in the country?</p>
   <p>This is a great question that everyone ponders over, the answer to which, however, is very difficult, because of there being no way to surety; all we have so far seem to be guesses and possibilities.</p>
   <p>The opponents of President Roosevelt foresee, with certainty, the failure of President Roosevelt's plans, but that is a partial opinion and has no bearing on the question.</p>
   <p>But there are many others who consider the Government measures as being against the economic life of the country, as foreign to the standards of the United States, and extremely radical.... Those who think and criticize in this fashion are extremely conservative and believe that capital only should rule the country, and that the interests of the country is the serving, by any means, the capitalistic interests.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But, are the measures taken by the government truly socialistic, and is its policy socialistic and communist and the danger they foretell justified? To get an understanding as to how much soundness there is in the fears of the conservatives, we must, above all, keep in mind that America was ever the capitalistic country, par excellence, where Capital ruled, and where the different administrations in power served only the interests of the Capitalists.</p>
   <p>It is known, on the other hand, that "Wall Street" was what ruled all America, and that the Government and Congress were always under the influence of "Wall Street". This influence became so strong that it has resolved itself into a political doctrine which is that the supporting of the interests of Capital was the purpose of the State, and that the progress and prosperity of the American people was based on Capital's might.</p>
   <p>Those are, mainly, the reasons that have made America the most capitalistic country in the world, and Capital has had all the freedom of action, which, admitedly, has advanced the country by leaps and bounds in a comparatively short time.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1067.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The only difference was that this dictatorial action of Capital was not apparent to the many, because the movement was unexploited and capital had engaged itself in great enterprises so that the majority had innumerable opportunities for work and prosperity. All industrial workers were progressing and enriching themselves in America.....</p>
   <p>In this great activity, during which whole fortunes were made from nothing, and small business men and laborers were, as if by magic, acquiring great fortunes; and where great tracts of unpopulated wilderness were, as if by a miracle, transformed into great cities and industrial centers; and where a few shares of previously unknown corporations, bought for a few cents, transformed themselves into precious bonds enriching their owners, and where laborers were getting high wages and could save great sums of money. In this giddy whirl, nobody, of course, thought, or even imagined, that much would be destroyed; that the beautiful and magnificent dreams would be crumbled into ruins by a blow from the big capitalists; that the fancied riches of the many would return again to the hands of those who "allowed the many to believe for a moment, that they had the right to acquire prosperity."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1068.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Consequently, it is quite natural, that the moment the Government steps in to get the country out of the economic chaos in which it finds itself, and to take measures against the dictatorship of Capital the plutocrats of the country to holler "Wolf", calling the Government communistic, and announcing that it is introducing new methods into the administration which hinder them. Why are these selfish Capitalists with their Civic Liberty league shaking? Are they justified in accusing the Government and President Roosevelt as communistic and the prosecutor of Capital?</p>
   <p>This question we will deal with in our next issue.</p>
