   <p>Greeks of America have heard the bugle calling all brave men to the Blue and White [Greek Flag]. Never before has our motherland been in such a predicament. No more favorable opportunity to realize their age-old hopes of a greater Greece--a greater Greece with Byzantium as its capital--has ever presented itself to the Greek patriots.</p>
   <p>The maniacal Turks have committed veritable suicide by entering the World War. The Bulgarians are likewise doomed to destruction for the same reason. These barbarous nations will be judged and condemned by all civilized nations of the world. They, and others like them, will receive their death warrant from the Allied forces.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0922.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The destruction of these evil forces will have results that are of particular interest to Greek people. The riches, the fields, the cities, and the other possessions of these doomed countries will be an inheritance for some other country: that country can be no other than our own beloved Hellas.</p>
   <p>A resume of some of the spoils of the war will prove our claim: there is Thrace, which includes Constantinople and Adrianople; and there is....Smyrna, Prousan, and Trapezounta. These are going to be regained for Greece by the daring Constantine and his courageous troops. These places are the rightful inheritance of the enslaved Greeks. They are the lands which our brave ancestors owned and which have been stolen from us.</p>
   <p>Hellenes, our duty is clear! Our honor is at stake! The voices of our dead rise from the grave and ring like a clarion call in our ears. Our murdered sisters and mothers must be avenged! We must heed the commands of our soldier-king! If we do not answer now we must forever remain silent.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0923.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Some divine form of justice has helped our cause by encouraging the Turks and Bulgarians to enter the war. Their destruction is inevitable. At the head of the Greek army is Constantine, a descendant of Constantine of Dragatsi who, while fighting ferociously, was killed in battle in 1453.</p>
   <p>A holy prophet said at that time, "A Constantine has fallen, but another Constantine shall be born to take his place." Does any Greek fail to believe that our king is this prophesied Constantine, who has been sent to conquer our ancestral foes?</p>
   <p>Greeks of America, let us thank God that the hour has come. However, let us not confine ourselves to prayers. Prayers are not very effective in the winning of wars. Action is imperative if the glory of Greece is to be restored forever!</p>
