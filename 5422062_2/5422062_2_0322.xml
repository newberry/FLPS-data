   <p>I read with a great deal of interest your article in the February 16 issue of the Greek Daily entitled, "American Politics and the Greeks."</p>
   <p>While, in the main, your article is justified, I beg leave to disagree with you in that you state: there has been no political activity on the part of the Greek people. You evidently have overlooked the fact that since September 9, 1910, there has been in existence an organization which has been very active, not only during campaigns, but every day, in assisting our people to become naturalized and urging them to take a more active part in all political questions. The first open meeting of this organization was held in Hull House on October 6, 1910, at which meeting appeared, among others, Michael Zimer, then a candidate for Sheriff on the Democratic <pb facs="5422062_2_0323.jpg" n="2"/>ticket; Robert M. Sweitzer, candidate for County Clerk; Peter Bartzen, candidate for President of the County Board and John E. Owens, candidate for County Judge, all of whom were successful at the election. Carter H. Harrison was also present at that meeting, as was George F. Mulligan, a prominent Democratic of this city.</p>
   <p>In 1912, during the mayorality campaign, several meetings were held under the auspices of this organization which had then espoused the cause of Carter H. Harrison. In 1912, this organization endorsed and supported the entire Democratic ticket from the President down to the candidates for Municipal Court judges.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0324.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In 1914, this organization supported Roger C. Sullivan, then Democratic candidate for United States Senator and helped in a material measure during the primary campaign and was of immense value on election day.</p>
   <p>In 1915, Robert M. Sweitzer was endorsed in preference to Carter H. Harrison at the primary and this organization was very active during the campaign preceding the election.</p>
   <p>The same is true of 1916, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921 and 1922. The members have always been active and faithful to the principles of the organization and have been great advocates of the rights of the people, the "Hellenes."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0325.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In 1920, the Achaian League was successful in securing a place on the Democratic slate for one of its members for Judge of the Municipal Court, and at the primary this candidate received more votes than all of his five opponents put together, but unfortunately it was a Republican year and he was beaten along with the rest of the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>All of these facts are supported by written documents in the archives of this organization, conclusively proving that we have been active and that we have been a factor not only in politics, but during other times of stress, such as the attempt of the Bulgarians in 1914 to besmirch the character of the Greek army and the attempt of certain selfseekers to keep the young Greeks out of the United States Army during the World War.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0326.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>So, when you state that we have achieved nothing politically, you are overlooking the facts hereinabove mentioned. This same organization, the Achaian League, is now active in the campaign and is supporting, in conjunction with other prominent Democrats of Hellenic descent, Judge William E. Dever for Mayor of Chicago and is a factor not only in the local political situation, but has been of great assistance to the Greek voters during every election since its organization by advising them as to the qualifications of the different candidates seeking office.</p>
   <p>This organization is gratified to learn of the proposed organization of a Republican Club by American citizens of Greek descent, but we desire to have you remember that we are and have been in the field for a long time and intend to remain just as active as we have been in the past.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0327.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The war has increased the number of American citizens through induction or enlistment of a large number of our people into the army of the United States and those citizens, above all others have the right, by reason of their service to be the political leaders of our people instead of those who, though healthy and able-bodied, remained at home. The attempt on the part of professional politicians, who form, or claim to form, political organizations immediately preceding elections to gain recognition, will fail as any mushroom organization should fail. But the Achaian League, which is the only real and substantial political organization, made up entirely of citizens of Hellenic descent, will continue to render service to our people, to the Democratic party and to the Government of the United States of America as it has in the past thirteen years......</p>
