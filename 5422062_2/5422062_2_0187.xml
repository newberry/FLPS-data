   <p>Mr. William Howard Taft, the new President of this great country for the period 1908-1912, was given an ovation by the entire American nation, from former President Theodore Roosevelt to the humblest worker and farmer. The great majority of the people, regardless of former party allegiance, are filled with new hope for a better future and for continued progress in the administration of the affairs of the United States. The people of this country are especially hopeful at this time, because they are very eager to see some encouraging and definite improvement in the business, industrial, financial, and agricultural life of the nation. The general and severe nationwide economic crisis and depression which we have been experiencing for a year gives the people the right to have some change in government and a definite economic recovery.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago as well as its official public public organ, The Greek <pb facs="5422062_2_0188.jpg" n="2"/>Star, share the victorious triumph on the occasion of Mr. Taft's election to the highest public office in the land. The Republican as well as other American parties and newspapers have not failed to notice the support which The Greek Star gave in the recent presidential campaign. This newspaper is really proud of having contributed its share to the Republican party's brilliant victory in the recent election.</p>
   <p>We now wish to inform the public, and it will undoubtedly please all Greeks to hear, that the political support rendered the Republican party by the Greek people has been promptly and very cordially acknowledged by the Republican National Committee and by its official and distinguished leader, Mr. William Howard Taft.</p>
   <p>This official recognition of the important services and consistent support which The Greek Star and the Greeks of Chicago have given to the majority party of the United States is very encouraging indeed; because, it shows that the political leaders of America respect and think very highly of the Greek <pb facs="5422062_2_0189.jpg" n="3"/>immigrant group in the United States. This should be expected, however, for the simple reason that our organized Greek-American political organizations command the respect of those who are soliciting the organized support of a huge immigrant bloc of voters such as the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We must feel very proud to know that in his letter of acknowledgment to The Greek Star and to the Greek people of Chicago indirectly, President-elect Mr. William H. Taft pays tribute to the wonderful work which the Greek people are doing to enhance the welfare and interests of not only the Republican party, but of the United States as a whole.</p>
   <p>Below, we publish a photocopy of Mr. Taft's letter to Mr. Peter S. Lambros, proprietor and editor of The Greek Star.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0190.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"William Howard Taft</p>
   <p>"Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
   <p>"Hot Springs, Virginia</p>
   <p>July 8, 1908</p>
   <p>"Mr. Peter S. Lambros</p>
   <p>Proprietor and Editor,</p>
   <p>The Greek Star</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>"My dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of July 3, to thank you for your kind words of congratulation, and for sending me the clipping from your paper, The Greek Star.</p>
   <p>"I note what you say concerning the Greek vote in this country and shall take pleasure in turning your letter over to the Chairman of the National <pb facs="5422062_2_0191.jpg" n="5"/>Committee.</p>
   <p>"Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>"William Howard Taft."</p>
   <p>In a later issue The Greek Star will have the opportunity to publish a few more letters which were received from Mr. Taft and from the Republican National Committee acknowledging the contributions and support which the Greek people of the United States as well as of Chicago gave the Republican party.</p>
