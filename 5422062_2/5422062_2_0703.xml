   <p>This is the eulogy of praise which was heard on all sides for the Greek people of Chicago. The reason for this praise is the proud and distinguished showing that the Chicago Greeks made in the nationwide Liberty Loan drive. The Greeks led all the other nationalities of Chicago in the purchase of Liberty bonds. According to official figures, the average contribution of the members of our Greek colony was $167 per person, while the average contribution of other nationalities varied from ten to fifty dollars per person.</p>
   <p>While the average Greek was expected to buy one one-hundred-dollar bond, he actually bought bonds to the amount of one hundred and sixty-seven dollars. In other words, he loaned sixty-seven dollars more than his share. We do not think, however, that praise should be given only to our local Greek colony, for we firmly believe that the Greeks of the entire North American <pb facs="5422062_2_0704.jpg" n="2"/>continent have given the same evidence of reliability and patriotism. They have made their patriotism clear beyond any doubt; they have shown to the Americans and other nationalities the superior qualities which their national history has so often demonstrated.</p>
   <p>The entire Chicago press grasped the opportunity to give praise by writing hymns and paeans on the patriotism and the spirit of co-operation with which the Greek element hastened to subscribe to the Third Liberty Loan, thus supporting a cause, the success of which will greatly benefit Greece.</p>
   <p>One can with full conviction say that no Greek in Chicago failed to purchase Liberty Loan bonds. Even some of our women invested in them, as did many well-to-do, kind, and provident parents, who bought one, two, or even more bonds in the names of their children. By our attitude and conduct in this drive we have risen high in the esteem of the American people of Chicago; we have been pardoned for foolish and evil deeds in which we have indulged during our stay in America, deeds for which our ignorance and backwardness must be held responsible.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0705.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>By participating so actively in this noble task the Greeks here are the forgers of closer ties between the American and Greek peoples. They have so pleased the American people and the President of the United States that the latter, through his representative, the American Minister in Greece, stated that every possible moral and material help would be offered Greece by the United States. The Greek immigrant of Chicago and America has invested his money in the safest and most profitable manner, while, at the same time, he has won the undivided sympathy and respect of the business world, by the support of which he prospers, and the admiration and esteem of American industry, in the factories of which he works.</p>
   <p>That we may not be thought selfish or self-admiring we reprint an editorial from one of the prominent newspapers in Chicago, the Journal, in which the lofty patriotic sentiments and the noble qualities of the Greek people of Chicago are highly extolled.</p>
   <p>The article reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The alien residents of Chicago have done remarkably well in subscribing to <pb facs="5422062_2_0706.jpg" n="4"/>the Third Liberty Loan. We are now confident that they will do even better before the drive comes to an end. It is difficult to give the numbers of the various nationality groups participating in the nationwide campaign, since Bohemia, Poland, Lithuania, the Slavic peoples of Southeastern Europe, and many others are not recognized as nations. The following list of three European nationalities offers some interesting results:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>"Nationality</cell>
     <cell>Numbers</cell>
     <cell>Loaned in dollars</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>"Germans</cell>
     <cell>182,281</cell>
     <cell>2,106,750</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>"Italians</cell>
     <cell>45,169</cell>
     <cell>1,280,000</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>"Greeks</cell>
     <cell>6,564</cell>
     <cell>1,100,000</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>"In other words, the Germans of Chicago subscribed for the amount of $11.57 per capita; the Italians, for $28.44; and the Greeks, for $167.83.</p>
   <p>"There are two important reasons why the Greeks should take the lead. First, <pb facs="5422062_2_0707.jpg" n="5"/>the fact that, in comparison with the other nationalities, there are more men among them; second, their exceptional business ability. They are also worthy of notice for their genuine patriotism, their superb fighting qualities, and their love of philosophical contemplation and intellectual pursuits.</p>
   <p>"Such were the factors and advantages that molded and steeled their nation, which, although subjected to Ottoman tyranny and suppression for almost four centuries, was always and continues to be to this day the most enlightened and the most prosperous nation in the Balkan peninsula. This is the reason why their record in the Liberty Loan drive is unsurpassed."</p>
   <p>After this what Greek will not be proud and will not rejoice? There arises this question, however: Why do we not progress and prosper as a national political entity, while, as individuals, we are in the forefront? It is because a few despicable and corrupt characters are sowing the seeds of dissension, disobedience, and hate. It is because we lack the ability to work systematically; we lack the moral power to accept and espouse logical and beneficial systems.</p>
