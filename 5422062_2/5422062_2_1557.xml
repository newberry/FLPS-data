   <p>p. 6.- I have visited the pie factory of the Greek corporation, Chicago Pie Co., at West 24th and Congress Streets. The Chicago Pie Company owns the factory building whose architecture is modern and equipped up-to-date with the latest models in machinery. It is one of the best bakeries of its kind, in which about 100 men and women work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karalis, having showed me the plant, started giving me his opinion of Greeks in America.</p>

Most of the minority deal with concerns which are run by people of nationalities other than Greek. We do not resent this because we realize that it is necessary to deal with these others on account of business interests.</p>
