   <p>I am again taking the opportunity to stress to all Greek-American citizens in Illinois the importance of the coming primary elections, in which the voters will select the men best qualified for the most important offices in this State. I have considered the interests and welfare of my people above my personal friendship with many candidates, in order to indorse only those whom I consider the best suited and qualified.</p>
   <p>In my judgment such a man is the Hon. Len Small, twice Governor of the sovereign State of Illinois. He has served faithfully and efficiently in fulfilling the duties of his office, and by so doing, brought our State into an era of prosperity which lasted for eight years.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0101.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To improve present conditions in our State, to free us from heavy taxation, from graft and scandal, we must nominate a man whose past record shows him to be capable of restoring prosperity to our State, and of wiping out the terrible waste and extravagance which is rapidly putting us into a still deeper hole. He is a man who has fought for you before and will fight for you again.</p>
   <p>He stands for a program of improvement which is unquestionably second to none. In this program, he pledges himself to repeal the Sales Tax, that most rotten of all taxes ever imposed upon a state by any administration. It has encouraged graft and corruption and has failed to fulfill the purpose for which it was created.</p>
   <p>It has forced our business people to become the collectors of this abnoxious tax, amounting to about one hundred million dollars per year, which goes only to fill the pockets of a few. It has added a heavy burden upon <pb facs="5422062_2_0102.jpg" n="3"/>every man, woman and child, and you and I know that it has given nothing but humiliation to those poor unfortunates among our people who really need relief.</p>
   <p>Len Small further pledges himself to the equal distribution of relief or employment to the needy, regardless of party politics. He stands for the removal of politics from relief, and relief from politics. He stands for a complete and better road system in Illinois, which means more business for our people; and for the payment of a fairer old age pension, suited to each individual.</p>
   <p>I feel that it is a duty to ourselves to go to the polls with all our friends and acquaintances and do our utmost to secure the nomination of Len Small for Governor.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0103.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>I wish to call your attention to the candidacy of William E. Hull, who is a candidate for the United States Senate. He has made for himself an enviable record as congressman, for five consecutive terms, representing the people of Illinois in Washington.</p>
   <p>During this time he sponsored and put through some of the finest legislation. You and I know this to have been highly beneficial to this State. He sponsored the Hull Deep Water Act which opened a water route between Lake Michigan and the South.</p>
   <p>As a business man, administrator and executive, he is unsurpassed. Until a month ago, when he became a candidate for the U. S. Senate, he headed the gigantic Hiram Walker Distillery, which recently put up a ten million dollar plant in Peoria.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0104.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>While in Washington, he fought against the League of Nations, the World Court, and all foreign entanglement. He stands for protection of the American business man and the American working man, by fighting for a tariff which gives them that protection. He is openly against the terrific spending of the people's money in Washington, and favors Federal economy to reduce the cost of living. He is also against interference with business by the Government. He endorses Thomas V. Sullivan as Attorney General because of his many years good record.</p>
   <p>In closing, I wish to call your attention again to the merits of the candidates whom I have just endorsed, and appeal to you to give them all possible support.</p>
   <p>Before the election, I shall discuss with you certain actions of the present administration which have worked terrible hardships upon our Greek business people.</p>
