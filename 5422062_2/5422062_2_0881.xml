   <p>Twenty-five hundred patriotic men have rushed to offer their strength and their lives for the defense of Greece. They appeared at....and announced their determination to return to Greece.</p>
   <p>The consulate staff has been kept busy answering questions and explaining military procedures.....Many of the applicants are veterans of the last two wars of Greece; and on their faces is pictured their great joy for this opportunity to fight once again for their beloved Hellas. They are anxious to pit their mettle against the Turko-Bulgarians once again; hoping to complete the deed so well begun by the great Koumbaros. [great Greek fighter].</p>
   <p>They worry only about the financial situation. Many of them have passed through an economic crisis and will not have enough money to secure passage. They are hoping that the Greek government will arrange for their passage on a Greek liner.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0882.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bravo! to these brave patriots. May they help make the dreams of Greece become realities. We, in Chicago, will be praying for them.</p>
