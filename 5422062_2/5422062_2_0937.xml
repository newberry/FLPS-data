   <p>To the Members of the Class of 1911,</p>
   <p>Of the John Marshall Law School:</p>
   <p>Mr. Emmanuel Colliopoulos, a fellow member of the class of 1911, has returned to this country after serving with distinction under the flag of Hellas in the late Balkan Wars.</p>
   <p>In January, 1913, Mr. Colliopoulos enlisted in the Hellenic Army as a Lieutenant and by dint of merit obtained a promotion to Captaincy. The company led by Captain Colliopoulos was the first to enter the City of Janina after the successful attack on that place (then in possession of the Turks), on the night of the nineteenth of March, 1913.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0938.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thus upon an American Law Student, whose diligence, undismayed by handicaps which to anyone less courageous would have been insurmountable, has carried him through the curricula of two Chicago Law Schools, rests the honor of being the first Hellenic Soldier to enter the prized City of Janina, since its capture from the Greeks by the Turks, centuries ago. Not less distinguished was the manner in which Captain Colliopoulos discharged his duties during the subsequent war with the Bulgars.</p>
   <p>The Balkan Wars and the conflicts which grew out of them have altered the map of this planet. Much has been written of them, much imagined, much surmised. Some of the information concerning them which has been accessible to the general public is true, some is false - how much is not to be determined by anyone whose knowledge concerning the subject is derivative and dependent upon things over which he has no control.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0939.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Several members of the class of 1911 thought it worthy of consideration to invite Mr. Colliopoulos to address his fellow classmates and thus provide them with reliable first hand information upon a subject upon which everyone speaks a great deal and of which everyone can, with accuracy, know but little. Mr. Colliopoulos has consented.</p>
   <p>At 6:30 P.M. January 27, 1914, the members of the 1911 Class of the John Marshall Law School will assemble at the Boston Oyster House to greet Mr. Colliopoulos and be informed by him reliably on this subject which is of no little importance. It is intended that the evening shall in all respects be made both profitable and enjoyable. Your presence is desired and requested.</p>
   <p>Committee</p>
   <p>A. J. Resa</p>
   <p>S. C. Brown</p>
   <p>B. Blumenthal</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis.</p>
