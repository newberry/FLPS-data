   <p>All of us who came from the sunny shores of Greece to settle in this blessed country have, by our conduct during the war, demonstrated that the sons of the classic mother of democracy are among the best citizens of the modern champion of democracy. Am I not justified, when looking back upon the war record of my fellow countrymen, in believing that Greek-Americans will again distinguish themselves among all citizens of foreign descent by their subscriptions to the Victory Liberty Loan?</p>
   <p>We have given more than seventy thousand of our men to the American army and navy. We felt particularly proud when our keen eyes discovered the names of Greek heroes in the roll of honor--tens of them daily. We subscribed more then thirty-five millions of dollars to the Liberty <pb facs="5422062_2_0637.jpg" n="2"/>Loans. We did everything in our power to prove that we are true to the noble traditions of our race. We gave our heartiest support to the United States Government in its efforts to vindicate the rights of this country and to emancipate the world from the evils of militarism.</p>
   <p>Let us now confirm this splendid record by subscribing to the limit of our resources to the Victory Loan. This is the final test of our patriotism. We will again buy all the bonds that we can, in order to show our adopted country that we are worthy of its generous hospitality and of the opportunities which its liberal laws have kept open to us as well as to native-born citizens. No matter how extensively we participate in the Loans, no matter how many new proofs of our devotion to this country we add to those already accumulated, we will always be the debtor and America will be the creditor.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0638.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is not our personal welfare alone that we owe to America. We are indebted to her--even though we have gladly contributed our share of the sacrifices to the glorious victory--for the overthrow of tyranny throughout the world and particularly in the Near East. Millions of our brothers in Turkey as well as in Bulgaria are awaiting the verdict of the Peace Conference for their liberation, as a result of the gallant efforts made by America in behalf of universal justice and freedom.</p>
   <p>To America, as an adopted country which has unreservedly extended to us all the benefits enjoyed by its native-born citizens, and as a benefactor of the Hellenic race, we owe the same wholehearted co-operation in the work of reconstruction--in behalf of which the Victory Loan is issued--which we offered during the war for the destruction of militarism.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that, while we were lending our money to the American Government in the previous loan campaigns for the prosecution of the <pb facs="5422062_2_0639.jpg" n="4"/>war, the American Government was supporting financially our European comrades in arms, including our mother country. The new millions which we will lend to our Government, and the million with which we participated in the previous bond issue, are only a part of the loans extended by America to Greece, directly or through the European Allies.</p>
   <p>Let us, then, show our gratitude to America by oversubscribing our quota to the Victory Liberty Loan.</p>
