   <p>Over two thousand people were present in the Coliseum Annex last Sunday to attend the first meeting of the Greek Liberal Leagues' Liberty Loan drive. Greek and American orators made the occasion a never-to-be-forgotten one.</p>
   <p>The American Navy Band filled the air with stirring music; and the profusely decorated hall pleased the eyes of the spectators.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Matalas, president of the Liberal League. He, in turn, introduced Mr. Long as chairman of the evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. Long spoke briefly and to the point, and introduced Professor Clark who inspired the audience with his patriotic and well-chosen words. Mr. Deneen, former governor, made a speech dealing with the financial aspects of the Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nikolaov, baritone from the Chicago Opera Company, sang various classical <pb facs="5422062_2_0809.jpg" n="2"/>compositions. He pleased the audience most when he sang that undying Greek song called "Gero-Demus".</p>
   <p>Mr. Eftaxias discussed the drive from a social and patriotic point of view; and he bitterly denounced the unpatriotic and traitorous individuals who did not show the proper respect and concern for the United States. The Greek counsul, Mr. N. Salopoulos, gave a short patriotic speech which was enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>A letter was sent by the assembled people to the United States Government, pledging the loyalty of the Greek-Americans to the Government; and branding Atlantis of New York as traitorous and unpatriotic. Mr. C. Paleologos invited everyone present to come down and purchase Liberty Bonds at a row of desks arranged for that purpose. Those in charge of the desks were Mr. J. Raklios, Mr. C. Salopoulos, Mr. Tasiopoulos, Mr. Alex, Mr. Chiagouris and....</p>
   <p>Saloniki, wishes to congratulate the men who have worked so hard to insure the success of the meeting.</p>
