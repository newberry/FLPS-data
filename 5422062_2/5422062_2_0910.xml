  <body>
   <p>It has always been the policy of Saloniki to speak openly and freely on questions of national and international importance. We take this opportunity to make the following appeal to the American people.</p>
   <p>As a result of receiving thousands of letters, cablegrams, and messages containing heart-broken appeals, prayers, and pleas from the people of our mother country, we have decided to place this appeal before the great American people on behalf of our readers. The readers of our newspaper here in Chicago and in America generally, are vitally affected, almost without exception, by this disastrous conflict of the European nations. Their brothers, sisters, parents, children, or other relatives live in the warring countries. This does not mean that the American people as a whole are not vitally affected, but our readers are most closely linked by ties of blood with the peoples of countries now plunged in the depths of barbarous warfare. Each day's mail, with its news of the pitiful progress of the war, brings some new and bitter anguish to the <pb facs="5422062_2_0911.jpg" n="2"/>hearts of our people.</p>
   <p>The pleas of millions of widowed mothers, the appeals of the fatherless children and orphans, and the prayers of the starving thousands of Europe directed to us justify us, we feel, in making this appeal in the name of humanity and justice.</p>
   <p>We appeal to the American people, to the highminded and courageous American press, to the American Government, to the manufacturers of armaments and munitions, and to the workmen engaged in the plants devoted to the manufacture of ammunition for use by the nations at war, to desist at once from making powder, shrapnel, cartridges, and other instruments of war destined to destroy our brothers, widow our sisters and mothers, and orphan their children, as well as to destroy forever the priceless possessions handed down by our ancestors.</p>
   <p>We appeal especially to the American manufacturers and munitions makers and to the workmen engaged in manufacturing any of these articles and lethal weapons, <pb facs="5422062_2_0912.jpg" n="3"/>to suspend at once the manufacture of powder and bullets which are being made for the cruel and inhuman purpose of mutilating and destroying humanity. We appeal to the workmen of such factories to go on record, even at the risk of losing their jobs, as being unalterably opposed to being employed for the purpose of manufacturing ammunition to shatter the bodies and blot out the lives of their own blood relatives.</p>
   <p>The honor of the American people, the integrity of the nation, the reputation of our manufacturers, and the patriotism and manhood of the workmen demand that the entire world be shown, once and forever, that money soaked with the blood of humanity cannot purchase these qualities.</p>
   <p>We ask the American people, therefore, in the name of humanity and a true spirit of neutrality, to do everything in their power as individuals and, collectively, as a nation to influence the manufacturers and workmen in the United States engaged in the manufacture of powder and bullets for use by any of the warring countries of the world, to end the production, the sale, and the shipping of <pb facs="5422062_2_0913.jpg" n="4"/>such materials. We appeal to you and to every reader to help us save our brothers abroad from further destruction. Let us Americans rise with courage and determination to our responsibility.</p>
   <p>First, we must stop the wholesale manufacture of ammunition for profit, and thus any impending danger of our own involvement and participation in the war. Then we can insist that Europe heed our demand for peace. Quit working on the production of powder, shrapnel, and cannon. Make your will felt through resolutions of your societies, by appeals to your local press, by action in your churches, by letters to your representatives in public office. Our participation must stop now, and then our influence for justice, righteousness, and peace can help end the war.</p>
   <p>Let us alleviate human suffering and preserve life--not help to destroy it. It is our duty as responsible citizens, as true Americans, and as true Greeks, to make our sentiments and our stand in regard to the European war known to all just, honorable, righteous, and peace-loving Americans irrespective of origin, birth, nationality, creed, or race.</p>
