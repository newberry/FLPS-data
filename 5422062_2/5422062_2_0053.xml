   <p>The monstrous scourge of Bolshevism, has begun to manifest itself amongst the Greeks. As every disease of the body, or of the soul, or a social disease, requires careful treatment, so Bolshevism requires systematic elimination, before its venomous serum contaminates society until a cure is too late.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism, as a social contagious disease that grips and throttles the people of the world, today, must be treated with extreme care and stead-fastness. All of us, who participated in the first Bolshevic debate of the Greco-Bolshevics in Chicago, remember how the Greek apostate shamelessly and unscrupulously proclaimed, that religion, under the banner of Bolshevism, has no value and no significance, and must be destroyed, as an antiquated and rotten institution.</p>
   <p>Such a blasphemous and impious utterance could neither be tolerated nor overlooked. The degenerate Greek leader was asked to define religion, but the wooly-tongued backslider, although semi-cultured, was utterly ignorant of the Aristotelian maxim, "An assertion is not a proof". He <pb facs="5422062_2_0054.jpg" n="2"/>failed to give any sane and logical interpretation, but plunged into a labyrinth of depravity and continued to throw an appalling squall of vituperation on religion.</p>
   <p>The cool-headed propounder of religion, at the debate, succeeded in lessening the scope of the apostate's influence by disabusing the mind of many of his followers, and leaving the hireling of Russia with only a small group of his paid cronies. However, the danger of contamination should not be overlooked and it is the imperative duty of every Greek society in Chicago to keep a vigilant eye over the activities of hired organizers from Moscow.</p>
   <p>This social pestilence made its appearance recently in Greece, where it gained ground owing to the inertia of the government, but when Mr. Pangalos became Dictator, he ostracized every one of them when he began to clean his house of this contageous disease.</p>
   <p>Whether, Gen. Kondilis would do likewise, remains to be seen, nevertheless, Bolshevism must be destroyed or Paganism will prevail. We hope that Gen. Kondilis, leaving aside the distraught political pathos of vengeance, will continue to keep free from the contamination of Bolshevism.</p>
