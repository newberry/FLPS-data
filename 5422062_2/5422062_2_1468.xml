   <p>We have followed the progress of certain Greek firms with a great deal of pride. They have steadfastly fought the depression and its terrible havoc. An outstanding example of this fierce resistance is provided by the Chicago firm, Lekas and Drivas. This establishment was incorporated about two or three years ago for the sole purpose of serving Greek stores and communities in the Central and Western States.</p>
   <p>The house of Lekas and Drivas has been familiar to American Greeks for the last forty years. Its honesty and efficient management has made it an exemplary organization. Since the time of its incorporation, this firm, managed by Nicholas Lekas, has broadened the scope of its activity. Today, the mark "Lekas and Drivas", appears on many Greek products indispensable to Greek dinner menus. Housewives have implicit faith in products bearing this mark because they know from experience that it signifies a high standard rigidly maintained.</p>
   <p>The fact that the business of this firm is continually increasing despite the present economic depression, is sufficient justification for our pride in this company.</p>
