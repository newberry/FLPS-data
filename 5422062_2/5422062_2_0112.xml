   <p>In order to make certain of the nomination and election of Len Small and Willian Hull, we must give our undivided support to a candidate who is pledged to fight the vote thieves.</p>
   <p>The office of attorney general is one of the most important in the State of Illinois. It has terrific power which can be used for a good or a bad purpose, depending upon the character of the man in office.</p>
   <p>I heartily endorse Thomas V. Sullivan for attorney general. His record as attorney for the Board of Education for many years stamps him as a man of ability and understanding. He consistently exercised his efforts in behalf of the school children and their parents. Mr. Sullivan has pledged himself to stop the stealing of votes. He is the only candidate with enough courage <pb facs="5422062_2_0113.jpg" n="2"/>to come out on this platform. We all know to what extremes the Horner administration went to pass the permanent registration bill, which would have stopped ballot frauds to some extent. And we all know why it was defeated.</p>
   <p>A crooked political machine can nullify the will of the voters by its ability to manipulate the votes. Only by nominating a man with enough backbone to use the power in his hands, can this looting be stopped. Vote scandals appear in the papers daily. The dishonest politician or machine puppet will stop at nothing to insure his being placed in office, and vote stealing is his favorite method. We must see to the safety of our vote so that it really expresses our own choice.</p>
   <p>We can insure it only by nominating a man strong enough to use the power of his office and stop forever this flagrant nullification of our wishes. Such a man, my friends, is Thomas V. Sullivan. He is experienced, he is courageous, and his record is such that we are certain he will live up to his pledge and stop the stealing of votes.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0114.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In closing, I wish to call your attention again to the merits of the candidates whom I have just endorsed, and appeal to you to give them all possible support. Before the election, I shall lay before you and discuss with you certain actions of the present administration, which have worked terrible hardships upon our Greek business people. I thank you for your support of these men in the past, and trust you will do your utmost for them at the primaries on Tuesday, April 14.</p>
   <p>Nicholas P. Kachavos</p>
