   <p>The above picture shows the proud Chicago Greeks drafted for the American Army. Mr. Nick Matalas, in honor of his drafted brother, Demetrios, and the rest of the Greek boys, gave a sumptuous good-bye dinner, which was remarkable for its lavishness, joviality and patriotism. Besides the departing boys, many prominent Chicago Greeks attended the dinner. Their names are listed on page three.</p>
   <p>Kansas camp is the destination of the boys, where they will be privileged to don the U. S. Khaki uniform. The speakers at the dinner reminded the Greek youths of America what great significance the insignia of the United States have and how important it is to the wearer to repeat the words of the Spartan mother who handed her son his shield with the words "E tan E Epi Tas," i.e. return with it or (dead) upon it; in other words, he must never abandon his insignia.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0700.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Patriotic speeches were delivered, and a few of the speakers used this slogan, "Fight for American if you can; if you can't fight, give your dollars! Fight with Liberty bonds. The spirit prevailing at the diners was "credit to the Greeks of Chicago." American patriotic songs were sung, and the hall was decorated with American flags.</p>
   <p>Such gatherings and such a spirit are beneficial to the cause of America. We shall win the war quicker than we think. If the patriotic feeling of nations may be exalted to the highest pitch in order to augment their force of resistance, let us talk victory. Let us talk Liberty bonds day in and day out; let us feel these things as realities, and the war will be over with America the victor. Fall in line and print your name on the roll of honor.</p>
