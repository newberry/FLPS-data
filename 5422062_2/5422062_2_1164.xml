   <p>p. 11 The Woman's World's Fair, that was held at the Coliseum proved to be an outstanding success. Representatives from all parts of America, as well as from other parts of the world,convened and it was proved once more that the modern woman is fast gaining those privileges that will make her in every way the equal of man.</p>
   <p>May 23rd was Greek night, with numerous women of our community participating. This is encouraging, for Greek women in the past did not care for affairs of this nature. They considered it as beyond the dignity and the proper attitude of women.</p>
   <p>Let us hope, therefore, that this will set a precedent, and that our fair sex will elevate itself to that position of service and responsibility that will honor not only themselves, but even their men folk. The traditions of Greek womanhood are as great as those of any other nation.</p>
