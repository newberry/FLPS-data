   <p>It has been my good fortune (or my misfortune, as you choose,) for the last twenty-two years to have come in contact with many "statesmen" and to have learned something about their sentiments, about their likes and dislikes. I have known some of them in and out of politics, when they had something at stake, and when they ware care-free and with no immediate objective. It is not my purpose to set out , in detail, my observations. My whole desire at this time is to speak of that species known to many of us as "Phil-hellenists."</p>
   <p>Away back when automobiles were young, and bicycles were in style, I heard of a great philhellenist. He was a worthy son of an illustrious former mayor; I refer to the younger Carter H. Harrison. In the campaign of 1911, when he was ambitious to return to power in the city, he was seized by an overpowering love for the descendants of the men of Marathon.</p>
   <p>About the same time his Republican opponent also became afflicted with that incurable diseas; philhellenism. Since them I have met and heard of many others who were lovers of the classics and of the descendants of the creators <pb facs="5422062_2_0119.jpg" n="2"/>of the classics. In political campaigns these victims of the darts of Apollo's little brother Eros are most numerous.</p>
   <p>Strange to say, recovery is as speedy and as complete as it is miraculous, and it comes immediately after the ballot-box is closed. It has often occured to me that perhaps this affectionate relationship is of our own making. Perhaps the supposed philhellenists do not even know that there is such a word in the dictionary. We merely become enthusiastic over our newfound comrades, and in order to sell them to our compatriots, we convert them into philhellenists.</p>
   <p>In some instances, however, the idea is encouraged by the pretended philhellenist. The condition is not peculiarly Greek.</p>
   <p>Other national groups are similarly misled, either by their own people or by the benficiaries of this counterfeit friendship. I have often heard that a well-known city executive was in the habit of tracing his ancestry back to Germany when associated with Germans, to Bohemia when talking to Bohemians, <pb facs="5422062_2_0120.jpg" n="3"/>and even to Ireland when surrounded by the Irish, while in fact he was of English extraction and probably a direct descendant of some of the passengers of the Mayflower. But for political purposes what difference does it make, so long as the deception accrues to the benefit of the pretender?</p>
   <p>The founders of our government never contemplated that in these United States the various racial groups should act in blocs and not as a whole, but the politicians not only have tolerated the idea of national and racial groups during campaigns but have even encouraged them, and as a result among the various national groups pseudo-leaders and spokesmen have sprung up who in most instances, do not understand their groups and are not capable of speaking for them. The result of this situation is discrimination against the smaller groups and racial prejudice, to the irreparable injury of the innocent public and to the detriment of the country as a whole.</p>
   <p>How long these leaders shall be in control, and when this condition shall end, are matters which depend on us.</p>
