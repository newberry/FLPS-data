   <p>p. 1.- With regret we hear, often, prominent Americans in politics saying "The Greeks do not show interest in the affairs of the State" and "They do not take the trouble to vote."</p>
   <p>Time and again this paper brought out the importance and paramount necessity of naturalization. Americanization is a tremendous power. A power cannot be effective unless it is demonstrated. Acquisition of a power, without utilization and demonstration, is not much of a power, and not very beneficial.</p>
   <p>The country in which we live, grow, act, evolve and have our interests, is really our country, and when we acknowledge this, it is absolutely necessary to demonstrate our love, devotion and interest to its welfare.</p>
   <p>We have here our home, our business, clubs, schools, churches, and everything involving the life of the citizen, that is, safety protection and proportional rights. These unquestionably require proportional <pb facs="5422062_2_0431.jpg" n="2"/>obligations on the part of the citizen, which must be performed and executed in reverence and devotion, as we expect our rights to be revered.</p>
   <p>In order to expect and do these things (to give and take) we must elect the proper people to legislate laws, and the proper people to administer the affairs of the State.</p>
   <p>To have this privilege , we must become American citizens, thus having both, the privilege to elect and to be elected.</p>
   <p>There are some stupid and foolish people who think that to change nationality is a deadly crime, and that a Greek on becoming an American citizen, entirely loses his Hellenism.</p>
   <p>This argument may be true if and when a Greek becomes a Turk or a Bulgarian, but when he becomes Americanized the case is entirely different, because as a Greek-American he attains the highest degree of citizenship. Our adopted country, in honoring a foreigner with <pb facs="5422062_2_0432.jpg" n="3"/>naturalization papers, does not and will not expect him to be and to do what Bulgaria or Turkey expect from their citizens to be or to do.</p>
   <p>Those fools and pseudo-patriots, are confusing Americanization with "Bulgarization" or "Turkization."</p>
   <p>It is our holy duty to become American citizens and it is also just as holy to exercise our acquired privilege and power, that is to vote.</p>
   <p>If it is true that Greeks in Chicago do not exercise political franchise, it is about time that we recognize this necessary prerequisite of American citizenship. A citizen without voting is like an entity without a body.</p>
   <p>Greeks, becoming citizens of this greatest country in the world, have the greatest advantage to be useful and beneficial to mother Greece. In hard days we will be able to protect the national rights of Greece through the efforts of our grand adopted country. As Greek-Americans we can request our statesmen to act in behalf of mother Greece, we can, <pb facs="5422062_2_0433.jpg" n="4"/>as citizens, appeal to our adopted country to use her weapons, philanthropy, justice and liberty, and protect the interest of our former country. Oh! narrow minded people, can't you see what harm you are doing by advocating, not only to those Greeks here who respect your suggestions, but also to the whole nation of Greece? American statesmen, who in the past and now showed their interest and friendliness towards greece, will be skeptical if we, the Greeks in America, are not citizens of the land in which we live, breathe, and prosper.</p>
   <p>We must alter the prevalent idea in Chicago, that Greeks, although naturalized, do not register so as to vote later. If we love Greece, our family, our life, our interest and our liberty, we must love all the more the United States of America, which tenderly nurses us and tolerantly educates us to see her greatness, without using what Bulgaria and Turkey use to effect their selfish purposes.</p>
