   <p>When a government thinks there should be an increase in armaments, it issues official and unofficial statements on the increase in armaments in neighboring countries. A war minister whose sincerity is unquestioned begins by making confidential disclosures to his government. Germany is rearming. Figures are given, facts are mentioned. There is no reason to suppose that there is exaggeration; and, therefore, the extra credits demanded [by the war minister] are granted. According to the prevailing conceptions of democratic governments, it is necessary to employ these tactics.</p>
   <p>The sequel is even more deplorable. The "scare" comes next. In the parliament statements are made by men occupying more or less authoritative <pb facs="5422062_2_0603.jpg" n="2"/>positions--statements which go beyond those made by responsible investigators. It has been pointed out that in one case the conservatives figures were doubled. Outside the parliament there are no bounds to the imagination of sensational writers and speakers.</p>
   <p>Nations on reiterated misinformation are led to reinforce their armaments, to increase their period of military service, and to seek alliances on the old pattern--all of which can, if effective, only result in the encirclement of another country, which cannot stand still, but feels that it must do its best to catch up with the others.</p>
   <p>It is not only one government or even two which permits and sometimes gives impetus to the scaremongering which stimulates the armament industry. Everywhere utterances are being made which would appear to justify maximum <pb facs="5422062_2_0604.jpg" n="3"/>expenditure on armies and navies. These statements are usually exaggerated with a definite end in view. But....</p>
   <p>That is why the Disarmament Conference, disappointing as its results have been, must not be permitted to dissolve. For the end of the Conference means further fatal rivalry. At all costs, the alternative--namely, an agreement to limit armaments--must be accepted. In the meantime people should beware of being stampeded into....arming, by another country.</p>
