   <p>p. 1- Today closes a period of eight years which have elapsed since that historic moment when the white flag was raised by the German troops as a sign that the World War was ended, - a war which from hour to hour was causing such ruin and such calamities to the human race that throughout the world the day when hostilities ceased was hailed as the most fortunate and the greatest of all days. The armistice evoked the utmost joy and exultation and was celebrated as the gift of God, dropped from the firmament above.</p>
   <p>Not only was it a widespread war which had ceased; it was a war which had affected every district and every hamlet in the world, and the Greek community in Chicago was not excepted. No, no indeed! In both armies members of this community were to be found, in the army of Greece and in the army of the Americans. Naturally the great announcement was received by Chicago Greeks with no less joy than by others, for they too realized that humanity reigned again; and all minds turned by common impulse to the soldiers who were returning, for by the cessation of the fearful sacrifices that were being offered on the altar of the god of war thousands <pb facs="5422062_2_0618.jpg" n="2"/>were saved, - the multitude of those who were fortunate enough still to be alive.</p>
   <p>And now it is not only to commemorate those for whom the eleventh of November came too late - those who had sacrificed their lives - but also to honor those to whom this day brought salvation that the Greeks of Chicago join with all other communities in solemn celebration.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
