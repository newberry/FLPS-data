   <p>Loxias recommends to all of its readers that they vote for the Honorable Julian W. Mack for re-election as Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Judge W. Mack has been sitting on the bench for six years, and during that time has demonstrated that he is in every way fit to occupy this high office. He has always discharged his duties fairly and has given the people of Cook County his best and most conscientious efforts.</p>
   <p>The Greek voters throughout the City of Chicago will reflect credit upon themselves and upon the Greek Community of Chicago by casting their votes for Julian W. Mack, for re-election at the poles next Monday.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0186.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Greek citizens, like all other citizens, are interested in having on the bench men of ability and integrity. Judge Mack has demonstrated that he is possessed of these qualities, and we therefore unqualifiedly recommend him to all Greek voters.</p>
   <p>Don't fail to vote for Hon. Julian W. Mack on next Monday, June 7th, 1909.</p>
