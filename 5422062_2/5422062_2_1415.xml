   <p>The above picture shows the immense interior of the new restaurant built by the Tsinonis brothers. This establishment, located at 1102 West 35th Street, is in the center of an active commercial district, and has the necessary size and arrangement for the rapid accommodation of hundreds of people. Its kitchen is of the newest type, and is as attractive as its dining room.</p>
   <p>Mr. Angelo Tsinonis operated during the last nine years the restaurant situated on the same site. He met with reverses during the depression just as all others did, but he refused to allow himself to be defeated, as did so many other Greeks.</p>
   <p>So religiously did he continue to improve his service and food that the community marveled at his courage. His patronage increased so rapidly that it became necessary to enlarge the restaurant. This was done through bank <pb facs="5422062_2_1416.jpg" n="2"/>loans, which proves the ability and integrity of Mr. Tsinonis; for how many could have secured a loan on a small restaurant during the depression?</p>
   <p>Construction was begun three months ago, and the results are well worthy of praise. Business has been extremely good, and it looks as if this restaurant were a "gold mine". His brother, Aristotle, who manages the kitchen, is to be given credit for the good, clean food served. This is a Greek enterprise of which we are proud.</p>
