   <p>Among the ninety-three graduates who received their diplomas from the McKilling Veterinary College was Mr. Alex Economos. He is from Tripoli, and is a brother of Mr. K. Economos, a lawyer.</p>
   <p>He is also known to the music lovers of Chicago, being a graduate of the Chicago Musical College. At the graduation exercises of the latter college, he took part in the musical program which was given before an audience of over 1,500 Greeks and Americans. He was favorably mentioned in the notices of the American press.</p>
   <p>Mr. Economos is the first Greek to receive a diploma from the McKilling Veterinary College; and he also received the honorary degree of Honorary of the McKillp's Medical Association [sic].</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1355.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We heartily congratulate Mr. Economos and wish him every success in his chosen profession. We also congratulate the Greek community for acquiring a representative in this field; because the lack of a Greek veterinary has been acutely felt.</p>
