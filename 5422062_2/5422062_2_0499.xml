   <p>We write about the efforts, in another column, to systematically organize a political organization of all Greek Democrats of Chicago. It is a brilliant idea, and if successful, no doubt will benefit the Greek more than all other organizations in existence, or extinct.</p>
   <p>If it were possible for Hellenism in America to be under a systematic uniform political organization, having its communities as local centers, and under political organization of both major political parties, as the other nationalities have been organized long ago, incalculably benefits might have been the result, morally as well as materially.</p>
   <p>It would have been a worthy effort, if Hellenism became conscious of its racial faults, its individuality and discord, and understood the advantages of practical cooperation and its profits or the results of a benevolent competition.</p>
   <p>The Greek immigrant engaged in business as an individual is more successful <pb facs="5422062_2_0500.jpg" n="2"/>in comparison with the other nationalities, because he always depends on himself, his ability hard labor and very seldom pays attention to the good returns of a unanimous cooperation, examples of which he has plenty in his new environment.</p>
   <p>If from racial or national idiosyncrasy, Hellenism showed an intensified progress on account of its excited individualisn and its competition, this is not an important reason that Hellenism should not pay attention, take as examples, follow the methods and learn from the environment.</p>
   <p>One of the most instructive examples is the systematic political organization a practice and a privilege of the Irishmen, who right after they land in this country take part in the public and political life of the community and serve not only as policemen, but in the highest offices as well. The immigrants from other nationalities were not very slow to follow the examples of the Anglo-Saxons and Irishmen now they compete with them for the political and public benefits where they have enough votes to have a voice in public affairs.</p>
   <p>But Hellenism until now has not shown any signs of systematic political organization and it was left to individuals at all times to spring up as political leaders who only in a very limited way were able to represent their countrymen.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0501.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The lack of a purely political organization is evident everywhere. Hellenism is organized in communities, clubs or brotherhoods, and only in political organizations is inactive.</p>
   <p>We have all kinds of small and big secret and open clubs and we are lacking only in purely political organization.</p>
   <p>Will it be possible through this now started attempt for a purely political organization to bring together all the politically influential Greeks of the same party in one political organization, which will be able to represent Hellenism as it deserves, or will it prove once more that we are not as yet mature for such a thing ?</p>
   <p>Let us hope that this lack of purely political organization will be corrected and it will be possible for Hellenism to be represented as united and imposing with the power and ability it possesses, instead of being lost as divided in small factions.</p>
