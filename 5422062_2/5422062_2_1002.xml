   <p>Seven Negroes were lynched in the United States in 1932, not six, as was announced by an anti-lynching association a few days ago. The seventh lynching occurred just at the end of the year. This is a tremendous improvement over earlier years. In the past half century there have been about 4,780 lynchings. For forty years the average number was about one hundred a year. The improvement is due to the growth of education among the residents of the Southern States, where the greatest number of these lynchings have occurred. The agitation against this barbarous practice, which has been a blot on American civilization, began in the North, but did not make much headway. Only when powerful organizations in the South--particularly those of Southern women--began to make their influence felt, did it gain speed. These associations have exploded the ancient falsehood that lynching is necessary to protect white womanhood.</p>
   <p>For some time after the close of the Civil War, white women were frequently <pb facs="5422062_2_1003.jpg" n="2"/>attacked, the Negroes having quaffed deeply the heady liquor of racial equality--or of racial superiority, even--under the domination of the Northern carpetbaggers. But in recent years, as an analysis of statistics shows, most of the Negroes lynched have not even been accused--much less, convicted--of having attacked white women. For the most part, they have been lynched for quarreling with white men.</p>
   <p>Knowing no other way to assert their supremacy over the Negro, white men in Southern communities promptly lynched any black who failed to subscribe to the doctrine of "white supremacy". This doctrine prevails throughout the South at the present time, but the whites have found it possible to enforce it by less drastic measures.</p>
   <p>The press--especially the Southern press--is to be congratulated for the help it has given to the anti-lynching movement. All the influential Southern journals have denounced lynching, and the more important have heaped praise upon sheriffs and other officials who have dared to defy <pb facs="5422062_2_1004.jpg" n="3"/>lynching mobs, refusing to surrender their prisoners to them.</p>
   <p>Indeed, if the officers of the law had not been in sympathy with the lynchers, and if they had had the courage to stand against them, there would have been few lynchings at any time. But too many of these sheriffs, desiring to curry favor with the mob, have tamely surrendered their prisoners with a mere show of resistance. When the newspapers, in the faithful discharge of their duties, condemned such officers and praised those who showed courage, the tide began to turn. Today, lynching has reached a new low.</p>
   <p>It is the sincere hope of the Greek Press and all the anti-lynching organizations that this year there may be not a single mob murder.</p>
