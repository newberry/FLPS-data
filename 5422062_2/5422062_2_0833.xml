   <p>Many times Loxias has trumpeted in our ears that the Greeks of America must honor the Greek name. This time it becomes a necessity and a duty to honor that name by leading other races in embracing America as our beloved country, as our very life. Now is the opportunity to honor the Greek name. To follow others is not a distinction, but to lead is a great honor. The Greeks in Chicago and in every part of the land have the opportunity now more than ever to prove to our adopted country that we really are true scions of our glorious Greece by leading other nationalities in doing our national duty; that is, by standing behind America like a solid rock. My country America is at war; I am body and soul for America! That is our national duty, obligatory for one and all of us, and those who lead in doing it are consequently distinguished and honored.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0834.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The United States of America is at war with the Central Powers, and all races living here are under obligation to place themselves under the American flag and its commands. And he who, either directly or indirectly, is against our country's policy is an ungrateful citizen and an enemy.</p>
   <p>It is an indisputable fact that the Greek element in America, since the beginning of the Germano-American War, has been very enthusiastically behind America with the exception of a few of Constantine's Loyalists. Thousands of Greeks are now in the service, enlisted in the United States Army and Navy. That is an honor for the name of our race. And all Greeks must remain as one solid body under the orders of the Government in Washington. Some small outcries, however, are uttered by a few Greek Loyalists who are still for Constantine and do not realize that Germanic preponderance or victory means destruction for our American democracy.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0835.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>These Loyalists and their leader, Solon Vlastos, must know that it is base and cowardly, in one way or another to betray America and that democracy nurtures them and has many times been the benefactor of Mother Greece.</p>
   <p>The Loyalists and in general all those of other races who argue their heads off with such expressions as "the volunteer system is much better than mobilization; the people should vote their approval before war is declared; no army should be sent to Europe; representatives should be sent to Stockholm to effect universal peace; the Allies acted inhumanely toward Constantine and very humanely toward that traitor Venizelos," etc., should know that to speak so is a service to the German idea and pure treason to the United States. Don't these people know that the United States is at war and must win? Those who are not in sympathy with the United States might very well depart for Germany and either by word or by deed advise the German Government what to do.</p>
   <p>Those who administer our democracy know better how and what to do to protect the interests and the existence of the country than do the ordinary Tom, Dick, and Harry among Loyalists, slackers, cowards, unpatriotic citizens and people of that kind.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0836.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Since the country has declared war against Germany, the duty of every citizen is to stand solidly behind it and fight under its flag, not to argue his head off over foolish nations which his fancy conceives. For failure to comply with the laws of the country is nothing else than rebellion against the established law of the land. And those who rebel against the State are ungrateful citizens and traitors and must be....incarcerated.</p>
   <p>For the last time we advise the remaining bosses of the "Loyalists" to renounce their Satanic activities against the Allies and naturally against America too, for the grace and the patience of this county are exhausted. They must, as do hundreds of thousands of Greeks, stand behind our adopted country and be ready to serve her at her command whenever it shall be necessary.</p>
