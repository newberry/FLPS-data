   <p>The Saloniki has accepted the challenge of Greek exploiters and will spare no effort to save the shoeshine boys from a life of veritable slavery. It makes very little difference to us if we incur the wrath of fifty, seventy-five, or one hundred bosses and so lose their subscriptions. The Saloniki was not founded to hush up matters which should be known to all.</p>
   <p>We shall always defend the rights of man--even if it means chastising the bankers who are dishonest, or calling the rich owners of shoeshine establishments what they are--exploiters and tyrants. The Saloniki will always be on the side of the weak and the poor, to defend them from the wolves among our own people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1040.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The readers of this paper have faith in its principles and its integrity. Therefore, when they see the Saloniki fight for or against some cause, they realize it must be of major social importance.</p>
   <p>We want to call the attention of the whole United States to the treatment of these poor wretches. We have already received letters on this subject from bootblacks in Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Montana.</p>
   <p>We have also received letters from kind and philanthropic individuals from all over America, saying that they will help in every way possible to alleviate these shameful conditions. The enthusiastic response received, has given us fresh impetus to continue our fight.....</p>
   <p>There are certain rich bosses who fill their teeth with gold in order that they may eat more easily--with the profits earned for them by the sweat and blood of young Greek boys. They, of course, are not going to approve of our actions, and will bitterly oppose us, and call us insulting names.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1041.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>That will not even interest us; we are only interested in the fate of the boys. It is common knowledge that these boys work sixteen to seventeen hours a day, seven days a week. In all, they work about one hundred and nineteen hours a week, when the laws of most states prohibit anyone from working over forty-eight or fifty-four hours a week. In other words, these boys work about three times as many hours as the law allows.</p>
   <p>It is also well known that they are given food that is not only unappetizing but is actually rotten, and makes the children sick. Everyone knows that these children all sleep in one room, and that the room usually has no window, and is full of filth and vermin. This unhealthy condition is shown in the wan, pale faces and hacking coughs of the boys.....These are the evils the Saloniki intends to wipe out. We appeal for help to all the worthwhile Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>We must not allow these bosses to acquire wealth at the expense of the neglected Greek children. This evil must be stopped, and stopped for good.</p>

   <p>Forward, in the campaign for liberation.</p>
