   <p>One hundred and forty-five years have passed since the Liberty Bell in the City of Philadelphia rang out, proclaiming the freedom of the thirteen states.</p>
   <p>America, unable to pay the high tariffs and taxes imposed upon her by England, refused to do so and proclaimed that she would fight for her freedom. In a Declaration of Independence it was stated: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."</p>
   <p>It took a great deal of courage to make this statement, because the thirteen states were small in size and poor in money and soldiers, while England was <pb facs="5422062_2_1126.jpg" n="2"/>rich and powerful. The volunteer American army was put under the command of George Washington.</p>
   <p>After the victory of America a constitution was drawn up, and Washington was elected the first President of the United States.</p>
   <p>To all the foreign-born we say: "Remember your fatherland; but pledge allegiance to America."</p>
