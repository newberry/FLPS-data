   <p>We will remember that prior to the World War, when the clouds presaging the impending catastrophe were thick, there was considerable talk of the necessity of reducing armaments. It was then claimed by all opponents of war, as well as those who believe that war can never be eliminated, that the nations were becoming bankrupt. Of course we all know what followed. And if what has been stressed lately--the need of curtailment of armaments--has any bearing upon the fate of nations, the tragic irony of the thing makes the future look gloomy.</p>
   <p>Man seems to be imbued with a desire for predominance. Since nations are the aggregate of individuals they, too, are motivated by the desire to predominate over others. In the struggle for predominance they are obliged to use force, hence the armaments. Just now, when the nations of the world are <pb facs="5422062_2_0598.jpg" n="2"/>spending four times as much for armaments as before, the war, ministers of foreign affairs, and even our own secretary of state, declare armament reductions a necessity, if war is to be averted. To us, this line of reasoning has never seemed logical, and we could never understand the rationality of the proposed measures. If men are to have armaments, it simply means that they need them in case of war. By what reasoning can we expect war to be averted or postponed because of an existing agreement between nations to limit armaments?</p>
   <p>There is only one method by which war can be eliminated--the outlawing of war as a means of settling differences, and the closing of all munitions factories. Since this cannot be done, who in the world could believe that there is any meaning in all this talk about reductions in armaments. Especially now that imperialism is running rampant, and nations like Japan and Germany are chartering their own course in defiance of the League of Nations, from which they withdrew in order to have free hands to proceed with their plans.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0599.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>To believe that there is the slightest hope of ever reaching an understanding is to ignore human history.....</p>
   <p>This crime of war, which will ultimately wreck our civilization, or what we are wont to call by that name, will be abolished when man cultivates the idea and ideals of peace....and...shuns all the charlatans who would have us believe in their biological rationality.</p>
