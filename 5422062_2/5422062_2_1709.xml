   <p>A new luxurious and aristocratic recreation center including a bowling-alley and a billiard-hall, was opened last Saturday in the central square of Quincy, Illinois.</p>
   <p>This place of recreation occupies a whole building, which has been decorated and furnished by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Company and includes the billiard-hall, the bowling-alley, a candy-store, a cigar-store, and a barber shop. It is named "The Q Recreation Parlors."</p>
   <p>The cost of furnishing and equipping the whole affair was about $100,000, and it is the beauty-spot of the town.</p>
   <p>The owner of this business is that well-known and popular countryman of ours, Mr. Anthony Bouras or Kanellopoulos, general agent of the big Brunswick-Balke Company of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1710.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The management of it has been entrusted to the owner's nephew, Mr. Constantine Georgopoulos, and to Mr. J. Steinbach.</p>
   <p>The recreation parlors were opened on Saturday about 2 p. m. with music and entertainment for all the visitors, who rushed in and filled all three floors of the building, admiring its magnificence.</p>
   <p>The number of visitors on the opening day was well over fifteen thousand, and on the following days the same enthusiasm was shown.</p>
   <p>All the newspapers of the town printed long articles describing the place and mentioning our popular compatriot, to whom we extend sincere congratulations and our best wishes for his success.</p>
