   <p>The date mentioned above is a very important one, for the fate of the money of the eight hundred Greeks of Chicago who were unlucky enough to be depositors in the Greek-American Bank.</p>
   <p>On that day full forgiveness of their sins will be granted to the four bankers. They will even be the recipients of congratulations and best wishes for their future enterprises, which will, no doubt, be of a similar nature.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate depositors must take proper steps to regain what is rightfully theirs. They must hire a good attorney and then prove certain facts, which will help them win their case. They should point out that only a few months ago "Messieurs the Bankers" (sic) transferred all their holdings to the names <pb facs="5422062_2_0591.jpg" n="2"/>of their relations or wives. These holdings were of very large sums. They should show that one of these fine bankers sold his expensive automobile only five days before the bankruptcy of the bank; that another one had his luxurious mansion safely and wisely entered under his wife's name; that the others took prolonged vacations in Europe at the expense of their trusting depositors.</p>
   <p>We must not cross our hands and expect the Lord to help us; but with His help, we must use those hands to knock upon the door of justice.</p>
   <p>Saloniki is the only Greek paper that has taken up the cudgels in behalf of the exploited Greek people. It will fight to the last ditch for the rights of those eight hundred victims of fraudulent banking.</p>
