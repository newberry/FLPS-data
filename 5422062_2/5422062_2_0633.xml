   <p>The Greeks of America continue to celebrate the victories and honors of the Greek Army on the Ionian plains and the meadows of Eastern Thrace.</p>
   <p>Given the task of conquering the Turks by the Allies, the Greek Army fighting under the flag of liberty and patriotism, advanced on winged feet, and within ten days they had conquered the wild hordes of Kemal. They killed thousands of Turks and took more thousands as prisoners.</p>
   <p>In this "Battle of Brotherhood," the Greek Army wove new laurel wreaths, which are worthy of the by-gone heroes. They fought so bravely, because they wanted to administer punishment for the horrible atrocities suffered by the women and children at the hands of these beasts.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0634.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The victims of this kind amounted to two thousand, while the tragedy of Idiniou added a fresh page to the list of Turkish atrocities and barbarism.</p>
   <p>Himpen, a New York journalist, who sided with Germany during War, said in an article that "Kemal was great, terrible, and unconquerable," and that "the Greek Army was incapable and ridiculous."</p>
   <p>Two days had not passed before the Greek Army showed itself to be gigantic. Kemal fled to safety, and the only ones who are ridiculous are Mr. Himpen and his associates.</p>
