   <p>The elections which took place last Tuesday in Illinois were of great interest to many Greeks of Chicago who are connected in one way or another with certain political groups or individuals. Many were the groans of disappointment when Horner defeated Doctor Bundesen for the governorship.</p>
   <p>The results of this election should be a lesson to many of our compatriots, who become so enthusiastic about politics that they often do injury not only to their own interests but to those of the entire Greek community. It is an acknowledged fact that by nature the Greeks are politico-maniacs. But it was not necessary for them to bring that mania to America and continue to nurture it. We must not think that we grasp the political organization of this country so well that we can predict or greatly influence the turn of affairs.</p>
   <p>We honestly believe that if our fellow countrymen minded their own business more and did not always seek to be in the public eye, they would be far better off <pb facs="5422062_2_0467.jpg" n="2"/>than they are now.....</p>
   <p>The recent elections should prove to them that the number of men who can become party leaders or acquire high political office, is restricted to a few. Unfortunately we cannot all get to be president.</p>
