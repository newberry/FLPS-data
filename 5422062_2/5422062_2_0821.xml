   <p>The National Herald of New York is undertaking a drive to raise funds to aid the American soldiers who are fighting in France. This is a good opportunity for the Greeks of Chicago to show their appreciation of the kindness and help extended to them by their adopted country. We must do our duty in order to bring honor and respect upon the Greek name in this country. Let us not fail as badly as did the Greeks of New York.</p>
   <p>We are not asking for a community contribution because it is felt that better results will be obtained if each individual is allowed to give as much as he can.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Lambros, editor of the Star, is in charge of the collection of funds in Chicago. Anyone who can do so should send his contribution to Mr. Lambros. The fund is for the purchase of cigarettes and other little necessities that will lessen the hardships of "our boys" to a small extent.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0822.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Saloniki is going to devote a special column to this drive, in which the names of all contributors will be printed.</p>
   <p>The staff of the Saloniki earnestly requests your co-operation in this patriotic matter.</p>
