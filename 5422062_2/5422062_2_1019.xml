   <p>"We want to hire Greek boys to work as shoeblacks. Steady work, good wages, and no work on Sundays or holidays."</p>
   <p>For the first time in its existence, the Saloniki printed an advertisement of this type in its columns. For the first time in the entire journalistic history of the Greeks in America, an advertisement has appeared that states the actual conditions of work in a shoe-shine establishment.</p>
   <p>This paper has devoted a great deal of time and effort to helping the poor Greek bootblacks who were attracted to this land by the glamorous stories that are circulated in Greece. Although they have been sadly disappointed and have lost all hope of becoming free and successful, they have taken heart again because of the accomplishments of this paper, and the work of <pb facs="5422062_2_1020.jpg" n="2"/>some kind and progressive citizens of Chicago, in their behalf.</p>
   <p>It is no small accomplishment to regulate wages and hours and form a protective union for these child laborers.</p>
   <p>If we have never published such an advertisement before, it was not because we did not receive any. On the contrary, we were forced to refuse many advertisements because there was a doubt in our minds as to the authenticity of some of the statements made in them. A paper must always print the truth; not only in its news and editorial columns, but in its advertising space as well. The Saloniki has refused to carry the advertisements of certain concerns and individuals because false statements were made, or because the advertised product was known, to us, to be of inferior quality.....</p>
   <p>Again we turn our attention to the little bootblacks. If all the Greek <pb facs="5422062_2_1021.jpg" n="3"/>papers in America were more selective in their acceptance of advertisements, there would be fewer advertisements offering work to thirty or fifty Greek boys without mentioning wages, hours, or working conditions.</p>
   <p>Does a Greek paper ever question a customer who advertises for great numbers of men? Does the advertising manager examine the character and past record of the would-be advertiser? No! The Saloniki prides itself upon being the only Greek paper in America that places its integrity and social responsibility above financial gain.</p>
   <p>Newspapers that allow fraudulent or misleading advertisements to appear in their columns are helping dishonest individuals to exploit innocent people.</p>
