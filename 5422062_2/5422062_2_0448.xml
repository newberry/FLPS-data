   <p>The Republicans of the United States claim for themselves credit for the virtuous and honest administrations, while their opponents do not offer such confidence as to industry, work, and prosperity of the citizens in general during their administrations.</p>
   <p>Our paper, mindful of the principles of McKinley and particularly those of Republicanism, has with all its ability, from August 12 to November 2, never ceased, in every weekly issue to support the Republican Party efficiently and disinterestedly. Other Greek papers of our city, supposed to be Republican, expected (after such obligations and public appointments of its publishers) to receive money in advance, not to fight for principles, but to write about the party. That is a shame. As characters, those writers, and we say this in a public way, cannot be called true Republicans, but are bought bluffers, who, giving no support <pb facs="5422062_2_0449.jpg" n="2"/>to the progressive party of the country, are looking out just for the interest of their own pockets.</p>
   <p>Loxias stands with pride today, because it voiced principles, for the sake of principles and not for the sake of money.</p>
