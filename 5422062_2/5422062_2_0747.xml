   <p>To the Greeks of Chicago and Cook County:</p>
   <p>In order to promote the sale of bonds of the Third Liberty Loan and contact all Americans of foreign descent as soon as possible, it was decided to appoint registration committees from among the various nationalities in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of Greeks was appointed by the director of the foreign language division, which, together with a subcommittee, will call on you in the near future in order to explain the purpose of the loan and obtain your registration for the Liberty Loan drive.</p>
   <p>Now and always the Greek people are and have been most enthusiastic and generous supporters of their adopted county, America.</p>
   <p>Now the opportunity is offered us to convince the world of this. We can <pb facs="5422062_2_0748.jpg" n="2"/>give great proof of our devotion, loyalty, and self-sacrifice for country and flag by oversubscribing that part of the loan which we are expected to cover. Let us assist the committee by presenting a much larger amount in subscriptions than any other nationality can offer.</p>
   <p>If the Greek people are not to remain behind in subscriptions, for it is expected of them to do their part, they must register through the Greek committee that will call on them personally.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos</p>
   <p>Secretary of Third Liberty</p>
   <p>Loan Greek Committee.</p>
