  <body>
   <p>About six months ago, Mr. George Kouretsos and Mr. Peter Demetropoulos opened their first restaurant at 436 North Clark Street, featuring low prices. This restaurant was formerly owned by Mr. Demetropoulos and Mr. Mermegas.</p>
   <p>Since that time, more than six similar restaurants have been opened by them, and other business enterprizes.</p>
   <p>It seems that the public likes these "penny cafeterias," as they are called, because they sell foodstuffs from one penny and up.</p>
   <p>No doubt this system is successful, and especially now, when the public wants wholesome food at low prices, which these restaurants can furnish by eliminating extra overhead expenses, and depend on the volume of business for their profits.</p>
   <p>Others who have seen the advantages of this system and have opened penny <pb facs="5422062_2_1452.jpg" n="2"/>cafeterias are: Mr. George Vrahos on Wabash Avenue, and Mr. Sicoke and Company on Wilson Avenue and Broadway.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Kouretsos thinks that during this depression the customers like to have food at low prices with no expensive, luxurious service. That is why small capital invested for the satisfaction of the customer is better than the luxurious decorations of the dining rooms, and other expensive furniture, which only enrich the Jewish furnishing houses, and for which the public paid at the higher priced meals.</p>
   <p>Here is another good opportunity for the Greeks to serve the public, and not give the impression that they rob their customers. Mr. Kouretsos and his organization point the way.</p>
