   <p>p. 3.- Election of officers of the American Restaurant Association of Chicago was held on December 12. John Besas, who has served as a member of the Board of Directors for the past two years, was unanimously elected president.</p>
   <p>In electing Mr. Besas as president, the members of this association have acted wisely. He is a man fully qualified to fill that position. During the time that he has served as a member of the Board he has won the respect and admiration of all those whom he has had the occasion to come in contact with.</p>
   <p>The American Restaurant Association of Chicago, an association of Restaurateurs of Hellenic descent, functioning in the Community of Chicago and suburbs since 1919, has rendered many services to its members, and as a whole, to the restaurant keepers of Chicago in various ways; through <pb facs="5422062_2_1634.jpg" n="2"/>lectures and by the publication of the Restaurant Keepers' Guide, which is the official organ of the organization.</p>
   <p>The Democrat congratulates the members of the American Restaurant Association of Chicago, and its newly elected officers, and wishes them success in the guidance of their organization.</p>
