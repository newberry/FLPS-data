   <p>Mr. Fournarakis, who graduated with honors from the National University, has practiced his profession in his native country. He went to Paris to complete his studies, specialized in surgery and has written a special treatise on Cesarian Section, as a consequence of which, he received the title, Assistant Etranger.</p>
