   <p>In ancient times when two tribes or nations were at war, the decision was often reached by individual fighting. When the ancient Spartans were at war with the Aegeans, each side chose three hundred men to fight against each other until all were killed except one man, and this lone survivor claimed victory for his side. In this instance only one Spartan survived, and so his army was considered victorious. In the Trojan War, Menelaos and Paris fought to decide which side was the conqueror. Until a few years ago battles were still being fought and won by individual armies of the countries involved.</p>
   <p>War today does not bear any resemblance to the war of ancient times . Today, it is nations and not armies that fight the battles. The nation that is conquered in modern warfare is removed from the map of the world. A nation in a warring state is demolished by improved methods of warfare; its civilization is destroyed and its inhabitants are either killed, wounded or caused to flee. Thousands of families are separated in the most brutal <pb facs="5422062_2_0897.jpg" n="2"/>manner; little children wander the streets seeking a familiar face; the papers are full of accounts of members of families estranged by war, seeking each other. This is what modern warfare does. It disrupts and murders nations, not armies. Such is the war in Europe today; a war that will set civilization back at least five hundred years.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that our beloved Greece will remain outside of such a horrible war, where blood is being shed more freely than water. The ideals of the ancient Greeks show themselves to be far superior to the modern ideals. They were practical and compassionate in the solutions of their difficulties.</p>
   <p>Imagine the joy the countries of Europe would feel if they were told that the war would be settled by the battle of a certain number of brave men from each side. A chance to die for their country would be given to these men, while at the same time the innocent women and children would be spared unbearable suffering. Cities and civilizations, public buildings and works <pb facs="5422062_2_0898.jpg" n="3"/>of art, and--what is even more precious--homes would not be destroyed.</p>
   <p>The idea is old, but it would serve as well now as it did in the past. It would be well for the rulers of Europe to read a little history, instead of dreaming of conquest and destruction.</p>
