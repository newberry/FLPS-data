   <p>The twenty-second of February is the anniversary of George Washington's birthday. Because of his great services in behalf of independence for America, Washington is called the Father of Democracy. His well-organized army won all battles against the English and forced England to sign a treaty recognizing the independence of America. George Washington was elected the first president of the United States.</p>
   <p>During the Colonial War he was distinguished for his military skill, courage, and loyalty, and during his presidency he was distinguished for his political views. He organized the country on the solid foundations upon which it has stood to the present day.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago and the rest of the country, in business as well as in private life, must commemorate the birth of Washington, who stands out as a symbol of liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>Make the twenty-second of February a Greek-American holiday in your calendar.</p>
