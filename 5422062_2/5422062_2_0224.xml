   <p>P.1. On Sunday, September 24th, the much-advertised picnic of the Greek-American Democratic Club was held at Prassinos's Villa in Arlington Heights. More than a hundred and fifty automobiles delivered the crowd.</p>
   <p>As had been announced, Mayor Kelly was present as guest of honor. He criticized the opposition newspapers for their attacks on his policies.</p>
   <p>George Prassinos, everywhere present to serve his guests, George Becharas, who acted as chairman, George Kyriakopoulos, the toastmaster, and all the others in charge tried to please the crowd and to make all enjoy a wonderful time, as they did.</p>

   <p>George Graechis's Band played American and Greek dances to the delight of those in attendance, who stayed beyond midnight to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the savory food, and the pleasant companionship of agreeable people.</p>
   <p>Mr. Donahue, who spoke after Mayor Kelly, praised the Greeks for their spirit and their industry and congratulated them on the splendid crowd assembled at the picnic.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Judges Joseph Burke, Grabler, and Schwaba of Chicago and Judges Klehm and Kaplan of Arlington Heights, who greeted the guests on behalf of the city of Arlington Heights.</p>
