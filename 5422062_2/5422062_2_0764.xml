  <body>
   <p>Two conferences of foreign language representatives took place last week for the sale of Liberty Loan bonds. The first conference took place at the Liberty Loan headquarters of the seventh district of the Federal Reserve Bank system. Felix J. Streyckmans, the president, and Nels N. Hokanson, the vice-president of the foreign-language division, prepared a plan by which they will communicate with a population of more than one million, speaking foreign languages.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the foreign language groups are as follows: F. J. Streyckmans, Belgian; A. J. Cermak, Bohemian; Masaki Shimadju, Japanese; J. R. Palandech, Serbian; Ernest Kusswurn, German; Antonio Ferrari, Italian; Henry Hertz, Danish; A. O. Stang, Norwegian; Harry A. Lipsky, Jewish; J. J. Elias and John I. Bagdziunas, Lithuanian; Henry S. Henschen, Swiss;</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0765.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Paul S. Newey, Assyrian; Steven Von Fay, Hungarian; C. Salopoulos, Greek; Edward de la Gourneux, French; and J. Spolarsky, Russian.</p>
   <p>Professor Knott of the University of Chicago has notified the representatives that the University of Chicago will furnish volunteer translators whenever they need them. The president of each nationality or foreign community will undertake to work among the members of his nationality. The president of the savings department will be assisted by a state chairman for each of the five states of a district, and by a special committee for the affairs of Chicago and Cook County. The state chairman for Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Iowa will organize their own states according to counties, which will be subdivided in local committees.</p>
   <p>On April 6, the gun will be fired giving the signal for the beginning of the Liberty Loan drive. The first shot for the beginning of the Third Liberty Loan campaign in the seventh district was fired from the La Salle Hotel on <pb facs="5422062_2_0766.jpg" n="3"/>Friday, when the chairmen of three hundred and thirty-eight counties of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa met and concluded the day's activities with a dinner in the evening. There were several speakers, among whom were: J. B. McDougal, chairman of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank; C. H. Scheepe, vice-president of the district Executive Committee; Vatkin W. Kneath, secretary of the Executive Committee; Lawrence Howe, Chairman of the speakers' bureau; Vilbur D. Nesbit, publications chairman; Mrs. George Bass, secretary of the Women's Liberty Loan Committee; Miss Grace Dixon, chairman for the Women's Government Savings Department; and Felix Streyckmans, director of the Foreign Language Department.</p>
   <p>Honorary guests at this dinner were: Lowden, Governor of Illinois; Harding, Governor of Iowa; Sleeper, Governor of Michigan; Phillips, Governor of Wisconsin, and Mr. Wilbur D. Lesbit, president of the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday at about 1:00 P. M., a dinner was given at the Sherman Hotel by the State Council of Defence in honor of the newspaper publishers of <pb facs="5422062_2_0767.jpg" n="4"/>Illinois. Governor Frank O. Lowden of Illinois was the honorary guest.</p>
