   <p>To help preserve the ideals and sacred traditions of this, our adopted country, the United States of America. To revere its laws and inspire others to respect and obey them.</p>
   <p>To strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty; in all ways to aid in making this country greater and better than we found it.</p>
   <p>Quotations from the Chicago Press. From the Greek Star.</p>
   <p>"For the sake of civilization," is the title of an editorial in the Greek Star, P. S. Lambros.</p>
   <p>"After the British lion and the rest of the allied powers that are fighting for the rights of humanity, justice, and civilization," reads the editorial, "we are bound to see the new World's power participating in the World's greatest War - America - a power aiming not to conquer, but to check the would-be <pb facs="5422062_2_0792.jpg" n="2"/>conqueror and to lend her great assistance in freeing the small nations that are sighing under the yoke of the iron ring of the central powers.</p>
   <p>There shall be no political parties, or factions now, there is only one party - the great American party - there is only one leader - the President of the United States, so let us follow our President and let us pray that God may guide, strengthen him."</p>
   <p>The Tribune, February 4, 1917</p>
   <p>The Greek Star</p>
   <p>It has been heralded from coast to coast that we are going through a critical moment on account of the diplomatic rupture between our adopted country and Germany. It is no any longer a question of being pro-ally or pro-German, but it is a question of pure Americanism, and, judging from the enthusiasm with which the American people have answered the call of President Wilson, we feel that the spirit of the American people <pb facs="5422062_2_0793.jpg" n="3"/>and the foreign-born citizens is in their hearts, and this brings us into unity, one country with one leader, the President of the United States.</p>
   <p>And we as Greek-Americans - loyal Americans - are here to stand by the land of the free and the home of the flag - the flag that flies over the brave.</p>
   <p>The Herald, February 6, 1917.</p>
