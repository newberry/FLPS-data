   <p>The situation in Europe has suddenly begun to get darker, if the news dispatches are to be believed. The major cause for unrest springs from the happenings in Russia, which corresponds to the events which took place in Germany last year on the last day of June. At that time Hitler, to safeguard his interests, massacred hundreds of his political enemies. Perhaps the Russian situation has not become as desperate as that of Germany, but "where there is smoke, there is fire". As if the Russian crimes were not enough, news comes from Hungary that Serbian troops have entered Hungary. According to the messages no explanation has been offered for this action.</p>
   <p>The most conservative and peace-loving nations in Europe are expending all their efforts to prevent a war which seems very imminent. Practically the same <pb facs="5422062_2_0606.jpg" n="2"/>situation exists now as existed on the eve of the World War. Then, too, France and England tried to prevent a war which they knew had to be.</p>
   <p>It may easily be said that the situation is today more crucial than it was then because peace is threatened by far greater foes today, than in 1914. It is evident that there will soon be trouble in the Balkans between Greece and Albania.</p>
   <p>The year 1934 presented--we use the past tense because the year is nearing its end--situations that would have caused a declaration of war if they had occurred in earlier years. Not because these situations which presented themselves should have caused war, but because they provided an excuse for war.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1934 we had internal disturbances in Austria. These were <pb facs="5422062_2_0607.jpg" n="3"/>closely followed by the brutalities of Hitler, the murder of Dolfuss, the murder of a Soviet official, and the murder of the Serb King. All these crimes testify to the extent of the European crisis; and no one will be surprised to discover some morning upon awakening that half of the world is killing the other half. This would be a terrible blow to humanity and civilization, but it seems inevitable--unless the United States, England, and France unite their forces and fight for peace. These three nations are finding themselves in practically the same situation in which they were in 1914. Now, as then, there are nations--which to an even greater degree than before--thirst for blood. Germany seeks revenge, and all the other European nations have so many quarrels and conflicting interests that it is difficult to see any solution except war--if that can ever be a solution. Russia may desire to remain at peace, but who can doubt that Japan does not eagerly await her chance to strike at her ancient enemy? We firmly believe that Japan is doing everything possible to create friction and war among the European nations; for then she will have the chance to become the strongest power in the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0608.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is obvious that this involved situation will plunge humanity into a cataclysm of death and pain. It is not just empty talk when students of the situation say that we are on the brink of a devastating war which will make the last one look like child's play.</p>
   <p>Only a miracle could save us from our impending doom; and since miracles do not occur, we fear the worst.</p>
