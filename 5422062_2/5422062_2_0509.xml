   <p>Hon. Harry Olson,</p>
   <p>Chief Justice, Municipal Court of Chicago,</p>
   <p>City Hall, Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Constantine Hougiazos, an associate member of this League, undergoing instructions for American citizenship, represented to us today that he had been summoned to appear in the speeders court for parking his car in a loading zone. Mr. Hougiazos sat in court all morning and heard other people, who were brought to the court for similar violations, fined $1 and $2 and costs. When his case was called the first question asked of him by Judge Hazen was whether he was a citizen, to which Mr. Hougiazos truthfully answered that he was not. The judge then imposed <pb facs="5422062_2_0510.jpg" n="2"/>a fine of $15 and costs and said, in substance, to the Assistant States Attorney, "I call your attention to this man who is in business here in Chicago and he is not an American citizen."</p>
   <p>The purpose of this League is to prepare people of Hellenic descent for citizenship. Mr. Hougiazos has indicated his desire to become an American citizen and has joined this League for the purpose of receiving proper instructions.</p>
   <p>We do not know of any law which compels a man to become an American citizen before he can go into business or otherwise earn a living in America, and conduct of this kind on the part of the judiciary does not tend to give prospective citizens a creditable opinion of our American institutions.</p>
   <p>This is the first time we have decided to call this to your attention, but we have had numerous complaints of a similar nature in the past with <pb facs="5422062_2_0511.jpg" n="3"/>other judges. We believe that much ill feeling would be avoided if you would call attention of the judges to the fact that all persons under the law are presumed to be entitled to the same fair and equal treatment in our courts of justice.</p>
   <p>The Achaian League,</p>
   <p>A. C. Coorlim,</p>
   <p>President.</p>
  </body>
