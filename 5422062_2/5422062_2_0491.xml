   <p>p. 1-We have always supported Greek political organizations and participation of our fellow-nationals in political activities of this country, regardless of what party they may belong to.</p>
   <p>We know well that the game of polities is a great factor in our social life, and one without which nothing could be done. In America, politics plays the leading role in business.</p>
   <p>Politics in America, however, is complicated to such an extent, that the closest attention is required, as well as long experience, in order for the game to be understood and the Greeks do not, as yet, grasp the organization and system of a political and the roles played by various political leaders.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate feature is, that we are always waiting until the last moment to create something from whatever is at hand. We make some spasmodic moves, in order to show to the Americans that we, too, are political factors and interested in the political life of the country.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0492.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And the result is that we spend money, arrange luxurious dinners, have demonstrations and political mass-meetings, create a partisan current among our countrymen for this or that party, develop some enthusiasm and often some fanaticism. We render, in other words, real service to the various candidates and the reward is: Nothing!</p>
   <p>Just because we have not learned as yet, how the game of politics is played. The only way to learn is to create an organization that is systematic and determined and not a spasmodic one gathered together on the eve of an election.</p>
