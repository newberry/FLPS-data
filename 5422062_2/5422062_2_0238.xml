<title level="a">SPECIAL MEETING OF THE GREEK DEMOCRATS OF CHICAGO OPINIONS AND COMMENTS AT THE BANQUET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>At the Old Town Tea Room of the Sherman Hotel, the first meeting of the Greek Democrats was held on October 5. Almost all the Greek Democratic leaders, old and new, were present to exchange ideas for the better organization of the Greek Democrats.</p>
   <p>The meeting was preceded by a banquet, given on this occasion by the newly elected president of the organization, Mr. George Becharas.</p>
   <p>About seventy of the old timers and new politicians were present. Three members of the Sanitary District, Mr. Thomas Bowler, Mr. John Touhy, and Mr. Denis A. Horan spoke and expressed their satisfaction for this attempt at real political organization on the part of the Greek voters of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Becharas, president of the new Club, said the organization was the result of advices from our American political friends, who insisted on organizing the Greek Democrats along the lines of the regular Democratic <pb facs="5422062_2_0239.jpg" n="2"/>party of Illinois. It was also an attempt to rectify the mistakes of the past.</p>
   <p>In our new political organization, the Greeks will be represented by fifty representatives, one in each Ward, who will cooperate with the Democratic Ward Committeeman. They will receive instructions and orders from him, and will take care of the various political needs of our countrymen in the Ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. Becharas expressed his opinion and confidence that in so acting the Greek Democrats of Chicago will get recognition and more attention from the political leaders of the party, as well as more benefit. They will not be pushed aside, as in the time when Mr. Panteles was a candidate for judge, and was rejected because no committeeman was there to support him for a place on the Democratic ticket for Judges in Cook County.</p>
   <p>John Touhy, a veteran politician, and very well-known to the Greeks for over twenty years, congratulated the Greeks when he saw them for the first time show signs of understanding the political game. He said that if he <pb facs="5422062_2_0240.jpg" n="3"/>had had such an organization at the time when Mr. Panteles was an aspirant for the judgeship, he was sure that Mr. Panteles would have had the support of the organization, and would have been elected along with the ticket.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bowler also commended the idea of the systematic organization of the Greeks, along the lines of the Democratic party, and assured them of their proper place with such an organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Horan also praised this sign of understanding of the political game, and expressed his confidence in the ability of the Greeks that by this neworganization, they will take their share of the benefits.</p>
   <p>After these candidates for trustees of the Sanitary District left the meeting, and the Greeks were left alone, Mr. Becharas asked every one to express his opinion about the organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Panteles protested because he was not invited at the time when the first meeting was held. He said he was "left in the dark," and was informed about it only when he read the Proodos, the newspaper published <pb facs="5422062_2_0241.jpg" n="4"/>in Chicago, by a lawyer from Detroit, Mr. Laskaris. Mr. Panteles also protested the rumors that he sold the Greek voters to Sabath, who is the recognized organized of the foreign groups, and explained that he received his appointment through the influence and support of the Legionaires. He said Sabath called on him because several Greeks were asking for money to deliver the Greek votes, like George Vournas from Washington, D.C., who had asked $10,000 to deliver the Greek votes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Becharas explained that Mr. Panteles was not invited because he was already affiliated with the foreign groups, and the Greeks did not like to have a repetition of the past experiences from that group.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Panteles interrupted to protest, Mr. Becharas reminded him that he was not interrupted while speaking, and continued his talk about his services to the Greeks, stating that these services and the services of all others, including those of Mr. Panteles, were useless, and lost, because most of the so-called political leaders did not know their Ward Committeeman only by sight.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. Becharas recommended that it was time to forget the past and <pb facs="5422062_2_0242.jpg" n="5"/>bury the hatchet, make up, and organize on the plan as suggested by the Democratic leader. He suggested that the Greeks recognize only one representative in each Ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Prassinos suggested the two factions name two committees to work out a plan for cooperation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Babakapes said it is time for the Greeks to realize that it is not to their interest to depend on Mr. Sabath of the Democratic Party, and Mr. Romano of the Republican Party.</p>
   <p>At the request of Mr. Becharas, Mr. George Polos explained the task of trying to put Mr. Panteles on the Democratic ticket as candidate for judge. Mr. Becharas told how he had five hundred dollars ready as a deposit, and everything failed because no Ward Committeeman was there to support Mr. Panteles. Some others made different suggestions, but approved of the political work of a young Greek who was elected City Clerk of Roger's Park.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Bovramas declared that only through this organization of the Ward <pb facs="5422062_2_0243.jpg" n="6"/>representatives, and unity of all the Greek politicians, would Hellenism find its proper place, instead of being left aside as usual.</p>
   <p>The venerable old man, Mr. Salopoulos, requested permission to voice his opinion, reminded us of our national characteristics and racial faiths, and plead for unity and cooperation among all the Greek Democrats.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. John Prassas suggested that the committee of the old organization be admitted to the new organization. To this, Mr. Panteles was opposed, and declared that all the present organization would be absorbed by the old organization, and the subject of the Ward representatives to be elected by the Greek voters in each ward, would be defeated.</p>
   <p>This was an unacceptable proposition, and the president closed the meeting. The organization was left as originally created, with the various Ward representatives to be approved by the Ward Committeemen, and in case of disagreement, to be selected by them.</p>
