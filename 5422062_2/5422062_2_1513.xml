   <p>p. 5.- The Greeks of Chicago beside being successful in establishing and maintaining themselves in many thousands of retail stores of various lines, for many years, have also progressed as manufacturers, supplying their customers with different kinds of commodities. Lines, that the Greeks handle in a wholesale way, are: ice cream, dairies, laundries, metals, glass, paper, etc., and in them many hundreds of Greeks are working.</p>
   <p>One line that the Greeks overlooked was the manufacturing of linen supplies for their restaurant's great need. Because of this great need, the well known James Nicholopoulos (James Nichols), for many years in Chicago and owner of The Nichols Laundry Co., recently established The India Garment Mfg. Co., in Milwaukee, with Mavrogenes Bros. as partners.</p>
   <p>At their last meeting, the directors elected James Nichols as President. Mr. James Nichols is entitled to the community's sincere congratulations and its wish for the company's speedy expansion.</p>
   <p>From now on the Greeks should be proud of getting their supplies from the India Garment Mfg. Co.</p>
