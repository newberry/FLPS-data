   <p>The Chicago Tribune of June 29th, tells a miserable story of another Florida real estate explosion. And to the extreme amazement of the American people and also to the Greeks here and abroad, this thing was fathered by a former King of Greece. But, fortunately, this so-called monarch has been exiled by the intelligence of the Greeks, as the brains of Greece saw that Royal men and Royal women were incapable of furnishing them the kind of government Greece demands. Hence the King and his crowd were dismissed.</p>
   <p>A Florida land company, organized by bold and audacious Americans, but upon the idea of bringing an ex-royal king into their scheme, as they knew that one, George the Second, had been eliminated from his Royal Job by the intelligent and sane men of Greece.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0078.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Believing that this ex-king needed a "meal ticket," they induced him to join them in their enterprise. The land promoters had in mind many wealthy and influential men and women of the eastern shores of the United States, and realized that some of the big rich of America still had a craving for Royalty, as some silly Americans marry into this class. These promoters understood that if George the Second were in the game, it would enable them to fleece these lovers of Royalty, thereby gaining for themselves big sums of money, etc.</p>
   <p>Almost every human endeavor had been exhausted in selling Florida swamps, towns and what not. Happening to think of the ex-king and how his name would add to the sales, they caught little "George" in their net.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0079.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The promoters understood that kings and the like are parasites doing no useful service, and they showed him where he could make money out of his titles, ranks or patents or whatever kingly folk have to sell; including "divine rights," another asset claimed by Royalty. They persuaded the king to buy lands from them,extending all the credit he might wish. They agreed to furnish him the money to build house in which he must live, and after a time he could sell the house and make piles of money.</p>
   <p>King George fell for the suggestion, and the thing only failed of success, due to the financial panic which struck this Florida bubble like an enraged cyclone, knocking the bottom out of it.</p>
   <p>Friends of Greece, whether here or abroad, take notice of the act of this so-called king. Thank your lucky star that the intelligent citizenship of Greece has forever ended and eliminated Royalty, of the kind headed by George, or his sort.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0080.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>When a so-called king is willing and ready to swap his royal robes or power for mere money in the shape of Florida real estate, it is high time for all Greeks and Americans to scorn and stigmatize the name of king, nobleman, or another name that might contribute to such financial infamy. All honor to the Hellenic Republic. All honor to the men who killed the power and influence of the worthless wretches who imposed their Royal decrees on the Greek race, affronting the decency, culture, fame and education of this great people. A people of Demosthenes, Socrates, Pericles and all of the mighty ones who have passed, but whose names will emblazon the pages of history for all time.</p>
   <p>The ex-king George the Second should come to America and help sell the lands he caused gullible Americans to buy. His name caught these people and he should assist in extricating them from the financial dilemma in which they find themselves by believing in his Royalty. Long live the Hellenic Republic!</p>
