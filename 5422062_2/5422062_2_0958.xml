<title level="a">THE BULGARS FAIL TO BURGLARIZE THE BALKANS</title><title level="a" type="sub">By P. S. Lambros, Editor Greek Star.</title></bibl>

   <p>Although the present conflict between the Balkan States is rather surprising and slightly understood by the American people, it is, nevertheless, an event that can be traced easily when we take into consideration the fact that jealousy has always prevailed between the Balkan States and especially among the Bulgarians. The present contest grows out of their attempt to burglarize their former allies by demanding the lion's share of the spoils.</p>
   <p>It is furthermore a matter of natural consequence, that can be found even in this country; it is a jealousy among friends, as illustrated by the victorious Democrats, quarreling between themselves, as to who, or which faction shall receive the biggest political plums.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0959.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bulgaria should appear before the eyes of the American people as the Tammany Hall of New York - nothing but spoils would satisfy her. It was because the Bulgarians tried to be the Tammany of the Balkans they met with reverses and fell from the top to the bottom of the Balkan States.</p>
   <p>The war against Turkey was the war of the Cross against the Crescent - a war of civilization against barbarism. The result of it is that the Turks have been exterminated from Macedonia, Epirus, Thrace, Albania and the Aegean islands. With the exception of the small zone near Constantinople, the flag of the Cross is flying over European Turkey.</p>
   <p>This was the result of the bravery of their soldiers and the wisdom of the Balkan statesmen. At last after five centuries of eventful history, the Turk has been driven away from Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0960.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In view of the fact that the population of Turkey was 27,000,000, against 9,500,000 of the entire Balkan States, it was the general opinion that a war of that kind would be hopeless. But Turkey was caught unprepared. The most of her army was in Asia Minor. She tried to transport her troops, during the war, from Asia to European Turkey, but owing to the superiority of the Greek fleet the Turkish navy was crippled. Greece possessed an absolute control of the Aegean Sea and forced the Turk to remain within the borders of the Dardanelles in order to protect his capital from the attacks of the allies.</p>
   <p>So through the achievements of the Greek navy the strength of the Turkish army was reduced to an equality with that of the combined Balkan States. Through the heroic fighting of all the allies Turkey was beaten and demoralized.</p>
   <p>The Servians captured practically all the western territory of Macedonia; the Montenegrins also did their share manfully. The Greeks captured all <pb facs="5422062_2_0961.jpg" n="4"/>the eastern Macedonian territory up to and above Saloniki, besides nine islands and Epirus. The Bulgarians also fought heroic battles along Adrianople and the Thracian lines. After all these great victories of last autumn, a general opinion prevailed that the division of the spoils would be settled peacefully between the victors, or by the intermediation of the European powers. In consequence there was no sign of alarm anywhere.</p>
   <p>Even the Premier of Bulgaria, Mr. Geschoff, was in favor of such a settlement, but he was forced to resign, being succeeded by the warlike Dr. Daneff. Things after that took quite a change. The Bulgarians became swelled up with the uncensored publicity given to them in preference of the allies as a whole. They took themselves seriously and felt that they were really the conquerors of Turkey. The city of Saloniki was a nail in their eyes at all times. They demanded Saloniki from the Greeks and the lion's share from the Servians. They disregarded the fact that the Greeks and the Servians captured the most territory. They did not appreciate the <pb facs="5422062_2_0962.jpg" n="5"/>brotherly support extended to them by 75,000 Servian soldiers in helping them to capture Adrianople. They did not realize the fact that without the support of the Greek navy their victories would have been impossible.</p>
   <p>In spite of all protests made by the Greek and Servian governments, the new Premier of Bulgaria, with the assistance of Czar Ferdinand and the secret encouragement of Austria, declared a war against the former allies. The Bulgarian troops were ordered to march to Belgrade and Athens.</p>
   <p>The Greeks and the Servians decided to protect the territory won by their valor and the blood of their countrymen. Within the course of ten days Bulgaria was crushed, her army defeated and everywhere in retreat. She not only lost all her claims, but also most of the territory captured by the Bulgars from the Turks, together with the sea ports in the Aegean Sea which she demanded. Bulgaria, now on her last legs, just as badly humiliated as Turkey, is ready and willing to treat for peace at any cost.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0963.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>After the Bulgarians were beaten, Rumania stepped in to claim a certain strip of land along Sillistra - Bulgarian territory - promised to Rumania in the year 1878 when the St. Stefano treaty was signed after the Russian-Turkish war. One of the results of that war was the independence of Bulgaria.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, Turkey has ventured to resume the war, in spite of the fact that she had already signed the treaty in London. By taking advantage of the fighting among the former allies, Turkey attempts to extend her frontier farther than the gulf of Enos, the line fixed upon by the peace conference in London.</p>
   <p>It looks to be a mixed up affair, but it is not. The Turkish frontier has been drawn from Media to Enos and will remain the same in spite of the efforts of Turkey. Rumania will receive the territory she claims, first, because it has been promised, and secondly, because of her neutrality during the Balkan war. Servia will receive practically the <pb facs="5422062_2_0964.jpg" n="7"/>entire Western territory of Macedonia, while Greece will receive Epirus, Crete, nine Aegean Islands, and all the eastern Macedonian territory with all the sea ports besides Saloniki, which is the chief of the spoils.</p>
   <p>Bulgaria being the victim of poor advice and unwise rulers, besides the fanaticism and egoism of an insatiable people, will be greatly humiliated before the world. All her desire of the lion's share of the spoils, besides the great publicity and the Bulgarian styles adopted in this country, will be a dream of a summer night.</p>
   <p>"Who laughs last, laughs best."</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 22, 1913.</p>
