   <p>p. 2.- The movement of the coming elections has also started a movement among the Greek politicians of our city. They are inviting friends and planning various symposiums for the purpose of gathering masses of people, regardless of whether they vote or not, whether they belong to the specified ward, or whether they know a thing about politics.</p>
   <p>These political gatherings have no interest or no benefit, unless it be for the person who is doing the organizing. It is not a good thing for Greeks in Chicago because we are being kept back politically.</p>
   <p>These "patriotic" politicians of ours must realize that political organizations cannot be made over night during the pre-election days. Systematic energy and tireless efforts are needed and must be headed by the right person.</p>
   <p>These politicans must learn that politics is not merely notices in newspapers, programs scattered in Greek centers, and free passes to various <pb facs="5422062_2_0494.jpg" n="2"/>affairs. The Greek people must become interested in politics, but by another method. They are not making the right start and therefore will not get very far.</p>
