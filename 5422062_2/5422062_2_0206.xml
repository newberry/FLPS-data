   <p>p. 1.-The entertainment and dance given at the enchanting Aragon, by the Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization, for the benefit of the victims of infantile paralysis, was a Greek-American feast. It was the occasion of the birthday anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and it was an unprecedented success in the annals of our community.</p>
   <p>The Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization reached its peak on that night. It did so, not only because of its material success, but because of the presence of representatives of the Mayor, the Governor, the Prosecuting Attorney, and other City and State authorities. They have seen and confessed, that the Greeks really can accomplish things worth while. Whenever men of ability, will power and determination undertake to carry through an affair, it is a success. They are men who compose this Democratic organization, which has been recognized as a Greek factor by the authorities, and has obtained, in addition, the appointments of Greeks to political positions.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0207.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We would not miss this opportunity to emphasize the fact that, along with the Executive Council of the organization, the Star has contributed to the success of this benevolent purpose, and to the support of our compatriots. It has left no stone unturned, spared no effort, and it went as far as to secure the written endorsement of our Honorable Mayor, Edward J. Kelly, who expressed his hope for the success of the affair, and congratulated the organization for its philanthropic gesture.</p>
   <p>On this point we wish to remind you that we are not forgetful of the response the organization has made by thanking us over the radio, and by a resolution in a public meeting to thank the Star. This resolution was published, with pleasure, in the last issue.</p>
   <p>Thus, this political organization, and the Star, have proved without any doubt that, regardless of political beliefs, we must be united, in order to make our strength fest to greater purpose. So we attain good results for good causes, and the recognition of our race.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0208.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On this subject, in particular, the Star wishes to state, and this for the sake of truth, that when within an organization, there is even one individual with will power, vigor, and courage, who wants to accomplish something it can be done, when the rest of the members recognize him, follow him, and ask him to "Let us go".</p>
   <p>This Democratic organization must consider itself fortunate in, having as its spokesman and main lever, the diligent and energetic young man, Mr. James A. Geroulis, Secretary. Mr. Geroulis graduated from the Greek school, Socrates, went to high school, and University. At the University he studied law. After graduating he passed his Bar examination successfully and in a short time became Assistant Corporation Counsel in the City Hall.</p>
   <p>This brilliant young man is enjoying fully the universal esteem of the Greeks, and those of the organization in particular, and he has a first class record as legal Counselor, being respected by the Americans also.</p>
   <p>Judging from signs all around the horizon, we see that the star of Mr. James A. Geroulis is destined to shine brightly and that he is to raise himself to eminence for the benefit of this Greek Community, where he first saw the sunlight, and gradually will take his place as an important factor in the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
