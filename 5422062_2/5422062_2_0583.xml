   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The police department of Chicago has decided to close up all gambling houses and all hotels used as brothels. Raids by police on all suspicious places is the everyday routine.</p>
   <p>Among the gambling houses there was one on Halsted Street known under the name of Minerva, which is frequented mostly by Greeks. The owner, was the Italian Lawrence Mangano, leader of the Sicilians and the Italian gang in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Police Captain Garrick, who raided the gambling house of Mangano came pretty near paying for this raid with the life of his wife. She suffers with a heart ailment and has been near death from the shock of a dynamite explosion which also seriously damaged their home immediately following the raid.</p>
   <p>This bold attack of Mangano's gangsters forced police to arrest Mangano as morally guilty of the perpetration of the act. But before Mangano could <pb facs="5422062_2_0584.jpg" n="2"/>be brought to trial and proven guilty, Lombardo, the leader of another Italian gang, was murdered in the most centrally located spot of Chicago, before the eyes of thousands of spectators, and the murderers disappeared.</p>
   <p>Italian gangs, having been dissolved in Italy long ago, are active now in Chicago and terrorize citizens, undisturbed even by the authorities.</p>
   <p>It is understood that this audacity on the part of the Italian gunners and dynamiters is due mainly to the support of politicians, who not only do not prosecute them, but even use them as their tools.</p>
   <p>Lately, the evil has been increased and the crimes have become so flagrant that it was decided that organized crime must go, that public safety must be maintained.</p>
