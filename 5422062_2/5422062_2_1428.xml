   <p>The natural slack which followed the Christmas orgy of shopping has caused many of our businessmen to suffer pangs of fear over the future condition of their business. Their great and universal fear is that the economic crisis may force them out of business...</p>
   <p>For several years we have been hearing that the number of Greek stores in Chicago is rapidly diminishing, and that the Greeks are losing all their money and property. The truth of the matter is that no one can say with certainty what is happening to the Greeks economically because Greek enterprises have never been systematically listed, and there is neither basis for comparison nor argument, pro or con.</p>
   <p>A systematic, careful count cannot be made by any one individual or group.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1429.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even if one person should try to make such a list of Greek statistics he would probably not receive enough co-operation to be able to publish or compile his findings. Work of such a nature requires the co-operation of the entire group if it is to be of any value. To the Greeks these things are like higher mathematics, although they are fundamentals to even the smallest American community. We, the Greeks of Chicago, have thousands of business establishments. But have we even one efficient organization to co-ordinate our activities and protect our rights?</p>
   <p>We have nine churches and parishes, two large organizations, and at least a hundred clubs of every description. In the face of this, it is shameful to admit our lack of a center, or bureau of information, in which could be accumulated important facts and statistics, to be given out on occasion, and which could serve as headquarters for influential and unified political activity. Such an organization could give helpful advice to businessmen, and thus give them the added courage which is derived from a feeling of greater security.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1430.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Such organizations exist in every city and town in America and are called Chambers of Commerce. Even the most backward village in Greece boasts of a businessclub. The Greeks in America--and we refer especially to the ones in Chicago--are still in the dark about such matters.</p>
   <p>Our constantly complaining businessmen, who protest that they are always being taxed or asked to contribute to one organization or another, are nothing but bad-tempered people. ....The Greek merchants who deal exclusively with Greeks are exceptions to this statement, for they pay very heavily for the patronage they receive, in the form of donations to a hundred charities, benefits, churches and.....We know, that all business places are forced to contribute to various philanthropic causes if they are to possess the trust and good-will of the communities they serve. It would be more to the point if, instead of giving money to the various organizations--political societies, for example--they would each spend ten dollars a year for the maintenance <pb facs="5422062_2_1431.jpg" n="4"/>of a Greek Chamber of Commerce. Such a move would strengthen the political influence of the Greeks for more than the support of various petty officials.</p>
