   <p>With great joy we present in our columns one of the few Greek professionals with the wisdom of Aristotle. From a small boy George Drosos liked to study. At ten he finished the public school in Milious and went to the Great National Academy.</p>
   <p>I remember George well while at school. I was a small boy then and he would help us all with our harder problems. He showed remarkable teaching ability from the very start and was always at the head of his class.</p>
   <p>After he received his diploma he taught in various schools and, at the outbreak of the war, he joined the army.</p>
   <p>One day in a Saloniki newspaper, the Light, I read that G. J. Drosos was elected chief of the Saloniki teachers at an educational convention.</p>
   <p>Like many of my countrymen I found my way to America, and here in Chicago I found my friend, George Drosos. He said he was a teacher at Socrates <pb facs="5422062_2_1340.jpg" n="2"/>School, yet was continuing his studies at the University of Chicago. He invited me to his school and I went. As far as I can say, it was a model classroom.</p>
   <p>Last month at the University of Chicago I witnessed the graduating exercises of George Drosos, Bachelor of Philosophy in Education. I want to present this man to you to show how lucky Chicago and especially Socrates School is to have him in our midst.</p>
