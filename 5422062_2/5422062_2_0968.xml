   <p>Chicago, Oct. 23.</p>
   <p>To the Editor:</p>
   <p>The treaty of the Balkan states, to strike at Turkey and shake off the tyrant's yoke, is, indeed, a divine inspiration.</p>
   <p>The Balkans had peaceably waited for the putting into effect the reforms according to the Berlin treaty, through which they would assure the safety of the Christians under the Ottoman yoke, but they had waited in vain since June 1880, when the treaty was signed by the European powers and was accepted by Turkey.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0969.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Ever since that time the Christian population never ceased to suffer. The horrible massacre of Adana, the Turkish atrocities in Asia Minor and Constantinople, the brutalities in Macedonia and other parts have won the name of "the great assassin" bestowed upon the Turk by Gladstone.</p>
   <p>Millions of Greeks, Bulgarians, Servians, Armenians and others have been signing under the tyrannic yoke, thousands of innocent children had fallen under the sword of the enemy and the European powers had shown the utmost apathy.</p>
   <p>Turkey had been promising the reforms again and again, Europe had taken up the matter again and again, but owing to the existing jealousy between the powers, who do not want to dismember Turkey, the atrocities went on all over the Empire.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0970.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Under the most intolerable conditions the matter could not be settled in any other way than by a war of Christianity against barbarism.</p>
   <p>If Europe did not dare to touch the integrity of the unspeakable Turk, if Europe overlooked its duty toward peace, civilization and humanity, it was the duty of the Balkan states to undertake the great responsibility and declare war against Turkey in order to show to the world that they care for the honor and lives of their compatriots under the yoke.</p>
   <p>Could a nation with a national spirit and ambition do it in any other way than through fire? No!</p>
   <p>Now we hear the cannons roaring against the barbarian, we hear that Christianity is triumphing and driving the enemy away, and we soon will hear that the crescent will be humiliated and that Christianity will triumph over the Ottoman empire.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Editor of the Greek Star.</p>
