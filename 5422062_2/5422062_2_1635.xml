   <p>The "South Town Fruit and Grocers Association" which was recently formed, was honored last week, with a banquet given by the Anheuser Busch Inc.</p>
   <p>Mr. Walter A. Busch member of the famous family was presiding at the festivity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Konstantine Palaiologos outlined the moral and material benefits of the Association, and urged the Greeks to thoroughly Americanize their business systems as the only possible way to progress and success, and in convincing words brought out the achievements and wealth of United States of America, in contraposition to ten other countries combined. He also pointed out that the object of the Greek immigrant, who comes in to this country, is to create a fortune. Therefore, in order to lift ourselves above the stage of merely living, we must take the example set by the people of our new Country, as regards to union and system, in this way, said Mr. Palaiologos,,will we achieve our aim. We must follow the adage "when you are in Rome, do as the Romans do", and when in America work, live, and do business as the Americans do; in order to live in harmony with the established rules of American Society, and be successful in our enterprizes.</p>
