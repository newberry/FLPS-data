   <p>In a previous issue, the Saloniki printed an editorial which discussed an insult to the American flag by a Greek.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, some Greek men employed by the Illinois Steel Company, discovered in a conversation with Sam Pappas, one of their fellow employees, that he was the Greek who had insulted the American flag in such a vile manner. No sooner had they made this discovery than they decided to hang this man who had sullied the honor and reputation of the Greeks. The preparations were complete, and Pappas would surely have suffered the fate he so richly deserved if the police had not intervened. They took Pappas to the police station, where he will answer to the judge for his dastardly and dishonorable action.</p>
