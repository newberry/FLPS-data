   <p>The Greek people of Chicago and vicinity have proven themselves to be wholeheartedly aligned with the Americans, in the war against the Prussian autocracy. Their purchase of Liberty Bonds is sufficient evidence to justify the above statement. The Liberal League of Chicago, succeeded in collecting $100,000 in subscriptions at a meeting held in the Coliseum. The purchasers of these Bonds were not wealthy people; they were fruit vendors and common laborers.</p>
   <p>To date, October 24, the Greeks of Chicago have purchased over $300,000 worth of Liberty Bonds; and there is a strong indication that their subscriptions will go over the $500,000 mark in a shorttime. The American Government has already expressed its pleasure and pride in the Greek people for exhibiting such fine patriotism....</p>
   <p>There are over 25,000 Greeks in Chicago, and close examination will reveal that the majority of them subscribed for small bonds of fifty and one hundred <pb facs="5422062_2_0805.jpg" n="2"/>dollar denominations, to be paid for in weekly amounts. This indicates that the working class is firmly behind the Government.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Raklios, owner of a large chain of restaurants, says that he and all his employees have pledged themselves to purchase over twenty thousand dollars worth of bonds.</p>
