   <p>P. 6.- The Greek-Americans of Chicago, upholding the present Mayor of Chicago, have formed an organization to be known as The Greek-American Thompson Organization.</p>
   <p>In a meeting held last week they formed a regular Club and elected their permanent officers. Those elected are: Nick Canellis, President; Christ Smirlin, Nicholas Spiro, Constantine Licouris, P.K. Simades and George Primpas, Vice-presidents; Louis Nigal, Secretary and Spiros Campas, treasurer. The advisory board consists of Daniel King, G. Patris, G. Canellis and Harry Broumas.</p>
   <p>After the formation of the club the committee arranged for a meeting, where the Mayor was to be asked to address his Greek followers in the city.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mayor Thompson honored the Greeks by consenting to appear before them and address them in the council chamber on Friday evening, January 31st. Over 500 Greeks, on a two day notice, were there to greet the Mayor. Mr. George Patris, member of the advisory board, presided.</p>
   <p>The Mayor's appearance set the whole gathering wild with joy and enthusiasm: the acclamation lasting for five minutes. The Mayor spoke for more than an hour in his usual forceful manner and held the audience spellbound with his eloquence.</p>
   <p>The assembly passed the resolution indorsing the candidacy of Mayor Thompson 100 per cent, for his 100 percent fulfillment of every pledge he made and for reducing the death rate and crime. Mayor Thompson promised that he will try to give work instead of dole to working people.</p>
