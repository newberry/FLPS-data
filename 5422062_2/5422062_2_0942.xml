   <p>The Chicago Examiner sponsored a mass meeting of the Bulgarians of Chicago at the Opera House last week. Miss Jane Addams, the director of Hull House, a great friend of the Greek people and noted philanthropist, was also asked to sponsor this meeting, whose purpose, it was claimed, was purely charitable.</p>
   <p>The official sponsor, The Chicago Examiner, thought that it was supporting a great cause when it appealed to the American people to give material and moral aid to the victims and sufferers in Bulgaria. If the people of Chicago only knew the barbarous atrocities and inhuman massacres that the despicable Bulgarians have perpetrated in Macedonia and Thrace against the defenseless and innocent Greek women and children in those regions, they would be very reluctant to offer any sort of aid.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0943.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of course, we do not say that the widows, orphans, and wounded in Bulgaria should not be helped by the Red Cross and other charitable agencies. This newspaper feels that it is obliged to protect the Greek name and the high standing of the Greek people of Chicago by warning both Miss Addams and The Chicago Examiner against the Bulgarian accusation that the Greeks also have wantonly massacred innocent women and children and sowed desolation and destruction in Thrace and Macedonia before and during the recently concluded Balkan Wars.</p>
   <p>We Greeks in Chicago, indeed all American Greeks, have gained a good reputation among the American people by virtue of our way of life, our activities, and our extraordinary qualities. We must do everything in our power to fight any and every influence that tries to undermine our national honor.</p>
   <p>In this particular instance, the good Greek people of Chicago desire to enlighten Miss Jane Addams, the main speaker at the Bulgarian mass meeting, as well as The Examiner by asking them to accept only the truth in regard to the <pb facs="5422062_2_0944.jpg" n="3"/>cause and results of the Greco-Bulgarian wars.</p>
   <p>The publisher of Saloniki visited the offices of The Chicago Examiner and appealed for an impartial, honorable, and fair treatment of the Greek people in the face of Bulgarian accusations and hatred, and Bulgarian propaganda. Unfortunately, our personal appeal to the editors of The Examiner was not heeded.</p>
   <p>Then we decided to appeal to the staunch friend of our people and world-renowned humanitarian, Miss Jane Addams, for moral support. Mr. Milton Hunt, her secretary, listened to our just complaints with great patience. He admitted, to his sorrow, that great injustice is being done the Greek people. Mr. Hunt brought the matter to the attention of Miss Addams, who promised the Greek people her wholehearted support.</p>
   <p>Indeed, those who read the malicious and sycophantic writings in The Examiner before the mass meeting was called, believed that the same attacks would <pb facs="5422062_2_0945.jpg" n="4"/>be made against the Greeks at the Opera House last week. Thus, The Examiner would find another opportunity to repeat its shameless accusations against the Greeks. The timely intercession of Miss Jane Addams, however, upon the appeal of Saloniki to Mr. Hunt, to whom we are deeply grateful, saved us from a dangerous attack. The result was that the mass meeting as a whole assumed more or less of a charitable character. There were quite a few hints of massacres, destruction, and mutilations, but never was the Greek name mentioned openly.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, much was heard about the Serbians and Turks and many bitter remarks were directed against them, but no one dared attach any stigma to the Greek name.</p>
   <p>Once again has this powerful newspaper, the champion and defender of the national Greek cause--this paper which is adorned by the glorious name of Saloniki, our holy citadel of the North--emerged triumphant.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0946.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Such was the victory that Saloniki won against the Bulgarian propagandists in Chicago. The sad failure of the much-publicized mass meeting sponsored by The Examiner for the benefit of the Bulgarians will seal the mouths of all pro-Bulgarians.</p>
   <p>The effectiveness of Saloniki's efforts to protect our honor and our national pride proves that the Hellenic element of Chicago is powerful enough to stop the Bulgarian attacks against us, and to defeat any enemy who would dare to insult or disgrace us.</p>
