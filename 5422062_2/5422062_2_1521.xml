   <p>Among the Greeks of Chicago there are a few men who decided the future of the rest of the Greeks who came later. One of these earlier Greeks is the well-known florist from Afisou, Sparta, John Venizelos (Mangel). Mr. Venizelos, one of the first Greeks to come to Chicago, arrived in 1884. During all these years, he has managed to build up one of the largest flower trades in Chicago. He is well-known and well-liked by everybody. His name is always heard in connection with charities and benefits and every year on Good Friday, he decorates the sepulcher of Christ in all the Greek churches.</p>
   <p>Every distinguished visitor from Greece receives a beautiful bouquet of flowers from him. When Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos was in Chicago his rooms were constantly filled with fresh flowers - a gift from John Venizelos.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1522.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He is very much in demand by the Americans who like the way he decorates church weddings and receptions.</p>
   <p>At present Mr. Venizelos lives in Wilmette. His family consists of his wife, a son, and three daughters. We wish him continued progress in the future.</p>
