   <p>The N. R. A. is a start in the reform of the capitalistic order. Its initial mistakes can be corrected by "trial and error". It will discover better methods as it proceeds. Already it has abolished child labor and has tackled sweatshop labor. It has made a beginning in its effort to outlaw cutthroat competition, while preserving reasonable competition, for protection of the consuming public. While suspending at least some of the provisions of antitrust laws, its aims and purpose are the same as these--the prevention of monopoly.</p>
   <p>All of these things pertain to normal industrialism, and not to emergency situations in particular. There is no certainty that the N. R. A. has facilitated business recovery. In fact, in some ways it may have impeded and slowed up a recovery that was coming through natural forces. But recovery merely to all the evils, abuses, and sufferings of the "old order" <pb facs="5422062_2_0993.jpg" n="2"/>is not what the country hopes for. Economic planning for a long term rather than for a critical occasion is desirable, probably even necessary, if capitalism is to remain the ruling system.</p>
   <p>The American people do not desire to "get back" but to "get forward" to something better. The N. R. A. is chiefly significant as an effort in this direction.</p>
