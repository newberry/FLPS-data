   <p>P.1. The political activities for the coming election are gaining momentum and Greeks are showing interest in the candidates of their party.</p>
   <p>The Greek-American Organization of the Republican Party will start its pre-election campaign activities with a splendid banquet in honor of Robert E. Crowe, States Attorney, to be given at the Palmer House, March 11th. All Greek Republicans are expected to be there to show their political strength.</p>
   <p>We have often called attention in these columns to the fact that participation of Greeks in politics in America is imperative, because failure to participate results not only in indifference, but also in ignorance regarding their interests. To participate in politics means to support one's general and private interests. Besides general interests, everyone has his own private interests which need political support; and in order to have political support, we must participate in the activities of the country and come in contact with the political personages who are seeking our help in the political struggle.</p>
   <p>One of these political personages, Robert E. Crowe, States Attorney, has held his office for many years. The idea of a political banquet in his honor is a <pb facs="5422062_2_0275.jpg" n="2"/>happy one, and we have no doubt that all Greeks belonging to the Republican Party will be present to demonstrate their political strength.</p>
