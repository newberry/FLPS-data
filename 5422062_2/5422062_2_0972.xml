   <p>It is impossible to separate Herbert Hoover from his background. He is unforgettably the President who heralded the imminent abolition of poverty at a time when the country blindly tottered on the brink of what was to be the greatest economic disaster, the greatest period of poverty, of modern times.</p>
   <p>There is no use in saying he was no more blind than anyone else in those days. He was and he wasn't. His own advisory council had raised the question of the economic cycle. They had proposed measures for meeting an expected depression--measures which were left to gather dust in the Commerce Department pigeonholes.</p>
   <p>We often wonder what would have happened in and to America if a man of Roosevelt's caliber had not made his appearance at the critical monent.</p>
