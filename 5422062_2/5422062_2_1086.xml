   <p>Mr. Peter S. Lambros, Chicago</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: I received the article which you sent me on Linclon and Pericles. I read this with great interest last Sunday, and I have heard several very nice compliments on it. It is certainly a very able article and brings out clearly the ideals of each of these men.</p>
   <p>You no doubt know that I was born and reared in the South. In fact, I was born only a few miles from the birthplace of Linclon, and while the South's idea of him is considerably different from what the North imagines, still we believe that he was not always unquestionably right. No one doubts that the outcome of the Civil War was for the best, and the South accepted it gracefully but did most seriously complain of the [North's] actions after the war. Of course Linclon was in no way responsible for them, for he was not in power at that time.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1087.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I have frequently read the speeches of Lincoln and Pericles, and I have heretofore been struck with the similarity of thought. Sometimes the expressions seem so much alike that one might almost conclude that Lincoln's words were almost a copy of those of Pericles.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Edward L. English</p>
