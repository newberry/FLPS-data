   <p>We are very pleased to announce that Dr. Harry Fournarakis has been made Associate Professor of Gynecological Surgery at the Chicago Medical School. Not only will this young Greek professor conduct his routine classes; he will also lecture to a special group interested in female anatomy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fournarakis finished high school in his home town, Messinia, and then attended the University of Athens. He graduated from there with honors and practiced medicine for a short period. Later he was made house doctor of the Evangelismos, the largest public hospital in Athens.</p>
   <p>Having gone to Paris to do further research work on his thesis "La Cesarienne vaginale," he was given the title Assistant Etranger of the University of Paris.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1241.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later he went to London to study advanced hospital methods and clinic procedure.</p>
   <p>The doctor is to be commended, for, although he has been here in America but a few months, he has succeeded in obtaining an enviable position in an American medical school.</p>
