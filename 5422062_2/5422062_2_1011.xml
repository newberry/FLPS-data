   <p>p. 4- Altogether different is that propaganda which promotes social reform and aims at an object essentially pacific, the settling of disputes between employer and employee.</p>
   <p>Between the former and the latter, before the World War, mountains of prejudice existed which have gradually, one after another, been removed. To-day, in spite of extreme cases, the two main factors of national production are beginning to perceive that their interests are combined.</p>
   <p>They arebeginning to be convinced that a solution favorable to either side, when obtained by struggle, is more injurious than a direct understanding, even if the latter does not immediately fulfill the demands of both sides. Opposite views sometimes prove to be identical. From now on, thanks to the existence and operation of the International Labor Office, there will be another factor, benevolent and unselfish, namely, the state - the state as arbitrator, as counselor, as punisher.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1012.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Performing these functions and others besides, though these are the most important from the social viewpoint, the state, which constitutes the organic miniature of the nation and represents objectively all the interests of the citizens, will have as its mission not only to regulate individual interests with the interest of the whole but also to be the vigorous advocate of justice for every suppressed class.</p>
   <p>All this, it is understood, will become a reality if the workers do not slumber but on the contrary are alert and elect representatives who understand the workers' views, above all, men not inclined to sell their votes to the highest bidder.</p>
