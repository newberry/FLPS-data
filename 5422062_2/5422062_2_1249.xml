   <p>It is rare for Greeks--despite their great progressiveness and ability--to achieve nation-wide recognition in any particular field. This is exactly what the well-known Greek doctor of orthopedics has accomplished. The name Emmanuel Demeur (Demertzi Dakis) is familiar to Greeks and Americans alike.</p>
   <p>Dr. Demeur was born in Karpatho, Greece, where he lived the first years of his life. Later on, he graduated from the Evangelical School of Smyrna. At the age of eighteen he emigrated to America and came to Chicago. Here he engaged in various forms of menial labor to earn his living; but his eagerness to study never left him. He attended various schools and finally became interested in surgery--especially in relation to correction of the feet. He graduated in 1920 and opened an office in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Little by little Dr. Demeur began to receive the recognition of his associates.</p>

   <p>Last year, when the leading Orthopedists in the country held their annual meeting he was elected president of their organization. And this year, at their convention in the Morrison Hotel, Dr. Demeur was again elected president.</p>
