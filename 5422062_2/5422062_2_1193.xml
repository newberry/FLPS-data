   <p>The Greeks of today still maintain the habits and customs of the Ancient Greeks in regards to health.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of the past considered, bathing as a daily routine, washing their hands before and after meals. They believed that a cold bath was a topic to the body and mind, and a hot bath, refreshing.</p>
   <p>Dancing was a necessary prerequisite in building and maintaining their Demi-god body and beauty. Marriage was performed by aesthetic dancing and music, just as much as today. The ancient Creteans danced very much before their Patron Goddess, while the Rhapsodists sang and played the Lyre.</p>
   <p>In the "Homeric Era" the Greeks were eating three meals per day. The breakfast was very early, and consisted mostly of bread soaked in wine. The Greeks paid much attention to the first meal, they believed that no one should leave the house in the morning without eating. Let us hear what Ulysses said to Achilles.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1194.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Although you are as brave as God, -Oh! Achilles,-do not command the sons of Ahaion to fall upon the Trojans, before they eat their breakfast, for the battle will be of long duration, but command them to eat bread and wine in the morning, for that gives them strength and courage."</p>
   <p>It is known that the Greeks after the battle, were eating all night.</p>
   <p>The main and principal meal took place at noon, and consisted of bread boiled or barbecued meat, vegetables, cheese, and fruit. The meals were very salty, and Homer called salt, a divine substance, and called Barbarians these who used no salt.</p>
   <p>The evening meal took place at sunset; it was very simple, and consisted mostly of fruit.</p>
   <p>On holidays at marriages, or when they were receiving a foreign dignitary. the ancient Greeks were famous for their Symposiums at which they ate plenty.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1195.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Therefore, we see Alkinoos giving a Symposium in honor of Ulysses ordering twelve lambs to be slaughtered, eight hogs and two steers. Homer, in order to show the gluttony of the Pylious, tells us that for a Symposium of fifty persons they slaughtered nine cows; that is to says one cow for six persons. And thus, we see that Agamemnon at a Symposium offered to Ajax, the whole shoulder of a steer.</p>
   <p>The Greeks drank water, wine, and milk. They considered wine as a tonic, and offered it to the wounded. Nevertheless, the Greeks abstained from drunkedness, which is the case even today amongst Greeks the world over. The Ancients knew the bad results of debauchery and abborred that; as we see that the word drunk, was considered to be a very insulting and offensive word. We see the cunning Ulysses, giving Polyphimos wine to get him drunk; and Homer tells us the result of that drunkedness.</p>
   <p>"The bent bestial neck of the sleeping cannibal (Polyphimos) from whose mouth wine and pieces of human flesh came out."</p>
   <p>The Ancient Greeks were very clean and lovers of hygeine. The Greeks of today follow the steps of the ancients, and differ very little, if at all.</p>
