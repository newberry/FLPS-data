   <p>The Greek professional ranks of Chicago, indeed all of our people, are happy and proud to welcome five new brilliant university graduates and members of the medical and legal professions to our great Greek community. These men distinguished themselves in their college studies and in their final examinations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Emmanuel Apostolides obtained his Doctor of Medicine degree from Loyola University. Mr. Andrew Petrakogiannis obtained his Doctor of Dentistry degree from Northwestern University. Messrs. Andrew Vlachos and George Kyriacopoulos were each presented with a J. D., or Doctor of Jurisprudence, degree from Northwestern University. Mr. Paul Demos distinguished himself as a brilliant student during his two years in the law school of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Saloniki wishes to extend its hearty congratulations to its friends and new professional men. It wishes them success and the best of luck in their careers.</p>

   <p>All of us must be very happy to see that our young Greek community of Chicago is already making excellent progress in the sciences and professions.</p>
