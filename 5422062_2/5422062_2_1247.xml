   <p>The Greek Press is continually given the privilege of printing the accomplishments of Greek men and women in colleges and universities. The large number of university graduates among the Greeks each year is a good indication of the upward trend of our people.</p>
   <p>We take an added pleasure in writing about Athanasios Fournarakis, not only because this boy, who is only twenty-two, graduated from the De Paul Law School at such an early age, but also because he took the bar examinations immediately, instead of waiting until November, as is the custom. This practice is followed, as a rule, in order to enable the applicant to study in preparation for them, since they are very difficult.</p>
   <p>This young Greek professional is the brother of the well-known Mrs. Christopher Yioha. She helped her brother achieve his success and made many sacrifices <pb facs="5422062_2_1248.jpg" n="2"/>in the interest of his education. We are sure that Mr. Fournarakis will achieve many more successes in his future life.</p>
