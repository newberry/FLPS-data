   <p>p. 1--The American people and all naturalized foreigners will be called upon a month from now to elect a new President to govern this land of liberty and plenty.</p>
   <p>Nominees for the high position are Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Parker, Republican and Democratic candidates respectively. Both these distinguished men are beyond reproach. But facts speak louder than arguments, and we find that America is proud and honored to have as President Mr. Roosevelt, who is a noted statesman, soldier, historian, author, and orator, a true American in soul and a universalist in spirit. In his administration he has revealed to the world the tremendous power of the United States and the greatness of American liberty and justice, and he commands the respect of all nations.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0204.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Democratic party, advancing as its candidate the eminent jurist, Mr. Parker, may contend that his experienced judicial mind is better capable of governing the country than Mr. Roosevelt is, but a judicial mind alone is not sufficient to govern and administer the internal affairs of the whole country and maintain the dignity and the prestige of the country abroad.</p>
   <p>The prosperity, welfare, and vital existence of a nation depend not only on its internal administration but also on its foreign relations. This country, before McKinley came into power, was in spite of its greatness and its brilliancy practically unkown, unnoticed, and unrecognized as a great Republic.</p>
   <p>The Star of Chicago, as the teacher and the property of the Greeks in America, urgently presents to them the importance of electing Mr. Theodore Roosevelt and requests them to cast their votes for the greatest man among contemporary Americans.</p>
