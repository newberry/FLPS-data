<title level="a">CHICAGO'S NEW MAYOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Monday Chicago witnessed one of the greatest victory parades in its history. The occasion was the formal induction of William Hale Thompson into the office of Mayor of the second largest city of our great adopted country.</p>
   <p>Seventy-five thousand people took part in the parade, in which all the foreign-language groups of Chicago were well represented. Our prominent fellow countryman and successful florist, John Venizelos, had beautifully decorated the car in which Mayor Thompson was riding. A huge--and, indeed, an unexpected--number of Greeks took part in the parade.</p>
   <p>The triumphant chorus of the parade was, "Prosperity is coming". In his address, Mayor Thompson promised the people of this city that a twenty-two-million-dollar public works program will be launched immediately. He admitted that there are one hundred and fifty thousand men unemployed in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0180.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The new chief of police announced that, at the order of the Mayor, the city will be cleared of all robbers and criminals, and that law and order will be restored very shortly. Measures are now being taken to close the saloons on Sundays.</p>
   <p>Chicago will thus have a new political order--an efficient and progressive municipal government, which we hope will greatly benefit and serve the people of this great metropolis of the Midwest. Incidentally, we are indeed proud to say that 25,000 Greeks do business and live happily in this great center of industry and finance.</p>
