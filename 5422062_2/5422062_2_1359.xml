   <p>The ranks of Greek professional men of Chicago, have been enriched by the presence of Mr. George Kyriakopoulos. He is a native of the town of Tripoli, Greece, and is thirty years of age. He studied law at Hamilton College, Chicago, where he received his degree.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos has lived in Chicago for the last thirteen years, and is well known and respected by the entire Greek community. He is the founder of the Greek Restaurant Association of Chicago and is honorary president of that organization. Mr. Kyriakopoulos is also president of the Post "A" of the Pan-Hellenic Union of Chicago. With such a record behind him, the horizon looks bright to Mr. Kyriakopoulos as he embarks upon his chosen career.</p>
   <p>To those who already know him he needs no introduction; to those who do not know him, we say that he is a dependable, honest, trustworthy individual.</p>
