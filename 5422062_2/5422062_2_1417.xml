  <body>
   <p>News has come from New York City that the restaurant men of that city, in a mass meeting, decided unanimously to raise the price of menus to cover the increased cost of food. This increase amounts to five or ten cents per dinner. The New York restaurants have been suffering severe losses due to the increase of overhead expenses.....</p>
   <p>We do not know just exactly how the restaurateurs of Chicago--the majority of whom are Greeks--feel about this action of their business associates. However, we do know that the Restaurant Association, which is supposed to protect the Chicago Greek restaurants has done nothing, although it is obvious that the situation is just as bad here as [if not worse] it is in New York. Therefore, it is time that vicious antagonism cease and steps be taken to achieve more unity, co-operation and stability.....Of late, a restaurant has been but a source of worry to its harassed owner, although, by right, it should be a source of material gain.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Writing the above paragraphs has caused a chain of thoughts to go through my mind. The entire picture of the economic life of the restaurants in Chicago and their problems presents itself to me. The number of Greek restaurateurs of this city who have been in business for many years runs into thousands. The last few years have made it obvious that they can be classified in two ways. One class is composed of those who persist in following antiquated and backward methods in the conduct of their business. They are the ones who recoil from any new method or basic change.</p>
   <p>The other group takes an entirely different attitude. It is composed of progressive, wide-awake, businessmen who are forever seeking to better themselves. The businessmen included in the first category do not fulfill the demands of their clientele. Therefore, the added burden of the depression pronounced their doom. If they do not immediately alter their methods the majority of them will suffer economic death, and those who survive will be <pb facs="5422062_2_1419.jpg" n="3"/>ailing economically for the rest of their business lives. The latter group, despite the effects of the depression, are making every effort to serve their customers the best food at reasonable prices and in a congenial atmosphere.....They synchronize themselves with the rapidly changing times as much as possible.</p>
   <p>Just as it is easy for an enterprise to be annihilated and removed from the economic arena by a series of minor errors, so it is difficult to remove from that arena an establishment which is careful not to make those small, but costly, mistakes. Even the most ignorant mind without the slightest idea of restaurant management, can perceive that he is not economizing by forcing his employees to wear their soiled uniforms in order to save on weekly laundry bills. A lady or gentleman who sees dirty, stained uniforms on the help may return once more to the same place; but if the same condition is still in evidence nine times out of ten a customer has been chased away.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this is not the only fault of the first group. Cleanliness <pb facs="5422062_2_1420.jpg" n="4"/>was placed first because this largely depends upon the orders of the owner. He must comprehend that today's eating place is supposed to be as immaculate as a hospital. Employees who neglect to shave, and waitresses who use powder instead of soap should not be allowed to serve the public.</p>
   <p>Perhaps all this seems radical and extreme, but that is not the case. We do not want to forget to mention the washrooms of the restaurants. What can a customer think about a restaurant whose washroom is badly ventilated, badly lighted and without clean towels and soap; in which the faucets are either broken or furnish only ice-cold water; where the clothes of the employees are piled on one hanger or draped over a broken chair?.....What will he think of it if--to top all this--he gets a glimpse of its chef and dishwasher, each wearing a filthy apron and having unwashed face and hands?</p>
   <p>In the light of his impressions from the washroom and the kitchen, you can easily understand why so many Greeks complain about the smallness of the American appetite. It is a wonder any customer ever has any appetite left.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1421.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Every restaurant must have a washroom--it should really have two--which is airy, clean, well-supplied with soap and towels, and attractively decorated. It should be provided with mirrors and good lighting facilities, just as the washroom in a home. A good impression must be made upon the customer if he is to be retained.</p>
   <p>It is not possible to eradicate all of the mistakes made by Greek restaurant owners in one or two years. But it can be accomplished if some program of enlightenment and guidance is followed by them as a group. The main essentials are cleanliness, good service, courteous employees, and the purchase of good meats. These requirements can easily be met without undue expense, and will greatly increase patronage.</p>
