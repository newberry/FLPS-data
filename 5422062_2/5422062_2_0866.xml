   <p>There is no Greek in America whose blood does not race at the declaration of war between America and Mexico. Many Greeks from all over America have made public statements of their sincere willingness to fight for the honor of the Stars and Stripes as gallantly as they would for the blue and white of Greece.</p>
   <p>The Greeks have always been characterized by idealism and honor, and are recognized and lauded as true patriots. This patriotic sense is not dead in the Greek-Americans. Fifty thousand Greek-Americans fought in the first lines of attack, and conquered the Turks and Bulgarians. They emerged victorious at the Ioannina. Victory was also theirs at Thessalonike and Kilkis.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0867.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Truly great achievements, our readers will say. But what a pity! Forty thousand of that fifty thousand were left behind on the battlefields. But we must not think of such things! Those patriotic men were glad to die for the defense of their motherland; they do not want our pity.</p>
   <p>The volunteers who want to fight against Mexico are to be commended; yet, we are not offering them any encouragement. America is appreciative of such offers, and has a kindly regard for foreign-language groups that rush to the defense of their adopted country.</p>
   <p>In this instance, however, we feel that such offers are not necessary, because the situation is far from serious. Mexico must do all the worrying. America has sufficient men and arms to fight Mexico without additional reinforcements.</p>
   <p>Europe is a land of tragic death and intolerable suffering. Women and <pb facs="5422062_2_0868.jpg" n="3"/>children without homes and without hope wander aimlessly, crying for food. Men are lying wounded and unattended on the battlefields of Europe. Destruction and death run rampant over cities and towns, sparing no one. That is real war, and not a mere spat such as we are having with Mexico.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America can suppress their patriotism until the time arrives when America will need it more urgently than she does at this time. It is predicted that we will soon be embroiled in the European massacre.....</p>
   <p>Of course Greece will not be able to keep out of the war much longer. The Allied Powers are putting a great deal of pressure on the Greek government and the Greek people. If we Greeks cannot fight for Greece, we can fight for our adopted country. It is a glorious country, and deserves enthusiastic defense from all the foreign people that have found shelter and peace on its shores.</p>
   <p>The magnetism of American patriotism must attract and electrify the soul <pb facs="5422062_2_0869.jpg" n="4"/>of every Greek in America. As a result, we will exert ourselves to relieve the situation in Greece by raising large amounts of money, and at the same time prepare to defend our adopted country with our lives.</p>
   <p>The time is not far distant when the storms of war will break upon the entire civilized world. God have pity upon the weak and unprepared nations of the world!</p>
   <p>The year 1917 should see a world holocaust. Rulers will be dethroned; governments will be overturned; and the entire face of the world will be altered. It will be a year of change and destruction, and the American people must prepare themselves. There must be no domestic turmoil or dissension.</p>
   <p>Let every Greek gird his loins and prepare to do battle for his Stars and Stripes--the symbol of liberty and individual rights.</p>
