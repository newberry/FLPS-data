   <p>The Greek Democratic voters of the Fifth Ward celebrated the victory of Horace G. Lindheimer as ward committeeman in the elections of April 12, by giving a banquet and dance at the Piccadilly Hotel, last Tuesday evening, where over one hundred people were gathered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bouramas, President of the Pericles Greek Democratic Club and its Secretary, Peter Vassilos, saw to it that enough roast lamb was furnished to the guests as well as considerable Greek grape juice, of which everybody partook in a large measure. During the banquet a fine orchestra was playing the tunes of the day as well as a number of classical pieces. There were present besides Mr. Lindheimer a number of prominent Greek citizens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vassilos acted as chairman, Messrs. Pantelis, Paul Javaras, and Bouramas delivered short speeches, and a feeling of satisfaction ran high among those present, because of the successful results of the election.</p>
