   <p>A little retrospection in Greek history is necessary and advisable when intelligence needs a guiding hand.</p>
   <p>The ancient Greeks used to say, "He who is not a Greek is a barbarian," an awful statement, which is nevertheless true.</p>
   <p>Today in the twentieth century Loxias says, "He who buys a Liberty Bond buys freedom and civilization; and he who, having money, does not buy a Liberty Bond, buys German barbarism."</p>
   <p>Dispute this statement if you please. Right now we may familiarly appreciate this proverb of the ancient Greeks. The American flag today flies the seas of the world for liberty and civilization, and he who does not support that flag is naturally a barbarian.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0721.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of course a few cosmologists would say that we are today just as much fanatics as the ancient Greeks were in advocating such erroneous doctrine. They are right, of course, in the last analysis. But today, in our present stage of evolution, we have barbarians and non-barbarians, and the only way to preserve civilization is to fight against the barbarians. And when national frontiers are removed and worldwide unity exists, then naturally the ideal state of the cosmologists will materialize.</p>
   <p>If Greek history were more generally and thoroughly taught, it is safe to suppose that we should see more poise, more comprehension, and more sense of proportion in the discussion of the present world tragedy.</p>
   <p>Ancient Greece was a human experiment-station. This marvelous intellectual, able, versatile, and active people which inhabited Greece tried almost every device in government that man could think of.</p>
   <p>They missed, however, that peculiar form of federalism which is the glory and the strength of America, the system in which the central power has <pb facs="5422062_2_0722.jpg" n="3"/>a certain direct action on the citizen as well as on the confederate states; but with this one exception ancient Greece had about everything from the darkest despotism to the freest town meeting. There is hardly one of all those reforms which are popularly demanded today on which the history of Greece does not throw light.</p>
   <p>Nor is this all. The blessings of liberty and the curse of empire, the value of arbitration and the ravages of civil war, the inevitable tendency of militarism to produce the worst rather than the best form of government - these things can be studied in Greek history, free from the prejudices and the passions which we bring to the perusal of times nearer to our own.</p>
   <p>The importance of Greek history is beyond dispute. Whenever you bring up the question of the origin of any great modern movement, you are pretty sure to find that a sound knowledge of the history of Greece inspired its evolution.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_0723.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Liberty Loans and other similar responses to the appeals of governments are found in Greek history.</p>
   <p>And "he who does not buy Liberty Bonds if not a pauper is a barbarian."</p>
   <p>Remember the flag of civilization and liberty and support it! That flag is the United States.</p>
