   <p>The action of the "Greek Republican Club," which is said to be a paper organization, in making public a statement indorsing Charles Evans Hughes for president and Harry B. Miller for states attorney, was protested in a statement issued today by G. G. Magges, treasurer of the Achaian League. The league is a Greek-American organization of long standing in Chicago. On Oct. 28 it passed resolutions indorsing President Wilson and the entire county and state Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>The protest addressed to the Greek Republican Club, so called follows:</p>
   <p>"I desire to protest against the use of my name and the names of my fellow members of the Achaian League, Christ Pharazis and Sam Leperis, in connection with your "Paper" club and its doings. You have no right <pb facs="5422062_2_0441.jpg" n="2"/>to use names of people in connection with the election of candidates especially if those people do not approve of these candidates.</p>
   <p>"I am not in sympathy with your letter indorsing Harry B. Miller as states attorney, and I do not think that the election of Harry B. Miller as states attorney would be for the best interests of the people of Cook County, and for that reason I am for the re-election of Maclay Hoyne as states attorney of Cook County, who, for the last four years, has prosecuted crime in high places and has broken up the crime trusts in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"I am treasurer of the Achaian League which on Oct. 28 indorsed President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Edward F. Dunne, Attorney General Patrick J. Lucey, States Attorney Maclay Hoyne, Thomas M. Sullivan for president of the sanitary district and the entire Democratic ticket.</p>
