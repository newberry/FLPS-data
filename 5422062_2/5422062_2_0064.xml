   <p>Denouncing the reigning family of Greece and its supporters as the cause of the sudden reverses of the Greek army in Asia Minor, members of the Hellenic Liberal Democratic League, an organization composed of Greeks of Chicago, met last night and took steps to show to the world that the recent losses of the troops were not due in any way to poor fighting or low morale, but were due to the actions of King Constantine.</p>
   <p>The league desires to aid in establishing a republic in Greece. Constantine, they brand as a traitor and betrayer of the trust of the people. The league claims that through his orders more than 50,000 troops were removed from Asia Minor and sent to Thrace, thus weakening the support of the troops, fighting the Turks in Asia Minor. Lack of efficient officers, factional and selfish interests were <pb facs="5422062_2_0065.jpg" n="2"/>blamed as the cause of the reverses.</p>
   <p>The league emphatically declares its firm and unequivocal decision in the fight, while obeying with respect and devotion the Constitution of the United States as loyal American citizens, and they will endeavor by all possible and legal means to aid their countrymen in the overthrowing of the Constantine Dynasty and proclaim a republic in Greece.</p>
   <p>Paul A Demos, a prominent Greek attorney, is president of the league. He presided at the meeting last night, which was held at 515 S. Halsted Street.</p>
