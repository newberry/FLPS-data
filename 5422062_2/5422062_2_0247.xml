   <p>Of all the candidates of different offices, for the coming elections, the one who seems to have captured the hearts of the voters is our indomitable states' attorney, the honorable John A. Swanson.</p>
   <p>Our own Greek-American citizens have more than once in the past shown their fidelity to Mr. Swanson. Independently of political sentiments they are in strict approval of the way he has been managing his office and are ready in the present campaign to assist him to the utmost. The have seen him in so many of our social affairs that they begin to consider him as one of our own. Each one will not simply vote for him, but will see to it that some of his friends do likewise.</p>
