   <p>In the Bowen Hall of the Hull House, six hundred people gathered to discuss and endeavor to solve a tremendous social problem. They were people from all walks of life. The owner of a shoe-shine parlor found himself sitting next to an American social-worker, who, in turn, had a little boot-black for a neighbor.</p>
   <p>As you might have guessed, the meeting held last Sunday was for the purpose of discussing the working conditions of the Greek shoe-blacks, and the problems of their employers.</p>
   <p>The meeting was presided over by the editor of the Saloniki, Mr. Christ Damascus. He spoke convincingly of the need for co-operation between the boys and their employers. He pointed out the necessity of some form of organization or an arbitration board which could be appealed to by both employers and employees.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1027.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such a board would have the power to bring certain stubborn, backward employers in line; since such individuals block the path of progress for the entire group.</p>
   <p>The majority of employers are willing to close their shops on Sundays and Holidays, but they are prevented from doing so, by the actions of one or two men who refuse to do likewise. If they were all members of a union they would be forced to follow the wishes of the majority.....</p>
   <p>An organization of such a club or union will stop the countless criticisms and denunciations of the Greeks by the American press. Such criticisms are harmful to all the Greeks in Chicago, because they give the public false impressions of our race; and it is the patronage of the public that we seek.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the outstanding social-worker and philanthropist, Miss Grace Abbott. She is a member of the immigration department at Chicago. She urged the Greek boys to unite and fight for their constitutional rights.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1028.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The need for education, and knowledge of the English language was stressed by this outstanding woman. She also gave the histories of various cases that had come to the attention of her department.</p>
   <p>Doctor Constantine Kalliontzis offered to give his professional services to the Greek boot-blacks free of charge. He promised to give them lectures on health, and free medical advice. He also said that steps would be taken to make their surroundings more hygeinic.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Emmet Floyd, general organizer of the labor union, made a spirited speech. He recommended that they form a powerful union of all the shoe-blacks of America. He promised them his whole-hearted support.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Kyriakopoulos, well-known Chicago lawyer and supporter of all progressive undertakings, also addressed the audience. He pleaded for harmony between employees and employers.....</p>
   <p>The meeting was presided over by the vigilant George Prasinos.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_2_1029.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Another meeting will be held next Sunday. We suggest that, in the meantime, each boy should talk the matter over with his boss and try to reach an agreement with him on the important points in dispute. If this is done the meeting next Sunday will not be divided into two hostile camps, but will be composed of people who are friendly and understand each other. The boys and the bosses must come to an understanding right now while there is still time for it. There must be no antagonism between bosses and employees.</p>
   <p>We are certain that some of the liberal and humane bosses will put themselves at the head of such an organization; and will devote all their efforts toward improving the working conditions of the Greek boys. We are sure that they will urge their fellow businessmen to co-operate in this philanthropic cause; for by so doing they will gain the esteem and appreciation of the American public.</p>
