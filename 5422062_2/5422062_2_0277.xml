   <p>The meeting announced by the Central Committee of the United Greek-American Republic Organizations took place, last night, at Olympic Hall. There the political section of the 27th ward was launched with 50 present.</p>
   <p>The meeting was conducted very efficiently under the chairmanship of Mr. Nichalopoulos, lawyer, who explained the purpose of the gathering and introduced the speakers.</p>

Koliopoulos, lawyer, who spoke in English emphasizing the need of organization and Mr. Constantine Augerinos who spoke in Greek.</p>
   <p>The manager of the Greek Daily, Mr. S. Kotakis, was also invited to speak.. "All Greeks," he said, "have an interest in participating in politics in this country as all other nationalities do."</p>
