   <p>On last Thursday the Socrates School, our Greek school in Chicago, considered on <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to the best of its kind in the United States, produced in Greek the tragedy "Iphigenia in Tauris." The parts were taken by pupils of the School, and the play was staged in the Auditorium Theatre.</p>
   <p>Although the thermometer had reached a high high peak on that day, the theater was crowded. The box-seats, the main floor, the balcony, and the gallery were filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>The cast follows: Iphigenia, Mantinia Palivos; Orestes, George J. Andriano-poulos; Pylades, Philip D. Kollias; cowherd, George P. Kolotoures; Thoas, Demetrios K. Booras; messenger, Harry G. Papageorge; and Athena, Aphrodite J. Karagiannes.</p>
   <p>The chorus was composed of students of the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, <pb facs="5422062_1_0398.jpg" n="2"/>with Theodora N. Houzakiotis as choragus. Boys of the fifth and sixth grades appeared as Scythian soldiers.</p>
   <p>The actors were coached by G. Drosos and N. Lambrinides, teachers in the School. The costumes were designed by Mr. and Mrs. Kanellos, who also trained the chorus in its dances.</p>
   <p>The executive committee and the staff of the Socrates School merit our congratulations for the great struggle which they have maintained to support our Greek school and to keep the children of Greeks in our great Hellenic family of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Congratulations are likewise due to all those who support this work, which has great significance for us.</p>
