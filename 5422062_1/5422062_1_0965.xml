   <p>p. 2.- Uncle Sam, so recently symbolizing the greatest wealth in the world, now talks openly of the "dole" for relief in his own country. Congress is passing through a troublous time, debating how best to relieve distress and reassure a restless people. Whatever else the high tariff has done, it has not prevented hunger and unemployment.</p>
   <p>Since the opening of Congress, early in December, much time has been taken in making appropriations for the emergency, and with little practical results. In the welter of talk, Senator Borah dramatically appealed to his fellow-members to "do something for the people who are hungry." The New York Times refers to a $60,000,000 relief bill as carrying a dole of "human food." President Hoover's request for a $150,000,000 emergency building program to provide employment.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0966.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is little wonder that a feeling of alarm has arisen. The Federal Treasury is confronted with a deficit of between $300,000,000 and $400,000,000, even though relief measures are kept down to the modest amount asked by the President.</p>
   <p>The rush of Congressmen to introduce bills is described by one newspaper as "the hysteria of relief" and there is fear that measures will lack coherency, cost vast sums of money, and still be disappointing in result.</p>
   <p>Senator Borah, who is celebrated for his cantor and freedom from dictation, brings the public back to earth with this statement. "If the public wants the expenditures, the public will have to pay the bill. There seems to be a widespread belief that you can restore prosperity from the public treasury. It is a false theory. Dire emergencies will have to be met from the public treasury, but the idea that you can restore permanent prosperity by spending public money, and thereby necessitating the imposing of more taxes, is unsound.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0967.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I favor, therefore, holding down the expenditures as much as possible, a deficit is created, I favor increasing the income taxes especially in the higher brackets."</p>
   <p>All of which sounds ominous in the light of the extravagance of recent years. The results will also give the United States a mild taste of what has been endured by "poor old Europe."</p>
   <p>The experience will, likewise, prove an eye-opener for those who thought the Republic could sell to all the world, buy little or nothing and live in perpetual prosperity.</p>
