   <p>p. 1.- Perhaps, of all the nationalities that mourned the passing of Miss Jane Addams, the Greek were moved more, because they have seen more of her and were benefited more, if for no other reason but for the fact they were so close to the institution.</p>
   <p>Hundreds--we would say thousands--of young men and women of our race have been the recipients of many favors and in many cases of actual assistance from the House.</p>
   <p>For the Greek community to repay what it has received from the Hull House will be well nigh impossible, but the Greeks are not wont of forgetting their friends.</p>
   <p>All those who were present at the funeral services at the court of the Hull House have noticed the beautiful, large wreath that the Greek <pb facs="5422062_1_0905.jpg" n="2"/>churches had sent.</p>
   <p>The spontaneity of the Greek merchants on the day of the funeral to rush and put crepe mournings at their stores all along the line from the "L" Station to Polk street and all around Blue Island Avenue, proved the sentiments held toward the great humanitarian.</p>
   <p>Now comes another duty that the Greek Community feels duty bound to perform; and that is a memorial service. No sooner was the idea suggested and immediately steps were taken for such memorial.</p>
   <p>This memorial service will be held in the Greek Church of Holy Trinity 1101 S. Peoria street, the only church that was intimately known by Miss Addams. The services will take place at 11:00 P.M. on Sunday the 23rd. The possibility is that his Grace, the Bishop, will officiate and that the Greek Consul of Chicago will be present. There will be a Greek and an American speaker, both making short addresses.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0906.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have not the least doubt that the Greek colony will flock to the church on Sunday to pay its last religious tribute to the name of one who assisted so much during our first struggling years.</p>
   <p>Such was the "Pan-Hellenic" expression of gratitude to the memory of Miss Jane Addams.</p>
