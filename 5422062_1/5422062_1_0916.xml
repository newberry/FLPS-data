   <p>Urged by our journalistic duty, and our vital interest in the Greek ideologies, we have intently followed the progress and growth of the Greek communities in America. We have striven to print in these columns only those things which are factual and true. The safest and surest method of making comparisons and arriving at conclusions is to analyze carefully the existing situations and facts.</p>
   <p>As is well known, the Greeks in America and the Greeks of Egypt are the only groups of Greeks living outside of Greece that can be compared. The Greek community of Egypt reached its highest point of achievement about fifty years ago. Now, this former powerful and progressive group is beginning to wane in power and efficiency. In fact, the Greek Government has been forced to create a bureau of education and philanthropy to work with the Greek Consulate <pb facs="5422062_1_0917.jpg" n="2"/>at Cairo. To every Greek of America--and especially those who have at one time lived in Egypt--this retrogression is practically unbelievable. Where higher institutions of Greek learning once flourished, and various institutions and business concerns once flourished, there are now only signs of gradual decay.</p>
   <p>Rather, than to allow this once-thriving community to die, the Greek Government will, of course, make an effort to revitalize it; in the first place, because of economic reasons; and in the second place, from a patriotic sense of duty. However, it would not be as easy for the Greek Government to come to the aid of the Greek communities in America. In the first place, the amounts required would be far greater than could be paid by the Government; in the second, the Greeks of America have not even one institution that is of the slightest benefit, or which is now in danger because of lack of necessary funds.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0918.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Even if the Hellenism of Egypt ceases to exist in the future, it shall have had a glorious history of accomplishment. But what have the five hundred thousand Greek-Americans to present that might be regarded as a national achievement? We do not believe anyone would dare to compare further the situations of these, the two largest groups of Greeks outside of their native country. The Hellenism of Egypt passed through the normal stages of a social order. The Greeks of America have reached the brink of the last stage of assimilation or obliteration without having passed through the creative and progressive stages. Unfortunately, we in America are so busy doing nothing that we never get time to create any worth-while heritage for our children.</p>
   <p>The signs indicate that our social structures are beginning to crumble, not because their time has come, but because we conduct ourselves like the unprepared virgins of the Bible who had no oil in their lamps, and so did not see Christ.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0919.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A community of fifty thousand Greeks, living in a metropolis like Chicago, which has not even one philanthropic institution, despite the existence of hundreds of Greek orphans and homeless aged in its midst, should be ashamed of itself. This condition can still be remedied if the co-operation of every Greek of Chicago is given.</p>
