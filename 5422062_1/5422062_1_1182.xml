   <p>The Serbian community of Chicago arranged a great program of ceremonies and banquets last week on the occasion of the anniversary of Serbia's freedom from the yoke of Turkey.</p>
   <p>It was only natural that the Serbians of Chicago should invite the Greek people of this city to participate in their festivities and rejoicing. Our traditional friendship with the Serbian nation is long. During the recently concluded Balkan wars, however, the alliance and the military collaboration between our two countries have strengthened the ties and the cultural relationships between these two great peoples. Both the Serbians and the Greeks have had to suffer under, and to free themselves from, a century-old hateful and barbarous Turkish tyranny. Both countries fought to extend their borders and to unite their people in the Balkans by driving the Turks from Europe during the early part of this century.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1183.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Though the Serbians are Slavs and though they have a somewhat different historic background than the Greeks, we have a common religion, and our political and economic interests compel us to act and think with common objectives and ideals in mind.</p>
   <p>The Greek and Serbian national groups in Chicago also have common ideals and a community of interests. The co-operation of our two peoples in the social, economic, religious, and cultural sphere will greatly benefit all concerned.</p>
   <p>The Greek church and our diplomatic and business leaders of Chicago were happy to accept the invitation of the Serbian community.</p>
   <p>A magnificent and sumptuous banquet was given at the La Salle Hotel, which was graced by the presence of the mayor, several congressmen, and other prominent political figures of Chicago. Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, the consul general of Greece, was our official representative at the <pb facs="5422062_1_1184.jpg" n="3"/>banquet and in the other patriotic ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Among others, the official Serbian committee invited the publisher of Saloniki, Mr. Christ Damaskos, to represent the Greek press of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago wish to share the joy and happiness of our good Serbian friends on the occasion of the thirty-sixth anniversary of their national independence. We wish the Serbian people happiness and prosperity.</p>
