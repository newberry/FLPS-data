   <p>The Greek-American citizens in the community of Pullman believing that their children would make better American citizens and serve the community much better if along with their studies in our American institutions they also learned the language, traditions and ideals of our forefathers, and with that thought in mind they banded together and organized what is known today as the Greek Political Club "Pericles," under whose auspices in 1920 the First Greek School in Pullman was founded.</p>
   <p>Between 1920 and 1928 more Greek-Americans came to live in this community and realizing that it was time that they should also have a church of their own, went ahead, and through many hardships they finally built "St. Spyridon Community Church," one of the most beautiful churches in this part of the city, and along with this church building they saw that there was enough room made in this building to move in the school and co-ordinate both, school and church so that our people would not only receive instruction in our language but also have a place where they could worship.</p>

   <p>Our school has over one hundred pupils attending it every afternoon from 4 to 6 P.M.</p>
   <p>"Plutarchos," was the name chosen for our school because Plutarchos was not only one of the great philosophers of his time but also a great moralist and man of letters.</p>
