   <p>The Greek Parents' Association invited all parents and all interested persons to meet at Hull House last Sunday in order to discuss ways and means of improving and advancing our educational system. The school committee, which is working so admirably and patriotically for a great cause, has appealed to Saloniki for moral support and for the use of the press to arouse the interest of our people in the school.</p>
   <p>An official bulletin was sent to many Greek parents setting forth the purposes and methods of the Greek school of Chicago. Several hundreds of Greek boys and girls have received helpful and saving instruction from this institution, which has been serving the Greek community of Chicago well for the past four years. This year there are 125 children enrolled.</p>
   <p>Many important and constructive decisions were made in the meeting of last <pb facs="5422062_1_0481.jpg" n="2"/>Sunday. One of them was the appointment of a school finance committee, which is to find ways and means of raising funds to support and improve all of our educational institutions affiliated with the churches and our local organizations. It was also decided to improve the teaching staff and to raise the salary of the teachers.</p>
