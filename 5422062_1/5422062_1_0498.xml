   <p>P.-2-..... A noteworthy event in the Chronicles of the Greeks in America was that of last Sunday. The burning desire in the hearts of Greeks for the establishment of a Greek School was then fulfilled and consummated in the inauguration of the school, which was consecrated in a brilliant and magnificent ceremony befitting so extraordinary an event.</p>
   <p>The spacious halls of the institution, located at 3611 Lake Avenue, were packed with the elite of the Greek community. The ceremony of consecration was conducted by the Archimandrite Ambrosius Mandelares with a most imposing liturgy.</p>
   <p>Dr. N. Salopoulos, Greek consul general in Chicago delivered a speech of paramount significance, emphasizing the fact that the life, activity, and progress of the Greek element in America depend first upon our educational institutions and secondly <pb facs="5422062_1_0499.jpg" n="2"/>upon the Church, which is an inseparable companion of education and of Greek traditions.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. S. Lambros, publisher of the Star, spoke next. His matter-of-fact address, recounting his incessant efforts to hasten the establishment of the school, was frequently interrupted by applause. Mr. Sp. Kotakis, president of the newly-formed Hellenism Society was the third speaker. He explained the purpose of the organization of the school and the duty of our community toward education.</p>
   <p>The foundation of the school is exceptionally significant because this school in Chicago is the first Greek school to be established in the United States. The credit and the honor of establishing the first Greek school in the New World is appropriate and becoming to the Greek community of Chicago because this community also established the first Greek church in America.</p>
   <p>Parents and children, old and young, professional men and laborers, businessmen and peddlers, all that constitutes the Chicago Greek community came to bend the knee before the mighty tradition of Greek letters.</p>
   <p>Every language in the world serves the purpose of its creation, but the Greek language was created to express not only material things but divine things as well.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0500.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The intricate and inexplicable thoughts of St. John, "In the beginning was the word," could not have been expressed in any other language and have retained their significance. Divine thoughts require divine words to express them. And divinity, before Christ and after, has best been expressed in what we call "the language of the Gods," that is, in Greek.</p>
   <p>Greeks the world over are silently urged by invisible forces to perpetuate the Greek language in every land in which they live, regardless of how many other languages they speak. This urgent need has been satisfied for the Greeks of Chicago in the establishment of the first Greek school in America. Later generations will remember this event, and due honor and credit will be accorded to the Chicago Greek community for kindling in this new world a light which will cast its beam afar.</p>
   <p>A new society has been formed to find ways and means to support the school. The officers of Hellenismos, as the organization is called, are Sp. Kotakis, president, Dr. J. Volicos and Dr. K. Theodorou, vice-presidents; K. N. Karalopoulos, secretary, and N. Mazarakos, treasurer. The members of the council are D. Manoussopoulos, St. Lambarcakis; J. Prokos, N. Kavouras, Ath. Nashiacos, Dem. Cheronis, Dem. Lambrakis, K. Loumos, L. Giannacopoulos, D. Kalogeropoulos, G. Bouzanis, and K. Juvanis.</p>
