   <p>At this time the thoughts and attention of the American people are focused upon the President of the United States. Especial interest is evidenced in his latest speech to the Senate which was broadcast over the radio. Not so long ago the speeches made by presidents did not go much farther than Washington D. C. Sometimes the people read such speeches, but in the majority of cases they did not, because they were written in such technical language, and in such long-drawn-out paragraphs. Later, when the railroads began shortening the distance between cities and towns, and the telegraph made communication a simple procedure, larger and larger numbers of people began to follow the developments in Washington. During the last ten years the radio has brought the news of the world into every home. This, therefore, was the method chosen by the President for telling his people what the proposed program would mean to their welfare.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1504.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The President's defenders praise the incomparable manner in which he presents his policies to the people. Even his worst opponents envy his power of public appeal; while the radical groups seem to see a realization of their dreams for a socialistic government in America. This is made much of by the Republican party, which is conservative to the "nth" degree. However, all of the various political factions agree that the President was correct in his predictions and precautions. His speech to the American people was touching in its honesty, courage, and philanthropy. The method used by Roosevelt in presenting his beliefs to the people has caused a psychological change in the minds of all classes of people--except the conservatives and capitalists. To each person has come the realization of the difference between the policies and ideologies of the present Administration and the one in power before F. D. R. took over last March.</p>
   <p>We are actually at the threshold of a great social upheaval. No matter what <pb facs="5422062_1_1505.jpg" n="3"/>name we attach to the suggested reforms of the President, it is the common opinion that future relationships between the government and the individual will be different than ever before. There is a marked resemblance to national socialism. There is, as yet, no mention made of public ownership and lack of individual right to property; but the President has foreseen the day when the state will provide each unemployed person with work. That is nothing less than social equality--which does not, however, lead to the government of Marx, but to an ideal, long-sought type dreamed of by Plato, Moore, and Campanella.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we do not wish to go on record as believing that Roosevelt is a socialist. On the contrary, the general outline of his program reveals that he is striving to strengthen the status quo, which was on shaky foundations before he took office. The President himself has said that a rebirth is being hoped for; a radical change in social ideals is being aimed at. This change which the President seeks to bring about--and which the great majority of <pb facs="5422062_1_1506.jpg" n="4"/>American people are in favor of--will be accomplished by the passage of certain social laws and the establishment of certain guarantees which have been demanded by the people. The outline is based upon benefits for the up-until-now-forgotten common people of America. Food shelter, and clothing must be available to every human being because they are his natural and lawful heritage as a member of society.</p>
   <p>The suggestions and ideals of the President mark a great turning point in the history of mankind. The hopes of men all over the world are fixed upon the success of these policies. The basis for the future government of all nations has been laid by Roosevelt. May his dreams become realities so that we may all--except, of course, the poor capitalists--benefit by them. It is unfortunate for humanity that more men such as Roosevelt are not in evidence in the governments of nations.</p>
