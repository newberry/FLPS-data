   <p>Last Sunday the Socrates School gave its annual program in the large hall of Hull House. There were various recitations, dialogues, and musical numbers on the program. There was a speech by the principal of the school Mrs. K. Kantzou, concerning the financial report. Mrs. Kantzou clearly outlined the needs of the school, and what the community could gain culturally from a school. There followed a program by the students, of patriotic and humorous dialogues, poems, monologues, class singing and then the presentation of diplomas.</p>
   <p>Archmandrite Pigeas, president of the Board of Trustees, then congratulated the staff of the School, for its zealous interest in the improvement of its methods of teaching. He then blessed the entire gathering, and praised the supporters of this patriotic institution. He emphasized the fact that there would be no neglect of the teaching of Greek to the Greek children.</p>
   <p>A financial statement of the year followed, showing the amount of money <pb facs="5422062_1_0411.jpg" n="2"/>received from tuitions, church trays, donations, sale of books, and benefit performances. The expenses and the bank balance were also shown.</p>
