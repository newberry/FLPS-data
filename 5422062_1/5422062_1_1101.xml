   <p>Something is lacking in us that prevents us from surpassing other nationalities. That "something" is well known to all of us. We sense it in our associations with other people, and we envy it in them, but still we cannot succeed in attaining it. That "something" is called ORGANIZATION.</p>
   <p>No matter how many parishes, schools, clubs and other groups we set up, our efforts will fail unless we acquire unity and organization..... The Greek knows it all. Question him on any subject, and he will tell you that he can answer you; he will tell you he is ready to debate with you, and that he overlooks nothing. The only thing he does not seem to think about is the value of unity. He has never struggled to attain those benefits of organization which he so envies in others.</p>
   <p>The last war is good evidence in support of my argument. Neither America,nor England had a large army before the war. This is not a secret. It is also not a secret that both countries succeeded in gathering very large armies in <pb facs="5422062_1_1102.jpg" n="2"/>France within a very short time. This can only be credited to ORGANIZATION. Thus if organization can bring together millions, lack of it can bring together only tens. This is evident among us, the Greeks in America,--the land of unity and organization.</p>
   <p>Again we repeat that the Greek may surpass other nationalities in some respects, but his ability to organize is nil. One Greek donates money for a university and a stadium; ten thousand Greeks fail to build a small school. Do you know why? It is because unity is lacking; and egoism, and a spirit of stubborn resistance prevail.</p>
   <p>The Greek unceasingly--we will not say unconsciously--says yes or no, but those answers are not derived from his own crystallized thoughts. Ten of his friends say yes, so he says yes. Ten of his friends say no, so must he. And so, at every club meeting, we see recurring this sad scene in which selfishness and foolishness prevail. We see that, although as individuals we are all giants, we are inconsequential as a group.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1103.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If strangers could have seen us last Sunday at a certain meeting, they would have thought we were cannibals who had been invited to dinner and, not finding enough food, were attempting to eat each other. Certainly, a stranger at a Greek club meeting would feel obligated to throw raw meat into the arena to prevent members from consuming each other. These truths are very bitter, but what is to be gained from burying them. Absolutely nothing! Nothing is to be gained from not revealing these truths--and nothing is to be gained from exposing them. Let us continue to scrub the African, not to make him white, but at least to remove some of the encrusted filth which has accumulated upon him. Black he will remain; but at least he will be clean and healthy.</p>
   <p>In closing, I would like to emphasize the need for scrapping our petty grievances against each other and for having the interest of the community as a whole for an ideal.... Neither the churches nor the steeple chimes will ever solve our problems. Proof of this is found in the case of a church which is valued at $120,000, and still does not have a Greek school.</p>
   <p>Only ten determined hands that are unselfish can accomplish that which we <pb facs="5422062_1_1104.jpg" n="4"/>lack. Those who have this type of hands should raise them high. Let those ten raise up their hands, and they may be certain that thousands will be found to applaud them; thousands of lips will kiss them, and thousands of eyes will shed tears, which will wash those brave hands.</p>
   <p>ONLY TEN!</p>
