   <p>Many women constantly complain and sorrow because they are married to men much older than themselves. Many of these women would exchange their homes and luxuries for a humble home and a young husband. This is the ailment, from which many, many women have suffered and will suffer. Something beyond their control forced them into marriage with a middle-aged man and since then their existence has been an unhappy one. A great difference in the ages of the contracting parties is a common characteristic of the arranged marriage, for the prospective groom is not chosen by the girl herself, but by her parents. Her wishes are often completely ignored. In such cases the parents always strive to keep the girl under the impression that "parents always know best".</p>
   <p>Of course, these parents are not intentionally cruel. They do what they really think is best for their daughter's happiness and security. They know from the <pb facs="5422062_1_0653.jpg" n="2"/>bitter experience of life that very few men are capable of living a life of economic security. Therefore they make an effort to find a groom in whose hands their daughter will neither starve nor suffer. They quickly seize any opportunity that comes along of accepting a well-established man who asks their daughter's hand in marriage. The girl is not often consulted because "she doesn't know any better". Her parents blind her by promising her wealth, luxury, and a certain social prestige, when she shall have become Mrs. So or So.</p>
   <p>Once in a while a girl is high-spirited enough to refuse to follow blindly and silently the decisions of her parents. Urged by those inward feelings which made her want to shape her own destiny, she protests and says:</p>
   <p>"I do not wish, by either word or action, to bring you, my parents, unhappiness or disappointment. However, I do believe that I have the right to defend myself. Never shall I sell myself for money, even if by doing <pb facs="5422062_1_0654.jpg" n="3"/>so I should become a princess. I prefer to marry a young man with whom I have something in common, and to work side by side with him for the establishment of economic security.</p>
   <p>"Life with a rich old man is for a lazy woman who has no initiative or ideals and who has no interest in creating something through effort and sacrifice. She is a mere social parasite. I am not of that type and you must wait until I meet someone of my own choice who has a better recommendation than mere money. Age is not so very important because, even if he is ten or twelve years older than I, he is still young. The most important thing is understanding and mutual ideals; when these exist age is of secondary importance. However, when these are lacking, age is an all-important factor."</p>
   <p>There is another side to this important social relationship which must not <pb facs="5422062_1_0655.jpg" n="4"/>be overlooked. Why does a girl want a man who is still a big boy, without manly knowledge or experience? Perhaps, because she is so proud of him--her handsome young husband--when they go to dances. But, dances are not daily affairs, and happiness is based upon the peace, security, and contentment of everyday life. The very young man is not prepared to sacrifice himself to the needs and demands of a family. Rather than eliminate unnecessary expenditures which he was accustomed to make when unmarried, he will demand that his wife go to work in order to help pay the bills.</p>
   <p>Marriage to an older man has certain undeniable advantages, and it is these which sway the parents of girls. In such a union exists greater respect and honor; and a mature husband is better qualified to understand the idiosyncrasies of his young wife than an immature lad.</p>
   <p>When young brides complain of their mature husbands, some one should tell them that if they were married to young men they would be faced with other problems far more serious than differences in age.</p>
