   <p>Dear Editor of Saloniki: This is in answer to your recent editorial concerning the marriage codes of Germany and America. I would like to express my own opinion regarding this important subject.</p>
   <p>One of the indirect causes of this war is the crowded conditions in Germany. She desires territorial expansion in order to make room for her rapidly increasing population. If the Kaiser wants larger families, it is because he wants to justify his expansion program; and because he desires to have suffiant cannon-fodder for his future barbaric enterprises. That is, of course, if he succeeds in winning this struggle.</p>
   <p>Greece, also, has encouraged marriage and large families. There, however, it is done for totally different reasons from those of Germany. It is necessary that there be a large male population in order that there be enough men to be able to protect Greece from her hereditary foe--Turkey. Besides that, the manner of living is such that it is just as easy to raise many children <pb facs="5422062_1_0741.jpg" n="2"/>as it is to raise only a few.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, wherever and whenever people exist who desire to live in a progressive, cultured environment, it is necessary that high standards be maintained. The government of such a country would forbid marriage to any individuals falling beneath certain standards of health, morality, and mentality. By giving parental rights only to the finest types, would society reach a perfected form; and it would thereby eliminate most of the undesirable, weak members, unfortunately so prevalent in most countries.</p>
   <p>It has been proven that the poorest families usually have the greatest number of children. These children are raised without proper food, homes, education or environment; and, as a rule, become burdens upon the community. Not only do they inherit the poverty and want of their parents, but they also have received some sickness or disease as a birth-right.</p>
   <p>The questions of marriage and reproduction are not to be solved by dictatorial decrees or manifestoes. Their solution must be derived from economic and <pb facs="5422062_1_0742.jpg" n="3"/>health conditions and from the marriage customs of each country. It must be admitted that intelligent and logical marriages are usually prevalent in all civilized cultured groups. By "logical" I mean that young people, and the mentally deficient, are not given prizes if they marry or bear children.</p>
   <p>The plutocrats, the tyrants, the dictators, and the clergy, are in favor of such undesirable unions. After all, if they acknowledge the undisputed truth it will not be at all to their advantage or interests. They want society to provide more deficient individuals in order that they might not fall short of followers and cannon-fodder.</p>
