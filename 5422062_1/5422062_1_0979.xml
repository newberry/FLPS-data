   <p>"The Greeks have a word for it." Jack Dempsey wants to find out all about it. The popular fighter and his bosom friend and trainer G. Livadas, known in the sporting circles as "Jerry the Greek," have become Ahepans.</p>
   <p>The ceremony of the initiation was witnessed by 1000 Ahepans who gathered at the Southmoor Hotel to inaugurate the two new members into the mysteries of the Order. Stylianos Rekas, Grand Commander of the 9th circuit officiated at the event.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dempsey said, I believe in noble ideals. I'm certain I will find them in Ahepa." "Jerry the Greek" spoke in Greek expressing his appreciation for his entry into the Order of Ahepa.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0980.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The American fighter Jack Dempsey, and his Greek friend, after the initiation and the following stimulants, (which are necessary) admitted that indeed "The Greeks have a word for it." A curious reporter asked Dempsey what it was all about and the famous fighter with a smile said," Join the Lodge."</p>
