   <p>With a great deal of joy we learn that the formation of a union of Greek typographers is added to the list of unionized professions, followed by a large number of our nationality.</p>
   <p>The Greek typographers have felt the need for unionization for a long time. Finally they held a meeting in the Pan-Hellenic Union Building in New York City, and after much discussion it was decided to form an organization to be called "Union of the Greek-American Typographers", which would include all branches of the printing profession. At this meeting, the general foundation for the union was laid; a constitution was drawn up and accepted; and a temporary council was elected. The purpose of the union is to better the working conditions among its members and to fight for a substantial rate of remuneration for a short working day. It desires unemployment insurance and sick benefits.</p>
   <p>Saloniki is in favor of this union and is proud to have its staff join the organization. Any Greek typographer who desires detailed information concerning <pb facs="5422062_1_1402.jpg" n="2"/>this union can apply at the offices of Saloniki.</p>
