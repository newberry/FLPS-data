   <p>Many have asked how the grocery store, butcher store, drug store and other retail stores originated.</p>
   <p>Have you ever stopped to think that the increase of sales in the United States depends largely upon the retail stores?</p>
   <p>In early times the transactions took place as follows: The producer of fruits, for example, would exchange his produce for different products of his neighbor. In the course of time silver coins came into use and the sales and purchases of different products took place through different salaried clerks, who were chosen by farmers to take care of a public market. Later these salaried clerks became the owners of the markets, buying and selling the products of the farmer.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1383.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later the invention of machinery brought in the manufacture of other products such as shoes, furniture, etc., the sale of which necessitated the establishment of retail stores. In these scores, one may find different products from all parts of this world.</p>
   <p>This is the summarized history of he retail store, the development of which keeps pace with the progress and prosperity of a country.</p>
