   <p>Mr. Paul Demos, one of Chicago's prominent civic leaders and a well-known attorney, returned to Chicago from Greece where he went last July to study the political and economic conditions and to interest the Greek Government and business interests to participant in the Chicago World's Fair.</p>
   <p>On his way to Greece, Mr. Demos spent canderable time in France, Switzerland, Italy and Jugoslavia.</p>
   <p>"Economic conditions in France are the best in Europe, even better than in America." Mr. Demos said, "there is no unemployment in France; money is glentiful and prices are high. The French people are happy and contented. You could hardly believe that there has been a war.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0972.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I was very much impressed with the new at of affairs in Italy," Mr. Dcmos said; "if there is any poverty in Italy, the American traveler does not notice it."</p>
   <p>"Jugoslavia impressed me immensely too, with the wealth and beauty of her country. The land everywhere is cultivated and the crops appear rich and plentiful. The people there too, are happy and contented. Political and economic conditions are very satisfactory, I was informed.</p>
   <p>"Since I left Greece twenty-one years ago, many changes have taken place there. One who has not seen Athens in that period of time would hardly recognize this great historic monument of the World's art and culture, as it has been greatly modernized. Today Athens is one of the World's most beautiful <pb facs="5422062_1_0973.jpg" n="3"/>metropolis, with its marvelous scenic and artistic wonders. What one sees of modern improvements in Athens is likewise emblematic of other Greek cities and places of interest and importance. Greece is fast becoming a tourist center. I saw Americans everywhere. Transportation has been improved considerably and water has been brought to cities and even to villages. The cities are spotlessly clean and their hotels modern and up-to-date.</p>
   <p>Communication has linked Greek culture and commerce with the rest of Europe.</p>
   <p>"I was particularly impressed with the law and order that prevails all through Greece. The political situation is ideal. The people, who have always been politically minded, seem to have turned to business and industry, while Venizelos, the great statesman and patriot, who has the implicit love and confidence of all the Greeks and the respect of the world, is given full power to govern the country.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0974.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Although crops were poor and inadequate this year because of the drought season, the economic conditions in Greece are in excellent shape. Very few people are out of work, when you consider that this little country of about 5,000,000 people has absorbed 1,500,000 refugees since the war.</p>
   <p>"One of the greatest signs of progress and satisfaction in Greece is the growth of its modern educational system. Compulsory education has wiped out illiteracy.</p>
   <p>"What I was most interested in, was to impress upon the minds of the Greek people and of their government the significance of our Chicago World's Fair, which in order to succeed must have the good will and co-operation of all the nations of the world. I was disappointed however, in how little the people, not only of Greece, but in other countries as well, knew about the great task that we are undertaking in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0975.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Everywhere and everyone seemed to know all about "Al" Capone, and of our lawlessness and crime. I was astonished to hear people inquire if our city was not in bankruptcy and if it were true that we were unable to pay our school teachers. What we need is a publicity campaign to acquaint the people of Europe with the good and noble things in our city and our country, which will not only induce the different governments to participate in our World's Fair, but will set us right before the people of Europe and bring many visitors and exhibitors to the Fair. Many who are misled by the injurious propaganda spread abroad do not believe that we will have a fair."</p>
