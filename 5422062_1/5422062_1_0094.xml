   <p>p. 3.- On June 19th, the Greek Professionals Men's Club of Chicago gave a dinner at the Aquarian restaurant in honor of Greek graduates from various Universities.</p>
   <p>Besides the professionals and graduates, many notables participated in the honor-dinner, including Americans and Greeks. The presence of the Greek Archbishop of North and South America gave a touch of solemnity to the affair, besides its academic and scholastic atmosphere.</p>
   <p>After the delightful dinner the President of the professionals, as Master of Ceremonies, Dr. Soter or Soterakos, congratulated the graduates, and then presented Paul Kokinatos or Cokens, President of the Society, Elicon, (composed of Greek students), and Miss Katherine Miller, President of the Greek Women's University Club.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0095.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Both spoke of the achievements of their respective societies. But the graceful, black-eyed, Greek beauty, Miss Miller, possessing sagacity and eloquence, brought out the potentialities of the graduates, especially of her sex whom she called The Guides of Hellenism in America. Immediately after Miss Miller, the Greek Archbishop Most Rev. Athenagoras, in his usual solemn and imposing manner, spoke, comparing science and religion, and elucidating that science, in its present advance, does not contradict religion but, on the contrary, assists it in the way of solving the mysteries of life.</p>
   <p>The liberal-minded Prelate, emphasized his statement, that the unbiased and intelligent Christian knows and accepts the theory that theism has never made it necessary either to limit the operations of nacure, or postulate divine intervention to account for unusual phenomenas.</p>
   <p>The eminent Greek ecclesiastic, however, very mildly and tactfully, chided those who follow certain philosophical doctrines, congratulated the neophytes, and assured them that the Greek mother Church understands <pb facs="5422062_1_0096.jpg" n="3"/>and appreciates the great difficulties that engulf them, but that in the very immediate future she will assist them with a plan that will render their connections mutually beneficial.</p>
   <p>The Master of Ceremonies introduced the last and principal speaker, Joseph Murley, Professor of Classic Languages at Northwestern University, whose subject was "What Significance Has Ancient Greece For Us?" Mr. Murley's speech we print on another page.</p>
   <p>The graduates for whom the testimonial dinner was given are: Miss Olga Massias, Bachelor of Philosophy, University of Chicago; Miss Mary Maniatis, Liberal Arts, Northwestern University; Miss Mary Pernokis, Bachelor of Arts, University of Chicago; N. George Dedakis, Law, University of Chicago; Theodore Constantopoulos, Law, De Paul University; Demetrios Geroulis, Law, De Paul University; George D. Cologer, Law, Loyola University; Peter D. Cologer, Law, Loyola University; Christ Chamales, Architecture; Christ Kardas, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University; John Kermes, Chemistry, University of Chicago; Anastasios Maniatis, Bachelor of Philosophy, University of Chicago; Aristides Rifakis, Law, Northwestern University.</p>
