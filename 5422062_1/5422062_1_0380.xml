   <p>p. 3-.....Last Monday the commencement exercises of the Socrates Greek School were held in the spacious West Side Auditorium. It would not be an exaggeration to state that this was the first magnificently successful event which has happened in many years in the Greek community of Chicago, a novelty indeed.</p>
   <p>More than two thousand people packed the hall, listening with profound interest to the wonderful program presented by the pupils. The program was perfect in arrangement and in performance. It was not the usual recital of poems which one expects in school commencement exercises; this was something exceptional, a literary bouquet of the choicest flowers.</p>
   <p>Outbursts of laughter in the audience were followed by enthusiatic and deafening applause, and again tender emotions were aroused, and tears shone in spectators eyes. All the pupils showed exceptional ability in expression and spoke their lines with a skill that many of our orators would be glad to equal.</p>
   <p>The two youngsters F. Kollias and G. Andrianopoylos, who presented "The Cook", a comic dialogue, caused many outbursts of laughter. But the most splendid presentation <pb facs="5422062_1_0381.jpg" n="2"/>was the performance of the play "Neagenea(New Generation)", a national drama by Professor Nikolas Lamprinides, which ought to be seen by all the Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The play was excellent both in plot and in performance. The action begins with the dream of a grandfather, who represents the outgoing generation and is dissatisfied with the youth of today. While he gazes heart broken at the statue of the Great Ideal of the Greeks, despairing of a national resurrection, he falls asleep before the statue.</p>
   <p>Then mourning Greece appears to the accompaniment of a touching melody and recounts in passionate accents the tale of successive disasters suffered in unequal battles against Turks and Bulgarians. In an apostrope full of melancholy and despair she bids farewell to the magnificent temple of St. Sophia, the symbol of the race.</p>
   <p>Then the statue moves, and the animated Great Ideal, Galatia, speaks to mourning Greece and reminds her of the gigantic struggles during the four centuries of slavery under the Turkish yoke, of terrible janizaries leading the maidens of Byrantium away to slavery, of the Harmatoloi and the Kleftes of Mount Olymbus and <pb facs="5422062_1_0382.jpg" n="3"/>Mount Ossa, of the dance of Zaldfo, of the inspired Rhegas, the first martyr of the Greek Resolution, of the great Kolokotrones, the old man of Morea, with his austere face, of Kanares and his burning torch, and of the recent Maiedonian tragedies, of the wild Bulgarian "committees" who slew Greek women and children. The thrilling epic of the wars of 1912 and 1913, with the prade of the immortal Tsoliathes (Greek infantry in kilts) and other soldiers and marines, aroused wild enthusiasm in the audience, and then appeared the widows and orphans of the disaster in Asia Minor, the manifestation of the national pain and despair caused in the betrayal of Greece by her friends.</p>
   <p>Finally, with gay music, appears the new generation, "Nea Genea," jubilant and strong, hand in hand with Hope and embraces Greece, who departs with them radiant with courage and full of confidence for the future.</p>
   <p>The statue again stands motionless; the dream has vanished, and when the grandson comes and wakes the old man, he repents of the pusillanimity of his generation and speaks with enthusiasm of the Great Ideal, embracing his grandson, the new generation, on whom the hopes of the race depend. This in general outline is the plot of the drama which was so perfectly presented by the pupils of the school.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0383.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>After the performance the president of the community, Mr. Nick Kokines, thanked the audience for their interest and support and introduced the principal of the school, Mr. Geo. Drossos, who gave a report of its activities. Mr. Theodore Laskaris of the board of auditers assured the audience of the community's sound financial condition. Mr. Evangelos Tsioles, the president of the school, praised and thanked the personnel for their interest in the results of their work. Professor N. Lamprinides in a touching speech congratulated the pupils on their earnest love of learning, bidding farewell to the graduating class and wishing them the best of luck in their future studies. He urged them never to forget their inheritance from the mother of civilization, once more bringing tears to the eyes of the pupils and the audience.</p>
   <p>We congratulate Professor N. Lamprinides on his drama and on his directing ability, and we also congratulate Principal George Drossos and the President N. Kokines on their ability to provide the school with such a personnel.</p>
