   <p>The chief topic of conversation among those who like wine is whether or not the innocent one will be condemned to death.</p>
   <p>The first of July is the day of judgment for wine, beer, whiskey, and all other alcoholic beverages, as on that day their destiny will be determined.</p>
   <p>You poor lovers of Bacchus! Who would ever have dreamt that the arm of the law would reach out and take the glass from your lips, the joy from your heart, and forgetfulness from your spirit!</p>
   <p>"Oh, brother," I heard someone say, whose mouth had callouses from so much contact with a wine glass, "is this democracy, is this liberty?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, undying Greece," said another, "may you live forever. Can you imagine any country without wine?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0626.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I would like to know which is the one I voted for who is responsible for this deprivation of human liberty. I'd like to....."</p>
   <p>"Ha! Ha!" answered his friend, "you would spend two hundred dollars to go to Washington to do the impossible. Why don't you send five dollars to the fund collected by the Ethnikus Kyriks (National Herald Press) for the purpose of buying Venizelos a gift?"</p>
   <p>"I won't, because I am a Royalist, and as such I would only give money to give a jewel-studded sword to King Constantine."</p>
   <p>"Get out, get away," answered his friend. "You have filled the place with unclean microbes. Go some place else and draw flies."</p>
   <p>My theme is not the Royalists, but prohibition. So let's go back to the subject.</p>
   <p>In order to satisfy my wine-loving compatriots, I would like to send the <pb facs="5422062_1_0627.jpg" n="3"/>following letter to Washington:</p>
   <p>Dear Lawmakers:</p>
   <p>Maybe you are accustomed to drinking coffee and tea with your meals; perhaps you don't even like beer or wine, but you should have thought of the thousands of mouths that await impatiently the cooling, exhilarating and life-giving glass of wine.</p>
   <p>You should have realized that we Greeks cannot give picnics, or dances, or weddings, or baptisms, or even funerals without wine.</p>
   <p>By condemning wine to death, you are killing all our social events and so, indirectly, you will be the cause of our priests' dying of starvation.</p>
   <p>Another fact you should know--since every one else does--is that some of our Reverends can't officiate on Sunday unless they are bolstered up with a few glasses of wine.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0628.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>You see, wine is always used to represent the blood of Christ, and since our priests love our Savior very much, they feel justified in partaking of a large amount of this symbolic fluid.</p>
   <p>Because of all these serious reasons, we beg of you that you endeavor to prevent the passing of this law, which will make it impossible for us to do any kind of celebrating. For the other nationalities, you may vote as you wish, but we Greeks must be allowed our wine and beer and our innocent card games, for these are habits which have been left to us by our ancestors and without which we cannot live.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>N. Lambropoulos</p>
