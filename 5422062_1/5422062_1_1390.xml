   <p>"Those boys are accustomed to a hard life, and pay no attention to it," we heard the proprietor of a shoe-shine parlor say; when we complained to him about his harsh treatment of his employees.</p>
   <p>He forced seven Greek youths, in his employ, to sleep upon the bare floor in the damp basement of his establishment. "Those children are little peasants," said this conscienceless boss, whose teeth glittered with numerous gold fillings as he adjusted his diamont tie pin, which was worth four hundred dollars. Then he added: "If you allow peasants to sleep in beds they become lazy and worthless."</p>
   <p>The skin of these boys is as yellow as faded autumn leaves. They are bent crooked and resemble the weak little trees that are bent under a furious mountain gale. Unwashed, and black from the polishes and dyes, with sunken eyes resulting from sleeplessness and continual overwork, these boys are wrecked and ruined for life, <pb facs="5422062_1_1391.jpg" n="2"/>at an age when they are really just budding and ready to bloom.</p>
   <p>Behold! the pitiful picture of thousands of small Greek boys, enslaved in Greek-American cleaning and shoe-shine establishments. Behold! the fate of these poor waifs, who are ignored and unprotected.</p>
   <p>These boys are the innocent offspring of honest villagers and shepherds in Greece. They were entrusted to the boss,--with the mouth full of gold teeth--who promised to pay their passage fare and to give the parents the big sum of one hundred and fifty drachmas. The boys were to serve one year as apprentices, and receive a salary as soon as they knew the trade.</p>
   <p>This is the indecent exploitation indulged in by various heartless bosses, who wear diamonds bought with the lives of little boys.</p>
   <p>This condition must not be allowed to continue. The Saloniki, will excercise all its powers to punish those who exploit human beings in this most bestial manner.</p>
