   <p>With an audience of five hundred people, the holiday of St. George school, (Agios Georgios), took place at the school hall on the 30th of June exactly at 3:30. The program opened with a prayer and the students sang, "Evlogitos E Christai O Theos".</p>
   <p>Then the principal, Archreverend Daniel Kolemis, introduced the pupils of the school, the teachers, Mrs. S. Flambouras and Miss Z. Lappas, to the people present, and briefly explained the purpose of the assemblage.</p>
   <p>The students presented the program with a certain forwardness that brought pride to the hearts of all the spectators. An exhibition of the progress made in Greek grammar and the Bible was enthusiastically received and wildly applauded by everyone.</p>
   <p>The Great Greek organization of Gapa was represented at this gathering by Mr. A. Kapsopoulos, who praised the school of St. George and emphasized the need of instilling the Greek spirit and tongue into the hearts of our younger generation.</p>

   <p>Another speaker was that true Zakinthian, the president of St. George church, Mr. A. Flambouras who congratulated the parents on the performances of their children.</p>
   <p>Under the leadership of Archreverend Daniel Kolemis and the teachers, Mrs. Flambouras and Miss Lappas and the direction of the Board of Directors of the Church, the school of St. George deserves the praise and congratulations of every single person in the community.</p>
