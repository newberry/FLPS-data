   <p>p. 1- The country is not satisfied with statements made to the effect that capitalism is the world's ideal system. The people still believe in freedom of trade; but that is far from believing that it is better that money should be in the hands of the few than that it should be scattered among thousands. When our Secretary of the Treasury declares that concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is more beneficial than even distribution among the many, then the lines are clearly drawn between capitalism and the rights of man.</p>
   <p>In a long-drawn-out battle between capital and mankind the strife will be terrific. Unless sound reasoning prevails, the country is likely to be thrown into political turmoil immeasurably fiercer than any that has been recorded in its past history. In the forthcoming fray the weapons to be used are not going to be firearms - except here and there - but the ballot-box. The final outcome cannot be anything else but placing human flesh above the might of gold, which has been the cause of the shedding of rivers of blood.</p>

   <p>In this enlightened age, in this twentieth century, when humanity is reaching up to the remotest boundaries of the universe to solve the mysteries of nature, it is unthinkable that we should be earning our bread by the sweat of our brow. If all the progress achieved by modern science does not suffice to solve our problems, then it is best that we fall back to prehistoric means of cultivating the soil and do away with our entire superstructure of civilization.</p>
