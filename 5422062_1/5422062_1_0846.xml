   <p>p. 1. Programs have been circulated by St. Basil church, through which we are informed, that the procession of the burial of Christ will go, this year, as far as Halsted Street, in Order to meet the identical procession of the Holy Trinity Church. Aparadoxical encounter!</p>
   <p>We are ardent advocates for a meeting of the councils of both churches to affect the merging of the two Communities into one. Such a meeting shall support with all our might and we firmly believe that these two Communities should unite so there would not be a need of two different processions of the burial of Christ on the West Side. Until this is accomplished, let the directors of St. Basil Church confine themselves within their limits and not advance their procession of the Holy Trinity church.</p>
   <p>We believe that the officials of St. Basil will take in consideration our friendly suggestions, and so we close with the warm wish, that next year we shall attend, all of us, the procession of the ceremony of the United Community of West Side.</p>
