   <p>The Greeks did not teach the world about farming, nor the production of steel or iron; but they did teach the world to think logically and to create exquisite statuary from cold marble, and by the synthesis of colors to create beautiful images.</p>
   <p>It was the Greek mind that first said "all things are not as they seem". A Greek founded the study of Philosophy. Thales of Miletus was the first to predict the eclipse of the sun; the first to teach the use of the North Star as a guide.</p>
   <p>The Greek is the highest type of the Caucasian race. Greece metamorphosed for the better everything left to her by other civilizations, and made perfect everything she herself created.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1106.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We are all Greeks," said the English poet, Shelley, "our religion, our letters, our civilization, our fine arts, the professions, and philosophy--all have been given to us by Greece....."</p>
   <p>And in the later years the Greeks are beginning again to regain that old spirit. After centuries of slavery, Greece broke the bonds by herself and gave the tyrant such a beating that no more has he attempted to re-enslave her. She has aroused the liberty-loving spirit in other subjugated countries, by being so brave.</p>
   <p>Greece now awaits the dawn of a new day to light up the path of glory which she is going to follow. And again she will become the leader and torch-bearer of all Eastern Europe, as in the days gone by.</p>
