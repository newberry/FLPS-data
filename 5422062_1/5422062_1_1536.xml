   <p>The ancient Greek genius made itself manifest in all forms of human life, and flying beyond bur planet, received sparks of heavenly light, and that illumined the whole earth.</p>
   <p>The architects, guided by that celestial light explored other planets, acquired rhythms, and built the temples of ancient Greece. The sculptors, ascending the peak of Olympus and having a spiritual communion with their Olympian gods, created their status, as prototypes of heavenly beauty. The chisel, in their hands turned the marble to a thing of art. The painters, studing nature, received scenes of earth's abundant beauty, painted pictures depicting, the beauty and the feelings of mankind, the ferociousness and rapaciousness of wild animals, the grace of the multi-colored birds, the shadowy forests, the sun-lit groves and the sweet smelling flowers.</p>
   <p>The Greek people in creating the Greek language, have perpetuated for thousands of years this treasure of Greek wisdom and ever lasting Greek civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1537.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Plato, Pythagoras and the ancient Greek philosophers have clothed the lofty and etheariol ideas in the beautiful toga of Greek language. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes and Aristophanes, have dressed the pathos of humanity with the bejeweled robe of the Greek tongue. Homer received from Olympus, the heavenly scenes and the conversations of the Olympian gods, attired them in the Greek tongue and created the Homeric epics.</p>
   <p>But in the twentieth century, we descended to the bowels of the earth. Mankind corrupted by gold and silver, wallowed in the mire of gross materialism. Blind in mind, blind in vision we do not at times raise our eyes to behold the greatness of the cosmos, flower wreathed nature and the beauty of creation. We turn our eyes and mind towards gold, to satisfy our lust for gross materialism, towards steel and iron, to kill one another, we become croaking like frogs in putrid water, day and night in the market place and stock exchange of the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1538.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We, the Greeks of America, as younger sons of our adopted country through Greek culture, must rescue this great democratic country, which is cracking under the whip of materialism, (as did the Roman Empire.) It is our sacred and imperative duty, in conjunction with our sincere devotion to the laws of the land, to maintain and perpetuate the Greek tongue from generation to generation, and impart to our fellow-Americans the colossal treasures of Greek wisdom. We must "Americo-Hellenize" the whole country.</p>
   <p>Thus the Greek-sons of the United states of America will become benefactors of this immense country because they will endow it with a much more valuable treasure, than the billions of dollars spent by the American Croesus for education and civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1539.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Although we are a drop of water in a bucket, nevertheless the Greek mind will do wonders. Bear in your Greek mind, fellow-Greeks, that the original thirteen states were a drop of water in an ocean, in comparison with the wealth and might of Great Britain, nevertheless, they liberated the country we live in today. The courage, determination, self-denial and self-sacrifice of those immortal liberators of the thirteen colonies, won the victory, which surprised the whole world, and made it possible for us and millions of others to enjoy liberty, happiness, equality and justice.</p>
   <p>The American democracy was established upon the basis of Athenian democracy and, today, it is evolved into the best and the biggest democratic country in the world, inspiring a democratic spirit.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1540.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The blood shed by your Greek ancestors, and the blood shed by your brave and immortal American liberators, for liberty and civilization, must inspire you, the new generation of Greek-Americans to march once more to Philadelphia and ring the bell of liberation that all maybe bred from the shackles of gross materialism. Mighty thrones have fallen and vanished, but the mind of Pericles and the mind of Washington, like luminous stars are leading the people of the world to liberty, happiness, progress and true civilization.</p>
