   <p>It is a great pleasure to see that the Greeks of Chicago have finally comprehended the importance of co-operation and unification. As a result of our continuous and persistent appeals they have finally made a start in the right direction--the formation of trade-unions.</p>
   <p>The owners of shoe-shine and hat-cleaning shops were the first ones to form a union. Simultaneously, the boys employed in these establishments also formed a union. We believe that such a course will benefit both the employers and the employees.</p>
   <p>The next trade to realize the blessings of organization was the restaurant trade. The employees in this trade expect to benefit greatly by forming their union.</p>
   <p>There is a strong rumor that the employees of the confectionary stores are <pb facs="5422062_1_1406.jpg" n="2"/>preparing to form a union. And why not? We have always urged the Greeks to organize themselves because we agree with the American proverbs, "In Unity there is strength" and "Two heads are better than one". The more highly we are organized the greater will be our strength.</p>
