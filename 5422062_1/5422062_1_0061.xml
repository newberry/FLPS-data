   <p>While its inhabitants have lived, died, laughed, and mourned, the joyous earth has danced around the sun once more, oblivious of the destiny of man. And the earth has arranged the steps of her dance so that man might regulate certain functions of his existence in accordance with her rhythms. So, in step with nature, we vacation, play, work, and study. Now, our rest and our playtime is over for another year, and preparation is being made for a period of study and work.</p>
   <p>This is the time when youth is the focal point of the entire world. Youth is shouldering its books and proceeding on its way toward enlightenment and culture. There are many millions today who are students and tomorrow will be the professionals, laborers, and presidents who will have inherited the <pb facs="5422062_1_0062.jpg" n="2"/>earth.</p>
   <p>Aided by their parents or guardians, the children proceed along the most beautiful thoroughfare of their lives without the burdens of adult existence and with no thought of "bills" or "depressions." Unaware of the many sacrifices made by their parents, children feel that society is responsible for their comfort and security. Youth is imperious in its demands, and is difficult to satisfy. And we adults, understanding the innocence of their mistaken ideas, try to give them every happiness while they are still in our charge.</p>
   <p>Every parent aspires to see his or her children happy and secure. They educate them and teach them in order that they may face life's struggle well armed. Parents are aware that one who is trained for a particular profession does not suffer the uncertainty and fear of the ignorant person who can only work as a common laborer. Parents also have discovered, <pb facs="5422062_1_0063.jpg" n="3"/>through bitter experience, that their daughters also require an education. It is true that most of them marry while comparatively young and that they do not usually work while in their parental home. But marriage is a variable thing which involves many factors pertinent to existence. A daughter's husband may die; he may become an invalid; or again, as now happens so frequently, the couple may obtain a divorce. A woman should have some special training or education to keep her from becoming the victim of any untoward circumstances.</p>
   <p>Of all the sacrifices parents make for the sake of their children, the worthiest is the effort made to give them a good education. Parents work to be able to buy bread to feed their children, but that is not most necessary; for even if parents do not provide food the instinct of hunger and self-preservation will force them to seek sustenance for themselves. But they who labor to endow their offspring with something that is priceless--with an education, a diploma--are giving them a dowry that will <pb facs="5422062_1_0064.jpg" n="4"/>enrich their entire life.</p>
   <p>Perhaps our young people never tell us, in so many words, how much they appreciate the sacrifices made for them, or the opportunities laid at their feet. But deep in their innermost soul is a realization of the great privilege accorded to them by their unselfish parents. No matter how hard you are being buffeted around by economic conditions, please do not attempt to ease your plight by taking the children out of their last year of high school. If you do you are dooming them to a life of servility and want.</p>
   <p>Our race has always been a worshiper of letters, and we, its members, are worthy of a high, respected place in society. Let those who dislike education and scorn culture work as laborers. We are going higher!</p>
