   <p>(Reverend [Constantine X.] Demetriou continues the discussion on mixed marriages, and interprets the provisions of the official bulletin of the Greek Ministries on Foreign and Church Affairs.)</p>
   <p>"Marriage by a justice of the peace or by civil authorities is recognized by the Greek Orthodox Church because it considers marriage a simple personal contract in virtue of which the couple is entitled to the protection of the law. To perform the marriage ceremony, the church, through the priest, must be given a certificate or license issued by the city hall. The civil authorities cannot prevent a legally performed wedding, whereas the church can forbid such a wedding for several reasons. The law, however, can punish any violation of the civil or criminal code after the marriage.</p>
   <p>"Just as is the case when a marriage license is issued, so also, in regard to the dissolution of marriage, do the state and the church act separately and independently.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0752.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"There are many of our people who think that their matrimonial status no longer exists since the courts dissolved the marriage. As far as Greeks are concerned, their marriage has not thereby been dissolved. Conversely, many think they are properly married when they merely have a license from the city hall and the blessing of the justice of the peace.</p>
   <p>"The state has the right to dissolve a civil marriage, but not the marriage performed by the church. Only the Patriarchate [the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Church], the archdiocese, or the diocese to which the couple belongs, has any authority to dissolve a marriage which was performed by a Greek priest. Only in Greece proper can the civil courts authorize the dissolution of a marriage. Hence, without the consent of the Greek church, American civil courts in any state cannot dissolve the marriage of a Greek couple or of a couple one of whom belongs to the Greek Orthodox faith. Without this consent, a second marriage of either member of this couple will be considered an act of bigamy, which, according to the Greek church and to the law, constitutes a crime. We <pb facs="5422062_1_0753.jpg" n="3"/>must be careful, because in America a marriage is legal when the couple agree to marry on mere personal grounds, regardless of social or church sanction and blessing.</p>
   <p>"Of course, since we do not as yet have an Orthodox Diocese in Chicago, the Greek priests and churches in Chicago must be authorized by the Holy Synod--that is, by our immediate superior ecclesiastical authority in the mother country--to dissolve marriages, issue divorce papers, as well as to perform weddings and issue church marriage certificates. In other words, a council of capable, recognized, and educated Greek priests must form a spiritual ecclesiastical court to pass on and judge all cases related to marriage. Thus, a great service will be rendered the Greek people for their social, religious, and moral welfare."</p>
