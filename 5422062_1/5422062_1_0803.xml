   <p>The City Ordinance, that is meant to protect children from any indecent and nervebreaking aspects in daily life, gave the writer the ground to ask a further enlargement of the ordinance, so that it will include the phrase "protecting the children from their parents." Who will protect the children from their parents? (at least some parents).</p>
   <p>Some Greek parents teach the youngsters discipline, to say thank you, and to believe that children are brought love in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> from heaven. This is the way some parents this and are fortented that they give the youngsters an ideal <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to begin with.</p>
   <p>The parents drag the young <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to the movies, to public gatherings, entertainments and soon, depriving <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to such places that are polluted with the germs of corruption and immorality and other destructive elements under the guise of art, drama, beauty, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0804.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Very recently <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Greek family devoted to the celebration of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> drinking, the boys and girls singing and dancing, with due respects to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> until the wee hours of the dawn. I also noticed upon a <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of the picnic prouds beer selling establishment, a youngstar of six or seven years old trying to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. Indeed it was one of the children who was taught, decipline, to any thank you, and to believe be came from <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in a backet, but who was also taught, by this example, to spend the rights at public gatherings, and to sleep upon the so<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of beer dispensing establishments. No one would dare dispute that such a treatment of youngstar is not right, still however, there is no <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to protect the young terms from their parents.</p>
