  <body>
   <p>While the two major parties contest the field for the Presidential chair and for power, the economic crisis is becoming more tense and unemployment is increasing.</p>
   <p>The two presidential candidates are broadcasting promises galore and claiming that if their party is elected to power they will bring in the "Golden Rule." In the meantime, the gold flies away abroad where its fortunate possessors find more profitable investments.</p>
   <p>No one of the two candidates tell us anything however of how he is going to put a stop to this money outflow to Europe, while so many working hands remain idle in America, and so many large public works are also idle and ineffective. Many millions of workers are not only out of work, but are penniless also.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1452.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>None of the candidates touched this question, however, which interests the people so much but is of little concern to the capitalists. Both parties are supported by capitalists, and to these capitalists primarily they give most attention, although they make promises to the voters.</p>
   <p>In regard to improvement in the economic situation, therefore, we are expecting none, whichever party wins.</p>
