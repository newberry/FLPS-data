<title level="a">THE GREEK CAFES</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The police records of the American cities are being filled with the names of Greek gamblers. The Greek cafes have become the objects of close scrutiny by the police. Many cafe owners have been fined, and large numbers have been put in prison.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Harrison, condemned the Greek cafes very vehemently when he addressed the city council. He called them centers of vice and evil; in fact, he classified them with the dime-a-dance halls and Chinese opium dens.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, our respected mayor has been sadly modernism about the Greek cafes. As yet, no Chicago cafe has been closed by the police for any reason whatsoever. The mayor has probably judged all of them from the reports on Greek cafes he has received from other cities. These reports are so bad that <pb facs="5422062_1_0645.jpg" n="2"/>the mayor cannot be blamed in the least for his attitude.....</p>
   <p>And now that the New Year holidays are coming, the Greek gamblers will be increasing their activities; and,so,adding further dishonor to the Greek name. How long will this condition continue to exist?</p>
   <p>Many believe as the Chicago Mayor does, that the cafes are the reason for the gambling. Others believe--and more correctly--that there are only a few dishonest proprietors who use their cafes as sources of illegitimate incomes.</p>
   <p>The truth of it is, that the Kafenior [cafe] is a native Greek institution and serves a definite purpose. It is the community meeting place and the haven first sought by the Greek immigrant. A few years ago the Lowell, Massachusetts, police did not allow the Greeks to open cafes. As a result the doorsteps of the Greek homes were crowded with men because they had no other <pb facs="5422062_1_0646.jpg" n="3"/>place to go. There they met, became acquainted, and held friendly conversations. When the cafes finally opened, these men merely moved to the marble topped tables and continued their arguments and patriotic discussions.</p>
   <p>This is exactly what the cafe means to the Greek; a place to meet and talk on every subject under the sun.</p>
   <p>It is not fair that all should be judged by the actions of the few who are cheats and gamblers.</p>
   <p>This matter has its comical aspects. As we all know, these cafes bear historic and classical names, such as the Acropolis, the Parthenon....The American papers often print articles with titles such as, "The Acropolis is closed", or "The Paradise is raided by police".</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0647.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These ridiculous things must be stopped. The Greek people are becoming objects of ridicule. We Greeks must see to it that the gamblers are eradicated; so that we shall not become unworthy of being called Hellenes.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki has declared war upon all those who shame or lower the Greek name.</p>
