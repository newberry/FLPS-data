   <p>We have written so many articles about the education of our Greek children that we are afraid of having bored our readers. However, the subject is of such importance that we take the liberty to add another plea to our already long list. It is our duty to do so since it is the function of a newspaper to uplift and enlighten the community it serves.</p>
   <p>We have previously declared our pride in the Greeks of America, for they have become scholars, business and professional men, and capable laborers. We wish to re-emphasize this feeling of pride. But what can we say for the Greek people as a group? As a mass? What have we done to keep our customs and institutions, our language and culture, alive in America? Have we given our children any reason to love our fatherland? Are they taught our glorious and heroic history? <pb facs="5422062_1_0470.jpg" n="2"/>Do they read and write the beautiful Greek language that will enrich their lives?</p>
   <p>All these things could be done by the Greek schools of our church parishes. But--what kind of churches and parishes do we have? Are they unified and progressive, or are they divided, stagnant, and of little or no social value? We are afraid that the affirmative of the latter question describes them perfectly. Has anyone seen a Greek parish in America that is not a hotbed of intrigue, scandal, and money-grabbing? Has a parish ever existed that was united and cognizant of the needs of the younger generation? Instead of trying to benefit the community, each Greek church and the individuals that guide its destinies take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself to keep the group disorganized and discontented. If these churches maintain some poor excuse of a school, it is only because they want to have an excuse to pass another collection plate at each service.</p>
   <p>What, then, does this newspaper seek for itself, the community, and the coming generations of Greeks? Just this: that all church parishes in America send <pb facs="5422062_1_0471.jpg" n="3"/>a worthy and educated representative to a meeting whose purpose it would be to make plans for the erection and maintenance of Greek parish schools on a nationwide scale. These schools should have the facilities and enough financial backing so that the pupils might receive a complete and comprehensive education.</p>
   <p>They must be the kind of schools that imbue the children with a sincere desire to learn. The buildings should be light and airy, not dark, dreary, and unsanitary. The present schools are so dull and uninspiring that it is not hard to understand the aversion the Greek children have for them. The efforts expended to teach children in these schools are being wasted. A child that leaves such a school will not remember anything he has been taught. He will forget the language because he has not been taught to speak it fluently. In fact, children are not taught the same kind of Greek that they speak at home, and as a result they quickly lose all the knowledge that they managed to get.</p>
   <p>We have met many children who were students in Greek schools. Their ignorance <pb facs="5422062_1_0472.jpg" n="4"/>of the Greek language, grammar, and history was disgraceful, but it is not at all their own fault. The teaching in the Greek schools is so abominable that we admire the courage of the pupils who make sincere efforts to learn. Let us create grammar and high schools which will be on a par with similar American institutions and which will be recognized by the latter.</p>
   <p>Such cities as Chicago, Detroit, San Fransisco, and New York, with rather large Greek populations, should each have at least one good school. Students should be equipped to enter any American school or university, since they can be taught English as well as Greek. If we do not build such schools we are doing nothing for our children. They will grow up and be ashamed of their heritage. But actually they should be ashamed of us, for we are not giving them a true picture of Greece and Greek culture.</p>
   <p>The unification and co-operation of the Greek parishes is the most important problem facing the Greeks of America. We have called the attention of the <pb facs="5422062_1_0473.jpg" n="5"/>Greeks to this matter many times. We dedicate the columns of this paper to the furtherance of this movement. It is such a worthy and patriotic cause that it is worth the wholehearted support of every Greek in America.</p>
   <p>This is not--as it seems at first--an unattainable goal. Actually, it is easy to achieve, since it will receive the encouragement and aid of every patriotic and progressive Greek citizen.</p>
