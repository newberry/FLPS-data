   <p>Hitler and his ardent fascist followers and sympathizers, when discussing the situation existing in Germany today, speak of a reborn Germany. They speak of a rekindled culture and of true Germans. The rest of the world--opposed to the methods of Hitlerism--does not see anything except tyranny presented under a new guise, if it is possible to hide tyranny under any guise.</p>
   <p>Political developments in Germany have taken a curious course since the ratification of the Weimar constitution. The Weimar constitution was supposed to be one of the finest expressions of social democracy that had ever been adopted. During a few years that intervened between the adoption of this constitution and its abolition by Hitler political conditions in Germany proceeded along a quiet, conservative path--only to end in the absolutism of today. If the Social Democrats in power had been more progressive and liberal, they, and not Hitler, might be ruling the German nation today.</p>
