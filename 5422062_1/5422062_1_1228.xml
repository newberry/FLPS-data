   <p>Quite a few influential and important Greeks in Chicago have dared to direct vindictive attacks and calumnies against American public officials without proper or reasonable justification. We regret that we must reproach some impertinent and loose-tongued fellow countrymen for acts which place us in a most unfavorable position before the American public.</p>
   <p>The respect and honor in which the Greek people of Chicago hold the American officials and our American friends in general should remain high. Our sense of gratitude impose on us that duty for the many benefits and blessings which have been extended us. In the November 18 issue of the Loxias, a Greek satirical weekly published in this city, we note with indignation an unjust and unwarranted attack on Mr. A. A. Seraphic, United States inspector in charge of <pb facs="5422062_1_1229.jpg" n="2"/>ports in this state, and a special investigating officer of the Bureau of Immigration. A lie has been resorted to by a clique of Greeks, actuated by vindictiveness, because they were brought to justice by Mr. Seraphic and convicted by the Federal courts here for violations of the immigration laws. The editor of the Loxias was induced to seize upon this lie as a pretext to justify the attack. The lie referred to states that Mr. Seraphic was present at the Greek meeting at the Chicago Masonic Temple to influence votes in behalf of the party headed by the gentleman who is now president of the Greek community of Chicago, as well as president of the Panhellenic Union or League of all Greek communities throughout the United States. That, while there, Mr. Seraphic applauded the party referred to and that such action is, in the mind of the editor of Loxias, a crime of partisanship and as such is brought to the attention of His Excellency, the President of the United States, with a rather conspicuous heading in English.</p>
   <p>For our part, we are ashamed of the stupidity and ignorance displayed by the <pb facs="5422062_1_1230.jpg" n="3"/>man who poses as an editor of a Greek publication. The said meeting took place on November 13, at 9 P. M., for the purpose of designating a committee to supervise the election of officers at a later date. We are in a position to know that although Mr. Seraphic happened to be present at this meeting, the insinuation is untrue, as Mr. Seraphic is in no way connected with the affairs of our community and does not interfere in our factional fights.</p>
   <p>We know from Mr. Georgopoulos, who is connected with the office of the chief of police of Chicago, that Mr. Seraphic called at the Masonic Temple by appointment to meet him, regarding some information desired. We also know that Mr. Georgopoulos was late, and Mr. Seraphic took a seat near the entrance to the hall on the side occupied by the constituency of the incumbent president. We know, from reputable Greeks who sat by his side that he did not applaud. He left just after he saw Mr. Georgopoulos. These are facts and not fabrications. But, were the fabrications appearing in the Loxias facts, Mr. Seraphic would have been perfectly free and at liberty to exercise his rights, that is, rights <pb facs="5422062_1_1231.jpg" n="4"/>that inhere to American citizenship, of which evidently the editor of the Loxias is utterly ignorant.</p>
   <p>If the faction supported by Loxias was ignored in that meeting, it was for other reasons and not because of the presence of Mr. Seraphic in the opposition. Mr. Seraphic is highly esteemed and respected by all law abiding Greeks here and throughout the United States. He does honor to his nationality and we are proud of him. [Translator's note: Mr. Seraphic is of American and Greek parentage.] None but the lawbreakers fear him and the inference drawn from the statements of Loxias is an insult to the Greeks of Chicago. We know that all Greeks who attended that meeting and brought about the results are law-abiding, intelligent, and successful businessmen who fear nobody.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star has known Mr. Seraphic for years, and it respects his record with the government and also with the Greeks. We have found him to be a perfect gentleman in every respect, and a man faithfully performing his duties; <pb facs="5422062_1_1232.jpg" n="5"/>therefore, we take pleasure in publishing this article, not only to contradict what was published in said paper, but to say, even to the English-speaking public, that Mr. Seraphic does a great honor to the Greeks in the United States, and enjoys the love and respect of all respectable Greeks from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
