  <body>
   <p>Honor was paid to the memory of the late Eleutherios Venizelos, one time premier of Greece, who died in exile in Paris, March 18, when thousands of Chicago Greeks gathered in their ten churches for memorial services yesterday.</p>
   <p>The main service was held at St. Constantine's Church, 61st street and Michigan avenue, where His Grace Gennadios M. Arabaglon, primate of the Oecumenical Patriarchate of the Greek Orthodox Church officiated.</p>
   <p>Memorials Planned</p>
   <p>His grace who is one of the twelve governing heads of the Eastern church is in Chicago visiting a brother. He arrived here recently from Constantinople. <pb facs="5422062_1_0828.jpg" n="2"/>His title of "Metropolitan" of the church is the equivalent of cardinal.</p>
   <p>The memorials to Venizelos, who had been called "the greatest Greek statesman since Pericles", will be nation-wide.</p>
   <p>Once Visited Chicago</p>
   <p>In Chicago it is estimated that some 75,000 Greeks will pay tribute to onetime premier's honor.</p>
   <p>Venizelos and his bride visited the city in 1921 on their honeymoon. Co-incidentally, Venizelos attended a special service at St. Constantine's when he was here.</p>
