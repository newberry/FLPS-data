   <p>The educational committee feels that the primary object of this organization is educational. It is of the firm belief that if it were possible for all the members of the Order to understand and to practice the lessons that are taught by this organization through its ritualistic work the mission of the Order has been attained and its future secured. It is, however, evident that in our anxiety to increase and multiply in numbers, we have neglected the responsibility we assumed when new members were initiated in our ranks, and consequently many members have lost interest in the organization. The educational committee, therefore, feels that our efforts and attention for the coming year should be concentrated on the education of our members and to the better preparation of those who desire to become members.</p>
   <p>To attain the above results the educational committee humbly suggests the following recommendations:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0073.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. That each chapter, through the assistance and cooperation of the District Governor of this organization, organize initiation teams which will be well drilled in the execution of the initiation work.</p>
   <p>2. That all chapters must follow the official ritual and that no deviation from it shall be tolerated.</p>
   <p>3. That the District Governor shall be held responsible to the Supreme Lodge for the enforcement of the above recommendations and that the failure of any chapter to conduct its initiation in strict accordance with the ritual of our Order and its failure to do so may be good and sufficient reason for the District Governor to suspend this chapter while awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Supreme President.</p>
   <p>4. That the Supreme Secretary, and in cooperation with the Supreme President or any of the other Supreme Lodge officers, shall either prepare <pb facs="5422062_1_0074.jpg" n="3"/>or select from the rich store of the literature of the world, short or inspiring sermons, lecture or essays, and furnish the chapter regularly with copies of them, for the purpose of reading them to the members.</p>
   <p>5. That a speaker's bureau be established in every district, and that the head of said speaker's bureau be the District Governor.</p>
   <p>The committee believes that as there are many chapters closely located in the densely populated localities the expense and the time which is required for the speaker to travel to these chapters for the purpose of delivering a lecture is negligible.</p>
   <p>In many cases the speakers are more than anxious to spend the required time for such purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0075.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The committee is of the unanimous opinion that the chapters crave for short, intelligent and enlightening addresses, and if there has ever been an expression of opinion against it, it was not against the principle of education but against the idea of having them rocked to sleep by speakers who have no conception of time. A short, concise and interesting lecture can find its way in every chapter room at every meeting.</p>
   <p>Celebration of Greek and American Independence</p>
   <p>The educational committee is pleased to report that the Order of Ahepa has been the center of activities in the past in organizing meetings for the celebration of the day of the Greek independence. This fact alone has dispelled the idea that the Ahepa is as much a Greek organization as an American one. We do feel, however, that the day of the American independence has been somewhat neglected by our organization <pb facs="5422062_1_0076.jpg" n="5"/>and we recommend that wherever it is possible such meeting must be organized.</p>
   <p>The public officials of each community have never failed to cooperate with, and respond to the invitations of the local chapters in any of their undertakings, and we believe that if the Ahepa chapters were to take the initiative in sponspring celebrations for the day of American independence, the American people's esteem and admiration for our people will be greatly enhanced. It is suggested, therefore, that the Supreme Secretary shall prepare an outline of a program to be followed by each chapter if they feel able to sponsor such a celebration, and that such a program be sent to the individual chapters in amble time for each chapter to make the necessary preparation for such celebration. It is also recommended that the Supreme Secretary should encourage, through his correspondence with the individual chapters to such undertakings, and urge the individual chapters to sponsor them if they can.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0077.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The committee feels, however, that this organization shall continue to award a few scholarships every year as it has been doing in the past until a better plan of awarding scholarships to worthy, needy and meritorious students has been devised.</p>
   <p>We therefore recommend that the sum of $2,000 be appropriated for scholarships and we feel that the abuses, mistakes and iniquities that have prevailed in the past in making awards will be reduced to a minimum since all scholarship awards must be submitted to the District Governor, whose approval or endorsement must first be obtained before the Supreme Lodge shall have the power to make any awards. In order to make the contribution as fair and as equitable as possible, we make the following recommendations:</p>
   <p>1. That in awarding scholarships, all things being equal, the members of the Ahepa and the Sons of Pericles must be given preference.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0078.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>2. That all applications must be approved and endorsed by the District Governor of the District in which the applicant resides or is attending school.</p>
   <p>3. That before any application shall be considered, it shall have the favorable endorsement of two members of the Order of Ahepa, and two members of the faculty of the institution the applicant is attending.</p>
   <p>4. That the scholastic standing of the applicant must be procured from the registrar of the school which the applicant is attending, or has been attending, and must be a part of the application of the applicant.</p>
   <p>5. That in awarding scholarships, the Supreme Lodge shall have the authority to award as much as $200 or as little as $100 to anyone applicant and that said money shall be made payable to the order of the institution which the applicant is attending.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0079.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>6. The committee is of the opinion that in order to make certain that these scholarship awards are to be awarded annually the sum of (5%) be set aside from all per capita tax which is collected by the Supreme Lodge and that such money be set aside for the scholarship to be awarded from time to time.</p>
