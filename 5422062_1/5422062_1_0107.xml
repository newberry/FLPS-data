   <p>p. 4.- Ismene Papageorge, the wistful little Miss, daughter of Dr. George Papageorge, is the honor student of Austin High School, and it is wished by teachers and all, that time and growth will not effect her, so she can stay in the High school all the time, as the angel of the school. It would be a tragic thing for Austin if "Izzy" goes away.</p>
   <p>Here is a list of her accomplishments. She is president of the Opera Club, and has been the vice-president, secretary, treasurer and program chairman of the same organization in past semesters. She is vice-president and was treasurer of the Pentong club, chairman of the C. I. C. excursion committee, program chairman of the Astral Club, has been sergeant-at-arms, secretary, and now is vice-president of the Uke Club. Ismene has been the program and song chairman of the "Y" in 1928 and 1929, program chairman of the Opera Club for two years, and for the Girls' Glee club for one year, program chairman of the History Club in 1929.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0108.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nevertheless, all these numerous positions that "Izzy" holds down, have not made her too big or "high-hat." And everybody thinks that Ismene is strictly Austin property.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to our beautiful and wise little Greek girl, and to our good doctor Papageorge, for having such a daughter.</p>
