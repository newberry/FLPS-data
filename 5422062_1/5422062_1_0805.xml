   <p>Character is mainly a result of training. The parents' and teachers' duty is to bring out all potentialities and advantages latent within a child. Later, those who watch the development of the boy or the girl, are responsible as to the development of the childs' character.</p>
   <p>Also, the judge should take into consideration the breeding of the accused in order to accurately find out the seriousness of the offense or crime. His job is not only the measuring of the crime, but also the investigation of conditions under which he or she commited the crime, and then, and only then, the penalty will be a just one.</p>
   <p>The child is not responsible as to whether the parents happened to be poor or rich, nor as to whether he or she inherited from the parents dispositions and habits, good or bad, or as to whether faulty training has wrought a bad character.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0806.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It can be said that child training, today, is a matter of secondary importance undertaken by parents who, as a rule, lack that very thing. Consequently, we must not get surprised if youth gets the worst of it, constantly.</p>
   <p>However, this cannot go on very long. It is time to have this incomplete exercise of responsibility reformed, the training of children laid on a sound basis, consistent with wise guidance of the natural tendencies, and directed by able instructors. The State must step in with circumspection, if it genuinely wants to see child training improve generally with good results.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the noble efforts of parents, usually, are not effective, today, because of the unnatural conditions of life which get the parents and also the children into an equivocal position. They are made to suffer evils, sorrows, deprivations, and grave diseases. To these are added bad companions, bad customs, and temptations in various forms. Things that are likely to make, even the best bred man go astray. There is a feeling that justice and truth have fallen down, and it is easy to become a bad man.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0807.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have here an excerpt from an article of a large German journal. The ideas brought forward in it are in accord with ours. "Present conditions," it says, "demand radical changes in regard to the training of children. Complaints about ill-bred children have increased in such a fashion that they cause uneasiness to us all. We cannot conceal the fact that there is this great defect, in the present system, and which endangers our future generations.</p>
   <p>"The consequences of past attempts at economic social reforms were in no way helpful towards the emancipation of youth from corruption. Youth became more libertine and more inclined to accept the temptations of evil. The weak types surrendered themselves wholly to self-indulgence, and when their means were exhausted, they did not stop but robbed, cheated, and even resorted to firearms to further their evil ways. Attacks, injuries, violence and threats found their confederate in youth. In public disaster the modern youth behaves itself rather shamelessly and violently. Many of the young girl graduates of schools surrender themselves to indulgence, cannot break up their immoral life and lose caste completely.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0808.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Experience teaches us that penalties are not sufficient to fight the increasing tendency toward crime found in youth of the present day. The tendency must be fought from the start in order to rescue youth from the pernicious environment into which it has floundered. Bad habits must be controlled by a methodical training that will react on successfully body and soul."</p>
