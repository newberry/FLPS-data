   <p>My dear Mr. Editor: Please permit me to express my opinion and reaction to the recent editorial concerning the marriage manifesto of Germany; and the not-so-much-publicized--but nevertheless existent--Greek manifesto.</p>
   <p>I have approached this grave matter from three angles, and will present my reply in three sections.</p>
   <p>First: the action of the German lawmakers in regard to the marital age requirements is not only brutal, but it is also anti-social. Encouraging and forcing unions of people who do not desire, or are too young or too old, to wed, is actually an infraction of their civil liberties.</p>
   <p>Second: this concerns the encouragement of large families by our own King Constantine, as well as by the Kaiser.</p>
   <p>Both preach the doctrine of liberal and unrestrained multiplication; and, <pb facs="5422062_1_0744.jpg" n="2"/>in order to encourage the laggards, they bestow tin medals and bonuses upon the most fruitful of their subjects. King Constantine goes so far as to become the godfather of these children.</p>
   <p>Those who are allowed, by their ignorance and lack of knowledge, to raise large families; are sooner or later to awaken to certain bitter realizations. How are these children to be fed and clothed? How are they to be educated and fitted out for the future?</p>
   <p>And so I say to the parents of large families,--especially the mothers--the only reward you will receive for bringing many children into the world, will be--tears.</p>
   <p>I believe that the rulers who are encouraging promiscuous marriages are responsible for setting the human race back a hundred years. They are reducing humans to a level lower than that of animals; because, even the higher types of beasts do not breed every ten months.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0745.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A country or nation is far better off if it has a selected--instead of a large--population. I heartily believe that the program of the Kaiser and Constantine will be voluntarily followed only by the uneducated and by the morally degenerate; these, curiously enough, always breed in great numbers without any encouragement. Perhaps present-day rulers would like to govern a race of people whose only difference from rabbits would be the absence of long, pink ears.</p>
   <p>Third: better and fewer children, is my other point. This seems to me to be the sanest, most decent, and most beneficial of all social welfare programs. People should be free to have families whenever they choose, and to the extent that they choose. In that way the size of the family would be dependent upon the desires of the parents; the parents, in turn, are influenced by their income and their environment.</p>
   <p>A couple that knowingly brings children into the world when there is not sufficient means to give them proper care is committing a heinous crime against the innocent children and the rest of society.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0746.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is true that, if this policy had been carried out about the time we were born, a great many of us would not be here today. But a close scrutiny of our fellow men and fellow countrymen, will quickly convince us of the advisability of birth restriction.</p>
   <p>In regard to the New York organization, I am in accordance with its principles of restricting marriage to only those found to be completely fit. I disagree with their clause forbidding marriage to poor individuals; because it is not democratic, but plutocratic. Marriage should be entirely unrestricted by any man-made laws.</p>
   <p>With respect</p>
   <p>C. Antonopoulos</p>
