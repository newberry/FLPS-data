   <p>The first Greek immigrants to this country, or rather the pioneers, were not of the educated class of Greece, but rather the opposite, nevertheless, they did not fail to comprehend the importance and significance of education. Two words gyrating back and forth in their mind. Church and School, but which one first?</p>
   <p>The financial circumstances of the Greeks did not permit them to have both. Church, was indispensable, but School was a necessary prerequisite; they argued back and forth about this, the result being that they decided both must be built. Their daily necessities of life must be curtailed in order to have both. That is the reason everywhere in America you will find a Greek school either next to the church or in the church building.</p>
   <p>The Korais School is one of the many schools all over the country. The object of the school is not to mold perfect Greeks, but perfect Greek Americans. The English and the Greek Language is taught side by side, Greek and American ideas are taught, reading, writing, English, history, geography, composition, religion, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0212.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Teachers few the morning and evening classes, as will for Sunday School, are chosen ladies and gentlemen of culture, high education and high morals.</p>
   <p>The personnel of the educators is under the immediate supervision of Rev. Constantine Glynos, Deacon of the Church, who was brought from Constantinople for that purpose, a distinguished Theologian.</p>
   <p>Above all stands the vigilant eye of the head priest, Rev. M. E. Petrakis, who is the head of the Church and School.</p>
   <p>A brief history of the Korais School will give the reader an idea of the exponents and servants of education at that period. Right after its completion, and at the beginning of 1910 the school opened its doors under the name of Korais. The name is a commemoration of Mr. Korais, president of the Greek University, an exponent and patron of Greek Letters and Culture. The first teachers of the school were appointed, and were supervised by Mrs. Kyriakoula Kotakis, Year after year the pupils and the personnel of the teachers were <pb facs="5422062_1_0213.jpg" n="3"/>increased; so the educational system was improved more and more.</p>
   <p>Other presidents of the institution, after Mrs. Kotakis, were Mrs. Chrysosthenes, Mr. Lempesis, Mr. G. Arvanitis, Mr. Dem. Davrantzis, Mr. D. Hagigianis, Mr. Sideris and Mr. George Papanicolopoulos, in whose period, the school reached the highest point of its purpose.</p>
   <p>Mr. Papanicolopoulos was the founder of the school's library, composed of the best and chosen Greek and American books suitable for the pupils to read.</p>
   <p>The Korais school, under the tutorship of Rev. M. Petrakis, and Rev. Constantine Glynos, inaugurated afternoon classes, only of religion and Greek language.</p>
   <p>Thus was the course of events when the building was destroyed by fire on the 26th day of April, 1926. Pupils and teachers were scattered in every direction. Some of the pupils continued their lessons by attending American schools, <pb facs="5422062_1_0214.jpg" n="4"/>others attended school in two halls at 61st and Indiana until the rebuilding of the new church and school.</p>
   <p>After the erection of the new school and church, the number of school teachers and pupils was very much increased, and according to the latest statistics, there are now 20% more pupils than there were at any other period of time. The increase, is mostly attributed to the implicit faith of the parents in the personnel of the school, which personnel is distinguished for its self denial, and devotion to its imperative duty.</p>
   <p>The personnel of the school composed as follows: For the Day School, Deacon Constantine Glynos, graduate of the Theological School of Halki; Mrs. Fotini Barounis, graduate of ... Athens; Mrs. Maria Christopoulos, graduate of Rethimni's College; Mrs. Venetia Askounis, graduate of DePaul University; Miss Maria Metos, graduate of St. Xavier's College.</p>
   <p>The personnel for the afternoon classes, Rev. Const. Glynos, Mrs. Barounis, Mrs. Christopoulos, Mrs. D. Lempesis, graduate of.....Athens; Miss Zoe Tselehovitis, <pb facs="5422062_1_0215.jpg" n="5"/>and Mrs. Maria Koumentaki, graduate of the College of Crete.</p>
   <p>School hours for the daily classes are from 8:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. every day, with the exception of Saturday. For the afternoon classes from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
   <p>The pupils besides their educational lessons are taught music, and dancing celebrations their voices hum in harmony. Under such circumstances the school is functioning and the result is not only perpetuating Greek religion, language and nationalism, but also Americanizing the pupils by the best possible method.</p>
   <p>It would have been a salvation and a blessing, if other cities in America would exemplify the Chicago Greek school, and build similar institutions all over the country, so our new generation would be known as perfect Greek-Americans.</p>
