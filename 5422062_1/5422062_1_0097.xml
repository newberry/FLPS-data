   <p>p. 1.--Last Friday evening a banquet was served by the Society of Greek Professional Men in honor of recent Greek graduates of various universities.</p>
   <p>The Most Reverent Father Athenagoras, Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of North and South America, was also a guest at the banquet. S. D. Soterakos acted as chairman, and the speakers were Paul Kilinakis, president of "Helicon," an organization of Greek young men attending universities, Catherine Melia, president of the Greek Young Women's University Club, likewise composed of university students; the Most Reverend Archbishop Athenagoras, and Dr. Joseph Morley, professor of classical languages at Northwestern University. D. A. Geroulis, a young doctor of law, though not on the regular program, was also requested to speak.</p>
   <p>The musical part of the program was furnished by Mrs. Leonora Tsivia and Mr. John Lysandrou.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0098.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Archbishop's address was impressive. He pointed out that phalanxes of young Greek scholars will contribute their share to the nation and to mankind, for Greek science working hand in hand with the Church has always guided human destiny.</p>
   <p>Professor Morley said a few words on the civilization of the old Hellenic world, laying stress on the fact that the Greek of ancient times was a great lover of beauty and strove for the attainment of ideals. He also pointed out that the reason why many contemporary scholars fail to catch the full meaning of many terms found in the works of classical authors is that they attempt to judge ethical matters according to Christian conception, which is qualitative, whereas the Greek conception of ethics and morals was quantitative. One motto of the ancient Greek was "Pan metron ariston"(Moderation in everything is best), and another was, "Meden agan "(Nothing to excess).</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0099.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Morley concluded his momentous address by calling the attention of the Greek students to the marvelous achievements of their forefathers, the ancient Hellenes, and said that it was their duty to prove themselves worthy of their fine heritage by striving to imitate the ancients and to maintain the ideals of that Greek civilization which will continue to be known as the highest ever achieved by man.</p>
   <p>The fact that the English language was used all through the program on account of an erroneous notion that this was an act of courtesy to the American professor did not please the guests nor the professor himself, in view of the fact that the Archbishop was present.</p>
   <p>This use of English was abandoned, however, when an enthusiastic young man, Dr. D. A. Geroulis, arose to speak in response to many requests.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0100.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He introduced himself in the Greek language and stated that he was proud of the fact that he is a Greek; that he had been reared in the Greek community of the West Side and owed his knowledge of Greek to the Socrates Elementary School and especially to Mr. George Drossos, who happened to be present at the banquet.</p>
   <p>Dr. Geroulis made his entire speech in the Greek language and asserted that it was his duty to serve the community in which he had been reared, and in which he had learned to love, admire, and respect everything that is Greek. He reminded all those present that the banquet was served by a group of Greek professional men in honor of Greek graduates, and that since one of the distinguished guests was the leader of our Church, the elder members at least, of this professional group should have spoken in the Greek language.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0101.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>This would also have been in harmony with the thought of Professor Morley, who laid stress on the subject of Greek social life.</p>
   <p>The numerous guests heartily applauded Dr. Geroulis's speech, for they were roused to enthusiasm by the young man's assumption of the attitude which becomes a loyal and genuine Greek.</p>
