   <p>That which is true of animals is often as true of human beings in certain aspects of life. The crow firmly believes that her young ones are the most beautiful fledglings in the bird kingdom. The mother cow placidly contemplates her ungainly offspring, knowing that it is the most graceful of all the four-footed animals she has ever seen.</p>
   <p>And humans! Each parent is sure that his or her child is the most beautiful and the most intelligent in the entire world. The animals instinctively have this feeling of pride, but humans have it because they allow their minds to be affected by their feelings. This is one of the few things which have not been changed in the history of man. It was true in the paleolithic age, and it is still true. Yet, this continuance has not been of benefit to civilization; in fact, it is a calamity.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0786.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This belief is especially prevalent in America, where theories of democracy and social equality prevail. Here, all are born equal--or at least they think they are--and have equal opportunities for success and achievement. Nine out of ten parents cherish the secret hope that their son will become president of the United States. Therefore, the democratic ideology has, in some ways, been detrimental to the youth of America. Many boys who could have become good mechanics or capable shoemakers are being trained in occupations for which they are not at all fitted.....</p>
   <p>But--American parents are fortunate; for until a short time ago, the presidency was all they could look forward to. But now another door to fame has been opened for their children; and this time to their daughters as well. If their child cannot become a government leader, he at least can become a Hollywood "star". Why should the "darlings" kill themselves working so hard in stores or on farms when they can become kings and queens of Hollywood? Unfortunately, this American ambition has even penetrated the Greek homes; and, as a result, our boys and girls are acquiring similar ambitions and <pb facs="5422062_1_0787.jpg" n="3"/>dreams.</p>
   <p>A few days ago I visited a Greek family. In the family were two adorable children--a girl and a boy--about eight and nine years old respectively. During our conversation I asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. Their answers were, "We want to go to Hollywood and get into the movies". And their response brought smiles of unconcealed admiration and approval to the faces of their parents.</p>
   <p>So we ask: Even if they do attain their ambition in life, will they also attain happiness and contentment. We are very much afraid they will not! The bitter truth of the matter is that most of us humans have not been created to play great roles in life. We cannot help but long for the greatness that seems so easy to achieve, but longing is not enough. It is necessary that a certain "something" exist in the individual in order that he may become a great artist, actor, or writer. The great mass of people are destined to stand in the sidelines and envy great ability. If they do enter the <pb facs="5422062_1_0788.jpg" n="4"/>professions for which they are in no way suited, they are destined to a life of mediocrity and sham glory.</p>
   <p>And the results? The results are very tragic. Their bright hopes are darkened, and they cannot be happy as common members of society. The simple things are affronts to their thwarted ambitions, and they think all their efforts are useless. The fact that greatness is not for them makes them become hateful and resentful, forever dissatisfied and jealous of others. All this because their parents let them think they were too good to work in stores or to become housewives, and let their foolish dreams ruin their entire lives. This disillusionment does not allow them to live a normal existence. The company of others is not pleasing to them, and they are not very popular with others. All their ideas and standards have been influenced by their mistaken ambitions.</p>
   <p>So, I ask you to think when planning your life's work.</p>
