   <p>The American Association of Greek Restaurant Keepers was incorporated on the first day of December, 1919, to promote the interests of the members in a Social, Educational and Commercial manner.</p>
   <p>Since it came into existence it has done much to raise the Standard of cooking, sanitation, working conditions and service in the restaurants of its members, with the result that it now has five hundred members.</p>
   <p>It has held many meetings at which addresses were made by sanitation cooks, business men and public officials including the Health Commissioners of Chicago with the object in view of complying with all health and sanitary regulations.</p>
   <p>It conducts a department of Naturalization whose object is to have all owners and employees become American citizens after thorough instruction in classes teaching American principles and about American institutions, thus bringing into greater cohesion its members and employees with the citizens of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1374.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It has always been its object to have its members conform to American ideals and American institutions.</p>
   <p>It has done much to wipe out racial prejudice and has fought unjust, unreasonable, illegal and un-American attempts to prejudice the public against its members.</p>
   <p>This is well illustrated by its action, last year in procuring the assistance of the courts by writ of injunction to resist an unjust attack made upon its members based on racial prejudice and untruthful statements as to working conditions by persons who did not represent organized labor.</p>
   <p>The members and our employees do not belong to any organization opposed to our government but on the contrary are all law abiding citizens.</p>
   <p>In other words we are business men whose slogan is "Americans all for America first."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1375.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We extend an invitation to the public that we serve, to make suggestions for the betterment of our service, addressing same to our office, 108 N. Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois. - John T. Askounis, President.</p>
