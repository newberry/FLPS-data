   <p>The Greek Star is happy to be in a position of responsibility which imposes upon it the duty to caution the Greek parent against the many social dangers which surround their children.</p>
   <p>Greek parents! You are responsible for the conduct of your children in the community according to the latest law which was passed. Before, the judge had authority only to reprimand or warn the parents whose underage sons or daughters went astray. Now, however, the court has the power to penalize the parents of those children who follow the road to corruption, delinquency, and crime. Those parents are subject to a two-hundred-dollar fine or imprisonment for one year, or both, when they are found to be reluctant or unable to restrain their children from becoming burdens to society.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0810.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Juvenile Protective Association advises all parents to give their children the proper upbringing, to offer their young men and women the best possible physical care, moral, and mental education. No one has to be told that it is his or her duty to serve society by supplying it with healthy young men and women physically, morally, and mentally. It is such men and women that make for a healthy citizenry. It is estimated that three to four thousand young boys and girls are brought to juvenile courts every year. Also about eleven thousand boys and girls between the ages of sixteen to twenty are brought before other courts.</p>
   <p>In order to prevent this evil the Juvenile Protective Association offers to give the parents any kind of advice pertaining to those of their children who are showing signs of delinquency or who are emotionally or psychologically maladjusted.</p>
   <p>The Association has informed us that it maintains a total of thirteen offices in the city besides the central office which is located in room 1520 <pb facs="5422062_1_0811.jpg" n="3"/>of the Ashland Block Building, 59 North Clark Street.</p>
