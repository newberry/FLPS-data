   <p>p. 1.-Last Sunday will remain a historic day in the annals of the Greek Community of Chicago, for the great event which took place, the influence of which is important from the national viewpoint of wellenism in America.</p>
   <p>This event is the inauguration of the Greek School, Solon. A simple two store edifice, with a large hall on the first floor, capable of taking in 3,000 persons. This hall is surrounded by eight rooms.</p>
   <p>The entire building cost $150,000. Various communities of Chicago were represented there and many societies. Professionals, merchants, business men of different enterprises, mothers with their children, young and old, all enthusiastic, were there.</p>
   <p>When final introduction and short speech, by the rector of the communal church, the Rev. Kesses, finished, Mr. Pantelis legal adviser of the community introduced the speaker of the day, Dr. S. Loumos, who was greeted by prolonged applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0351.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Immediately following him, the floor was given to the manager of the Greek Daily, Mr. Kotakis, who dealt with the historic background of the community on the North Side, congratulated the Executive Council for the erection of the beautiful building and emphasized the necessity of a speedy unification of Greeks in America, ecelesiastically so that communities might be enabled to respond to their economic needs.</p>
   <p>"This structure," Mr. Kotakis said, "was erected at a great sacrifice and the community was compelled to conclude a loan of $150,000.00 for a purpose which all the Greeks of Chicago must help to realize and the ones present should set the example for the rest.</p>
   <p>The Ladies Society, Solon, was the first to respond, contributing $500.00 and then the communities of Holy Trinity, Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and St. George, followed. The Mothers' Society of the school, Socrates, also made a donation which was greeted by great enthusiasm and clamorous applauses.</p>
   <p>The members of the Executive Council of Annunciation offered $100.00 and many others did the same, some with $100.00 checks. Suddenly a $1,000.00 <pb facs="5422062_1_0352.jpg" n="3"/>check appeared from Mr. George <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to be hailed with unbounded enthusiasm. Before the applause subsided, another $1,000.00 check was announced from one of the older members of our community, the well known Mr. Panteleon Rousetes, who is one of the original founders of Annunciation. There was prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Liberal sums also were donated by Messrs. John Alexopoulos of Pepas Alex, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. Kannelis, Christoper <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and the pastor the Rev. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>esses and many others. The total amount collected was around <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>,000.00.</p>
