   <p>Now that he realizes that the people of Europe have neither listened to him nor feared him, Mr. Benito Mussolini, creator of thunder-and-lightning threats and promises, has made a new move which is typical of him.</p>
   <p>In the meeting of the Fascist party last Sunday, Mussolini outlined his sixty-year plan for the exterior program of Italy. If we have criticized the sardonic policies of Mr. B. from these columns we have done so because we sincerely and firmly believe that the gentleman is not "all there". Now we feel that our contention is fully proved by none other than himself. He has just indicated the course of action Italy will follow in her relations with other countries for the next sixty years.</p>
   <p>Only an idiot or a mentally unbalanced person would ever make such a speech at a time when events are changing with lightning-like rapidity. No one can predict what will happen in five years, certainly not in sixty. Or has our <pb facs="5422062_1_1498.jpg" n="2"/>friend eaten so much macaroni he thinks he is God? Mussolini may be "Il Duce" to some; but to the majority of sane human beings he is merely a ridiculous creature and a fairly successful bluff.</p>
