   <p>The lame eagle of Europe is again showing his talons--this time against Abyssinia. He has two reasons for making such a move at the present time, both of which are supposed to have their roots in an effort to produce a certain psychological effect upon the national Italian mind. In the first place, Italian pride has suffered in the skirmishes between the Italian patrols and the Abyssinian soldiers. Therefore, an army must be sent to punish insubordination.....The second, and most important, reason for this martial move is to withdraw the people's minds from contemplation of their sufferings due to the tyranny of Mussolini's blackshirts.</p>
   <p>This charlatan [Mussolini] has other quacks ably assisting him in Europe, who, just as he, spend all their time fighting battles with windmills [Don Quixote] or their own shadows. The time is not far off when the peoples of Europe will perceive the trickery of their buffoon "generals" and dispense with their services.</p>

   <p>A minor cause of the Duce's action is the old score made by Abyssinia against Italy in 1896..</p>
   <p>Greece has recently had bitter experiences with the insane actions of the Duce,...These experiences include his feudal manner of governing the Dodecanese Islands. He has striven to cut the church of these Islands apart from the Patriarchy, and has forbidden the use of the Greek language in the schools.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that religious persecution is being carried on at the suggestion of the Vatican. Let us, as honest Greek people, examine the life of this man [Mussolini].</p>
   <p>He was born on July 29, 1883, in a small Italian village of poor parents. His father was an ironworker who could neither read nor write. His mother <pb facs="5422062_1_0912.jpg" n="3"/>was a teacher. His grammar-school days were passed in continual fights with fellow students whom he tried to bully.....Later he tried to follow his father's trade but received only severe blows because of his egotistical attitude and know-it-all-ness.</p>
   <p>One must understand the early background of this man to realize what has made him cruel beyond human belief. He does not know the meaning of kindness or compassion because no one has been kind to him. The struggle for existence was very difficult, and his mother continually worried about his future. At the parochial college he attended his teachers repeatedly told him that his soul was blacker than the Devil's. More than once the good Fathers threw him out, only to take him back for his mother's sake. Finally, he received a teacher's diploma, but he did not follow his profession long. He traveled in Switzerland, France, Germany and Austria. While in Switzerland he translated the works of Karl Marx into Italian. Until the Fascist movement, Mussolini was an active Socialist, and published a newspaper called Class Struggle.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0913.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Duce is no longer a Secialist; all his actions are contrary to that ideology. Neither is he opposed to religion, as is evidenced by his overtures to the Pontiff in the form of a magnificent ecclesiastical symphony [sic]. Naturally, he has changed his uniform to match his present beliefs; so he is the typical nationalist in appearance. He has striven to centralize all Power in his own hands, while sober rulers make every effort to find responsible leaders with whom to divide power and its ensuing responsibilities. Any person who seems to be acquiring public favor he quickly exiles or tactfully sends to some forsaken outpost for a long period of service. There is positive opinion among the Greeks of Europe and America--we can only speak for our own race--that Hussolini is suffering from a mental disorder plus a megalomaniacal complex.</p>
