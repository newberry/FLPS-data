   <p>Sometime ago we were confronted with the problem: What was to become of the new generation? True, they were to become sterling American citizens but would they forget the language, history and traditions of their parents?</p>
   <p>The boys and girls born in this country of Hellenic parents were being reared in the grandest and most impressive civilization of the day. The great educational advantages and the opportunities for self-advancement offered by this country were not to be equalled. The boy would make his comparisons in his own elementary way. He would compare the grandeur of his public school with the small Hellenic community school which his parents required him to attend. The communities, of course, were to be complimented most highly for their efforts to teach the Greek language and history to the rising generation but the immature mind of the youngster could not grasp the reason for the huge difference. He would then hear the words "foreigner" and "American", the former at times used with disdain.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1011.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Often he would behold various factions of his race quarreling and wrangling, perhaps about community problems or long distance political controversies. These conditions and comparisons would cause the young man to conclude that his parent's race was not of the same fibre as that of his school or playmate. He, too, would perhaps look upon them as "foreigners."</p>
   <p>He would believe that perchance fortune had counted him among a less influential race and that it would be to his advantage to conceal these facts as much as he could or entirely, if possible. It was not difficult to conceive why the young man should think in this way. In the first place, the youth could not grasp the mighty significance of his great Hellenic heritage in order to think otherwise. But more important, nothing was being done constructively from the start by his own people to offset this state of affairs. In other words, the inexorable laws of social gravitation were taking their natural course.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1012.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Then came the Order of Ahepa with a program such as no other organization had the courage to undertake before. It started to build from the foundation. Instead of issuing proclamations and decrees concerning the glorious and undying Hellenic language and history, for to be sure, no one could add to the just verdict of history which had assigned an eternal place to all things Hellenic, it began to work on present problems confronting the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>Ahepa's program breathed the essence of practicality. The organization was placed "in the swing" of American life. It made this decree: "Americans of Hellenic origin, you are living in the world's greatest country, in the midst of unheard of opportunities. Forget your quarrels. Imbue yourselves with the spirit of the country which you have made your home. Become a citizen and make yourself a loyal and integral part of these institutions which are offered to you for the asking. In this way you shall enhance the prestige of your race and inculcate the pride of Hellenic origin upon the rising generation."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1013.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Ahepa preached this gospel. It met with the same misunderstanding and attack as is encountered by every movement which is new, regardless of merit. But the pioneers went on with their work, ever preaching and practicing this same gospel. The rising generation suddenly began to see a different picture. They heard their local Congressman, their Senator and often their Governor speak at the gatherings of the Ahepa and heard them laud the achievements of Americans of Hellenic origin. They saw their Mayors and other leading citizens of their communities attending the various functions of the organization and heard from their lips an estimate of the value of their own Hellenic heritage. They read the newspaper comments and editorials praising the achievements of the fraternity and signaling out as exemplary the conduct and the civic virtues of the race of their fathers. They noticed that the local chapter in their city was participating and competing in diverse civic functions and they were thrilled when time and again the first awards would go to the Ahepa. Then some of these younger men came into the organization. They came into an environment distinctly their own. They saw for the first time an organization of their own people conducted with a method and a degree of practicality hardly surpassed by any organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1014.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>They were proud. In this organization they could speak, if they wished, the language which they knew and understood. Through this organization they could give real expression to their feelings and aspirations. Their enthusiasm became unbounded. It even spread to the imagination of the boys. The Sons of Pericles was organized and later on was adopted as the official Junior Order of the Ahepa. In this Junior Order the boys in their teens began to emulate the work and preach the same gospel as their elder brothers. These boys were being trained to become the splendid American citizens of tomorrow, but for the first time value of their great Hellenic heritage began to dawn upon them. Voluntarily they learned the language, the history and something of the traditions of their fathers. In fact, many of these boys, previously in darkness of all things Hellenic, became proficient in the language and good scholars in the history and traditions of Hellas. Of their own accord "they set out to marshall into active service for America the finest attributes of true Hellenism." These boys were becoming better Americans because they were preparing to contribute something to this great land of their father's adoption. A newly mentality was in the making.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1015.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>What is to become of the future generation? That used to be a very serious problem. It is no longer a problem. Ahepa has solved it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the Hellenization of these boys was brought about by the Ahepa, an American organization, and because it is an American organization.</p>
   <p>Great results are not to be accomplished over night. To be sure they cannot be brought about by decree or proclamation nor by a stroke of the pen, the clang of a gavel or the sheathing of a sword. They are brought about by vision, by education, any by the constant process of building from the foundation. These happy results which we witness today are the results of vision and a policy which for seven years has been religiously adhered to--a policy which signalizes the Order of Ahepa as a great exemplary American organization, uplifting Hellenic prestige by preaching undivided allegiance to the United States, respect for its laws, and undiminishing loyalty to all its institutions.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1016.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>As retiring Supreme President, it is my parting advice and most earnest solicitation, that these policies be forever continued with undying zeal and with ever increasing vigor. To attempt to change these policies of the Order is to attempt to change the United States of America and to alter the determined course of evolution. The foundations have been laid and we are now ready for the real work that is to come. We must forge ahead with the same unswerving clarity of vision and the same tendacious adherence to these principles and policies which have made Ahepa what it is today. Only in this way will the noble mission of Ahepa be fulfilled.</p>
