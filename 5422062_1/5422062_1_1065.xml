   <p>When we immigrate to this most hospitable land, which we, as well as all foreign groups deeply appreciate, we should realize that in order to become responsible citizens and successful commercially, we must cast off some of the characteristics of our European heritage. Europeans generally have many offensive ideas and habits which should be discarded, if they want to become new men. Then we would be able to acquire a new status in accordance with the expectations and requirements of our modern civilization. We could thus adjust ourselves to the customs and "way of life" of this country; we might accomplish this in the commercial field by adjusting ourselves to various conditions. This principle of adjustment is neither new nor [is it] unreasonable; it is very old and quite reasonable. The Romans expected everyone coming to Rome to do as the Romans; when one is host to an individual either at home or abroad, one expects the guest to comply with one's habits and customs and to be satisfied. [Such is certainly the case] if the visitors have not been invited, but like the immigrants have arrived in this land by their own will.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>No doubt things would have been much different had we remained in our fatherland. In this land we enjoy great blessings and prosperity. In addition, we have not only saved and improved our lives according to our abilities, but we have saved and benefited our people in the fatherland by what we have personally and materially contributed.</p>
   <p>Since this is true, generally speaking, we should realize that we should not only be grateful, but that our love for our new country should equal if not exceed our love for the fatherland. This reminds us of the old saying, "Love your teachers more than your parents," because if the latter gave you life, the former made possible your well-being.</p>
   <p>Bearing these thoughts in mind, we should acknowledge the propriety of making every sacrifice and exerting all our efforts to effect a change in our attitude toward life, and thus become socially and economically worthy of the expectations and occasional needs of the native Americans. In other words, we should become "gentlemen," for only then can we assert ourselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1067.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>No one denies that we are in many ways superior to the other immigrant groups of America. On the other hand however, no one can conceal or hide the fact that we are inferior to them in many other respects. But if other nationalities, such as the Italian or Jewish, have some defects, they do not make as painful an impression as we do on the minds of the American people because, on the one hand, they are more numerous than we, while on the other hand, they are so admirably organized and united that they possess an invincible defense against any overt action. The exact opposite is true with us; we have declared ourselves to be not only the inveterate enemies of unity and co-operation, but even in our personal relationships, we lead a life of incessant enmity, hatred, and strife.</p>
   <p>We could be in a much better position, and the results would be very different indeed, if we would develop an attitude of mutual consideration and appreciation. It is generally conceded that in our native qualities and potentialities we are superior to many other nationalities, who in other respects are considered superior to us. But then have they not received enlightenment from Greek civilization?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1068.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We should be sincere and fair in our relationships; we should regard truthfulness as a precious possession and shun dishonesty. We commit a crime and destroy ourselves when, even in a light vein, we accept a lie as any part of truth. Lying is the first step towards fraud; the defrauder is despised in any society. "The liar and thief live only the first year," said our fathers, and the Great Lincoln declared that you can fool all the people some of the time, some of the people all the time, but not all the people all the time. We are here participating in business and social activity. The indispensable basis of our business and banking relations is good faith on which depends all of our credit. If this does not exist, then any independent economic action on our part toward those individuals whose business we seek is impossible. Many of us have understood and understand the situation and for that reason only those of us were successful who fully comprehended and consistently applied this important principle of good faith.</p>
   <p>We see that many of our fellow citizens who are endowed with many more natural gifts than others, endure great suffering, whereas others, who <pb facs="5422062_1_1069.jpg" n="5"/>have not exhibited the commonly called "cultural wisdom" have made remarkable progress. There is no other explanation for this than their adjustment to their environment, and their adoption of its modes of behavior. That is why we who are engaged in business and do business with banks, should be honest. By all means, we should avoid fraud by the issuance of checks when we do not have money in the bank. Remember that every time we do such a thing, our name is put on business "Black List," an action which destroys our credit.</p>
   <p>When signing accident or sickness insurance policies, avoid making false statements, because the standing and reputation of us all will be seriously jeopardized. Many complaints have been voiced which have caused measures to be taken.</p>
   <p>It is dishonorable and shameful to default on any payment of bank loans which one should not have made, because the consequences will be very sad.</p>
   <p>The honorable Greek element of Chicago, which has proved itself to be heroic <pb facs="5422062_1_1070.jpg" n="6"/>and dignified on many occasions, will not tolerate any disgrace brought by a few dishonest characters.</p>
   <p>Today we are in a position to know that ninety per cent of the Greeks have gained for themselves unshakeable confidence because of their industry and honesty. They will not permit a few dishonest individuals to blemish the Greek name. The Greek people will destroy them and repudiate them. We shall spare no one when we are protecting the Greek name, prestige, and interests. We shall be forced to expose what is taking place in every detail. Our duty and our deep regard for the laws take precedence over every other sentiment. For us and for every honorable man, the honest farmer is preferable to the rich man who has not acquired his money honestly, but by dishonest methods.</p>
