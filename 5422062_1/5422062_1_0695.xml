<title level="a">A MODERN RACKET</title><title level="a" type="sub">by G. Halepas</title></bibl>

   <p>Since women have become the equals of men in the professions, in politics, and in the expression of ideas--to say nothing of the fact that they have usurped man's place in the business world--it has at last become necessary to find some way to defend the so-called strong sex from the weaker sex.</p>
   <p>Hitherto, as you all surely know, a woman has had the right to drag a man into court on a breach-of-promise charge. This has become a good racket in the hands of a large number of the weaker sex. But, at last, justice has been established. Judge Joseph B. David has decreed that, since women seek equality with men, they--the women-- can be sued by men for the same reason.</p>
   <p>Of course, this legal decision gives the racket a wider sphere. Thus far, <pb facs="5422062_1_0696.jpg" n="2"/>it has been used by the female sex; but now disappointed males can also seek heart-balm in American courts. Certain types of male parasites that annoy every community will find this decision very helpful in their search for easy, unearned money....</p>
   <p>Naturally, the men will not have the advantages that women possess-that is, tears, fainting spells, and silk-stockinged knees. But that should not make much difference. If the men do not know all the tricks of the trade, they can soon learn them.....Women are not the only ones who know how to act a part. The female sex has produced Sarah Bernhardt and Duse, but the males have given Arlissand Krause to the world.</p>
   <p>This new racket gives promise of providing the world with a little amusement--which will certainly be appreciated in these hard times. Frequently we shall meet one of our dear pals walking along with downcast head and red-rimmed eyes. We shall say to him:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0697.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Hey, Kosta, what's the matter? Are you sick? What makes you so despondent?"</p>
   <p>And our friend will answer in mournful, quavering tones: "I am suffering, my friend--suffering like a dog. All my life, I have sought to find the ideal woman that I might make her my wife. Finally I did find her.....I fell madly in love with her, and she promised to become my wife. And now, she has cruelly disavowed her pledge, and my heart is broken. I am like a dead man and can hardly pull myself along. When I dragged her into court to answer for her thoughtlessness the judge ordered her to pay a mere twenty-five dollars to mend my broken heart."</p>
   <p>We shall then press his hand with feeling to show how deeply his tragedy has moved us; and as soon as he is out of sight we shall collapse from suppressed laughter. This love racketeer has a heart like an artichoke, and hides a different love under each of its petals.</p>
   <p>And after all, why shouldn't he? Don't the women do the same thing? Why <pb facs="5422062_1_0698.jpg" n="4"/>should this nice racket be confined to women? However, wouldn't it be better for society if this racket could not be practiced by either sex? It should be required by law that all those who desire to enter the marriage relation should submit to a complete physical and mental examination before receiving a marriage license. As a result, only healthy, normal and productive individuals could marry. Such a law would be more beneficial to society than the right to sue for breach of promise.</p>
