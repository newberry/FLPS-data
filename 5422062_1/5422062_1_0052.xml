   <p>The Ahepa School has roomy and clean quarters of the typical kind to be found in any good downtown school. Brother Papas, the generalissimo of this venture, may be found behind a desk ready and willing to discuss any feature of the plan to the satisfaction and complete comprehension of the inquirer. Classes have already met and progress made by the industrious and thoughtful attendants. A visit to the Ahepa School will pleasantly amaze the most ardent enthusiast and surpisingly convince the ultra-sceptical conservative. Every Ahepan is urged to pay a fraternal visit to the Ahepa School and meet the brother in charge.</p>
   <p>The players for the Ahepa band are increasing and it is urged that those who desire to enter into the Honor Roll sign the pledge and be "among those present" when the boys go marching in uniform displaying the inscription "Ahepa" every-where. Remember that fifty instruments are all that are needed and that the brothers are given preference before patrons are sought for outside of the Brotherhood.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0053.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That, Brother, is the progress that has been made in the attempted part of the program and no one but a destructive critic will deny that the above spells accomplishment. The Order thanks all the Brothers who, either directly or indirectly, made possible progress.</p>
   <p>The Apeha School</p>
   <p>Every Ahepan should think seriously what direct benefit awaits him if he will but denote a few hours a week to the learning of Greek. Do not feel that you will be among children and consequently uncomfortable. Our children have their secterian (church) schools and have no present need for the Ahepa School. But many of us need it badly. So let us avail ourselves of the opportunity and enroll.</p>
   <p>Remember the saying that a knowledge of Greek is necessary to the comprehensive understanding of any western language, being the Mother of them all.</p>
