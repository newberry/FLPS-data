<title level="a">FIFTY GREEK EMPLOYEES OF LA SALLE HOTEL FIRED BY <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>Recently, the La Salle Hotel of Chicago unexpectedly fired all the Greek employees on its staff. These employees were waiters, bus boys and servants, and they could get no explanation for their sudden discharge.</p>
   <p>This unjustified action by the hotel management has aroused the interest of the entire Greek community of Chicago, which is seeking an explanation for the attitude of the management. Naturally, there must be some reason for such drastic action.</p>
   <p>The discharged employees give three different explanations: first, the hotel management claims that a Greek employee was caught stealing hotel property; second, a Greek employee was suing the hotel for $18,000, because he had been poisoned (sic) while at work; third, the management of the hotel is pro-German, and the employees were discharged because of the hatred of the Germans for the Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1148.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We do not feel that any of these reasons justify or explain the actions of the hotel management. If a Greek was caught stealing, they would have been justified in discharging him without notice; but that would be no excuse for firing the other forty-nine innocent individuals. Such an action takes the form of racial prejudice and is not to be condoned, especially in a land that is supposed to without any religious or racial distinctions.</p>
   <p>If the hotel fired these people because of the third reason, it has made a grave mistake. If the management of this pro-German hotel decides to get rid of employees whose nationality is not friendly to the Kaiser, then the hotel must also expect to lose their best customers, since they are anti-German in most instances.</p>
   <p>Such an attitude is not truly American; it is not in accordance with the principles of this country. This attitude can be of no benefit to the hotel management, and of still less benefit to the Kaiser.</p>
