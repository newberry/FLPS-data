   <p>Due to the great antagonism towards prohibition, I would like to express my opinion upon this subject both as an individual and as a medical man.</p>
   <p>Primarily, I believe this law to be anti-democratic in that it curtails individual freedom and will give rise to the illegal control of liquor by profiteers.</p>
   <p>From a scientific viewpoint, wine in most cases is beneficial to health. To forbid wine beneficial to health. To forbid wine because it causes drunkenness is a serious mistake, since any beverage--even coffee--taken in excess will produce similar results.</p>
   <p>Drunkenness is a social evil-which cannot be cured by prohibition. The individual himself is to blame, and if he is deprived of liquor, he will exert every effort to find a substitute. The individual must be taught to keep in the middle of the road in anything he does.</p>
   <p>It is not right that the majority should be deprived of privileges of which it does not abuse in order that a minority be punished.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0630.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The ancient Greeks, among all their other contributions to the world's culture, taught the art of making wine and how to use it. It is not reasonable that this knowledge should now be hidden and outlawed.</p>
   <p>Let us solve the serious problems of the world today, instead of wasting valuable time doing something which will cause resentment and discontent.</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Kalionzis.</p>
