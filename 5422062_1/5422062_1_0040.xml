   <p>One of the greatest thrills that can come to the life of a parent results from seeing his son or daughter reach a certain goal in life, and from having the secret satisfaction of knowing that he has helped in the realization of his child's dreams. It is much more thrilling, however, to contemplate a youth who has fought alone to reach his goal. Such a person is George Anagnos.</p>
   <p>This outstanding and well-loved young man has just received his Bachelor of Science Degree in mathematics and philosophy from the University of Chicago. Mr. Anagnos was a student of the late Professor George H. Mead, famous professor of philosophy. The lecture notes kept by Mr. Anagnos were so complete and so thoughtfully Made that Mr. C. Morris used them when compiling the philosophy of Professor Mead. The titles of these volumes are Mind, Self, and Society; The Philosophy of the Act; and The Movement of Thought in the Nineteenth Century.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0041.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The work of Mr. Anagnos is gracefully acknowledged in the prefaces of these books.</p>
   <p>We know that he will go on to higher levels of learning and will bring honor to the Greek name. The Greek community of Chicago is very proud of one of its finest sons.</p>
