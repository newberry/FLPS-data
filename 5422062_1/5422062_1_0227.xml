   <p>With approximately one thousand people in attendance, the Greek-American School Koraes' graduation exercises were held in the Church Hall at 1:30 P. M., Monday, June 18.</p>
   <p>An interesting program, composed of songs, drama, and recitations, revealed to the attending crowd the ability of the students to use both the English language and the Greek to a marked perfection.</p>
   <p>Rev. Mark E. Petrakis spoke regarding the economic status of the school, revealing that it was operating on a loss due to the failure of a great number of parents to pay the necessary tuition. An address by Mr. Stylianos J. Reckas, president of St. Constantine Church, followed,in which he predicted a greater "Koreas," but only with the cooperation of every parishioner.</p>
   <p>Rev. Constantine Glynos, principal of the school, assisted Rev. Mark Petrakis in presenting diplomas to the Day School students.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0228.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The exercises were concluded with a farewell speech by the Rev. Constantine Glynos, at which occasion he presented each graduate with a Bible.</p>
