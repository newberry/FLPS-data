   <p>About two months ago, a certain Kerkulas, a bachelor more than forty years old, was married after following the procedure usual among Greeks of employing matchmakers and furnishing references as to his good character.</p>
   <p>After two weeks of married life, Herkulas declared that he could not continue to live with a wife whom he did not love and never had loved.</p>
   <p>Parenst of girls ought to be more considerate of their daughters. Instead of marrying them in haste they ought to maintain the engagement tradition so that the couple might get acquainted and study each other's characters to find out whether they are naturally fitted to live together.</p>
   <p>Taking this time-honored precaution would prevent much mistakes as that of Mrs. Kerkulas, who after a week of engagement and two weeks of married life <pb facs="5422062_1_0694.jpg" n="2"/>had to go to court for a divorce! This might have been avoided by a little less haste and a less ready acceptance of statements made by the matchmakers about the bridegroom.</p>
