   <p>The honorable and great benefactress, Miss Jane Addams, who was always distinguished for her genuine philhellenic sentiments and noble ideals of Greece, as well as by her constant and continual efforts to support the Greeks on any occasion, made a talk before a large and select audience last Monday in which she dealt extensively with the problems and needs of the Greek people of Chicago. She did not fail to praise the Greek immigrant very highly for his many virtues and rare moral and intellectual qualities.</p>
   <p>She summarized as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Greek population of the city of Chicago is estimated at more than twelve thousand; most of them are sturdy, fine-looking young men. The Greeks trace their origin to those heroes and philosphers of ancient and classical Greece <pb facs="5422062_1_1208.jpg" n="2"/>who, by their deeds, valor, and unparalleled accomplishments have adorned the history of the world with undying evidence of the greatness of the men of Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Macedonia.</p>
   <p>"Many times, the Greeks have been misunderstood and unjustly treated by the American people, but the latter are not justified in maintaining such an unworthy attitude toward the sons of Hellas. It is because the American public has been prejudiced against them or because it has failed to judge the Greek immigrants impartially.</p>
   <p>"Many wrongs have been done the Greeks,sometimes deliberately and sometimes because of the hatred and contempt with which many of us look upon the immigrant.</p>
   <p>"We should attempt to discard such sentiments and ideas because they are a disgrace to the American people and unworthy of a civilized society."</p>
