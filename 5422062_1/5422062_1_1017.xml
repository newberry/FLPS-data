   <p>Nothing under the sun is new. That glorious and splendid country, Greece, is the emanating source of everything good under the sun.</p>
   <p>Today's proclivity to nudity is not without origin and without cause.</p>
   <p>Immediately following the world war, pleasure and joy were necessary to counteract the struggle and sorrow of that war. Pleasure and joy are natural desires. Sentimentality and artificiality can not forever overshadow the reality of nature. Nudity is a natural thing. My body shivers when I speak this truth. You and I know the reality of this thing nevertheless social rules and custom have forced us to think and act otherwise, and permit superficial sentimentality and artificiality to becloud our mind. The present trend to nudity is not immoral, if we permit ourselves to think rightly.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1018.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is, therefore, natural and artistic. Social rules of our so called civilization may, for the time being, repress the reality, but eventually the natural will make us understand it and reckon with it.</p>
   <p>In ancient Greece, after the Peloponnesian War, nudity in full sway appeared, not as a national calamity, as some had classified it, but as a masterpiece of nature and art. In that era and environment the great Praxiteles appeared. As a god sent immortalized sculptor with his chisel he undraped the bodies of the gods and goddsses of love, insobriety and pleasure and caused them to be erected for worship in the temples at the altars in the groves and in the promenades.</p>
   <p>For the first time the world saw, in nature and art, Aphrodite emerging from the sea. At the shores of Eleusis the adepts saw her coming up from the waves of the sea unadorned.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1019.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From the same sea years later, Phryne, the most beautiful, emerged from the waters, outshining the sun, to show the Panhellenes her divine beauty of form.</p>
   <p>At that period two artists of great Praxiteles of the chisel, and Apleis of the brush and color, immortalized her indescribable beauty of form. One must be either archeologist or historian of the art to fully know the greatness of those two masterpieces. I can say with assurance that thousands of artists for centuries and in every country have since gotten their inspiration from these two and made their art the standard of perfection,</p>
   <p>This is the triumph of the nude in arts. At the fall of Constantinople, Greeks of learning, art, wisdom and music brought to the western world the Greek letters and art. Then the western people woke up from a long and deep slumber, rubbed their eyes and frantically observed the Greek masterpieces. Although they were Christians nevertheless they bowed before the nude idols of the ancients.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1020.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Palaces, villas, mansions and even churches of the Western World were beautified with nude ancient gods, goddesses, Aphrodites, Nymphs, Satyres etc. To be more specific, the Vatican procured many of those masterpieces in the nude.</p>
   <p>Nudity is not vile nor immoral. It is the divine creation. Our misconception and tendency to libidiousness constitute the so-called indecent aspect.</p>
   <p>Ancient Greece and her philosophers who struggled and fought through philosophy to uplift morality would not have tolerated nudity if it had been to them indecent, immoral and licencious. They said, when the mind is liberated from illusions then we can see and appreciate God's creation.</p>
   <p>Nudity therefore is not what the unstrained mind thinks.</p>
