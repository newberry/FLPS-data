   <p>A MAN who believes in America, upholds its principles, supports and fights, when necessary, for the lofty ideals of Democracy and freedom. Americanism is his motto and Hellenism is his keynote.</p>
   <p>HE STANDS for Hellenism exemplified - the synonym of Americanism; propagates to his utmost the ideals of the great Hellas, the mother of civilization.</p>
   <p>ENFORCES self-respect, through good conduct, and strives at all times to elevate to its rightful plane the name of a noble and illustrious race. The Hellenic Race! Education, brotherly love and self-sacrifice, he considers as part of his obligation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0935.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>PROMOTES good fellowship with all his might and encourages cooperation and unity among his fellowmen. Advocates respect for law and order and exercises his duties as a citizen. He is progressive!</p>
   <p>ATTAINS success through honest effort, love for his neighbor and the practice of the Golden Rule. Aids his fellowmen in distress and asks nothing in return.</p>
   <p>NEVER despairs, but places his faith and trust in the hands of his Master, the great Teacher of fraternalism. He is the good Ahepan, and the world has been sweetened and made cleaner and nobler by his presence among us.</p>
   <p>George A. Poulson,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
