   <p>We confess that this week it was our intention to discuss a subject of worldwide interest, and to put aside our topical social problems. Our interest was stimulated, however, by a notice which appeared in the Chicago papers three days ago. We read that, although the public schools of Chicago are not to open until September 18, the parochial schools--and by that is meant the Catholic private schools--opened last Tuesday.</p>
   <p>That, in itself, was not what startled us, but the fact that the number of children enrolled in the Catholic schools of Chicago is over two hundred thousand.</p>
   <p>This well-known fact gives us an opportunity to examine the condition of our own private Greek schools, and to make certain comparisons between them and <pb facs="5422062_1_0236.jpg" n="2"/>the Catholic schools. According to the city's statistics, there are more than one million two hundred thousand Catholics in Chicago. One-sixth of this number is enrolled in their private parochial schools. Immediately we asked ourselves: "How many Greek children of the sixty thousand Greeks in Chicago are enrolled in the Greek schools?" That is, if they can be called schools.</p>
   <p>Of course, we all must surely realize that not over one thousand Greek children attend the daily and evening Greek schools run by our churches. The reason for this pitiful number does not lie in the fact that Greek parents do not want their children to learn Greek. The answer is that we have not, as yet, established any institution that is worthy of being called a school.</p>
   <p>For many years we have endeavored to create a worth-while community, in order to unite and strengthen our nationality. This has already been accomplished by the five hundred thousand Poles and the three hundred thousand Irish of the <pb facs="5422062_1_0237.jpg" n="3"/>city. But, although our potentialities are proportionately greater than the other foreign groups, we have accomplished nothing that can compare with their achievements. We have no fine churches, no decent schools, and no cultural centers--absolutely nothing. Despite the fact that these are the matters which should be the objects of our interest, and which can only be accomplished when our community is strongly organized, we continue to scatter our power and waste our abilities on common and useless things.</p>
   <p>It is high time that this indifference be replaced by a new type of thinking. Methods must be altered to fit the needs of the community. Endeavors must be expended to educate Greek children in accordance with pedagogical methods. But, to achieve such a happy state and put this into practice we must first of all unite our everlastingly divided community. If this is not first accomplished, any thing we may try to do will be a complete failure.</p>
   <p>Since, as everyone can see, our problems cannot be solved or even lessened under the present system, does it make sense that there should be any opposition to changing the system and our methods?</p>
