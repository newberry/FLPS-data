   <p>One of the most outstanding and post active organizations of Greek woman in the City of Chicago is the Greek Women's University Club, which was founded February 1931 at the suggestion of the late Reverend Constantione Harvalis. The chief purpose of this organization is the promotion of education among Greek girls and Greek women.</p>
   <p>In fulfillment of this purpose the Club established a Scholarship Fund and during the past two years this fund had enabled the club to give financial assistance to four deserving Greek girls enrolled in Chicago high schools.</p>
   <p>This year, the Greek Women's University Club has established a scholarship at the University of Chicago, go, which is known as "the Greek Women's University Club Scholarship". Miss Evengeline Joures, a graduate of Austin High School has been awarded the scholarship for the academic year of 1955-1936 and is now enrolled as a freshman of the University.</p>
   <p>The scholarship is maintained by proceeds of benefit affairs which the <pb facs="5422062_1_0039.jpg" n="2"/>club sponsors. There affairs include annual scholarship fund dances, and musicales at which Greek talent is presented.</p>
