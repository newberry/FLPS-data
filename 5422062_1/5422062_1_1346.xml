<title level="a">THE NEW COMMANDMENTS</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>p. 4- Moses presented the world with the Ten Commandments which we all know.</p>
   <p>Christ came and supplemented them with two new commandments of different character from those of Moses. They are "Love your enemies" and "If any man smite you on one cheek, turn to him the other cheek also."</p>
   <p>Now comes another prophet, W. L. Hayes, with four new commandments which are altogether different from those of Moses and Christ. The difference, though, is due to the different descent of the three prophets.</p>
   <p>Moses was a Jewish revolutionist with nationalistic ideals, seeking the independence of Israel, preaching justice only for "the chosen people," and predicting the world-wide domination of Israel.</p>
   <p>Christ was a Jew also, but he had international ideals, teaching justice, love, and the unification of all the humble of the earth. He was the hope of the slaves and the poor of the world. He was the Lenin of His day.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1347.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hayes, however, is an American and an industrialist besides, superintendent of the American Steel and Wire Company.</p>
   <p>Here are the commandments that he offers to eternity:</p>
   <p>1. "It is not becoming for any worker to own an automobile. If any one of them owns one, he should not lose any time at all in selling it.</p>
   <p>2. "Having worked six days in the week, he must find something else to do on the seventh day rather than go to the theaters and movies, which are luxuries.</p>
   <p>(The Greeks need not be afraid of committing such a sin, for they already comply with this commandment by going to the coffee-houses instead of to the movies.)</p>
   <p>3- "Workers must be satisfied to reside in back streets for the sake of economy.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1348.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>4.-"Workers must be content to do without telephones in their houses."</p>
   <p>The explanation and purpose of these commandments which Mr. Hayes has addressed to the workers of his factory are: Twenty per cent cut in wages. Further details are not needed.</p>
