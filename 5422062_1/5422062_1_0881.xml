<title level="a">THE CELEBRATION OF THE GREEK EASTER - CHRISTOS ANESTI - Are We Real Christians?</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>During the Holy Week and on Easter Sunday the name of the Savior was on the lips of all the subjects of that Holy institution, the Greek Orthodox Church. Young and old, rich and poor, laborers and professional men and women, all spoke of Christ. And on Easter Sunday the three Greek churches in Chicago and every Greek home were reverberating with "Christos Anesti" (Christ Arose)</p>
   <p>Thousands of people, comprising the Greek community in Chicago, with shining, smiling, clean faces and immaculately attired went to the Temples of God to declare and affirm the defeat of nature and the glory of the Savior with "Christ Arose" and "Indeed the Lord has Arisen." What a glory to Judea, and what salvation to the world! The Heavens and the Earth in unison proclaim the victory of the Lord, whose blood was given for the purification of our souls.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0882.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Christendom, with its millions of Christians the world over, rejoices over the resurrection of Christ, and each year, in magnificence and glory, celebrates, in churches and in homes, the salvation of mankind.</p>
   <p>The celebration of the Greek Easter in Chicago this year was a brilliant event. The Savior's epitaph was carried around the streets accompanied by hymns of worshiping, hymns of praise and glory, and hymns of devotion and invocation. They, the Greeks, were telling the world that Christ arose. They, as well as other Christians, were telling the world that they are Christians, true followers of Christ.</p>
   <p>Are we really Christians? Can any one of us Christians, with the exception of a handful, raise his hand and say; "I am a real Christian?"</p>
   <p>When the world is in doubt it always looks to the Greeks either for good or for bad, and the writer of this article will do likewise and take the Greeks as the thesis of our inquiry. Are we real Christians? What a perplexing and delicate question!</p>
   <p>In order to avoid a storm of protests from non-Greek Christians we declare <pb facs="5422062_1_0883.jpg" n="3"/>that this article is written for Greeks and Greeks only. And as it may be possible that brother-Greeks in other parts of this country or the world declare a Peloponnesian war against us, the inquiry is directed and effects the Greeks of Chicago alone. If our assertion that we are brothers in Christ was true,then killings, hatred, untruthfulness, litigations and all that which falls in the category of vice and evil would not have been with us.</p>
   <p>The soul of the man which needs purification of all the evils and vices and through which we become brothers in Christ remains unclean; only our clothes, faces, and bodies we clean when we go to churches for worship. The connecting link of brotherhood in Christ, the soul of man, is neglected, and consequently throttled by the rapidly grown-thorns of vices and evil.</p>
   <p>Can any one become a real Christian by only accepting Christianity, by only attending churches, and by holding the title as Christian without purification of the soul? Indeed not!</p>
   <p>Are we Christians then in reality or in name only?</p>
   <p>The answer belongs to each and every one of us Christians, who with our magnificent Churches of Christ, our immaculate clothes, and smiling faces of hypocrisy <pb facs="5422062_1_0884.jpg" n="4"/>make a mockery of religion and who for the sake of sociability and by imitation, year after year celebrate the resurrection of Christ.</p>
   <p>Real Christianity depends not upon beautiful and expensive institutions of worship, not upon beautiful clothes and ornaments, but upon the purity of the soul.</p>
   <p>As this article was written for Chicago Greeks alone the millions of Christians the world over are exempted from this unpleasant question.</p>
   <p>Let us begin to purify our souls day after day and then we shall see the magnificence, the glory, and the real resurrection of Christ.</p>
