<title level="a">THE EXERCISES OF THE SOCRATES GREEK SCHOOL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The exercises of the Socrates Greek School were conducted last Sunday, and a magnificent program was presented.</p>
   <p>It began with a prayer offered by the pupils of the fourth grade. Thereafter an eloquent address was delivered by the principal of the school, Mr. Drossos. He showed what mistakes have been made in the past and told of the needs of the school, recommending a plan for its improvement and demonstrating the nationalistic significance of its mission.</p>
   <p>A program of recitations, singing, and short dialogues was then presented by the pupils, under the direction of Mr. Lambrinides and Mr. Karandreas.</p>
   <p>After an intermission of five minutes the exercises were resumed, and Mr. Angelos Tsiolis, the young and talented president of the executive committee of the Socrates School, took the platform. He pronounced an admirable <pb facs="5422062_1_0393.jpg" n="2"/>eulogy on the late Archimandrite Leonta Pigea, the first president of the school, whom Mr. Isiolis succeeded, and he also described with great eloquence the usefulness of the school, its material needs, and the dangers which threaten it, reminding our countrymen of their obligation to support the school, since our faith and our church depend upon it.</p>
   <p>He was applauded by all, for with admirable simplicity and modesty he made no attempt to display the oratorical talent which he possesses, delivering his address from memory. His remarks were full of sound thinking.</p>
   <p>The exercises of the sixth grade came next, directed by Mr. P. Papardes, a popular and highly respected teacher, and by the other teachers, Misses Nestorides, Stourza, Kaloida, Traulos, and Pratt.</p>
   <p>Prizes were then distributed among the pupils, hymns were sung, flowers were dispensed, and the holiday was concluded by a patriotic and inspiring speech delivered by the active and energetic president of the West Side Greek Community <pb facs="5422062_1_0394.jpg" n="3"/>of Chicago, Mr. Nickolaos Kokkines, who commented on our indifference and our neglect of our most important national interests.</p>
   <p>We all agree with the recommendations made and the advice given on the subject of the support of the Socrates Greek School, which is one of our major enterprises.</p>
