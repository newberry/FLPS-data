   <p>P.1--A committee of ten representing the American and other non-Greek restaurant-keepers of Chicago came to the office of the Star last Wednesday and complained against the practice of the Greeks, who hang electric signs outside their restaurants.</p>
   <p>They maintained that the Greeks incur this additional overhead expense in order to advertise their places and draw more customers, and they desire that the Greeks may discontinue this unnecessary expenditure because they do not wish to slave for the Electric Company as the Greeks do. They further suggested that the Greeks appoint a committee and have a discussion with them regarding the disadvantage of the electric sign.</p>
   <p>Their request from the point of harmony, cooperation, and trade understanding is not without foundation; nevertheless, from a progressive business point of view, they are wrong. For progress, in business as well as in everything else, depends upon amelioration and expansion of conditions, habits, customs, and ideas. The Greek, because of his innate progressiveness, <pb facs="5422062_1_1334.jpg" n="2"/>noticed the advantage and practicability of the newly developed electric sign and accepted the innovation in spite of the additional expense for electricity. Indeed, it is a credit to him, and in years to come those who now object to the electric sign will realize its importance and acknowledge the foresight of the Greek mind.</p>
   <p>To speak impartially and for the improvement of the restaurant trade and the beautification and illumination of restaurants, the electric sign is to a place of business what starch is to a white collar, or a neck-tie to a shirt.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, in order to disabuse the minds of those biased persons who always find something of which to accuse Greeks, and to avoid race-hatred, it will be wise for the Greek restauranteurs to appoint a committee as requested and discuss the merits and demerits, the advantages and disadvantages of the aforesaid signs, and I am certain that after the discussion the non-Greek restauranteurs will see the benefit of the electric sign and fall in line to follow the progressive Greek. If they do not do it now, most assuredly they will do it later.</p>
