   <p>Prometheus, the legendary figure who was condemned by Jupiter to be chained on the rocky peak of Mount Caucasus, gave humanity many blessings including the divine art of making fire, but he also brought upon humanity many evils, chief among which was jealousy. Jealousy is a most destructive force of the soul; the jealous man cannot understand how much he injures humanity, when because of this terrible passion he tries to destroy the good that others accomplish. A noble heart, a patriotic heart, which is filled with love for friend and foe alike, strives and toils to contribute to his country and his neighbors the best that he is capable of. In this way all the members of a group or nationality are welded together--thus they partake of the good that must result from a great common effort. The envious and jealous have only one end in view and that is to destroy something <pb facs="5422062_1_1278.jpg" n="2"/>good, some good cause or idea. But what will it profit him if some good undertaking is destroyed? Nothing, no doubt. Some mean individuals think that they should injure some particular cause because it was not thought of or supported by them.</p>
   <p>All communities, all nationality groups, all nations have such human and irrational beings in their midst, both among the intellectuals and the great masses. This great vice, however, is and has been the cause of great destruction to the Greek nation. For example, there appear from time to time men of unimpeachable character and of the highest patriotism who have been most useful to society and the state. Very often these men are in a position to think and plan so that some sort of splendid work could be done, the result of which would be very beneficial to the community and even to humanity. In most cases these people have sacrificed their property, their physical and mental energies, even their very lives to the end that a great cause, a noble ideal will prevail and succeed.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1279.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Nevertheless, in spite of these admirable and superb efforts, invariably the jealousy and enmity of certain men will seek to hinder and harm the good work that has been started or is about to begin.</p>
   <p>The jealous man is a formidable rival, a most dangerous enemy, an underhanded opportunist, who, in one breath, and by various tricks and false teachings, will attempt to wreck and discredit a good and worthy idea from the very beginning. Some despicable and worthless loafers and professional haters will use all sorts of machinations and false accusations to disunite the members and leaders of society. My causing strife, confusion, and ill feeling between many easily influenced and credulous individuals, they expect to profit and, at the same time, they are happy to see that some great idea or undertaking has failed to materialize or give any results.</p>
   <p>The history of the Greek nation has many examples of such men. First, <pb facs="5422062_1_1280.jpg" n="4"/>all of us remember reading about the exile of Aristides the Just; second, about the tragic exile of Themistocles, the victor of Salamis; third, the famous historical episode of the condemnation and death of Socrates when he was forced to drink the hemlock poison is well known. How different would our country be, if so many great and worthy men had not been exiled, put to death, or dishonored and disowned by their very own people? How different would our homeland be today if ingratitude, political persecution, intolerance, and jealousy had not forced some of our ablest and most gifted men to leave our homeland for some foreign land? Anyone possessing any common sense can see how different and how great our native land would be if the Greek people had not made so many serious blunders. There is not doubt whatever that many historical events in Greece have had some direct influence on the evolution of the world's history.</p>
   <p>So, even among the right thinking and progressive members of the Greek community of Chicago there are included many trouble-makers, many jealous <pb facs="5422062_1_1281.jpg" n="5"/>and envious characters who are using their own peculiar "virtue" with deadly effect. At all times they have been working diligently to destroy and undermine the vital interests and important activities of our own community. How many times have we witnessed numerous gatherings of a few good, honest, sincere, and patriotic Greeks, who accepted the common decision to form and establish a nationalistic, patriotic, or philanthropic organization for the purpose of rendering some useful service to the community? These ambitious and active members of our nationality have toiled and suffered much in the majority of cases without selfishness or any direct material or personal gain.</p>
   <p>At the very moment when some forward or constructive move is made, the jealous and envious cliques within our community will do all in their power to oppose and hamper some good cause which is proceeding satisfactorily. They appear on the scene not as supporters of a worthy cause which is proceeding satisfactorily. They appear on the scene not as supporters of a worthy cause but as deliberate conspirators who are bent on completing their destructive task. All <pb facs="5422062_1_1282.jpg" n="6"/>of us can see the tragic results of many failures in projects which were undertaken by our community. Who do you suppose is responsible for these failures and unfulfilled wishes and schemes?</p>
   <p>Lest some active and important members of our community become the victims of those nefarious schemers, who are steeped in their hateful jealousy, we advise the Greek people to mark well the useless and dangerous obstructionists of every progressive and worth-while activity within our community. We must remember that the people of this community can and must distinguish between the good and the bad Greeks. They must support and appreciate the efforts and intentions of the former, but should avoid and warn others against the latter.</p>
   <p>There is no room in the Greek colony of Chicago for envy, hate, disunity, and jealousy. The affairs and work of our people will progress and contribute <pb facs="5422062_1_1283.jpg" n="7"/>to the general welfare only if we get rid of those who would tear down what we are building.</p>
