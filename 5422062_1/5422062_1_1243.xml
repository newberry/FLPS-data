   <p>p. 1.- Among the Greeks in Chicago we occasionally hear of some countryman who has conducted himself shamefully in the eyes of the law. This is doing much to harm the Greek reputation.</p>
   <p>Because the American papers play up any crime or scandal committed by a foreigner, the Greeks get their share of it. Recently a Syrian boy killed a Turk and because of the similarity of his name to Greek names, everybody thought he was a Greek. Public opinion was not very favorable to Greeks for a time after that.</p>
   <p>That is way we Greeks must be on our best behavior. we must be careful what we no and what we say because an antagonistic feeling is not hard to arouse against us.</p>
   <p>A Greek who wants to rent a room in an American home finds it hard to do so because of the mistaken notion Americans have that all Greeks are <pb facs="5422062_1_1244.jpg" n="2"/>murderers, thieves, etc. We know that a priest was once turned away because his only crime was that he was Greek.</p>
   <p>Because of a few wayward men, our entire nationality, in Chicago is becoming condemned. We must do our best to stop this growing feeling of resentment which the American hold for us. We are all honest, law-abiding people and should be regarded as such.</p>
