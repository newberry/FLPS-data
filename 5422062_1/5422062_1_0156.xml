   <p>On last Tuesday, May 9, 1923, at 8 P. M. a dinner was served in one of the finest dining-rooms of the aristocratic La Salle Hotel by the Greek Students' Club in honor of their graduates from the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Gikas, the popular attorney, acted as toastmaster and spoke briefly about the progress of the Greek student in America. After this he announced Mr. Homer P. Valavanis, a graduate of the Chicago School of Commerce, who spoke eloquently on commerce. Next followed Mr. Constantine D. Kalogeras of Imber, a graduate in mathematics and physics, who spoke on astronomy, in particular on the sun. Miss Helen Papadopoulos, a graduate in music, and her brother, Mountes E. Papadopoulos, then delivered addresses, and Mr. George N. Spannon gave an imaginative talk on the political sciences and economy. In conclusion Mr. Robert Johnson Bonar, a professor of the Greek language at the University of Chicago, spoke on archeology, history, and rhetoric and eulogized Greece as a country of civilization and culture.</p>

   <p>All the speakers were applauded and congratulated by the guests. After the speeches Mr. Arvites, the president of the Club rose and spoke on the purpose and the activities  of the organization, and later all were invited to dance.</p>
   <p>We are sorry to have to reprove some of our professional men who were not sufficiently interested to be present at the affair and to celebrate, congratulate, and encourage their new colleagues.</p>
   <p>Sincere congratulations to the graduates!</p>
