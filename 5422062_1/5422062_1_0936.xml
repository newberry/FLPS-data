   <p>It would be well to recall the substantial aid, moral and material, rendered by the United States to the young Greek nation in her very hour of heroic struggle for political liberation. It was Daniel Webster who poured the honey of his eloquence before the House of Representatives on December 8, 1823, and convinced them that by helping Greece, America was not merely paying the debt to modern Greeks as heirs of their ancient forefathers, but was helping a new nation because it was fighting for mankind, for civilization and for Christianity, and for upholding the very principles set forth in the American Declaration of Independence.</p>
   <p>President Monroe, in his annual message to Congress, aroused the hearts of statesmen and citizens alike for sympathy and action for the heroic Greeks. Public meetings and church services were held throughout the land. Prominent personages formed committees, contributions were gathered, theatrical performances were given for the benefit of suffering women and children of the fighting Hellenes. A genuine spirit of sympathy and <pb facs="5422062_1_0937.jpg" n="2"/>Christian love prevailed among the wealthy and poor alike.</p>
   <p>The city of Hartford had organized a local committee for "the purpose of devising means to evince the public sympathy for the oppressed people of Greece and to solicit funds and address a memorial to the Congress of the United States on the subject of recognition of Greek independence." Boston, New York, Norwich, Conn., and other cities sent generous funds to buy provisions for the families of the Greek heroes. A very distinguished citizen of Boston, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, was appointed surgeon of the Greek fleet. Edward Everett, editor of the North American Review, another ardent friend of the Greek cause, was among the first to start the Philhellenic campaign in the United States. General George Jarvis, the son of an American diplomat, was wounded many times and saw as many battles as any Greek. Another outstanding fighter for the cause of liberty was Col. Jonathan P. Miller of Vermont, who, at the age of 23, was known among his comrades as the "Yankee daredevil". William G. Washington, a volunteer in the Greek Army, paid the supreme sacrifice while fighting heroically in Palamidi. George Wilson and Jacob Williams <pb facs="5422062_1_0938.jpg" n="3"/>were two brave American sailors who served with devotion the little armada of the Greeks.</p>
   <p>In the more recent World War and its aftermath, it was American relief through the Near East, Y.M.C.A. the American Red Cross and other volunteer organizations that helped a nation of six million to take care of one and a half million of their brother refugees from Asia Minor and to absorb them into the fold that has built the well-governed, new nation of Greece.</p>
   <p>Last year, Hellas and her children on distant shores have commemorated this centenary of her national liberation. Of course, at the same time the immortal soul of the Greeks was celebrating an anniversary more than three thousand years. Many of the festivals were held in the United States, among the university folks, the church people, among athletic organizations and the very Greek communities themselves. The newspapers of the land have extolled in articles and editorial comment the heroism and spiritual virility of the Hellenic people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0939.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Descendants of Greeks in many parts of the world have sojourned in their motherland; among these visitors were Greek members of the American Legion, a small part of the sixty thousand American soldiers of Greek blood who served in the World War. Before departing for Athens they were entrusted with a flag from each of the States of the American Union, sent by their respective Governors as a token of friendship and a cordial felicitation upon the centenary. These state banners have been presented to the President of the Greek Republic and to Premier Eleutherios Venizelos in great ceremony at the Stadium of Athens.</p>
   <p>There, too, was unveiled a memorial to American friends of Greece with statues of Webster, Monroe, Everett, Howe and Henry Clay, similar to the recent memorial in Massachusetts to George Dilboy, the American patriot of Greek blood who willingly shed his life that democracy might triumph. It is well known how the Greek boy was honored by the highest award of this land--the Congressional Medal.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0940.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Legionnaires have returned to their land of adoption with beautiful impressions of the new Greece. They have observed a more united nation where education prevails, where production and industry--with new settlement, with drainage and irrigation of the land and extension of the roads--where the creation of ports and the building of cities have made a paradise for those scholars, artists, diplomats or business agents who would tour her temples, seek her sacred bypaths, introduce American industry into fertile markets, and to discover that eternal summer still gilds her ancient isles for those who have the eye to see.</p>
   <p>The American nation harbors today more than half a million citizens or Greek origin. The vitality, loyalty, resourcefulness and civic enthusiasm that these Greeks contribute to the culture and welfare of the country is Welcome, and in high quarters understood, appreciated and acclaimed.</p>
   <p>Flags would be but strips of rags were it not that the authority of nations gives them respect and power, and were it not that the people of each nation pour the fill of their racial ideals and patriotic fervor into that very symbol of their national consciousness--the Flag! When flags of these two <pb facs="5422062_1_0941.jpg" n="6"/>democracies have been exchanged, hands of felicitation have clasped across the sea; in such a joyful communion and old friendship is strengthened and bonds of affection between Greece and America are sealed that together they may attain the highest aspiration of mankind--international peace and the material and spiritual prosperity of their citizenry.</p>
