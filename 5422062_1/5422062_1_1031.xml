   <p>Whether Greece will eventually become an American colony or vice versa is a matter of time. American influence has conquered the Greek atmosphere. Anyone not speaking American in Athens finds it hard to get along. Everywhere you see American things and you hear of American things. The city of wisdom is giving in to American wisdom. Everything has been changed by American influence. In ancient times Greece was changing the world; today Greece is changed by America.</p>
   <p>The weekly sports magazine Athletismos, reports the outcome of a recent basketball game played in the gymnasium of the National Athletic Association in Athens, between the Constantinople Athletic Club, its members all graduates of Robert College, and the Near East Relief team. The interesting match, which took Athens by storm, ended with the Near East Relief team the winner, thirteen to seven. The ex-orphanage boys played in good form showing thorough coaching.</p>

   <p>Poor Athenians, how times change. Instead of being the leaders, they are now led by those who are baptized in Americanism; but the peculiar thing about it is they do not resent it, they like it.</p>
