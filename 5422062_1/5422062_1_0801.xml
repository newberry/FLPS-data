   <p>The Ancient Greeks used to say and practiced, "Pan Metron Ariston". The human being, besides seeking the unknown. object of his creation, for which object thousands and thousands of books have been written without getting any-wheres, must observe the law of preservation. The divine governing power indowed him with logic, in order to live, act and perform his obligations to himself and others, with wisdom justice, and love. Logic is, what discriminates us from the inferior animals.</p>
   <p>Aristotle Dogmatised the following Characteristics of the Anthropos. "Man is a demonstration and measurement of illness and health, a prey of the elements of Nature, a plaything of Fate, The Scale of Envy and Misery, The Masterpiece of Nature, and The Paragon of Animals." Logic is the guidance to light, justice, and right. Desires, sentiments, feelings and emotions of the heart must be guided and ruled by logic, in order to avoid extremities. Man has individual, family and society obligations to perform. His duty to himself is to maintain his health, his morality, and to develop his mental powers, in order to meet the necessities of life, and raise himself to a higher level of life.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0802.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Family obligations are, the demands of Nature and Society for the perpetuation of the species and the breeding of better and civilized members of society. Society, therefore, is the result of family life. In the performance of our obligations, our horizon must be illumined by logic in order to enable us to labor in light and not in darkness. But the betterment of society depends upon the betterment of the family. So the blossoms of the Greek Family in our adopted Country must be taught, besides what is taught in the schools. The blossoms of the Greek Family are, The Greek Language, Greek Religion, Greek Habits and Customs, and devotion of the child to both Greece and America.</p>
   <p>A Young, Greek American, receiving the teachings of his two great mothers, will soon become a better and useful citizen and scintillate, as a forerunner of a real civilization, outshining the civilization of his projenitors which his American Mother Country now have.</p>
   <p>Come, my dear Greeks, let us build bigger and better Greek schools and Greek churches, so our new generation, in conjunction with American Education, will be taught the ideals and grandeur of Greece.</p>
