   <p>The schools of Chicago this year have celebrated George Washington's birthday with greater solemnity than in the past. The school ceremony which was held at the Auditorium, was organized by a special committee, appointed for that purpose by the Board of Education. Each and every race was represented at the festival by girl students attired in colorful national costumes.</p>
   <p>Greece was represented by Miss Anastasia Katsiafouros, student of Harrison High School, daughter of Mr. Pan Katsiafouros, a native of Vassara, Sparta.</p>
   <p>Miss Anastasia, in her wonderful attire, played her part with such dexterity, rhythm and perfection that she was awarded the first prize, and obtained the personal congratulations of Mayor Dever and the members of the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>The Greek-American girl displayed at the ceremony the charm, grace and beauty of her progenitors, coupled with her American individuality.</p>
