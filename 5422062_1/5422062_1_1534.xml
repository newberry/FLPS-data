   <p>p. 1- One of the most unpleasant things to contemplate is human misery. Countless fears beset the sons of men, but the fear of poverty overshadows all the rest. A human being who lacks the necessities of life is the most pitiable object on God's green earth. Yet the problem that confronted the savage remains unsolved to this day, notwithstanding our supposedly superior intelligence.</p>
   <p>As societies grow in number, and governments by treachery usurp all power to themselves, the individual becomes a nonentity and is practically abandoned to the mercy of the gods of fate.</p>
   <p>The modern state is being brought into line with the theory that the individual exists to serve the state, not that the state exists to serve the individual.</p>
   <p>If the modern state truly represented the individual, no such theoretical conflict of ideas would exist, for the individual would be the state, and <pb facs="5422062_1_1535.jpg" n="2"/>the state would be the individual. Modern man is becoming convinced that the tendency of all governments is to make him a slave to the state, be it monarchical, democratic, or communistic. The state keeps on demanding everything from the individual and in return guarantees us imaginary liberty but no bread. Surely we are nothing more than puppets in the hands of destiny.</p>
