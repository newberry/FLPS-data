   <p>p. 2- The students' association, Elikon, which was launched last year has shown increasing vitality and has also shown that our young students in spite of the fact that they were born in America and do not even know the Greek language very well are animated by the purest Greek sentiments and remain Greeks although they do not know Greece. This most patriotic association has held its elections of officers and has elected Mr. P. B. Belogiannis, student of law at Loyola University, as president; Mr. G. Lebanos of the Northwestern University Law School as vice-president; Mr. J. Michalopoulos of Northwestern University as secretary; Mr. D. Iatropoulos of De Paul University as treasurer, and Mr. Basil Nestos as manager.</p>
   <p>The new officers are full of enthusiasm, and they are preparing a new program of action for the new year, details of which they will let us have in a short time.</p>
