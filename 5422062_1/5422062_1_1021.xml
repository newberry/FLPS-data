   <p>p. 7.- For the enlightenment of some of our fellow-Greeks who suffered from megalomania, thinking that every good thing in the world is Greek, and especially for a certain class of people in the United States who entertain the same illusion, we are compelled to write this article.</p>
   <p>Now and then some ultra-patriot who is seeking office at one hands of American voters breaks out with a vicious attack on "foreigners." The effort is made to create hatred and antipathy to everything that was not started in the United States.</p>
   <p>The United States of America is the world's greatest nation. It was recognized as such at the close of the late world war.</p>
   <p>But this nation, as well as the rest of the world, owes a great deal of its material and spiritual progress to other nations, chiefly European.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1022.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first great advocate of public education was a Corsican named Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France. The first code of laws granting rights of citizenship to the common people was written by Solon, a Greek. The first man outside of the Hebrew race to teach publicly that there is a Supreme Deity, to be worshipped by man, was Zoroaster, a Persian. Gunpowder was the invention of a Chinese. The printing press was the idea of Johann Gutenburg, a German. A native of Switzerland, watching a wasp build a nest, discovered how to make paper from wood. The steam engine was the invention of James Watt, an Englishman. Marie Curie, a woman of Poland, and her French huspand, discovered radium. The first successful electric railway was built in Berlin.</p>
   <p>The first road builder was an Italian. The discoverer of the cure for rabies was Louis Pasteur of France. The man who succeeded in bringing back youth to the aged, through transplanting of certain glands, was Serge Voronoff, a Russian. The first white man to sail across the South Atlantic, was Christopher Columbus, an Italian, with a Spanish crew. The first great mathematician was a Greek, and Copernicus, who found that the sun stands still while the earth moves, was also of Grecian blood.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1023.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The United States owes, in a large measure, its independence to the military skill and courage of Marquis De La Fayette, a Frenchman, and Baron De Kalb of Poland.</p>
   <p>So every good thing in the world is not Greek, American, etc., and those Greeks who suffer from megalomania are not so harmful as those ultrapatriot office seekers who for their own personal gain will stoop so low as to create dissension and hatred against naturalized citizens.</p>
