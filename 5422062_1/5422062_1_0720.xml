   <p>It is reported, by telegraph from Athens, Greece to local newspapers, that the United States Charge d'Affaires at Athens, Mr. Capps, has requested of Mr. Rallis, the Greek Prime Minister, that Greeks acquiring American citizenship be properly treated as American citizens when temporarily returning to Greece for a brief stay. Mr. Rallis assured Mr. Capps that the Greek government will comply with the latter's request.</p>
   <p>In addition, Mr. Capps asked about a question that vitally affects the relationships between Greeks and Americans. The question was: In case an American woman marries a Greek, according to what laws will the marriage be arranged? Mr. Rallis, the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs, replied that the marriage may be performed "according to the American laws." We are unable to believe that such a thing was said by Mr. Rallis, but, if it was, then either Mr. Rallis <pb facs="5422062_1_0721.jpg" n="2"/>does not know much about law--a deplorable possibility--or else he is lying, and is introducing sinister influences directed against the existing laws. In any case, he is the cause of many evils and creates a situation whose ultimate effects will be most harmful to our nationals.</p>
   <p>According to American law, as it relates, in particular, to marriage, a topic with which we have dealt extensively in the past, and about which Mr. Rallis has not even the slightest idea--, if a Greek marries an American in America the following requirements must be fulfilled, if the marriage is to be valid:</p>
   <p>1. To satisfy American requirements, procurement of a license from the county authorities is necessary. Then, the marriage ceremony must be performed by a priest of the religious faith to which the husband belongs.</p>
   <p>2. To satisfy the laws of Greece, so that the marriage may be valid and produce the desired results, it is required that the marriage be performed according to the Greek laws: that is, a license must be issued by</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0722.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>the diocese of the Greek Orthodox Church. The ceremony must be performed by a duly recognized priest and the formality of returning the licenses to the diocese must be observed. If a marriage is not performed according to the Greek laws, then that marriage is illegal, and, consequently, we have a case of illegal cohabitation. The children of such a marriage have no hereditary rights in the father's estate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rallis, then, should have said, when the foregoing question was addressed to him in his role of minister, that the marriage, if it is to be valid and become successful, must comply with the civil and religious laws and requirements of both countries.</p>
   <p>But, is this, by any chance, the only blunder of the government? Where is one to begin counting [its blunders]?</p>
