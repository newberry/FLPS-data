  <body>
   <p>Thousands of Greeks have approved the editorial article of our prominent attorney, Mr. Andrew Vlachos, in which he said that the Greeks of America, especially the Greeks of Chicago, are awaiting with great eagerness the expected arrival in America of Professor Neocles Kazazis of the University of Athens. Our people understand that the Greek immigrant in this distant and strange land needs educated teachers and leaders of Professor Kazazis' caliber--men who will give the worried and anxious Greek immigrant the courage to carry on amidst a totally strange and often hostile environment, and will strengthen his patriotism.</p>
   <p>No one has indicated his disagreement with the general desire to have this distinguished educator and patriot with us in the near future. We take this <pb facs="5422062_1_1247.jpg" n="2"/>opportunity to say that the time is ripe and necessity demands the arrival of such eminent visitors from the homeland, so that we may receive their wise counsel. But there are many more specific reasons why the presence of Mr. Kazazis in Chicago is extremely desirable.</p>
   <p>Just as the sick need a doctor to treat them, just as a dying person needs a priest to administer the last sacrament, so the Greeks of America, and especially those of Chicago, need men like Mr. Kazazis to stimulate their thinking, enliven their spirit, and inspire them to good deeds and to a correct policy in regard to our personal, community, and national affairs. It is by such actions that a people develops and becomes famous, by winning a place for itself in history.</p>
   <p>The presence of this outstanding personality from the Greek academic world in our Greek-American communities is as necessary as it will be profitable to all those who will have the opportunity and the pleasure of coming in contact with him. His arrival here will do much to improve our way of life, for <pb facs="5422062_1_1248.jpg" n="3"/>it will heal many wounds in our social organism and it will remedy many of our apparently incurable diseases.</p>
   <p>We Greeks of Chicago, specifically, need great men like Mr. Kazazis we need a guiding hand to lead us to a safe port. We need staunch and true patriots, who can educate and inspire us to settle our differences, forget our disputes, and stop spreading discord and disunion among ourselves. We must be told to think more seriously and to realize that we are far from having fulfilled our obligations to our homeland.</p>
   <p>We find ourselves tossed about in a stormy sea, lashed by typhoons and whirlwinds of passions and unbridled emotions. We are about to be swallowed into the vast bosom and depth of the sea of humanity. We are threatened with the loss of our national identity and consciousness. We are heading toward a dreadful abyss.</p>
   <p>We certainly need a superhuman power to hold us back from this dangerous step; we need a strong hand to keep us from being drawn to the precipice of <pb facs="5422062_1_1249.jpg" n="4"/>destruction. We need a man who is free from any and every passion and hatred. No one but a man of the stature of Mr. Kazazis, could offer us strong support and sobering advice.</p>
   <p>Everywhere, in every Greek community which he visited in Turkey, Rumania, Russia, Egypt, etc., he has done excellent work. His powerful, imposing, and persuasive voice was heard with eagerness and heartfelt joy by thousands of Greeks all over the world. His inspiring and reassuring patriotic message was received everywhere with soul-stirring delight. The fruits of his endeavors to arouse the nationalistic sentiments of our people are evident everywhere.</p>
   <p>Professor Kazazis has traveled and preached even in England and France, defending and promoting our national interests. All the Greeks have learned to love and respect him for his genuine patriotism, attractive personality, outstanding educational attainments, and brilliant intellectual qualities. Thousands of foreigners have been convinced by his arguments in behalf of <pb facs="5422062_1_1250.jpg" n="5"/>Greece. The civilized nations of the world have learned that it was not the Greeks who committed the horrible massacres and atrocities in Macedonia. They know now that the Bulgarians were not merely the victims but the very perpetrators of the crimes that shocked the world.</p>
   <p>The interests and reputation of the Greeks of America, the high respect in which the Greek people of Chicago are held, are seriously injured and jeopardized because the reporters and foreign correspondents of many American newspapers are not well informed on the foreign situation, and especially on the political and diplomatic situation in the Balkans. Therefore, the public opinion of America is misinformed and misguided. The American press in many instances is totally ignorant of the implications of the change of events in Europe. That is why we read lengthy articles in the European and American press defending and approving the acts and policies of the Bulgarians, while, at the same time, the Greeks are accused of every crime and every inhuman act.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1251.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Our people in this city can be spared the pain of being called savages and wild mountaineers by our American friends. We here are not to blame, of course, for everything that happens overseas or in the homeland, but just the same, there are many inevitable reflections cast upon us; there are many prejudiced, ignorant, and narrow-minded people in this country who seize the slightest provocation to attack the many foreign-language communities.</p>
   <p>This current of discontent, intolerance, and false reports can be diverted and checked, if Professor Kazazis gives a series of lectures and has numerous interviews with representatives of the American press upon his arrival in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Extensive discussion and an authoritative explanation of the true situation in the Balkans by Mr. Kazazis will enlighten the American press and force them to refrain from attacking the government and people of Greece unfairly. The whole discussion may also raise the question of the rights of oppressed</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_1252.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>peoples and minorities, as well as the question of the right of self-determination of all those who have been subjugated and deprived of their right to liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let every man, every society, and every organization draft a resolution inviting this great man and outstanding patriot to come to Chicago in order that he may strengthen us in our patriotism and devotion to our beloved homeland, and in order that he may help us defend ourselves against the numerous attacks and accusations directed against the Greek people in general.</p>
   <p>We must, by all means, try to win the favor of the American press and American public opinion. The Greek press throughout the United States must exert every effort to convince Professor Kazazis to come here; we are confident that he will not refuse.</p>
   <p>Our esteemed Chicago attorney, Mr. Andrew Vlachos, who is always busy <pb facs="5422062_1_1253.jpg" n="8"/>educating and inspiring our people to work for the glory of Greece and the progress of the Greeks, not only in Chicago but all over the United States, deserves our love and respect for his untiring efforts and for his original suggestion that Professor Kazazis be invited to visit America.</p>
