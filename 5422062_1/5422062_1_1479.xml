   <p>The impartial observer will see that all the measures that the government has taken till now are measures for the preservation of capital from the crisis that it passes through, and it is only in America where capitalists were ruling the country dictatorially, that such measures are characterized as communistic. But, it is about time it be understood that the government has a right--by its own initiative--to take such measures as it thinks necessary according to circumstances, without the consent of the capitalists and, if need be against their will.</p>
   <p>The interesting outcome for all this is: The government by the measures that are being taken will succeed in getting the country out of this crisis and save capital even if capital opposes the move.</p>
