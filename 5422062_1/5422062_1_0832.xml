   <p>Practically all the Greeks of Chicago know Mr. John Venizelos (Mangel), the leading Chicago florist. They know him because he has been living in Chicago forty-five years, and has done many good deeds for the Greek community of the city.</p>
   <p>In recognition of his services, the parish of the St. Constantine Church gave a dinner in his honor last Sunday evening in the Church hall. The guest of honor, his family, and about two hundred of his friends gathered to celebrate. Many notables of our community were present. Mr. E. Pofantis acted as toastmaster, and speeches were made by the Church's deacon, Reverend Glynos; Doctor Zaph; and the Reverend Mark Petrakis. In response to their words of praise Mr. Venizelos said that he merely had done what he considered his patriotic duty.</p>

   <p>Dancing and singing followed the dinner.</p>
