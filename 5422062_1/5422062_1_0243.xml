   <p>p. 1.- The Fourth Ecclesiastical Congress, consisting of more than three hundred representatives, is proceeding rapidly with very important work.</p>
   <p>On its second day the Congress voted upon the articles concerning the Archdiocese's offices and the assignment of its employees. In the evening session the rules pertaining to marriages and divorces were discussed and voted upon and also the rule concerning the publication of the Archdiocese's periodical.</p>
   <p>In addition the Congress passed on the proposal for a charitable brotherhood of the Archdiocese with its seat in New York.</p>
   <p>A dinner was served to the delegates by the Archdiocese before the evening session at the Dixie Hotel.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0244.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One of the most important matters that will come before the Congress is the educational question. We present here in general outline the plan of the educational rules which the Committee has formulated.</p>
   <p>Supreme Board of Education</p>
   <p>Article I</p>
   <p>As per article 15 of the constitution of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America a Supreme Board of Education shall be established.</p>
   <p>Article II</p>
   <p>Aims</p>
   <p>The purposes of this establishment shall be:</p>
   <p>a - To obtain and to classify the personnel for the afternoon schools and for the other schools under the holy jurisdiction of the Archdiocese.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0245.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>b - To train this personnel so that a contemporary body of teachers may be created.</p>
   <p>c - To receive appeals of educational nature from the educational committees of the communities, from the School Committee, and from the Committee of the Catechetical Schools.</p>
   <p>d - To obtain and approve of the material to be taught.</p>
   <p>e - To form a corps of experts, of supervisors, and of itinerant preachers for communities and small parishes.</p>
   <p>f - To ratify appointments of priests as teachers in cases wherein priests shall be secured as teachers.</p>
   <p>g - To circularize instructions for the teaching personnel and the educational committees of the communities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0246.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>h - To appoint, supervise, and approve of scholars and scholarships, whether the candidates be teachers or not, in American schools and universities.</p>
   <p>i - To appoint suitable candidates to serve on local educational committees.</p>
   <p>j - To find practical means for uninterrupted contact between our schools and American educational circles in order to maintain closer cooperation in educational work.</p>
   <p>k - To rule on matters pertaining to linguistic controversies.</p>
   <p>l - To suggest means of financial assistance for communities or parishes unable wholly to meet the payment of teachers' salaries.</p>
   <p>m - To organize festivals and educational gatherings for the achievement of the Board's aims.</p>
   <p>n - To award annual teacher's certificates to the teaching personnel.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0247.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>o - To exercise supervision and control over Greek-American educational institutions now in existence or hereafter to be founded.</p>
   <p>p - To organize and approve of contests in language and philology for Greeks in America.</p>

   <p>The Supreme Educational Board shall be composed of nine members, elected every two years by the General Congresses of the Archdiocese, and shall function as an organ of the Archbishop's or under direction of his secretary or of any other proper person of the Archdiocese presiding.</p>
   <p>Article Meetings and Congresses</p>

   <p>Article VI</p>
   <p>The interpretation of the articles of the Board's rules according to the spirit as a whole of the Archdiocesan organization shall be made in the Mixed Council of the Archdiocese.</p>
   <p>Changes in the rules of the constitution are left in the hands of the General Congresses of the Archdiocese. And if any article of these rules in its application shall prove to be in conflict with the laws of any state, the Mixed Council shall substitute for it another article which shall be in accord with the aim and the whole system of the Archdiocese.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0249.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Article VII</p>
   <p>Statutes</p>
   <p>The local educational committees shall submit to the Board every six months either reports of their own, or answers to the questionnaires of the School Committee.</p>
   <p>The local councils of the communities shall regulate the formation of their organizations in such a way that the educational committees of the councils may function as uniform organizations and may also depend on the Supreme Board in points relative to their educational activities. Every rule of the Supreme Educational Board shall be final, and articles in conflict with the central organization shall be null and void. The members of the Supreme Educational Board shall be persons of superior education.</p>

   <p>The secretary shall have no vote, but the presiding Archoishop shall have the deciding vote and if absent shall appoint a person to preside as well as persons to take the places of members who shall resign or be absent without excuse from three consecutive meetings.</p>
   <p>The Board shall divide itself into committees for the more methodical transaction of business, and these committees shall obtain funds from the treasury of the Archdiocese to defray any expenses which they may incur.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_1_0251.jpg" n="9"/>
