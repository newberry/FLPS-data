   <p>Jens Christian Christensen, who is a skilled and competent watchmaker and jeweler, belongs to the class of en who have learned the art of their profession in a foreign land, where instructors are severe and the term of apprenticeship long, and traveled to the United States to practice where services are better rewarded. He is well known in the vicinity where his business is located and his ability in his line is recognized.</p>
   <p>Mr. Christensen was born April 26, 1841, in Denmark, and is the only child of Christian Johnson and his beloved wife. He was reared and educated and learned the trade which he has followed since in the region of his birthplace. He passed through the long apprenticeship of five years, bravely and successfully, and emerged a watchmaker and repairer of the first class. After being employed in Copenhagen two years, he located in the western part of Denmark, where he established a business in manufacturing timepieces. He remained in the vicinity and in the same business twenty years.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_1155.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In 1884 Mr. Christensen decided to come to America and embarked for this country. He traveled directly to Chicago and opened business at No. 96 Ohio Street, remaining at this number three years, conducting a repair shop. He removed to No. 57 Huron Street, where he remained until 1896, at which time he went to his present location, No. 765 West North Avenue. He is a first class business man and turns out some very fine work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Christensen was married before he left the land of his nativity, in 1870, to Miss Christiana Anderson. They became the parents of two sons, who are a credit to the rearing they have received and to their parents' name. Christ, the older, is a jeweler, living in the State of Missouri. John resides in Chicago, on the North Side. Mr. and Mrs. Christensen are refined and intelligent people and move in very good society. They are influential members of the Danish Lutheran Church, in which they are useful in many ways. They are possessed of quiet and kindly minds, and their home is one of harmony and happiness.</p>
