   <p>p.2.....The new Catholic Archbishop, with which Chicago has been blessed, arrived in the city recently, by special train, consisting of luxurious pullman sleeping - and dining cars for himself and his retinue.</p>
   <p>He,whom the bishop is supposed to represent, and whose teachings he supposedly proclaims, came riding into Jerusalem on an ass and did not even have anything on which he might rest his head. He lived for and felt for the small ones in society, and scolded the rich and unjust. But the chief purpose of archbishop Quigley's arrival in Chicago is to fight Socialism and there may be good reasons for this. Regardless of what form the religion of the future may take, one thing is certain: In a socialistic society people will soon become sufficiently spiritually independent to disregard proclaimers of false christianity, and spokesmen for injustice of Mr. Quigley's type. only under social conditions, such as we have today, can all kinds of parasites and "humbug-makers" exist.</p>
