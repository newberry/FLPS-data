   <p>The Student Singers' visit in Chicago developed into the greatest triumph ever experienced by Danish-Americans, and forms a brilliant counterpart to the AARHUS-day (4th of July celebration in Aarhus, Denmark), which undoubtedly furnished the incentive to the Students' American visit.</p>
   <p>The affair became such an outstanding success, thanks to the unity and coordination, which pervaded the arrangements from start to finish. Practically all of the more than fifty Danish Societies in the city were represented, through their presidents, on the great general arrangement committee, together with a number of the oldest and most experienced veterans within the Danish colony. This set-up functioned very smoothly and efficiently. One purpose! One thought!.</p>
   <p>The driving force in the preliminary work was the enthusiastic Dr.Max Henius, who seemed tireless, and who so ably directed his associates. He was assisted <pb facs="5420780_3_0746.jpg" n="2"/>by Mr. Carl Anthousen, who together with Mr. Hasselriis succeeded in inspiring the American press; never before has so much flattering attention been paid the Danes.</p>
   <p>What particularly impressed us during those stirring days, was the hearty interest with which our Swedish and Norwegian cousins participated in the festivities. We Danes have been deeply touched by the good will and brotherly sentiment thus evinced.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we Chicago Danes wish to bring the students our heartfelt thanks for the honor they, by their beautiful and cultured song, have brought to our nation on both sides of the ocean.</p>
