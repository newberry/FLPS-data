  <body>
   <p>p.2... Last Thursday, the Catholic Order,Knights of Columbus,gave a dinner in Sherman House in honor of Minister Egan. Many of the more prominent Danes were invited. Mr. Flynn acted as toastmater. Following McCann's speech for minister Egan, consul Bech spoke in behalf of the Danes. He pointed out Minister Egan's great love for Denmark, and his well-known ability as a diplomat and representative of American interests in our homeland.</p>
   <p>Minister Egan, greeted with wild applause, then delivered a very pleasing speech for Denmark. Among other things he particularly pointed to our "people's high schools" and the high standard of Danish culture.</p>
   <p>He characterized the Danes as a nation with a big heart, and expressed his gratitude over the great sympathy with which he was met everywhere in the country. He took the opportunity to mention the 4th of July celebration in Aarhus, as a beautiful attestation of the strong ties <pb facs="5420780_3_0752.jpg" n="2"/>uniting Denmark and America.</p>
   <p>Egan professed his love for Denmark and the Danes. Even though he disliked to do so, he found it necessary to take issue with Shakespeare.</p>
   <p>Personally he had never found that there was anything very much out of countenance in the State of Denmark.</p>
   <p>(Thundering applause from all the Knights of Columbus.)</p>
