   <p>Mr. A. B. Larsen, 2835 N. Maplewood Ave., passed away last Friday evening. He suffered from stomach inflamation and pneumonia, and was ill only a short time. Mr. Larsen who was born in Ulfsborg near Holstebro, reached the age of 57.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago in 1886 and two years later went to work as carpenter for Deerings staying with the firm for 29 years. He lived for 29 years in the home where he died, and was one of Maplewood Avenue's oldest and best known pioneers. He leaves his wife, Mrs. Thora Larsen, nee Sorensen, and four sons, of whom the oldest is married.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larsen was one of the organizers of the Sons of Denmark, serving for twelve years as its president. He also represented his organization for many years on the National committee. He was a member of D. B. S.</p>

   <p>The funeral was held last Tuesday from Mr. Christ Nielsen's chapel. Interment was in Mt. Olive cemetery. There was an unusually large funeral procession and many flowers from fraternal organizations, neighbors, friends and fellow-workers from Deerings. The Illinois Society members sang hymns and Mrs. Mathilde Huseby sang a solo in the chapel by the grave.</p>
