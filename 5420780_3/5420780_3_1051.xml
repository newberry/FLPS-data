   <p>The chief librarian of the John Crerar Library, Christian Bay, lectured last Sunday in Dania Hall about "The Prairie, its Nature and Forms of Life."</p>
   <p>With a profound knowledge of and deep interest in the topic, the lecturer described the geography and geology of the prairie and its plant and animal life, which during the last half century has been on the retreat before the onslaught of the pioneer in his never ceasing battle to conquer the earth. Almost unbelievable hardships had to be endured by the early pioneer, whose first shelter was usually a cave or an earthen hut and later on a primitive log cabin, miles from the nearest neighbour, and who would think now that in 1853 the voyage from New York to Illinois took 27 days over land and water? The interesting and instructive lecture was made even more vivid by accompanying lantern slides.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_1052.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. Bay reviewed the literature inspired by the prairie, mentioning such writers as Hamlin Garland, Carl Hansen, Kristian Ostergaard, Adam Dan, and others, who in poetry and prose have erected literary monuments in tribute to the endless plains.</p>
   <p>The rather disappointing attendance was probably due to the fact that Dania's lecture committee had decided on a moderate admission charge, which undoubtedly acted as a deterrent, considering the many worthwhile free lectures now offered in Chicago.</p>
