   <p>The famous Danish sculptor, Carl Rohl-Smith, died in Copenhagen, Denmark, at the age of forty.</p>
   <p>He studied at the Royal Academy of Copenhagen and later in Berlin and Rome. He came to America in the eighties and secured work with the terra cotta factory in Perth Amboy. Later he moved to Chicago, where he became famous for his statue of Franklin at the Chicago World's Fair. He also made the monument commemorating the Fort Dearborn massacre of 1812. This monument is now located at the foot of 18th Street; it depicts an Indian chief saving a white woman. He also made the statues for the Iowa monument at Des Moines. These statues were modeled here in Chicago. His last piece of art was the Sherman monument in Washington. He was well liked by the Danes who visited him in his studio in Chicago.</p>
