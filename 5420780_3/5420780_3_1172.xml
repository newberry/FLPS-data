   <p>James Thorsen, deceased, was among the earliest citizens of Danish birth to make his home in Chicago. He was born May 22, 1825, in Schlesin, Holstein, Denmark, now a part of Germany, the only son in a family of three children. He was educated in the schools of his native city and in his youth spent some time in the Danish navy. At the age of nineteen years he made the long journey to California, where he remained about ten years. He was in that state at the time gold was discovered and became a miner, eventually owning a mine.</p>
   <p>About 1854 he returned to Denmark with his savings and entered the brewery business, which he pursued successfully about fifteen years. His residence during this time was in Copenhagen, and in 1856 he was married in that city to Miss Emma Bloch, who was born in Copenhagen. She is the youngest child in a family of two sons and three daughters, and received a liberal education in the schools of her native city. Her father, Carl Bloch, was a <pb facs="5420780_3_1173.jpg" n="2"/>sailor and ship owner.</p>
   <p>In 1869 Mr. and Mrs. Thorsen crossed the Atlantic with their family and journeyed at once to Chicago, where Mrs. Thorsen opened a millinery store, at No. 155 Milwaukee Avenue. She continued this business successfully eight years, accumulating durint that time considerable property. Mr. Thorsen secured a position in a book store, which he retained for some time. He was a man of quiet, unassuming habits, but won the love and respect of all with whom he became acquainted. He was an influential member of the Danis Evangelical Lutheran Church, and his absence is greatly felt by all his fellow-members. He passed away November 3, 1898, at the age of seventy-three years, and his remains were buried in the beautiful cemetery at Graceland.</p>
   <p>To Mr. and Mrs. Thprsen were born five children, all but the youngest of whom, Mitchell, are still living.. Mary is traveling agent for a wholesale millinery firm of Chicago; James B., formerly of the bicycle firm of Thorsen &amp; Cassaday, Chicago, is president of the Thorsen Company, dealing in bicycle material; John is clerk in a retail boot and shoe store; and Peter is agent for a bicycle firm. Mrs. Thorsen is prominent among the Danish ladies of Chicago, <pb facs="5420780_3_1174.jpg" n="3"/>and is foremost in charitable work. She was the leader in the movement to organize the Danish Old People's Home Association, to Build a home for the aged Danish-born citizens of Chicago, and it was at her house that the first meeting of the society was held, March 12, 1891.She was its first president and has been its treasurer seven years, and was recently elected an honorary member of the association by acclamation. The society is now getting ready to build a home, having, after years of patient effort, secured sufficient funds for the purpose.</p>
