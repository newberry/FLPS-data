   <p>During the Christian-Socialist meeting which was held in Odense, Denmark, a committee was appointed for the purpose of directing Socialist propaganda for the three years to come. It contemplated having social-minded ministers, who are either members of the Socialist Party or its sympathizers, tour the country and call meetings where social subjects shall be discussed from historical, economic, and Christian points of view.</p>
   <p>During the discussion following the meeting it was interesting to note how heartily all the speakers agreed with the Reverend Benzon who presented the above plan. We quote some parts of his speech which clearly indicates that "the ministers are coming":</p>
   <p>"My conception of Socialism is that it stands and calls for a just distribution of daily bread acquired through collective efforts, and there is no doubt in my mind that Christian people should be first to respond to and <pb facs="5420780_3_0780.jpg" n="2"/>support this demand for justice.</p>
   <p>"However, even before an audience of Christians, who respond eagerly to an appeal for charity, it is a thankless task to talk in behalf of justice. Whenever we face an isolated case of need and misery, we feel, involuntarily, it is our duty to relieve the suffering; whereas we are sufficiently dominated by our duty to relieve the suffering; whereas we are sufficiently dominated by our egoism not to be particularly impressed when we are told of injustice and human suffering in general, that is, if we ourselves are not in need.</p>
   <p>"But such injustice and human suffering is evident. There are untold thousands of people who have barely enough to keep body and soul together, and with no prospect of relief. However, these people are rather fortunate compared with other thousands who have not even that much and, for the sake of their pride, fight a desperate battle to keep themselves off charity.</p>
   <p>"When it is a fact that our merciful feelings are awake, while justice is asleep, would it not be better then to seek a solution through charitable means than to press a demand for justice? Personally I do not think so, because <pb facs="5420780_3_0781.jpg" n="3"/>charity is helpless in the solution of social evils. Direct aid in one case leaves a hundred others unaided who are equally deserving. The demand for social justice must be pushed before we can hope for a solution. It is not much to the credit of Christian people that they, so far, have faced our social problems with indifference. Frankly speaking, it is plain laziness. Or we simply draw the conclusion that social evils are parts and parcels of human life, imperfect as it is, and that we can do nothing about it. To think so would be to blame our God and Father for conditions we ourselves have created. We have created the conditions and it is our duty to improve them. The soulless power called High Finance, reserves the smallest possible reward for labor. It makes life a festival for the few and hell for the many. But when a man is willing and able to work, why should he beg for permission to exist? "The laborer is worthy of his hire" is a phrase generally accepted by Christian people.</p>
   <p>"Now it is held that justice is asleep. Let us resolve that justice shall be awakened. It is the demand for justice that will spell progress in the <pb facs="5420780_3_0782.jpg" n="4"/>future. Social progress cannot be forced. It will not occur before they, who own our natural resources, realize that they have no right to own these resources. When they relinquish their unjust property rights, social justice will come about as a consequence. Christian people have a good reason to deplore the fact that they were not the ones who raised the demand for social justice. Those of us who have joined in that demand should be ready to disprove the claim that we associate with atheists. We have been indifferent and maintained a reserved attitude entirely too long. Now we come praying for a permit to join the ranks of those, who are veterans in the fight and often times come out as victors--without us."</p>
