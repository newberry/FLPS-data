   <p>The St. Stefan Youth Society observed the 5th anniversary of its founding last Thursday with a social gathering in its auditorium at 64th Street and Vincennes Avenue.</p>
   <p>The affair attracted a large assemblage of both young and old, who spent a happy evening listening to congratulatory speeches, recitations, song and music, and partaking of a great variety of refreshments; a buffet supper was served.</p>
   <p>The president submitted a very encouraging report. This society does not offer its members any financial aid in case of need; its chief aim is to develop a sound mind in a sound body, and to attain this goal it attempts <pb facs="5420780_3_0554.jpg" n="2"/>to arouse and maintain within its membership, boys as well as girls, an interest in sports and gymnastics, wholesome literature, lectures and discussions on educational topics, song and music, etc. With such a program, based on our Danish culture and traditions, the St. Stefan Youth Society and many similiar organizations throughout the country are trying to reach and develop the best in Danish Youth, among immigrants as well as among native Danish-Americans.</p>
