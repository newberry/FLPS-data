   <p>Capt. John Heinse, editor of Sonderjysk Tidende (Schleswig Times), was born in Denmark. He took part in the war of 1864. When Denmark was defeated he came to America in the seventies. He lived in Chicago for many years where he wrote editorials for Skandinaven, Pioneren, and Norden. He wrote many plays which were performed by amateurs both in America and Denmark. Several of them were given by professional actors in Denmark at the theaters in Copenhagen. He has been a good friend of Hostrup and Bjornstjerne Bjornson. Mr. Heinse is a fine writer and a good speaker, who has given many lectures on the war of 1864.</p>
   <p>He also has written a book Kapen for Sondergylland (The War for Schleswig). The book is well written and much read among Danes in the United States.</p>
