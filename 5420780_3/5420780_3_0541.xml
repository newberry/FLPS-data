   <p>St.Stefans Youth Society gave a demonstration of Danish folk dances in a genuinely Danish setting last Thursday in the Abraham Lincoln Centre, on Oakwood Blvd. The attendance was quite good, 300 tickets being sold.</p>
   <p>The stage was converted into a big 18th century farm living-room, and as the program opened, guests and members of the family, dressed in period costumes, were seated about a long table and on stools about the room, occupied with various kinds of handiwork, singing, and telling stories. It was an interesting scene, but it is difficult for modern Danes to understand the old Jutland dialect, not to mention the many Americans in the audience, and an accompanying English translation would therefore have been highly desirable.</p>
   <p>After a while, an old man pushed his work aside and suggested a dance; the suggestion was enthusiastically received by young and old, and the delightful, spirited folk dances were danced with admirable rhythm and precision, with the exception of a few minor mistakes, which were noticed by only a <pb facs="5420780_3_0542.jpg" n="2"/>few experts in the audience. All the dance numbers won hearty applause particularly "The Dance of the Coppersmiths," which had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>The program ended with the singing of "King Christian" and "My Country, 'tis of Thee," whereafter everybody went to the dining-room, where a delicious cold supper was served. Later the folk dancers, as well as the audience, enjoyed a couple of hours of modern, American dancing.</p>
