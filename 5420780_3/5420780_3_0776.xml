   <p>p.2.col.3.........The concert tour of Mrs. Rosenberg has been anything but a path of roses. This is due in part to her own temperament and in part to the difficult problems presented in the matter of routing, advertising and contracting such a far Western tour from New York City. Rosenberg's appearance in Chicago was a success in every way and plans were made for a return engagement. Her appearances were to be for the benefit of the Danish Old Peoples Home and as there is another festival arranged for the same purpose the committee advised her that due to the fact that two festivals with the same aim and drawing on the same public they could not see their way clear to pay her over $50.00 in justice to Chicago talent who were giving their services gratis. Mrs. Rosenberg replied that the would not appear for less than $100.00 and the tone of her letter was insulting - she demanded the committee pay her this amount in advance. This demand was interpreted as a spiteful insinuation that she was dealing with a group of irresponsibles or crooks. The committee (representing the Danish Brotherhood and the Old Peoples Home Society) promptly discontinued all correspondence with the self important Rosenberg, and she <pb facs="5420780_3_0777.jpg" n="2"/>will, in consequence, make no further Chicago appearances nor do her prospects for the balance of her tour (from Chicago to New York) look any too rosy. The "high hat" attitude and ego of Mrs. Rosenberg have made Chicago Danes disgusted with the idea of presenting artists from the old land to such an extent that many are saying "never again."</p>
