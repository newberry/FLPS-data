   <p>Denmark's Constitution Day is June 5th, but it was celebrated by Danes in Chicago, Sunday, June 7th. The weather was ideal, with bright sunshine and a cooling breeze,which animated the holiday mood from early in the morning. The Danes made great preparations, decorating their cars with Danish and American Flags in order to participate in the parade scheduled to leave Dania Hall about 12 o'clock. At the time of departure there were about sixty automobiles in the parade, which was less than expected. Furthermore, for some reason or other, the parade split up into several links so it was hard for the judges to make fair comparisons and award the prizes to those who really deserved them. However, we believe the judges solved the problems, and following are the winners:</p>

   <p>Arrived at Riverview Park we were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decorations that had been put up for the occasion; part of it was virtually artistic in the arrangement of Danish and American Flags, colored lamps and fancy little booths, one for each society. The decoration was made by Robert Krogh and Martin Knudsen, two of our ambitious countrymen who never refuse to give a hand when their help is needed.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was the performance of a great children's choir, under the direction of Conductor Peter Jensen. The children's voices proved to be well schooled. After a couple of songs had been sung Conductor Ole Nielsen tuned up the orchestra.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0298.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr.John Schmidt, President of the Danish National Committee welcomed the assembly and expressed the belief that this was probably the greatest number of Danes ever gathered outside Denmark to celebrate the Danish Constitution Day.</p>
   <p>"This year we are celebrating our native Constitution Day for the seventeenth time here in Chicago. Those who have participated in this commemoration in Denmark do probably know what significance a celebration of this kind can have. You felt what it meant to be a Dane and you resolved you would contribute to a future of your country equalling its past. We have gathered here to pay a tribute to our homeland and its free enlightened people to whom we are tied in so many ways.</p>
   <p>"There is a peculiar harmony between the colors of Dannesbrog and the Star Spangled Banner as they wave side by side today. We want to protect whatever good we brought with us from our native country, and we wish to preserve it unmolested for the benefit of our children.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0299.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Therefore, I wish to extend my welcome to you all. Welcome to all our guests who are here on their way to visit Denmark. When you come home perchance somebody will wonder why you and your children still speak the Danish language. Tell them that we gather by the thousands to celebrate Denmark's Constitution Day.</p>
   <p>"Welcome to all our Chicago Danes. It has become a tradition for us to meet here every year at this time. There was a time when there were more Danes in Chicago than there were in the third biggest city in Denmark, (Odense). This is not the case any more, but we represent quite a block of Chicago's population and it is with great delight we have gathered on this occasion.</p>
   <p>" Welcome to you all!"</p>
   <p>The President thereby introduced our beloved countryman, Attorney Peter B.Nielsen as Master of Cermony.</p>
   <p>Peter B. Nielsen spoke as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0300.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen:"</p>
   <p>"I have occasionally heard the remark made that it was un-American for people of foreign descent to celebrate events relating to their native country, or to keep alive, through public events, memories and traditions of their Motherland. Fortunately only a few Americans are so narrow in their judgment or so ignorant of the real meaning of celebrations of this nature. Such Americans fail entirely to understand that the very ideals, as well as the evidences of those ideals, which the American citizens of foreign descent celebrate, mark steps in the progress of humanity, which are part and parcel of American ideals and aspiration.</p>
   <p>"When you today gather together to commemorate a step in the development of the Danish nation in its efforts to gain greater liberty and privileges to all its people you are emphasizing and expressing your interest in the very same struggle carried on by the people of most nations for several hundred years and, likewise, <pb facs="5420780_3_0301.jpg" n="6"/>in the same desires and the same principles, which brought about the formation of the United States. The true American realizes and understands that when you, or any other body of American citizens of foreign descent still keep fresh in memory the struggles of your forefathers against tyranny, class distinction and other governmental restrictions upon the rights and privilges of a people, you are keeping alive the same hopes and aspirations which every good citizen of America has for even greater liberties and better government for themselves and their descendants.</p>
   <p>"June 5th and July 4th signify exactly the same in human progress - and there is only this difference - that the event for which they stand affected different people. But the things that brought these days to be near and dear to Americans and Danes, grew out of the same causes - the same events - the same social and political conditions. These dates evidence the culmination of similar struggles of people of different nationality against tyranny- against age old wrongs - and mark steps of the people in their progress for greater freedom and a better government.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0302.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>"It cannot be denied that the people of both nations have learned lessons of great value. Denmark has undoubtedly, in attaining its present standard of a free and enlightened government, drunk deep from the well of freedom and liberal government of these United States. But also, likewise, the United States has gained much from the men and women Denmark has sent here to become among its pioneers in developing the resources of this country and from their efforts to become a part of its best and most earnest citizens. It is recognized as a fact that you have brought with you to this country the elements of good citizenship. You have brought with you habits of industry, frugality and love for your fellow man. You bring with you respect for law and order. In the last generation you have shown the world many evidences of progress and development, which not only the United States, but nearly every country on the globe, has endeavored to follow and adopt. In recognition of your progress it will be remembered that the United States caused its representative to Denmark, Dr. Maurice Egan, to travel throughout the Southern States to advise and inform the people of those states of how you had made so marvelous a success from the cultivation of your lands - the organization and distribution of your products, and today you are the school <pb facs="5420780_3_0303.jpg" n="8"/>house of the world in teaching successful agriculture.</p>
   <p>"On the other hand America has given you the right to live under a form of government founded upon the basis that all men are equal, with no distinction by reason of class or creed.</p>
   <p>"To exercise the right of free speech and free action as long as you do not injure your neighbor. To exercise the privilege of developing your own future and success to any extent your own will and determination may carry you.</p>
   <p>"To become a citizen of a land, with all that that term implies, equal to every one else in power and influence, if you so desire.</p>
   <p>"To be one of, and part of, the nation, which gives to its people the opportunity of living a happy and centered life, more than any other nation on the globe.</p>
   <p>"Will you, therefore, join me in emphasizing this fact - that though we are gathered here together to commemorate an event that is near and dear to us as sons and daughters of our mother country, we do so as good and loyal <pb facs="5420780_3_0304.jpg" n="9"/>American citizens, and, here again, joing with me, in reaffirming our belief in, and steadfastness to, this "American Creed."</p>
   <p>"I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people,for the people, whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a democracy in a republic; a sovereign nation of many sovereign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable,established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice and humanity for which they sacrifice their lives and fortunes.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, I believe it is my duty to my country to love it; to support its constitution; to obey its laws; to respect its flag and to defend it against all its enemies."</p>
