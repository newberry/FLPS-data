  <body>
   <p>An old Chicago Dane, Colonel August Jacobsen, died last week in Washington, D.C., where he had gone to see the unveiling of the Sherman monument. He was born in Middelfort. As a young man he served with the Union forces in the Civil War; he became a colonel and a member of the staff of General Sherman. Later, he married a very rich girl in St. Louis, and then came to Chicago, where he made a fortune in real estate. Together with the banker, Winslow, he bought and sold a great subdivision near Humboldt Park. He had no children and lived as a widower at the Union Club here.</p>
   <p>A small part of Colonel Jacobsen's large fortune is going to his brother's and sister's children; the greatest part is donated to different institutions of higher learning in America. Not one Danish institution was remembered in his last will. He did not associate much with the Danish colony while he lived in Chicago.</p>
