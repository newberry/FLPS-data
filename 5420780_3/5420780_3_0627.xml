   <p>In the year 1890 there were 213,000 Danes in America, all born in Denmark. Illinois then had 17,090 Danes.</p>
   <p>Among the first Danes to settle in the Western parts of the country was Niels Christian Boye, who was born in 1786 in Lolland, Denmark, and died of cholera in St. Louis in 1849.</p>
   <p>Another early settler was Doctor Charles William Borup, who was born in Copenhagen, in 1806, and died in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1859. He came to New York in 1827. He was engaged as a physician by the American Fur Company and sent to Lake Superior.</p>
   <p>There is also P. O. Hansen, who translated the Bible of the Mormons into Danish. He came to Illinois in 1850.</p>

   <p>John Hansen is one of the very oldest of the Danish settlers in Chicago. He came here in the early forties.</p>
