   <p>A Swedish-Scandinavian recently gave a detailed idea on uniting the four Scandinavian countries into the United States of Scandinavia, with a separate national government for each country, but with a set up of one foreign ministry, one president for the Union, one revenue department, and one army.</p>
   <p>All issues that would come under the Union would be decided by the president and a combined parliament.</p>
   <p>The president would be elected for five years and would be one of the present kings; the parliament would be from a combined electorate of the parliaments of all the countries. In the event of not having a majority at the election, the oldest of the monarchs would automatically become president.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0711.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was also proposed that the flag of the Union be white, with the flags of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland in a square in the center of the white flag.</p>
   <p>This Swedish-Scandinavian believes that his idea will receive widespread support, and that the United States of Scandinavia will be born in time to sit in at the coming World Peace Congress.</p>
