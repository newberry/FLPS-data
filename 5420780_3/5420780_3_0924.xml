   <p>A self-made man if ever there was any is Dr. P. M. Nielsen. Working at farming in Denmark until 1912, and later in America at different places in the Middle West, he decided to become a Doctor and started to study in McPherson, Kansas.</p>
   <p>In February 1917 he enlisted in U.S. army and served as Hospital Sergeant with the A.E.F. at St. Mihiel. After armistice was declared he was transferred to the American Army of Occupation in Germany. Back from war, Dr. Nielsen took up study where he had left off at McPherson. In 1924 he came to Chicago and the Cook County Hospital.
