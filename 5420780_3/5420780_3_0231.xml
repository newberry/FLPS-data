   <p>The Danish Polar investigator was dined and wined in the "Red Star Inn," by the prominent Danish People of Chicago. Dr. Max Henius acted as toast-master and performed his duties very cleverly. The main speaker was Henry L. Hertz; he spoke for U.S.A., the country with so many possibilities. Carl Antonsen spoke for Denmark very beautifully. Captain Mikkelsen is a young man, only twenty-seven years old; he thanked every one for the wonderful welcome he was given in Chicago by his countrymen; he said that he visited President Roosevelt, and that the President promised him all the assistance he could give him, and so did several rich men of New York.</p>
   <p>The Captain will start from San Francisco in May. He has permission to fly the American Yacht-Flag.</p>
