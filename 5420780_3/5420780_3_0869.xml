   <p>George Dupont-Hansen was born in Chicago March 16, 1871. His father, a hardware merchant, was a native of Denmark, and had come to Chicago in 1867.</p>
   <p>While still very young, Mr. Dupont-Hansen went to Copenhagen, Denmark, to acquire a musical education. In his sixteenth year he became totally blind. In 1892 he returned to the United States, and became organist at the Danish Trinity Church, a position which he still occupies. He teaches piano, organ, and harmony. He has written many compositions, which have been sold in Europe and the United States.</p>
   <p>In 1925 he was knighted by the Danish king. He was married to Miss Johanne Nielsen in 1909.</p>
