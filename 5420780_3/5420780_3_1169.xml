   <p>Samuel Clausen, who does a wholesale and retail dairy business in the northwestern part of Chicago, was born in Denmark September 13, 1869. His parents, Lawrence and Cecilia (Madsen) Clausen, were also natives of Denmark and emigrated in 1872 to Hartford, Connecticut. Five years later they removed to Chicago, where the father conducted a milk business many years, selling his business and property to the son whose name heads this article in 1896. Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Clausen are now living, in well-earned retirement in North Evanston.</p>
   <p>Samuel Clausen was but two years old when he was carried by his parents across the Atlantic. He first attended school in Hartford, and after the removal of the family to Chicago spent some years in the common schools of that city. His adventurous spirit then led him to the prairies of northwestern Iowa, where he <pb facs="5420780_3_1170.jpg" n="2"/>assisted in herding cattle two years. He then returned to Chicago and during the next twelve months was employed by J.S. Ford, Johnson &amp; Company, Furniture dealers.</p>
   <p>By this time his father had embarked in the dairy business and was able to give the son employment. When the latter and reached the age of twenty years he was admitted as a partner, and this arrangement continued until 1893. In that year the sone entered the same line of business on his own account, and three years later, as has been before stated, bought out his father's business, and also his real estate. Samuel Clausen, is at present conducting a constantly increasing business, and not only supplies a large retail trade with milk and cream, but also sells at wholesale to other dealers. He has four wagons, one of which is used in handling the wholesale department of his business. Coming as he does from a country that is proud of its dairies. it is no wander that he takes pride <pb facs="5420780_3_1171.jpg" n="3"/>in procuring for his customers the purest and freshest of products; and in this he has been invariably successful, as is shown by his proving patronage among the best people of his portion of this city.</p>
   <p>In October, 1893, the subject of this sketch was married to Miss Alice Wallace, who was born in Pennsylvania and is a daughter of Robert and Isabel (Heatly) Wallace, both natives of Scotland. Mrs. Clausen came to Chicago in 1892. She and he husband are the parents of two sons, Lawrence N. and R. Wallace Clausen. Mr. Clausen is connected with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the National Union. He was president of the Chicago Milk Dealers Association three years, and is still a member of that organization.</p>
