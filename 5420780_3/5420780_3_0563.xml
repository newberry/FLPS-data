   <p>The Danish-American Youth Convention was visited by more than 500 delegates; the meetings had to be held in a big tent on the corner of Washtenaw and Potomac Ave. The meeting opened Saturday, Sept. 1, with a song written by Rev. Adam Dan and a short introductory talk by Rev. K. Gjorup. In the afternoon Ivar Kirkegaard from Racine spoke about the Danish-American movement, and Mr. Lauritzen spoke for both Denmark and America.</p>
   <p>During Sunday morning the delegates saw a little of the town. In the evening, between two and three thousand persons were gathered in the tent. There was singing by several Danish singing societies from Chicago, and a fine lecture about modern youth by Professor Nordentoft of the theological school in Des Moines. Ice cream was served by young Danish girls in Japanese dresses.</p>

   <p>The business meeting was held on Monday, with a view to re-organizing the Danish-American Association into one of national scope, so as to assist "new-comers" from Denmark in their adjustments to American manners and customs. The convention closed Monday night with a festival on an island in Humboldt Park with a speech by Rev. Nelleman of Manistee, Mich., and ice cream served by Danmarks Dotre og Dagmar Lodge.</p>
