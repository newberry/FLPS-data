   <p>P. Chr. Bronnum Petersen, L.D.S., jas become, entirely through his own efforts, one of the prominent and respected business men of the portion of Chicago where he is located, and has obtained success in many ways. He has made a name for himself among the residents of the Northwest Side and has secured the confidence of his patrons. He comes of a foreign country, having been born in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 13, 1865. He was the oldest of a family of two sons and one daughter and was educated in Kristensen's Borger og Realskole. He was graduated at the age of fourteen years and was then apprenticed to H.P.E. Nilsen, Colonialvare Forrething.</p>
   <p>After serving as apprentice two years with Mr. Nilsen, who was located at the corner of Gl. Kongevej and Bianco Lunos Allee, he changed to the employ of Carl Dehnfeldt, in the same business as Mr. Nilsen. He finished his apprenticeship in three years at the location of the corner of Lille Kongensgade and Halmstraede. He subsequently entered the service of C.W. Obel, wholesale <pb facs="5420780_3_1152.jpg" n="2"/>tobacco dealer, at Udsalg in Frederiksberggade, and was occupied one year as shipping clerk.</p>
   <p>November 5, 1885, he left Copenhagen for Liverpool, England, and two days later embarked for America on the ship "British King" of the American line, arriving in Philadelphia a short time after, on November 23. He proceeded to Chicago, reaching is destination November 25. Three weeks later he began as clerk in the service of Christian Rasmussen, editor of a Danish paper. In 1891 he decided to study dentistry and entered the Northwestern College of Dental Surgery, and two years later passed an examination of the State Board. He opened an office for business at No. 1751 Milwaukee Avenue, then Corner Hoffman Avenue, now Rockwell, and is now at No. 1730 on the same corner, where he has been located five years. He has been very successful and has realized many of the hopes and ambitions which prompted him to establish himself in the business world of the metropolis of the West.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petersen is also connected with the social world of the country of his <pb facs="5420780_3_1153.jpg" n="3"/>adoption and is a member of Denmark Lodge No. 118, Knights of Pythias, of which he is past chancellor, besides which he is identified with the Rathbone Sisters and is connected with Fullerton Council, Knights and Ladies of Security. He belongs to Ivanhoe Company, Uniform Rank, in the Knights of Pythias, of which he is treasurer.</p>
   <p>He is a self-made man in every sense of the word, and deserves credit for the fact that he showed the courage to enter a new, and to him, wholly unknown country, without much knowledge of its people or characteristics, and without friends. He has a fine practice that has been steadily increasing. He took out his naturalization paper in the Superior Court in December, 1893, and while he honors his mother country he is loyal to his adopted country, never forgetting that we owe our first allegiance to the country in which we make our home.</p>
