   <p>In an effort to contradict The Tribune's Copenhagen correspondent's review of the Danish-Norwegian Greenland dispute, H. Sundby-Hansen presented a lengthy historical treatise, but, unfortunately, chooses to omit a number of important and pertinent facts in the case.</p>
   <p>In fact, Norwegians discovered Greenland more than a thousand years ago. They started a settlement on the southwest coast of that vast continent which later became extinct. Renewed Greenland ventures in the Seventeenth Century originated fully as much in Denmark as in Norway. The Rev. Hans Egede did not forget the formality of first going to Denmark for the purpose of obtaining appointment from the king as a missionary, and after fifteen years of devoted labor among <pb facs="5420780_3_0647.jpg" n="2"/>the Eskimos, he returned and was rewarded the title of Bishop of Greenland, and became teacher at a newly erected Greenland seminary in Copenhagen.</p>
   <p>The entire administration of Greenland's affairs was then, as later on, centered in Copenhagen, and if at the treaty of Kiel, Greenland remained Danish territory just because of a diplomatic ruse, it is certainly a most peculiar fact that the Norwegian Storthing seven years later, in 1821, renounced every claim upon Denmark pertaining to the dissolution of the unions. By later treaty and a declaration of 1856, Norway recognized the Danish trading monopoly absolutely without reservation. Several treaties between Denmark and other countries involve the same recognition. The United States, when taking the Virgin Islands in 1916, expressly sanctioned Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland, and England, France, Sweden, and other powers have done likewise.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0648.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Really, hardly any Norwegian had any idea of disputing Danish sovereignty over Greenland until twelve years ago when Danish authorities found it necessary to intercede against Norwegian sealers, whose reckless methods threatened the very existence of seals not only on the east coast, but also, as the seals are migratory, on the west coast of Greenland. Subsequently, in 1924, a treaty regulating sealing, fishing, and hunting was concluded between Denmark and Norway, it being tacitly understood that the sovereignty situation would remain unchanged until the expiration of this treaty in 1944.</p>
   <p>Then suddenly in 1930, the Norwegian government conferred a police mandate over its subjects in east Greenland upon the leader of a fishing expedition. The Danish Government immediately protested against this provocative step, and while this matter was still pending last summer, some Norwegian sealers raised the Norwegian flag near Mackenzie Bay and declared the territory occupied. This <pb facs="5420780_3_0649.jpg" n="4"/>trespassing being officially sanctioned by Norway, the Danish Government having for years in theory and practice devoted itself to internationalism, pacifism, and disarmament had no other recourse than to bring action against the brother country before the World Court at The Hague.</p>
