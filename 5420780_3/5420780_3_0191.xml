   <p>The society Dania observed the 50th anniversary of its founding with a banquet and ball last Sunday in its new building, which is now completely decorated and furnished.</p>
   <p>At 6 P.M. the doors of the large dining room swung open, and the guests marched in to the music of Michelsen's orchestra. The horseshoe-table was set for some 250 people, and the dinner which consisted of soup, boiled salmon, and roast turkey, with numerous accessories, was a beautiful and delicious demonstration of chef Andersen's culinary art, and was expertly served by an able staff of waiters. The fact that no butter and cheese appeared on the table, and that no after-dinner cigars were passed around caused some criticism, but it was not made known who was responsible for this somewhat unfortunate oversight.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0192.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Carl Nielsen was toast-master, and handled his job skilfully. Numerous speeches were delivered, for Dania and for America and Denmark, for Dannebrog and the Stars and Stripes, for the ladies, etc., and congratulatory messages from absent members and friends of the society were read.</p>
   <p>After the banquet, the floor was cleared for dancing, and Dania's knights and their ladies made merry until long after midnight. When the gay affair finally broke up, everybody was satisfied that the society's 50th anniversary had been properly observed, and its new home properly dedicated.</p>
