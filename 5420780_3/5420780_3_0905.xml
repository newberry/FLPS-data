   <p>The growth from a first day's sales of four dollars to an annual volume of $62,000,000 in the course of 36 years is one of the great American advantages, and applies to the National Tea Company. When National Tea opened its first store on December 9, 1899, its first day's receipts were four dollars, while the sales in 1935 were almost $62,000,000.</p>
   <p>Recently the firm's founder, Mr. George Rasmussen, was paid a special tribute by the more than 6,000 men and women operating over 1,200 National Tea Company food stores in eight middlewestern states, and in this connection it is interesting to view Mr. Rasmussen's phenomenal climb in the business world.</p>

   <p>Mr. George Rasmussen, who was born in Denmark, was the second oldest son in a family of six boys. Possessing to an extraordinary degree from early youth the traits of great energy and unswerving determination, it is little wonder that he should seek opportunity where he could find it. He had the blood of a true pioneer. He could have remained at home in comfort and security, but he preferred to brave the dangers of a new land. This characteristic courage and decisive action was to stand him in good stead later on.</p>
