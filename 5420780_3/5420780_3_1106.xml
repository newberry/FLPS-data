   <p>Mogens A. Sommer is dead. He was a preacher, Socialist agitator, and journalist. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than seventy times. Although he hated the Lutheran State Church and all ministers, he was very religious, a fact which was not so well liked by the old Socialist leaders, who were all atheists.</p>
   <p>After the arrest of the leaders in Denmark in 1872, Mr. Sommer, who was then in Chicago, wrote letters to Pio in order that he might be incriminated when the letters were opened by the police. That his plan was unsuccessful was not the fault of Mr. Sommer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sommer also hated the Danish King. He was the one who wrote the articles in Den Danske Pioneer, of Omaha, Nebraska, which fiercely attacked <pb facs="5420780_3_1107.jpg" n="2"/>the King of Denmark, with the result that the Pioneer was banned from Denmark for several years.</p>
   <p>For more than forty years Mr. Sommer travelled all over the United States, going wherever there was a chance to speak to Danes. His last years were spent in Chicago, where he practiced as a homeopathic doctor and druggist.</p>
   <p>In 1893 he wrote a book about his work and life in Chicago. The book is now very scarce.</p>
