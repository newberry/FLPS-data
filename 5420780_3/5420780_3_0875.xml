   <p>Walter Ingstrup was born in 1882, in Viborg, Denmark. He came to the United States September 1, 1906. The first few years he was here he worked as a painter, until he learned English. In 1884 (sic) he started in business for himself as an interior decorator, and was very successful.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ingstrup decorated the Medinah Athletic Club, a one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar job. He has done most of the decorating for Balaban and Katz, and has decorated many churches.</p>
   <p>The Ingstrups live in a beautiful fifty-thousand-dollar home at 1522 Forest Avenue, River Forest. Mrs. Ingstrup is also Danish. They have three sons, all of whom work in the business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ingstrup has done some very clever marine paintings. He is a thirty-second degree Mason. He became a citizen in 1912.</p>
