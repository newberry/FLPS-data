   <p>Upon receipt of Revyen's No. 20, I take pleasure in mailing you a copy of Proletars about which you wrote in your paper. In the fall I will have another book ready for publishing in which Danish-Americans views of life will also be represented.</p>
   <p>It is my belief that the new ideals peculiar to America will tend to dominate Danish literature in the future because they are expressed in naturalism and dignity of labor through close contact with material things and actual facts, all of which is somewhat strange to the old countries as yet. I repeat that these ideals will influence the trend in literature of the future, in fact I believe it will dominate modern literature completely, because when writers once turn their attention to realistic subjects they will discover a greater field of sources than we have ever known.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0796.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is with pleasure I take the opportunity to express myself on this subject, particularly at this time, when so much is being said and written about strengthening the relationship between Danes at home and Danes abroad. At such a time, we should not be overlooking the fact that Denmark is likely to profit most through her relationship with Danish-Americans.</p>
   <p>What have we in Denmark that is of actual value for Danes abroad? Some historical memories and brotherly love which do not cease to exist in the old homes, even as time passes. And of course, those who left Denmark will never completely forget the old home; but their present surroundings and circumstances, under which they live, do not allow them to be sentimental. They have become realists to their fingers' ends. They know what the world is worth in the practical sense of the word, and <pb facs="5420780_3_0797.jpg" n="3"/>are ready at any time to meet the physical challenge peculiar to their time for they know what rewards they can expect. They are absorbed in work, in efforts to develop the possibilities which perhaps were denied them altogether in the Old Country. Perchance, there are quite a few Danish-Americans who have not the very best of reasons to nurse kind feelings towards Denmark, but Denmark is after all their native country.</p>
   <p>I only wish to call your attention to the fact that Dehmark, the prosperous little country of the North, which most certainly also allows a lot of pettiness and prejudices to exist, and where it is still far from easy even for ambitious persons to make headway - this little country, I repeat, has a lot to learn from Danish-Americans pertaining to initiative, practical sense and concerted action as unfolded in adherence to <pb facs="5420780_3_0798.jpg" n="4"/>Democratic principles.</p>
   <p>Our contact with Danish-Americans makes us feel the refreshing breath of a new culture, a culture of the future fraught with the roar of machinery, combined with a hymn of labor, which animates and inspires, and coming to us from a land far, far away. It is the land to which our brethen emigrated, those of us who, on account of their ambition and love for freedom, refused to be set aside and humiliated in the Old Country but whose insatiable desire for independence caused them to leave and make good in America</p>
   <p>With kind regards</p>
   <p>Christian Bundgaard.</p>
