  <body>
   <p>At a meeting held by the members of the Danish People's Society at the residence of Johannes Jakobsen on June 2, 1889, the Danish Youth Society was organized with seven charter members.</p>
   <p>The organizers had all been active in the folk-college movement in Denmark, and so they were interested in extending Danish culture here in America.</p>
   <p>At the first meeting of the Society the following were elected to the board of directors: Rasmus Hansen, chairman, Chresten Chrestensen, vice-chairman, S. N. Nielsen, treasurer, and Hans Jensen, secretary.</p>
   <p>The first meeting place of the society was 63 West Huron Street.</p>
   <p>At a meeting on September 18, it was decided to publish a youths' paper, Alvor G. Gammen [In Jest and in Earnest]. Hans Jensen and Hanna Christensen <pb facs="5420780_3_0549.jpg" n="2"/>were the editors. On November 20, it was decided to contribute ten dollars to young Danish men and women who wished to attend college. On January 15, 1890, it was resolved to organize a Danish college here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the early part of 1891, a sick benefit group was organized.</p>
