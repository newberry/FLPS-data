   <p>Peter Lawrence, a well-known citizen of the northwestern part of Chicago, was born in Denmark August 2, 1845. He secured his education in the seaport town of Copenhagen and being brought into contact with many who either followed the sea or gained their living by ocean trade, he began to look forward to a sailor's life at an early age. When but fifteen years old he became cabin boy on a Danish vessel which carried him to England, where he changed to an American ship bound for New York. He continued on the sea until he reached the age of twenty-five years, and by strict attention to his work, coupled with a desire to excel, he rose to the rank of mate.</p>
   <p>In 1870 he resolved to suit a sea faring life and having a natural liking for machinery, he apprenticed himself to learn the machinist's trade. He applied himself faithfully to the business for a period of three and one-half <pb facs="5420780_3_1182.jpg" n="2"/> years, and became very efficient in this line of work, and decided to make the machinery of hat factories his specialty. He worked in various like establishments in New York City ten years.</p>
   <p>In 1884 he removed to Chicago, where he secured employment in the hat factory of A. A. Turner, where he remained until 1895. Mr. Lawrence became one of the most skillful men in his line of work and was able, by due care, to accumulate quite a capital from his earnings. He therefore concluded to enter business on his own account, where his ability in that direction could have greater scope. With this end in view he opened a liquor store in 1895, and has continued the enterprise since. The venture has proved satisfactory from a financial point of view and has considerably bettered his fortune. He conducts a neat and business-like establishment and enjoys the patronage of the best people of his locality.</p>

   <p>While residing in New York, in 1872, the subject of this notice was married to Anna Jane Lucy, who was born in Ireland and came to New York at the age of fifteen years. They have been the parents of six children, only two of whom are living: Peter, Junior, and Agnes. The latter is the wife of Ezra Gedultig, of No. 558 North Hoyne Avenue, Chicago. Mr. Lawrence is a member of the Knights of Honor. In politics he uses his vote and influence in support of the Republican party.</p>
