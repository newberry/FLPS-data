   <p>If Frederick VII had come out of his sepulcher yesterday and looked in on Jackson Park he would have had no occasion to regret his act of June 5, 1849, when, in obedience to the request of his people, he yielded and gave to them the liberal government which to this day prevails in Denmark. It was a bloodless revolution, but it marked the beginning of an era in that kingdom which has continued to be one of peace and prosperity. The date is the natal day of Denmark, and it was observed by the Danes of Chicago yesterday at the World's Fair. The ceremonies were held in Festival Hall. President C. Michelsen made a speech of welcome in the language of his country.</p>
   <p>"There is a Land," was sung by the Harmonien and Hejmdal singing societies, after which Commissioner General Emil Meyer delivered an address in his native language on "The King of Denmark and the President of the United States."</p>
   <p>The Danish national song, "King Christian Stood by the Lofty Mast," and The Star Spangled Banner" were sung by the audience.</p>

   <p>The Rev. G.L. Grundtvig spoke on Denmark, and Mrs. Christine Nielson Drier, wife of the Danish Consul in this city, sang "The Mother Tongue", by Oehlenschlager, the national poet of Denmark.</p>
   <p>Dr. Max Henius delivered an address on the Danes in the United States. Prof. August Hyllested rendered several piano solos, after which Col. August Jacobson made the closing address in English, in which he said it seemed to him that he was standing so near Denmark that he could almost hear the song of the nightingale and lark "in the land where it is sweet to live and sad to die." The orchestra played "The Vikings" and that closed the proceedings in Festival Hall.</p>
