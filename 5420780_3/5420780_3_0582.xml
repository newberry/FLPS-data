   <p>The immigration of Danes to the United States reaches into the remote past. - At the present time there are about 15,000 living in Chicago, not including their families.</p>
   <p>The Danish Consul E. Dreier, arrived in Chicago in 1854, at the age of 21, and he can give some very interesting information about the good old times, Up to that time only twenty Danes had settled here. One of them was P. Hansen, who later became a United States consul to Elsinore. At one time was the Health-Commissioner of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0583.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Another Dane was H. A. Miller. He made the first soda beverages in Chicago, and later established a syrup factory. One of his employees was the previously mentioned Dreier. Mr. Dreier started later a drug store. He retired from this business only recently. He expressed the view point of all Danes. He said they have improved their conditions materially, compared with their old fatherland, and that therefore immigration has been steadily increasing during recent years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dreier was also a member of the Chicago School-Board, and of the Park-Board of the West Side......One can hardly speak of Danish colonies or settlements, because they are "mixed" with Swedes and Norwegians. We find Danes in the vicinity of Wicker Park, Humboldt Park, between Division Street and North Avenue, and elsewhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0584.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The majority of the Danes are Lutherans. They have many beautiful churches and large congregations.</p>
   <p>The club "Dania" is their largest social organization, and has 400 members.The members are interested not only in music and social activities, but they also carry out a mutual benefit plan......</p>
   <p>Scandia Hall, 96 West Ohio Street, is likewise a meeting place for Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians. This excellent building was finished a year ago, and dedicated to this purpose. Besides general entertainment, theatre performances in Danish and Swedish are rendered here. The Danes take a lively interest in drama......</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0585.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Danish women living in the neighborhood of Wicker Park have recently organized a new Charity Association which has succeeded brilliantly and deserves general recognition of its merits.</p>
   <p>Two Danish news-papers are published in Chicago, the Norden, a weekly, and Scandinavia, a daily.</p>
   <p>The Danes are active in politics. In former years most of the voters were Republicans, but of late they have turned toward the Democratic camp.</p>
   <p>One of the oldest buildings in Chicago, the hotel Dannevirke, was built by a <pb facs="5420780_3_0586.jpg" n="5"/>Dane and is the property of C. Hansen.....The members of the bank, Peterson &amp; Rax, are likewise Danes, and J. Skallerup, the County-Commissioner, and O. Hansen, West-Town Collector belong to the same nationality.</p>
   <p>John P. Hansen is one of the richest of the Danish business men. He manages a large tobacco business on Milwaukee Avenue, and is also one of the Directors of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank. W. Hansen is a large real-estate operator and specializes in the sale of large farms..............</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Henius, partner of the firm, Wahl &amp; Henius, has founded a chemical factory, and organized a brewing academy, which are outstanding from a scientific <pb facs="5420780_3_0587.jpg" n="6"/>standpoint.</p>
   <p>Famous among the population of the Danish Nationality is the great pianist, A. Hyllested. He is perhaps the most skilled piano-player, in this city.</p>
   <p>The musician, J. R. Hald, who is also a critic of music for a number of English news-papers, has achieved considerable fame as a composer.....The land of Thorwaldsen's birth has given us two eminent sculptors, J. Selbert and C. Rohl-Smith. The Danish artist C. Paulsen is also well known among the lovers of art.....</p>
