   <p>Statistics show that there are about 30,000 Americans of Danish birth in the State of Illinois. Immigration began as far back as about 1840, centered about Chicago and spread from there northward as far as Kenosha, Wisconsin, and southward to Dwight.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, the Danish immigrants settled largely on the West Side, where they established themselves in distinct groups. Many engaged in business and succeeded well. Wherever they settled, the older generation rapidly established homes, churches, lodges and schools, and many clung tenaciously to their mother-tongue and their traditions until, as they became familiar with American ways, some of their secular interests were absorbed by, and dissolved in, our national spirit. But their memories generally are very long.</p>
   <p>One Danish immigrant rose to the post of State Treasurer; another grew famous as one of the States' most distinguished distributors of food stuffs.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0590.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The younger generation (after 1880) also number many citizens of distinction as bankers, physicians, teachers, manufacturers, and men of affairs. Three became famous as musicians and composers. At least two were members of the State legislature. Several served in the city and village governments.</p>
   <p>Our contingent of Danish origin brought to our State an innate honesty and intergrity, coupled with a will to work hard for their homestead on principles which had stood the tests of centuries. This tradition showed itself in the fondness of the Danish immigrant for his native ways, foods, speech, and diversions. Some notable choirs, active for upward of a half-century or longer, still cultivate old home songs. For many years, each Danish settlement celebrated June 5, the anniversary of the Danish constitution, as a day of celebration, but in later times the tendency has been to transfer these festivals to July 4.</p>
   <p>Like other groups of foreign origin, the Danes in Illinois developed from the Sisties a literature of their own, founded on American impressions <pb facs="5420780_3_0591.jpg" n="3"/>of life and nature or embodying old memories. Poetry flourished in the earlier Danish-American press and in a number of books. Hymns and their attendant sacred music continued to cheer and animate many men and women. From about 1880 there also grew up some considerable dramatic activity, which still continues in sports, dependent on personal initiative.</p>
   <p>The Dane is fond of arts and craft, gymnastics, athletics, folk-dances, and other constructive diversion. Danish artisans were much in demand until the advent of the machine age. Much artistic decoration of our older mansions in and about Chicago was done by Danish skill. Danish servants always were, and still are, at a premium.</p>
   <p>But the greatest contribution of the Danish immigrants, in Illinois and elsewhere, lies in their genius for homebuilding and the development of sound units of farming. Acting under the time-honored demand that every farm should be left in a better state of cultivation that it was received, the Danish farmer contingent has set a praiseworthy example for all time. Wherever a large and commodious barn building is found in conjunction with <pb facs="5420780_3_0592.jpg" n="4"/>a modest dwelling, it is a safe guess that a Dane made the beginning.</p>
   <p>A grandson of one of the early Danish pastors in Illinois was chosen for the distinguished office of editing the great history of the United States of Henry Adams.</p>
   <p>An immigrant of the first generation is largely responsible for the initial development of our park system and many private estates.</p>
   <p>Another American of Danish birth, who came to Illinois fifty years ago, founded the only American national park in a foreign country--in Denmark--dedicated to the honor of our hospitable country of adoption.</p>
