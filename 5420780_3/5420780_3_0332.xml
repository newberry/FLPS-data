   <p>p.1.col.7........The celebration of the 60th anniversary of Denmarks"Constitution Day" Sunday June 6, exceeded the hopes of even the optimistic and overworked committee. The weather was ideal and brought out-of-town visitors galore. Before 9:00 A.M. several hundred had gathered at the hall of D.B.S. #17; a group from Racine, Wis., mustering two-hundred enthusiastic celebrants.</p>
   <p>That this was a real Danish-American celebration could readily be seen, by the thousands of Danish and American flags on display throughout Chicago. The intense work and its far-reaching influence is self-evident since it even brought delegations from Racine, Kenosha, Waupaca, and Stoughton, Wis., Woodstock, St. Charles and Dwight, Ill. Davenport, Iowa, and Lincoln Nebraska, too were represented by prominent Danes.</p>
   <p>Over seven-hundred out-ot-town visitors were given official badges and printed programs,while the Refreshment Committee out-did the proverbial in serving lunch <pb facs="5420780_3_0333.jpg" n="2"/>to all who entered #17's Hall preceding the parade to Riverview Park. The picnic grove of the park was properly decorated for the occasion. Special banners had been placed indicating space reserved for each organization attending in a body as well as for family groups. The entire Hans Nielsens Orchestra was gathered in the Band Stand and an almost continuous program of music made its soothing way to the outer-most corners of the big park. The check-up on the attendance showed that the record of ten years ago had been more than attained. This year recorded 7000 paid adult admissions, plus free admissions including hundreds of children and guests of honor. A conservative estimate places the total attendance at over 10,000. Among the honored guests of the day was the aged Peter Balle who as a boy of seventeen rode with the cavalcade that demanded and received from Frederick VII, constitutional freedom.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon a program of music, singing, speaking and gymnastic displays was offered to an appreciative throng. Gov. Deneen spoke feelingly of the contributions of the Danish-American group to the cultural and economical life throughout <pb facs="5420780_3_0334.jpg" n="3"/>state and country. In addition to the speakers platform, there were grand stands for the singers. Especially pleasing was the sight and sound of a choir of eighty girls in white with red sashes occupying the stand at one side ,while a combined chorus of Danish singing societies filled the opposite stand.</p>
   <p>A resolution, suggested by the M.C. Mr. Henry L. Herst, to be sent to the Aarhus administration was adopted and the following cablegram dispatched.: - Premier Neergaard, Copenhagen, "Ten thousand Danish-Americans are assembled at a Chicago-Danish national festival to commemorate June 5th and send most cordial greetings to Denmark."</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Col. Neble, editor of Omaha ,Nebraska, and George Beck ,Danish Consul. The speeches were followed by an interesting program of athletic competition and exhibitions and dancing in the pavilion to music by the Hans Nielsen Orchestra.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0335.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In the evening the Park Casino, was the scene of the annual banquet. Every possible seat in the huge dining hall was taken, for there were more than 650 banqueters. Toasts and speeches were the order of the evening. The speakers were Mr. Hertz, Carl Antonsen, Niels Juul, Col. Neble, Jas. Skallerup. The banquet and service arranged by the management of Riverview left a great deal to be desired as neither the food nor efficiency in serving were of Danish quality and efficiency. Criticism, plentiful and sharp, was therefore handed out in no uncertain terms. Even the music, secured by the Park management, was lacking in life and color.</p>
   <p>The traditional supper after the dance did not materialize due to the exhausted condition of the weatherman, who by this time could no longer keep back the rain and the throng started for home after a strenuous day that will live always in the memories of all attended.</p>
