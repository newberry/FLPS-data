  <body>
   <p>At its last meeting, the board of trustees of the Chicago Public Library went on record with a resolution which is particularly pleasing to us Danes, expressing as it does an unusual appreciation of a countryman's valuable contribution to the city's cultural progress.</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of Frank T. O'Connell, the board resolved to constitute itself as a committee and, in a body, petition Mayor Harrison that he reappoint its present vice-president, Dr. Max Henius, whose 3-year term expires next July, when he will be absent from the city on a trip to Denmark.</p>
   <p>At a festive gathering the same night, his colleagues presented the doctor with a silver cup, as an expression of their gratitude for his able work on the board. On this occasion the librarians J. C. Bay, of the John Crerar Library, Carlton of the Newberry, and Legler and Rode of the Public Library were present, in addition to the board members, <pb facs="5420780_3_1050.jpg" n="2"/>and several speakers, in very complimentary terms, expressed the hope that Dr. Henius on his return, may again take his place on the board, for the benefit of the Chicago Public Library and its patrons.</p>
