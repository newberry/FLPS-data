   <p>Late last Wednesday afternoon, a rumor spread that there had been a suicide and a murder at the Danish Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>A reporter from the Revyen rushed out to the Home. When he arrived the former manager was already present, he gave our reporter the following story:</p>
   <p>"A little past 3 P. M. I was called on the telephone and was requested by one of the maids to come to the Home. According to her story, the manager Mr. Christian Nielsen, who had been absent for several days because of <pb facs="5420780_3_0071.jpg" n="2"/>marital troubles, returned about 1 P. M. Wednesday. He seemed to have forgotten the trouble he had had. It was just after the prayer meeting held by The Reverend Blichfeldt and the inmates had eaten their dinner when one of the maids heard yells and pistol shots in the living quarters of the Nielsens'.</p>
   <p>"The maid then rushed in Nielsen's apartment and found Mrs. Nielsen on the bed, dead, with five bullet holes in her abdomen.</p>
   <p>"After the arrival of the police, a search was made for Nielsen, and he was finally found in the basement hanging from a steam pipe.</p>
   <p>"It was discovered by the police that Niesen shot his wife and killed <pb facs="5420780_3_0072.jpg" n="3"/>himself because he believed that his wife was in love with the house doctor, Dr. W. K. York.</p>
   <p>"They will both be buried at 1 P. M., Sunday, in Mount Olive Cemetery."</p>
