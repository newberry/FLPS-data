   <p>The Danish language was for many years used exclusively in the Ebenezer Danish Church, but about 1910 the first English class was organized. Since then the English language has been used more and more and in the last two or three years, the Sunday School has had only one Danish class. The fact is that approximately 80% of the Sunday School pupils are from the community, which is not Scandinavian as was the case thirty or forty years ago.</p>
   <p>The present enrollment (1936) is of more than 200 children and young people, with 20 Sunday School teachers. Mr. Carl Nielsen has served in the Sunday School for 33 years; one of his former pupils is now a pastor, the Rev. Edwin Petrusson of Kankakee, Ill. Another pupil, Mr. Herman Sorensen is now preparing for missionary work in Sudan, Africa.</p>
   <p>At the annual Christmas festival of the Sunday school it is customary to take up a collection for the Indian Mission at Oaks, Oklahoma.</p>
