   <p>The new Danish Trinitatis Church was dedicated Sunday, December 16. It is located on the corner of Cortez Street and Francisco Avenue. It has a seating capacity of five hundred. At the dedication six hundred were present. The architect is Mr. C. F. Sorensen, and the contractor, Mr. S. N. Nielsen, who is also the president of the Church Board. The Church has cost about twenty-six thousand dollars, of which about half has been paid. The dedication was performed by Reverend Kjolhede of Racine, assisted by the Reverends Dan Rordan and Gjerup of Chicago, Nordentoft of Grand View College, Iowa, and Rasmussen of Sheffield, Illinois.</p>
   <p>At one o'clock a dinner was served for five hundred in the basement. In the afternoon a sermon was given by Reverend Adam Dan and a children's choir sang. In the evening there was a Communion service, at which the sermon was presented by Reverend Nordentoft. The pastor of the Church is Reverend Rordam.</p>
