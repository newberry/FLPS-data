   <p>In 1899 he opened a paint store at 4648 Calumet Ave. and started contracting, his ever growing paint-store business demanding all his time and energy.</p>
   <p>Three years ago he moved his business to new and larger quarters at 4645-47 South Parkway, where he now operates one of the most complete stores, with paint, wallpaper, glass, window shades and artists materials, in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bunck can this year celebrate his 40th anniversary as a useful and unselfish worker for the best interest of the Danish colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the Danish Brotherhood Lodge No. 35 he has served in all offices from outer guard to President and delegate to the convention in Fresno 1910.</p>
