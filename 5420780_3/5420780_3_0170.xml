   <p>Some of the most interesting individuals, in later years, were the exiled [from Denmark] Socialist and Social Democratic leaders, Pio. Geleff, Kristian Baun, and William Hansen. The veterans of the German-Danish war of 1864 were Henry L. Hertz, Fritz Frantzen, and Solberg. We must also mention the writer Norman Hansen, the poet Carl Hansen (the "Old Eagle"), Dr. Max Henius, and Sophus F. Neble.</p>
   <p>Of organizations we mention Dania, the oldest, Valhalla, the second oldest, and the largest [of all], "Dansk Arbeider Sangforening" (Danish Workers' Singing Society).</p>
   <p>Of regular singing societies we mention "Harmonien," organized in 1886. The Danish Workers' Singing Society was organized in 1897. There are also the Illinois Ladies' Singing Society, the "Hejmdal," "Magneten," the Hartman Syric Club, and the youngest society, the "Hamlet".</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0171.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The reading society "Tyluten" should be mentioned. Of athletic societies we must mention the Danish-American Athletic Club, in which Karl Sorensen has been instructor for many years.</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting societies is, without a doubt, the Danish Old Settlers' Club. To become a member of this organization you must first of all have lived in Chicago at least thirty-five years, and you must be able to speak Danish.</p>
   <p>The Danish National Committee was organized in 1905. The Danish Aid and Relief Society is a welfare organization.</p>
