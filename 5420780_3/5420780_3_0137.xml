   <p>There are five kinds of Danes in America, the Danish Danes, the Danish-Americans, the cosmopolitans, the monkeys, and the common mortals.</p>
   <p>The Danish Danes always wear a pin of a Danish society in their buttonhole; the Danish colors are on the wall of their homes and also a picture of King Christian IX or Frederik VII. Most of them also have a picture of both Peter Noer and Viggo Danielson in full regalia. Over the lady's writing table you will generally find a picture of the Danish Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>The Danish Americans are the politicians or would-be-politicians. They are well dressed and wear glasses; their homes are without style. And they never <pb facs="5420780_3_0138.jpg" n="2"/>read Danish papers except during election time.</p>
   <p>The cosmopolitans are made up of both rich and poor; they are very critical, but do not like to be criticised themselves. At present, they read a great many modern Danish books instead of Kipling, but it is only a question of time when it will be the other way around. They read Danish papers edited in Denmark and in the United States. All our prominent Jews belong to this group.</p>
   <p>The monkeys consist of the spiritual lower class with higher aspirations. They want to play in our comedies, to speak at our festivals, and to write songs on all occasions. They often forget to finish the sentence they speak or write. They never read anything but Danish written by themselves, which does not enlighten them very much.</p>
   <p>The common mortals are the writer and the gentle reader, who want to be left alone and to live their own lives.</p>
