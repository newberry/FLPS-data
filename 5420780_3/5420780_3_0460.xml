   <p>This church was formed by the union of two Danish church societies. At a meeting in Argo, Burt County, Nebraska, in September, 1884 some ministers formed Det Danske Evangelisk Lutherske Kirkesamfund (the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Society); they had left Den Norsk-Danske Evangalisk-Lutherske Konference (The Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Conference) at a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, 1884.</p>
   <p>In 1893, there was another split within the Danish Church (Det Danske Evangelisk Lutherske Kirke in Amerika), which led to the formation of what later was called The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of North America or the North Church, as it sometimes was called. At first this church had nineteen ministers and two missionaries.</p>

   <p>At a meeting in Minneapolis in October, 1896, the North Church and Det Danske Evangelisk Lutherske Kirkesamfund united and thus began the existence of Den Forenede Danske Evangelisk-Lutherske Kirkesamfund i Amerika (The United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America) or The United Church.</p>
   <p>Originally this church had sixty-three ministers, eight missionaries, one hundred twenty-seven congregations and thirty-three mission churches. It now has one hundred twenty-seven ministers, three candidates, four missionaries, and one hundred seventy-nine congregations and mission churches.</p>
   <p>The United Church has an American Indian mission, and another in Japan, and a mission in Utah. A seamen's mission in San Francisco and an emigration mission in New York and Boston and also maintained.</p>
   <p>The center of the Church is Blair, Nebraska, where Trinitatis Seminary, Dana College, and the Danish Lutheran Publishing House are located.</p>
