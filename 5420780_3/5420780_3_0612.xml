<title level="a">WHAT KIND OF EMIGRANTS DID AMERICA RECEIVE LAST YEAR FROM SCANDINAVIA!</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>We have before us the Annual Report of the Bureau of Emigration for 1924. It is a large book full of statistical tables and calculations. The first impression one receives from the book is that it is very dry and tiring, but upon analyzing and comparing the different tables, much valuable information and interpretation is received into everything concerning immigration. Of particular interest are the tables showing the emigrants' vocation, profession and trade; as well as the tables showing when these people settled down. The following is a resume of what was found.</p>
   <p>The first table shows in what professions the Scandinavian immigrants are to be found. We are unable to show figures for each of the Scandinavian countries, as the Bureau of Emigration places Danes, Norwegian and Swedes under one heading -"Scandinavians."</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0613.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The grand total of Scandinavian immigrants is 40,978 or 5.8% of the total immigration from all countries, 706,896.</p>
   <p>Of the 41,000 Scandinavian immigrants, 2,014 had scholastic education, 11,684 were tradesmen and professional men, such as bakers, timber-construction workers, etc.; 16,984 were farmers, agricultural workers and laborers, domestics, etc.; 10,296 had no occupation. This last figure includes minors, wives and all others who did not work for wages.</p>
   <p>The most surprising of the above figures is the low percentage of Scandinavians listed under "no occupation". They amount to less than 25% of the Scandinavian emigrant, while the average for all other emigrant-groups is 40%. No other race or nationality has as low a percentage. For the British emigrants the figure is 47%, Germans 37%, Jews 53%, Italians 32%, Poles 47%, The Finns are next to the Scandinavians with 29%.</p>
   <p>As the number of the non-vocational Scandinavians is so low, it follows that the number of "vocationals" are proportionately much higher than other nationalities. As an example we will consider emigrants with university or technical <pb facs="5420780_3_0614.jpg" n="3"/>school education, of which 2,014 were admitted to the United States. This is over 8% of the total Scandinavian emigrants. The number of emigrants with higher education from all other countries is 24,778. As the Scandinavian emigration amounts to only 5.8% of the total U.S. emigration, it shows that the Scandinavian countries have sent us over 24% more people of higher education than all other nations. More than half of the Scandinavians of this group are either civil or electrical engineers, - 692 and 573 respectively. This is 15% of the emigrants of this kind, which proves that the Scandinavian countries, in proportion to the number of emigrants, have given the United States three times as many engineers as other countries.</p>
   <p>Of other Scandinavian emigrants arriving here during 1924 and belonging to the latter group are thirty-three architects, fifty-one scientists, librarians and ninety-eight teachers.</p>
   <p>Next in line are professionals - emigrants which the Scandinavian countries have equipped with a thorough knowledge of some useful trade. Here we find the following:</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0615.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Heavy" carpenters, 196 (40% of all other countries immigrants of this profession); seamen, 1914 (22%); carpenters, 2090 (13%); office people, 2039 (8%). Among other trades well represented in 1924 were: blacksmiths, 378; machinists, 204; machine-workers, 392; mechanics, 456; painters, 385; tailors and seamstresses, 225; stone-workers, 150; and cabinetmakers, 74.</p>
   <p>In the third group comprising labor we find (Farm laborers, 4502 (17%); domestics, 5134 (10%); fishermen, 586 (19%); common laborers, 3201; store clerks, 287; chauffeurs, 287; and 1410 farmers.</p>
   <p>As mentioned before, the annual report of the Bureau of Emigration also shows where all these people migrate. This statement is erroneous, as we all know that the great majority will move about the country looking for places offering the best living conditions as well as the best monetary inducements. We find that 10,265 remained in New York, 6598 traveled to relatives and friends in Illinois, 3737 went to Massachusetts, 2021 to California, 1629 to New Jersey, 1626 to Michigan, 1132 to Wisconsin, 1121 to Pennsylvania. At the end of the list we find New Mexico with 4, South Carolina 5, Tennessee, 7, Arkansas 7 and Kentucky 8. Every state in the Union received emigrants from the Scandinavian countries during 1924.</p>
