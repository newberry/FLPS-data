   <p>I should laugh at the utter foolishness of the book, The Rebild Wrong Side, were it not for the fact that in its insane misrepresentation, it spreads muck over all that is fine and good in human character. The author of this book besmears the hear [culture] of Denmark with foul insinuations of repudiation by those who left Denmark yet they have won the name of good citizens elsewhere by living the culture of the Danish people. It drags the good name of all the Danish-Americans through a mire of selfishness, and tries to efface every vestige of their sense of obligation and love to and for their mother country, and would have every thought and act which are of those feelings promote nothing but designs for selfish gains. It pictures the conditions of Danish-Americans as a Dante's Inferno, where each feeds on another, and squalor and misery is just <pb facs="5420780_3_0644.jpg" n="2"/>desert for heartless intercourse. What an existence the writer must have experienced while here. No friends, no love or loyalty for this or for his mother country, or for his fellow men.</p>
   <p>Rebild Park was bought and presented to the Danish Government by Danish-Americans as a token of love. Love for the two countries, love for the heather of Jutland, and love between the hearts here and there. The archive of Sohngaardsholm, and the blockhouse at Rebild, were conceived in the same spirit for the education and interest of future generations. It is difficult to understand where selfishness enters into these achievements, which have cost such great sums and countless days of planning by persons having not even seen their name in print in this connection.</p>
   <p>Of all muckrakers, he who stirs up only to destroy beauty, is the most contemptible; of all critics, he who criticises for the joy of destroying is the most detested; but he who commits perjury at the behest of another <pb facs="5420780_3_0645.jpg" n="3"/>is beyond all decency.</p>
   <p>Sometimes one can overdo--and that has been done in that filthy pamphlet. Its utter disregard of truth, its misstatements, and its insane rambling tirades will be a selfdug grave wherein it and its author will be engulfed, there to fume and fuss in helpless fury--and Rebild Park shall stand forever as that which it is--a place where thoughts meet in understanding and harmony.</p>
