   <p>Statistics show that there are some thirty thousand Americans (this figure includes only citizens) of Danish birth in the State of Illinois. Immigration began as far back as 1840, and centered about Chicago, spreading northward as far as Kenosha, Wisconsin and southward as far as Dwight, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, the Danish immigrants settled largely on the West Side, where they established themselves in distinct groups. Many engaged in business and succeeded well. Wherever they settled, the older generation rapidly established homes, churches, lodges, and schools. Many clung tenaciously to their mother tongue and their traditions, until, as they became familiar with American ways, some of their secular interests were absorbed by, and dissolved in, <pb facs="5420780_3_0107.jpg" n="2"/>our national spirit. But their memories are generally very long.</p>
   <p>One Danish immigrant rose to the post of State Treasurer, another grew famous as one of the State's most distinguished distributors of foodstuffs. The younger generation (after 1880) also number many citizens of distinction, including bankers, physicians, teachers, lawyers, writers, etc., and men of affairs. Three became famous as musicians and composers. At least two were members of the State Legislature. Several served in the city and village governments.</p>
   <p>Our contingent of Danish origin brought to our State an innate honesty and integrity, coupled with a will to work hard for their homesteads according to principles which had stood the test of centuries. This tradition revealed itself in the fondness of the Danish immigrant for his native ways, food, speech, and amusements. Some notable choirs, active for upward of a half-century or longer, still cultivate old native songs.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0108.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For many years, each Danish settlement celebrated the fifth of June, the anniversary of the adoption of the Danish constitution, as a day of rejoicing, but in later times the tendency has been to transfer the date of this festival to the fourth of July.</p>
   <p>Like other groups of foreign origin, the Danes in Illinois developed from the sixties onward a literature of their own, founded on American impressions of life and nature or embodying old memories. Poetry was plentifully published in the early Danish-American press and in a number of books. Hymns and the attendant sacred music continued to cheer and enliven the spirits of many men and women. Around 1880 there also developed a considerable activity in the field of drama. This activity, so largely dependent on personal initiative, still continues in the field of sports.</p>
   <p>The Dane is fond of arts and crafts, gymnastics, athletics, folk dancing, and other constructive amusements. Danish artisans were much in demand <pb facs="5420780_3_0109.jpg" n="4"/>until the advent of the machine age. Much of the artistic decoration of our older mansions in and about Chicago was done by Danish skill. Danish servants were, and still are, at a premium.</p>
   <p>But the greatest contribution of the Danish immigrants, in Illinois and elsewhere, lies in their genius for homebuilding and development of sound units of farming. Acting under the time-honored practice that every farm should be left in a better state of cultivation than that in which it was received, the Danish farmer contingent has set a praiseworthy example for all time. Wherever a large and commodious barn building is found adjoining a modest dwelling, it is a safe guess that a Dane was responsible for the structure.</p>
   <p>A grandson of one of the early Danish pastors in Illinois was chosen for the distinguished task of editing the great history of the United States written by Henry Adams.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0110.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>An immigrant of the first generation is largely responsible for the initial development of our park system and for the laying out of many of our private estates.</p>
   <p>Another American of Danish birth, who come to Illinois fifty years ago, founded the only park maintained in a foreign country by funds contributed by the American Government. This park, located in Denmark, was dedicated as a tribute to the hospitality of our adopted country.</p>
