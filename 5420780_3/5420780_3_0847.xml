   <p>The Danish artist, Miss Valborg Andersen, is in her twenties. She lost both her parents when she was six years old. At seventeen she entered training as a nurse at a hospital in Copenhagen. One of her patients, an old lady, introduced her to the Danish composer and singing teacher, Rosenfeld.</p>
   <p>She appeared at the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, where she was popular right from the start. She has a good contralto voice.</p>
   <p>She was also well received by the Danish colony here, where she stayed at the home of Niels Juul.</p>
   <p>Revyen, July 25, 1896.</p>
   <p>After appearing in many American towns Miss Andersen left the country in the <pb facs="5420780_3_0848.jpg" n="2"/>middle of July. Of all the prominent Danes who have visited the Danes in the United States, she was the one best liked. The Danes here in America really took her to their hearts.</p>
