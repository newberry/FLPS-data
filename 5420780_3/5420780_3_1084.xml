  <body>
   <p>The well-known journalist and literary critic, Clemens Petersen, left for Denmark August 17, to spend the rest of his days in the home of his brother, Valdemar Petersen, who is the chief of the police detective bureau in Copenhagen.</p>
   <p>Clemens Petersen lived in America for thirty-five years. He was a famous literary critic in Copenhagen before he came over here. He was the first to discover the now famous Norwegian writer, Bjornson. Mr. C. Petersen is a master of both Danish and English. In New York he worked for several years with the editors of Johnson's Encyclopedia and Schaff's Biblical Encyclopedia.</p>
   <p>Clemens Petersen lived in Chicago for some years, where he wrote leading articles in the monthly periodical Scandinavia. In the nineties he went to New York, where he and his friend, John Volk, started a Danish weekly newspaper Nordlyset (The Northern Light). Mr. J. Volk died this year, and the paper was taken over by someone else. C. Petersen's articles were read by all Danes with great interest.</p>
