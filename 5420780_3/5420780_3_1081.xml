  <body>
   <p>Friends of Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Ryberg gave a banquet in Dania Hall November 17, on the occasion of their silver wedding day. This popular couple has done a great deal of work for Chicago Danes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ryberg was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 24, 1858. His father, a paint contractor, died in 1859. Charles Ryberg came to Chicago in 1881 and was married the same year to Miss Anna Nielsen, who was born in 1861 at Brons in Schleswig.</p>
   <p>In 1884 they started a restaurant, which soon became the favorite meeting place of Danes in Chicago. This restaurant they ran for six years. In 1894 Mr. Ryberg became president of the Quadrigal Manufacturing Company, a job he soon gave up for a position in the Recorder's Office, where he is now superintendent in the map department.</p>

He has also done a great deal for the Danish Old People's Home. Recently he organized the Hans Christian Andersen jubilee that brought $8,000 to the Danish Children's Home. He is also president of the Danish-American Association. Mr. and Mrs Ryberg have two daughters, Daisy and Frances. Mr. Ryberg is a Republican.</p>
