   <p>Home in Denmark, on the Island of Fyen (Funen), a committee of patriotic citizens has been mercifully granted a permission to operate a small lottery in efforts to raise funds with which to erect a monument for the late King Kristian IX, to which enterprise people do not seem willing to contribute voluntarily.</p>
   <p>Royal-minded snobs among the Danes in America, organized for the same purpose, have received even less support and have no chance of getting out of the pinch they are in by resorting to gambling, inasmuch as gambling is prohibited in this country. The question as to what to do for the unfortunate members of this committee is still unanswered.</p>
   <p>Months have elapsed since a list of insignificant contributions was published, which contributions presumably went to cover travel and advertising expenses incurred by Chr. Rasmussen in Minneapolis. The business is at a complete <pb facs="5420780_3_0788.jpg" n="2"/>standstill right now. Even the most cordial appeals have had no effect; but, of course, it is hard for the ardent sponsors to face the music and admit they made a mistake. However, we believe there is nothing else to do, because the longer they wait, the worse the fiasco.</p>
