   <p>I do not presume that the readers of this paper are interested in any of us delving into the subject of evolution more thoroughly than we have already done. We of the Lutheran faith do not agree with the Calvinist Church's literal conception of the biblical story of creation, and neither do we run the way the wind blows, particularly,when its only a light breeze.</p>
   <p>I just want to emphasize that any person who has made even a very limited study of life knows that it is not at all easy to have faith in the theory of evolution.</p>
   <p>According to it nature itself is the origin of the species. We know they are fairly stable,but it is within our power to improve them and even develop entirely new species, apparently. Consider for instance the many <pb facs="5420780_3_0440.jpg" n="2"/>horse and dog breeds, the variety of roses, fruits, flowers and other plants developed by animal and plant experts.</p>
   <p>Luther Burbank was a master of that art. But we know just as surely that if we don't watch out and keep our creations under control the acquired qualities and characteristics will disappear. Nature will strip our artificial breeds of improvements in no time. With all our skill we have not succeeded in creating a single durable breed of animals or plants.</p>
   <p>In spite of this fact nature is supposed to have developed a multitude of individual species all from the primitive beginning of a single cell. Sounds illogical, doesn't it, particularly because nature generally punishes cross-breeds with sterility.</p>
   <p>Nature is jealously guarding itself against attempts to create unstable species.</p>
   <p>A lot could be written on this subject but I consider the readers of <pb facs="5420780_3_0441.jpg" n="3"/>this paper too intelligent to be in need of information which is commonly known.</p>
