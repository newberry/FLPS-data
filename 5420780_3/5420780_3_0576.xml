   <p>Dania, Chicago, is the oldest social society in America.</p>
   <p>Dania was organized Nov. 23, 1862, twenty-five years after Chicago, with four thousand inhabitants, was incorporated as a city.</p>
   <p>At that time the Civil War was at its height, and many of Dania's members enlisted, some never to return.</p>
   <p>Dania, for some few years, called itself "Dana," but for several reasons the name became Dania.</p>
   <p>The organizers, John Foster and Niels Uhrenholt, had a hard time building the society, mostly because of the poor transportation Chicago had in those days.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0577.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During its first years, the society had kerosene lamps and it was not until late in the sixties that it had gas lights installed. In the nineties the society bought its own building, after which it began to grow.</p>
