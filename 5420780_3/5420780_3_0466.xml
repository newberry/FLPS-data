   <pb facs="5420780_3_0467.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>St. Ansgar</p>
   <p>St. Ansgar was organized in 1890. It has 650 members, of whom 150 are active. The value of the church building is $16,000. There is a debt of $2,800. S. T. Corydon is the president of the church board. The Reverend M. F. Blichfield is the pastor.</p>
   <p>Chicago South</p>
   <p>Chicago South is a little mission church organized in 1874. There are thirty-five members, of whom seventeen are active paying members. The building is valued at $1,800. There is a debt of $200.</p>
   <p>At the annual conference held in Racine, Wisconsin, in 1893, a new constitution was written. Thirty-six ministers signed, but eighteen refused; these eighteen later formed Det Danske Evangelisk-Lutherske Kirkesamfund (The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Society), which later became Den Forenede Danske Evagelisk-Lutherske Kirke <pb facs="5420780_3_0468.jpg" n="3"/>(The United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church).</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: These two churches are known as The Danish Church and The United Church. The Danish Church is based on the doctrines of Bishop S. N. Grundtvig, and The United Church is based upon the great revival in Denmark led by Vilhelm Beck; this church is deeply pietistic.</p>
   <p>In the Danish State Church in Denmark these two religious view points share the same churches and their ministers are trained at the same theological school, the University of Copenhagen, but in this country they have not been able to co-operate in this manner.]</p>
