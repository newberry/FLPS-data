   <p>Mr. J. V. Brochsenius died August 8. The board of the Danish Old People's Home had just decided that he could be admitted to that home.</p>
   <p>Jens Valdemar Brochsenius, M. A., was born in 1831 in Nestved, Denmark, where his father was a merchant. He studied at Herlufholm's Laerde Skole from 1845 to 1850. He took his A.B. in 1851, and his Ph.B. in 1852. For four years he studied philology at the University of Copenhagen. He was teacher at a school in Tonder, Schleswig, but had to give that up when the war between Denmark and Germany broke out in 1864. Then he taught school for some time in Storehedinge, Denmark.</p>
   <p>Soon after, he left for America to visit his brother, Hans Brochsenius, who had a political job in Madison, Wisconsin. His brother tried to get him a position as teacher of old Scandinavian languages at the University, but this position was filled in 1869 by the Norwegian professor, R. B. Anderson. Two years later <pb facs="5420780_3_1100.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. J. V. Brochsenius took his M. A. degree from this university. He came to Chicago in 1881, and was for some time teacher at a German academy; later he was editor of Illusteret Ugeblad.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brochsenius was with Den Christelig Talsmad for fifteen or eighteen years. He worked for the Methodist Church and edited four books on Biblical geography, biography, natural history, and biblical costumes: these books were widely read. He never married. He loved to study: he was a fine poet and a good lecturer. He tried to reconciliate Brandes' idea with Christianity. His fate was too proofread sermons and devotional literature. The only Danish society he joined was the Young People's Society on the West Side, where he gave many a splendid lecture.</p>
   <p>He was always poor; just recently the young people, headed by the well-known contractor, S. N. Nielsen, started to collect some money for him. A brother in Copenhagen sent 2,000 Kroner. All the money was put in the bank, and out of this $300 was to be paid for Admittance to the Danish Old People's Home, but now it will be used for his funeral.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_1101.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During the eighties Mr. Brochsenius published a collection of excellent poems under the title, Ved Oresund og Mississippi.</p>
