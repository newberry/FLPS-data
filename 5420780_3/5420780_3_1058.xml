   <p>Former Alderman Jens N. Hyldahl died last Thursday after an operation.</p>
   <p>Hyldshl was born in Denmark in 1873, and came to Chicago fourteen years ago.</p>
   <p>In 1910 he was elected alderman from the 27th ward, a job which he performed very creditably. When he was defeated for re-election in 1912 by his Democratic opponent, he established himself as a cement contractor, and at the time of his death had built up a considerable business. He was a member of Dania and also a Free Mason.</p>
   <p>The large funeral procession, numbering at least 1,000 people, bore witness of the high esteem in which he was held.</p>
