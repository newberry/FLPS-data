   <p>Fritz Frantsen, president of Dania, died suddenly last Monday in the club rooms, of the society, Kedzie and Wabansia Avenue.</p>
   <p>Fritz Frantsen was born in Horsens, Denmark, May 25, 1835. He would have been 85 years old had he lived until next May.</p>
   <p>In the War of 1864, he served as Lieutenant. In 1865, he emigrated to America, and at once came to Chicago. In Denmark, he had been a mill builder, and on reaching America, he worked as a carpenter. In about two years, he saved enough money to operate a Cigar Store and ticket brokerage on Kedzie Street, near the old Northwestern Station.</p>
   <p>Later, he moved his business to the Danish colony, centered around the old Danish hotel, Dannevirke, on Milwaukee Avenue, where he also aid a little job printing, published a paper, and sold real estate and insurance.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0999.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After about fifty year's activity in his business in the "old quarter," where he was the last Dane left of the old colony, he sold his business. But he felt he could not lay idle, so he again started to sell tickets and handle the colony's large business in forwarding money to the old country.</p>
   <p>The year before the War he was knighted by the Danish king, which though rather late, was a reward for distinguished service in the War of '64.</p>
   <p>Before the great fire, on July 1, 1871, Frantzen became president of Dania Society. So it was, forty-nine years ago next July. After the big Chicago fire Frantzen being a member of the building committee, partly due to his wonderful activity that a new building for Dania soon was built on the ashes of the old one.</p>
   <p>All through his life he remained the soldierly looking figure of his youth, and he still retained his young, brilliant mind.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_1000.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He was a member of Society Dania, the Masons, and several smaller organizations.</p>
   <p>Dania has lost in Fritz Frantzen one of their most active and highly respected members.</p>
