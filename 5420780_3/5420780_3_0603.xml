<title level="a">IS IMMIGRATION FROM SCANDINAVIA STILL TO BE REDUCED</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The settlement of this question still rests with the American voters. Congress has not disposed of it. The National Origin Provisions law first scheduled to go into effect July 1, was postponed for only one year at the close of the sixty-ninth Congress by a vote of 232 for postponement and 111 against it.</p>
   <p>The National Origins Provisions, section 11 of the Immigration Law, provides that the total annual quota for all countries will be reduced from 164,667 to 150,000 beginning July 1, 1928. It is not this comparatively small reduction of the quota, but rather the impeding distribution of the total quota between the various nations which has caused such a sensation, and perhaps consternation in Scandinavian circles.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0604.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When the first quota law went into effect at the close of the world War, Sweden was allowed 20,042 immigrants per year, Norway 12,202, and Denmark 5,619. Under the present Immigration Law (without the National Origin Provision) 9,561 Swedish, 6,453 Norwegian, and 2,789 Danish immigrants are entitled to admission during the fiscal year, based on two per cent of the number of Scandinavians, who in 1890, resided in the United States. Although this represents a reduction of fifty per cent or more, there is absolutely no protest against this greatly reduced annual quota, or against its distribution on the basis of two per cent of the United States census of 1890. But under section 11 of the Immigration Law, the distribution of the annual quota of 150,000 immigrants, beginning July 1, 1928, will be made on the basis of so-called national origin, a very uncertain, and, therefore, arbitrary method, which, according to statistics, will reduce Sweden's quota to 3,259, Norway's to 2,267, and Denmark's to 1,044 per annum.</p>
