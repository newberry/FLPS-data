   <p>George Hoffmann was buried last Sunday, November 10. His casket was carried from his home to St. Ansgar's Church by the following members of Dania: N. C. Barthody, R. J. Jensen, Louis Hansen, H. H. Henrichsen, H. Ockenholt, and L. M. Hoffenblad. The Reverend Mr. Eriksen paid a fine tribute to the old Dane.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoffmann was almost sixty-eight. He was born in Hjorring, Denmark, and came to America in 1859. He lived for a short while in Franklin Grove, Illinois, and came to Chicago in 1861. He took part in the Civil War as a soldier in the Northern Army, and he later received a small pension. He first had a cigar store on Kinzie Street. After the Great Fire he moved to Milwaukee Avenue. In 1871 he was elected County Commissioner, and his name is now to be found on the County Building near the Clark Street entrance.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoffmann leaves a widow and three daughters, of whom one is a public school teacher and another a teacher of music.</p>
