   <p>Helga von Bluhme, who now lives in Brooklyn protests against calling Mrs. Elizabeth Riis, the first Danish actress to appear in America. Von Bluhme tells us that 16 years ago (1881) she came from Denmark as a well-known actress. She was in Chicago eight days and read Drachmann's poem: "Sonderjyske Piger before Dania," a small and intelligent society. She was introduced by Consul Dreier, whose daughter played the piano when she sang. Von Bluhme also read many of Hans Christian Andersen's stories. She became very popular in the colony.</p>
   <p>Later she left for Racine, Wisconsin, where she started to give amateur plays with some young people from that town. The often performed before as many as 1,100 people.</p>
