   <p>According to a dispatch from Copenhagen, Mr. Henry Ockenholt has been created a Knight of Dannebrog (The Danish flag) by the Danish King.</p>
   <p>During the many years he has lived in Chicago, Mr. Ockenholt has on numerous occasions demonstrated his interest in Denmark and everything Danish, and been one of the pillars of Danish culture and tradition on this side of the ocean.</p>
   <p>He has particularly given much time and effort in the interest of the society Dania, whose president he was for many years. Right now he is writing the history of this society, a work to which he devotes all his energy and enthusiasm, in spite of his poor health, caused by a heart disorder.</p>
   <p>He has also been a staunch supporter of the Danish Old People's Home, and <pb facs="5420780_3_0720.jpg" n="2"/>the Children's Home.</p>
   <p>The decoration, which he has just received as an expression of official appreciation, is certainly well earned, and is particularly timely now when his long work-day in America is coming to a close and he is about to go back and spend the evening of his life in the land which was always so close to his heart.</p>
