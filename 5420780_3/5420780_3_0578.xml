   <p>The Danish immigration to Chicago, it may truly be said, began with Peter Allen. Allen came to Chicago in 1837, when it was still a small town. Though his permanent residence was in Chicago, he sailed as a captain of sailing ships on the Lakes.</p>
   <p>Another early arrival was Jorgen Petersen, known as the "Old Whale." Petersen brought the first locomotive to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Another old timer was Andrew J. Miller, who has the honor of being Chicago's first barber and later became Chicago's first brewer, though this enterprise did not last long because Miller's beer was quite strong, and the mayor and his friends ordered Miller to stop brewing. Miller then began to manufacture soda water. This business flourished to such an extent that Miller's sheds and buildings spread over what is now downtown Chicago, and this section became known as Miller's Town. In the panic of 1857 Miller lost everything.</p>

   <p>George P. Hansen was Denmark's first consul in Chicago; he is also believed to have been Chicago's first Danish politician. Hansen agitated for Lincoln and received a personal expression of appreciation from Honest Abe.</p>
   <p>Among other Danish politicians we may mention Carl Skov, who changed his name to Woodman. He became the first Danish member of Congress. He also defended [in court] the murderer of President McKinley.</p>
   <p>Another politician of note, Henry L. Hertz, became State Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Niels Juul was State Senator for several terms and was later elected United States Congressman.</p>
   <p>Charles L. Ryberg was also a member of the Illinois legislature.</p>
