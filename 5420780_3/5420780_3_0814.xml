   <p>King Christian IX of Denmark died on January 27 at the age of eighty-eight. He was born April 8, 1818, and became King of Denmark in 1883. He was a German prince married to a Danish princess. He had a hard time during the Danish German war that followed in 1864, for the Danes were afraid that in his heart he was pro-German. But after many years he won the confidence of his people. His oldest son, Frederik VIII, is now King of Denmark. He was born January 3, 1843, and is thus sixty-three years old. There will be a memorial service in St. Ansgar Church as soon as King Christian IX is buried in Denmark.</p>
