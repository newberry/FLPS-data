   <p>p.2.col.1.........We would possibly have been moved to great sympathy at the thought of the venerable Danish King in tears over the opposition and criticism created by the reinstatement of J. C. Christensen as Prime Minister had we not known that in spite of the traitor like actions of Christensen the King himself had sponsored his reinstatement. With Christensen came the military legislation as valiantly opposed as unnecessarily expensive and dangerous to the future peace of Denmark.</p>
   <p>We would not brazenly assert that the tears shed by the King were crocodile tears though we are beginning to wonder whether it will not soon be advisible by Denmark to raise the banner of pure democracy and institute a vigorous campaign to eliminate the expensive and reactionary institution that monarchy shows, more and more clearly, it has become.</p>
