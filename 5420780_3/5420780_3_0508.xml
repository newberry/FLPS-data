   <p>The storm in the Danish Lutheran Church is over,so far as it can be for the present. The biblical questions of so much importance that brought fully one hundred clergymen and lay delegates from nearly every Danish Lutheran Church in the United States to Chicago, that they might confer upon the subject, and settle the dispute of two years' standing, once for all, was found to be too great to be disposed of in the space of one week. It was a matter of a split in the Lutheran synod or a surrender of one of the two parties. Neither has happened. Even Mr. Jeroild, the editor of a Danish paper, who accused two ministers of rationalism, could not be made to retract, and all the committee could do was to ask him to give reasons for his statements before the newly elected synodical government at the next annual meeting in September. Instead of settling the question at issue a new constitution was accepted, and if theological controversies occur under this new government, they will be settled by the heads of the church. The new government will be composed of two ministers and three laymen, who will rule the synod. A.S.Nielsen was President of the former church government.</p>
