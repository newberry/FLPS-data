   <p>This is the notorious case of the damage suit for $25,000 brought against Carl Antonsen by Christian Botker. Antonsen, as we all know, is the Chicago editor of the Danish Pioneer. The most ridiculous thing which came out at the hearing was the translation of an article which had appeared in the Pioneer, written by Antonsen. The translation was a masterpiece of errors; for example, where the word long-fingered should have been used, it was written light-fingered. This translation exasperated Botker. The idea of calling him light-fingered! He was no thief; and the altercation was drawn out longer and longer, on account of other numerous errors in the text.</p>
   <p>An entire army of linguists and translators were called to defend Antonsen's translation. Among the "experts" were, C. M. Koedt, A. W. Hansen, Attorney D. M. Frederiksen, and "Literatus" Visso Rutzow, whose "long-fingered" <pb facs="5420780_3_1251.jpg" n="2"/>habits have gained him the title of "His Lordship" (just as Schumberg became a baron, and A. C. Nelson a lieutenant). Rutzow apparently was to be used in court as an illustration of what could be done by "light-fingered" gentry. Botker also had a regiment of experts, Professor Theo. Buthne, J. W. Borchsenius, and others. Twelve good men and true were sworn in to aid Botkar in winning his suit for $25,000. Attorney Olaf Ray [Norwegian] pleaded the case, bringing out the story or stories.</p>
   <p>Mr. Antonsen's attorney, Mr. Miles, then called his witnesses. Antonsen had been smart enough not to give his case to any of our half-witted Scandinavian attorneys; he had secured the services of the native-born Mr. Miles, who, if we are to judge by the size of his nose, has Semitic blood in his veins.</p>
   <p>Mr. Miles began his questioning, and the words light fingers and light-fingered <pb facs="5420780_3_1252.jpg" n="3"/>rained down on the court.....The judge tried to arbitrate the case, but Antonsen would not consider such procedure, and his answer to the judge was,</p>
   <p>"Not by a damned sight."</p>
   <p>This case of "honor dishonored" appears to be one of those which can go on and on. Alas for Antonsen! Alas for Botker!</p>
