   <p>The Danish-American Youth Convention was attended by more than five hundred delegates. The meetings had to be held in a big tent on the corner of Washtenaw and Potomac Avenues. The meeting opened Saturday, September 1, with a song written by the Reverend Adam Dan and a short introductory talk by the Reverend K. Gjorup. In the afternoon Ivar Kirkegaard, of Racine, spoke about the Danish-American movement, and Mr. Lauritzen spoke for both Denmark and America.</p>
   <p>During Sunday morning the delegates saw a little of the town. In the evening between two and three thousand persons were gathered in the tent. There was singing by several Danish singing societies from Chicago, and a fine lecture about modern youth by Professor Nordentoft of the theological school in Des Moines. Ice cream was served by young Danish girls in Japanese <pb facs="5420780_3_0393.jpg" n="2"/>dresses.</p>
   <p>The business meeting was held on Monday, with a view to re-organizing the Danish-American Association into one of national scope, so as to assist newcomers from Denmark in their adjustments to American manners and customs. The convention closed Monday night with a festival on an island in Humboldt Park with a speech by the Reverend Nelleman of Manistee, Michigan, and ice cream served by Danmarks Dotre (the Daughters of Denmark) and Dagmar Lodge of the Danish Sisterhood.</p>
