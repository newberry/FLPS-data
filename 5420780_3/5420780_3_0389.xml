   <p>The Danish-American Association held its second general assembly Friday at the Great Northern Hotel, Chicago. About forty members were present representing a total of 186 shares of which 101 are owned by Mr. E. V. Eskeseu of New York. Chicago's South Side was particularly well represented.</p>
   <p>Proposals to amend the by-laws were adopted and a Board of Directors was elected for a period of three years, consisting of Editor Sophus F. Neble; Dr. Max Henius of Chicago and Contractor Madsen, New York.</p>
   <p>The following resolution of thanks was proposed and approved:</p>
   <p>1. "To express the association's most sincere thanks and appreciation to all Danish-American Societies and their appointed committees who so generously and unselfishly have devoted time and effort to further the cause of Danish-American Association during the past year." Furthermore:</p>
