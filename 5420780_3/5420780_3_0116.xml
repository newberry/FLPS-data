   <p>p.4.....To the many writers who have contributed to this paper, I take the liberty of saying that one cannot expect to find the culture of one's native land in a foreign country, if we ourselves do nothing towards its preservation.</p>
   <p>The Danish colony in Chicago has many splendid societies and libraries, where much of what is sought may be found.</p>
   <p>The Danish-American undergoes those changes which takes place in the process of his assimilation of American culture of having lived here half a dozen years ago. However, his Danish culture will have made its imprint too and so affects his reactions and mental-self.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_3_0117.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Within our own circle we have many sincere men and women, who have dedicated their lives to the furtherance of Danish Culture.</p>
   <p>Many of our ablest authors have translated Danish Poetry and Prose in the American language and the result is too well known to need discussion.</p>
   <p>In thousands ot Danish homes throughout the U.S., Danish culture is preserved and understood and this we feel is Denmark's valuable cultural contribution to the mighty America.</p>
   <p>Ego.</p>
