   <p>Danes from all over Chicago and from nearby communities will meet tomorrow in Riverview Park for the fifth time in five successive years.</p>
   <p>We quote from the proclamation issued by Mr. Arnold Rasmussen, president of the National Committee:</p>
   <p>"On this day we meet as Danes, regardless of our high or humble place in society, regardless of our political, religious or other differences, as a people proud of our national heritage and proudly conscious of the fact that our race always has contributed and always will contribute its wholehearted effort in creating and maintaining this great American Nation."</p>
   <p>The festival's committee on arrangements has worked hard, and is now putting <pb facs="5420780_3_0318.jpg" n="2"/>the finishing touches on its preparations for a great and festive event.</p>
   <p>The Park's gates will open at 11 A. M., and immediately after lunch Hans Nelson's orchestra will give a concert program, including a selection of representative Danish music.</p>
   <p>At 2:15 P.M. the welcoming speech will be delivered by Mr. Rasmussen, following which, various speakers, the children's choir, and the Danish singing societies will be heard.</p>
   <p>At 4 P.M. the lighter part of the program begins with the opening of the amusement with sporting events, among which are wrestling matches by members of Freja, and at 9:30 a fireworks display.</p>
   <p>Ole Nielsen's orchestra will furnish dance music from 2 to 11 P.M. in the great ballroom.</p>
