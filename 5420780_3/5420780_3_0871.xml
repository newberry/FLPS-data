  <body>
   <p>Christ Jorgensen was born in Ringkjobing, Denmark, in 1871. He and his wife arrived in Chicago in 1892. He was obliged to work at all kinds of jobs--for the railroad, for instance, and teaming.</p>
   <p>In 1903 Mr. Jorgensen started his own contracting business, which he still runs. It is now one of the largest in the city.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Jorgensen died six months ago. There are four daughters, ranging in age from thirty to forty-two years, all of whom are married. Mr. Jorgensen is very happy with his children and grandchildren. One of his grandsons was a messenger for three years in Congress in Washington.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jorgensen is a thirty-second-degree Mason, and is a member of several Danish societies, including Dania. He once made a trip to Denmark, but was glad to return to the United States.</p>
