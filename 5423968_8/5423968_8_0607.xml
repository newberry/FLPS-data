   <p>By all means let us defend ourselves against denationalization. Our children and our young people talk English more frequently than Polish. Of no help are all the literary clubs, all circles, all literary soirees, if those taking part in them speak in Polish only that which they had learned previously by heart for the occasion, but back of the stage speak among themselves only English.</p>
   <p>The greatest obstacle against denationalization is the home, for without it, the best wishes and efforts of individuals toward a nationalistic upbringing will be absolutely fruitless. But even a home needs an ally and such is a Polish book. Let every family try to have at least a certain amount of Polish books in their homes in order that their children and the youth may imbibe from them the nationalistic spirit and in this way be made stronger against denationalization.</p>
