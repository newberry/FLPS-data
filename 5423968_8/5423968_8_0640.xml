   <p>We read in the newspapers from the old country:</p>
   <p>"Reverend Domagalski, from America, has delivered a lecture in Posen about the conditions under which the working class--especially the Polish immigrants--live in America.</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as Reverend Domagalski has spent fifteen years in America, his competency on the subject cannot be questioned.</p>
   <p>"He considers the Polish emigration to the western hemisphere a national calamity.</p>
   <p>"There is no future for the Polish nationality in America, for most of <pb facs="5423968_8_0641.jpg" n="2"/>the children of Polish immigrants speak English, and the third generation is not conscious of its nationality.</p>
   <p>"The Polish element in America will exist only as long as more Poles keep coming from Europe. As soon as immigration is stopped, the Polish nationality in America will die out.</p>
   <p>"In Reverend Demagalski's opinion, Polish emigration to America is caused by lack of employment in the old country and by letters received from Poles living there, who describe conditions in America to their relatives in beautiful colors."</p>
   <p>So much about our future from Reverend Domagalski.</p>
   <p>We are merely repeating his statements and wish to announce that we do not share his opinion.</p>
   <p>We will return to this subject later on.</p>
