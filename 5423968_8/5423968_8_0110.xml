<title level="a">TROUBLE AT ST. HEDWIG'S CHURCH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The many fights that occur throughout Chicago daily finally hit St. Hedwig's parish last night. Today the Chicago [English-language] press and the German press as well published sensational stories to the effect that a brawl had taken place on the stairs of St. Hedwig's Church. Many purely imaginative reasons [for the fight] are cited, of which not one holds a figment of truth.</p>
   <p>The entire matter was pieced together by careful investigation and may be summed up as follows.The fight occurred when two inebriated individuals came to blows in an argument. It took place at 7 P.M. in front of a residence across the street from St. Hedwig's Church. The combatants were Wollenberg and Mrochim. Bystanders put a stop to the fight shortly after it began. Mrochim, however, went to his friends and collected a few in order to take revenge on Wollenberg. A second fight took place, and some one fired a shot at Wollenberg, shooting off a part of his ear and <pb facs="5423968_8_0111.jpg" n="2"/>injuring Mrochim on the chin. It seems that both were taken to a hospital for treatment; however, their wounds are not serious.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, in the scuffle a parish watchman, Vincent Soleski, came upon the scene and in the melee was severely stabbed.</p>
   <p>This is the gist of the matter, and we wish to say again that there is not one word of truth in the sensational articles printed in the Chicago press.</p>
