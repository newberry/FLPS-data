   <p>Yesterday evening the Alliance of Polish Military Societies in America held a special meeting at T. Jachimowicz's hall in order to discuss the stand that the organization should take in view of the crisis which the United States is now facing as a result of the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Germany.</p>
   <p>The following persons were present at the meeting: J. N. Przymorski, commander of the Alliance of Polish Military Societies; Titus Jachimowski, president; W. Kozuch, S. Snopek, A. Sikorski; W. Grygienc, treasurer; J. M. Andrzejewski; secretary general; and S. Orpiszewski.</p>
   <p>After a short discussion of the present strained situation, as a result of which the United States may find itself drawn into the war at any moment, <pb facs="5423968_8_1044.jpg" n="2"/>those present unanimously voted to support the stand of the President and the Government, expressing their willingness at any time to place the Polish military corps at the disposal of the country, to defend the Star-Spangled Banner and the liberty which we enjoy here.</p>
   <p>If the need arises, the military divisions are to be called to arms to fight any enemy who would dare threaten the unity and freedom of the United States, to give their lives and property to their adopted country. The unanimity of those present was complete, and finally it was decided to send the following telegram to President Wilson....:</p>
   <p>His Excellency Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>President of the United States,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>In the present great crisis involving the United States, the members of <pb facs="5423968_8_1045.jpg" n="3"/>our organization, the Alliance of Polish Military Societies in America, numbering several thousand, are all with you to a man and support your manly stand for the vindication of the rights, honor, and dignity of our country. They are ready and willing at all times to render any service and make any sacrifice that their duty as American citizens and Polish soldiers, descendants of Kosciusko and Pulaski, who fought for the independence of this country, may require of them.</p>
   <p>J. N. Przymorski, commander</p>
   <p>A. Wittort, subcommander</p>
   <p>T. Jachimowski, president</p>
   <p>W. W. Goralski, vice-president</p>
