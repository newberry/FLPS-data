   <p>A bill was brought before the State Legislature in Springfield, sponsoring a new insurance law which, if passed, will jeopardize the existence of insurance protection, now offered by fraternal and benevolent organizations.</p>
   <p>Representatives of various fraternal organizations met at a protest meeting, at the Sherman House last night to accept a plan of defence, and to elect representatives who shall be sent to Springfield to fight this bill.</p>
   <p>A representative was elected for each of the eight fraternal organizations, with a total membership of 700,000, having a total of $1,200,000,000 as an insurance liability. This bill has a definite meaning to the Polish element in America, because organizations such as the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Alma Mater have a similar insurance plan. If this bill is passed, the Polish organizations would be compelled to subscribe to other insurance companies for protection of their members. A conspiracy was planned to pass <pb facs="5423968_8_0787.jpg" n="2"/>this bill without public notice. Newspapers apparently were paid by large insurance companies to withhold this information from all concerned, and the public in general. This plan has failed and the representatives who were elected last night, to fight this bill when it shall come up for a vote in the legislature, and the organizations represented, can rest assured that it shall be defeated. In the state of New York a similar bill was passed, but the representatives raised and objection, the bill is, therefore, being held, pending an investigation of it, and the very silent manner in which it has been proposed and voted on.</p>
