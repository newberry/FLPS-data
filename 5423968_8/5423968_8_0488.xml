   <p>"As you make your bed, so will you lie in it," says the old Polish adage. It has always come true and always will come true. Therefore, during tomorrow's elections for aldermen and other city officials, our compatriots should remember that in order to improve their own welfare they should not elect men of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Through sad and long experience we all know that as soon as men of other nationalities are elected sad times begin for us Poles, because we have no one in the city council who understands us and who will properly present our problems and defend them when necessary.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow is election day. Every registered man and woman can take part in the elections. The polls will be open from 6 A.M. to 4 P.M.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy earnestly recommends that our citizens support the following <pb facs="5423968_8_0489.jpg" n="2"/>Poles who are running for aldermen: Stanley Adamkiewicz, Democratic candidate of the Seventeenth Ward; Stanley Kunz, Democratic candidate of the Sixteenth Ward; and Stephen Thieda, Republican candidate of the Twelfth Ward.</p>
   <p>We will not list the virtues of each of the three candidates here. Our readers know them well and will themselves know how to give proper recognition where it is deserved. Our purpose is to warn our countrymen not to betray the Poles by voting for men of other nationalities, who do not understand us and have not the slightest idea of our needs, and who themselves are not our friends.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy has always stood guard over the interests of the Polish people; therefore, at a time of such great importance as tomorrow's elections, it turns to its readers with this earnest entreaty: Brothers, vote only for your own people!</p>
