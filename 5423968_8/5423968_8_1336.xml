   <p>According to a report made public recently by its secretary, the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, which stands firmly by the Polish National Alliance, has 8,200 active members, not including the several hundreds of candidates whose applications for membership are still pending. These figures show that our immigrants are very much interested in becoming members of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, the membership of which is increasing every day. The Organization has impressed our people so deeply that the young and the old are gathering fast under its protective wings. The Falcons have found their proper field for development in the Polish National Alliance. Prior to joining the Alliance, the Falcons had operated independently for twenty years, during which time they were threatened with extinction many times and could never gather together a large membership. The storms and tribulations that hovered over them only a year ago failed, however, to break the Falcons' morale. Proof of this is that during this year they have nearly tripled their membership, and new candidates are ever on the increase. A good enterprise, conducted honestly by capable leaders and <pb facs="5423968_8_1337.jpg" n="2"/>free from evil and treachery, will always grow and develop. If the Alliance of Polish Falcons keeps on growing at the present rate, there is no doubt that by the time of its next convention in South Bend, it will have approximately fifteen thousand members. The Polish National Alliance hopes that this prediction will come true.</p>
