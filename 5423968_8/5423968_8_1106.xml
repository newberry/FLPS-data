   <p>As we have frequently noted before, the Polish National Council finds its warmest support in the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, one of the oldest, greatest and most prominent Polish institutions of America. From the very beginning of the existence of the Council, the Union has patronized it liberally and supported it morally and materially. The numerous representatives of the Union take part in the work of the Polish National Council. Narod Polski, the official publication of the Union, most readily lends its space to the doings of our organization and is a fearless champion of our ideals. The Polish Union treasury is holding the funds of the Council, of the former "Zwiazek Jednosci," (Alliance of Concord), created by the first Polish bishop of America, the Right Rev. P. Rhode, and willingly defrays out of this fund the various expenses incurred by the Council in carrying out its propaganda. And what is more, the Union is solicitous to enlarge these funds by <pb facs="5423968_8_1107.jpg" n="2"/>contributions flowing each month from its members.</p>
   <p>For this support, for this noteworthy cooperation, the Polish National Council is laid under a tremendous obligation to the Union and at every step demonstrates its deepest gratitude. No one can very well battle for an idea or an ideal if he is dependent on advertisements for existence; and verily, without the disinterested assistance of the Union, the Council would be woefully handicapped in its work. May the other organizations which enter as units in the Council emulate the notable example of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. Doubtless much more could be done for Poland as well as for the needy immigrants in this country.</p>
