   <p>What good will and the desire to help a good cause can accomplish is illustrated by the unusual manifestation which took place at St. Wenceslaus Parish in Avondale, in which many of our countrymen showed their good will toward this parish.</p>
   <p>Almost every young parish has to struggle along for the first few years, constantly coming up against new difficulties and overcoming obstacles, generally of a financial nature, in order to maintain its existence.</p>
   <p>It is well known that the pilot of every parish, who must battle with all sorts of adversities and difficulties and steer the parish ship in such a manner as to prevent its going on the rocks, is generally the rector, who is happy in the rare cases when he can call upon his parishioners to do some useful work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0491.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our parish of St. Wenceslaus, although very young, because it has been in existence for scarcely four years, has already surpassed much older Polish parishes in Chicago in the matter of external appearances. Rows of nice homes which have been built and are continuing to be built, and the streets which have been asphalted only a few months ago in our neighborhood, have greatly improved the appearance, healthfulness, and growth of our parish. It is not at all surprising that our people are leaving the overcrowded and smelly neighborhoods and are moving en masse into our district, in which one can breathe clean, healthful air.</p>
   <p>As I have mentioned above, the streets in our neighborhood have been brought into proper order. This fact, although it has added greatly to the cleanliness and healthfulness of our neighborhood, has brought with it no small expense to every property owner.</p>
   <p>Therefore, our parish, too, which possesses an entire block bordered by four <pb facs="5423968_8_0492.jpg" n="3"/>streets, is subjected to no small expense, which, although paid off in installments, represents quite an impressive sum for each installment.</p>
   <p>In order to come to the aid of our parish in this difficult situation, and for the purpose of becoming better acquainted with the new arrivals in our parish, the local civic clubs--the T. Kosciusko Club (men's) and the Queen Kinga's Club (women's)--arranged a modest banquet at the parish hall on February 18, to which they invited the parishioners and the countrymen outside of the district who are friendly toward the parish. The attendance was so large that the committees of the above-named clubs found themselves in real difficulties, since despite thorough preparations for the success of the supper they were not prepared for so many people, and hereby extend their apologies to those who quite justifiably might have been dissatisfied.</p>
   <p>In order to make the supper more interesting, a short program was prepared.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0493.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>After the prayer by Reverend F. C. Scieszka, rector of St. Wenceslaus Parish, Mr. N. Budzban, chairman of the Welfare Committee of the T. Kosciusko Club, introduced as toastmaster Mr. W. Danisch, who then called upon the following gentlemen [to speak]: Mr. W. Palewicz; Mr. F. Gorski; Peter Rostenkowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Stanley Kolanowski; vice-president of the Fidelity State Bank; and Frank Linowiecki and A. Plocinski, clerks of the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>Successful vocal solos were rendered by Mrs. A. Nowak, Miss M. Wierdak, and Mr. E. J. Kanabaj. Recitations were given by Mrs. R. Matling and Mr. A. Hartowicz. During the supper the diners enjoyed the music of Mr. F. Bomek, an old veteran in the Polish cause, though a newcomer in our parish. In conclusion everyone joined in the singing of "Boze cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>The committees of the above-named clubs, headed by the rector, wish to express <pb facs="5423968_8_0494.jpg" n="5"/>their sincere thanks to all those who were present at the supper, to all those who brought contributions to the supper, to those who took part in the program, and to those ladies and gentlemen who worked zealously all evening in order that everyone might have an enjoyable time. To all of these people we extend the old Polish "Bog Zaplac" (God bless you.)</p>
