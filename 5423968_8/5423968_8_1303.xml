   <p>The organizational activity in the Polish National Alliance has again acquired enormous proportions with the coming of the cooler season. The Alliance receives comforting news of the organizing of new groups and of mass enrollment of new members into groups already existing. More than one thousand new recruits have enrolled under the national banner during the past month and new applications are already pouring in from all directions. It is anticipated that the month of November of the current year will break all present records. The Polish National Alliance wishes to take this opportunity to welcome all the newly affiliated groups by taking them into its folds. It also wishes to extend its sincere gratitude to the numerous organizers who have made the affiliation possible by exerting all their efforts and contributing generously to increase the number of new recruits in the ranks of this vast and ideal Polish national organization.</p>
