   <p>The first meeting of the new administration of the Polish League, recently elected at the Toledo convention, was held yesterday. Those present were: Joseph Napieralski, president; John Arkuszewski, vice-president; Reverend John Kasprzycki, spiritual advisor; Szczesny Zachajkiewicz, secretary; Peter Kiolbassa, treasurer; Reverend Vincent Barzynski and Leon Szopinski, trustees; and Stanislaus Szwajkart, former secretary general.</p>
   <p>The secretary read the minutes of the Toledo convention, which were given to him by Leon Szopinski, recording secretary of the convention. The changes to the statutes were read and accepted. It was agreed to have them read before the administration next Monday and then printed. It was also agreed to accept and publish the appeal of the new administration, together with the accomplishments of the Polish League for the past year.</p>
   <p>The League then voted to create a Department of Welfare, and the following <pb facs="5423968_8_1509.jpg" n="2"/>members were chosen for this work: Reverend Adolph Nowicki, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, S. Szwajkart, W. Burda, John Nering, Francis Wleklinski, and Louis Kalisz. It was agreed to invite these members to attend Monday's session, at which time they will be officially sworn in to undertake their duties.</p>
   <p>The Toledo convention contributed $4.20 and the Reverends Barzynski and Kasprzycki each contributed one dollar toward this welfare work.</p>
   <p>Meetings of the Polish League will regularly be held on the first Wednesday of each month, although the next meeting will be held on Monday, as previously announced.</p>
