   <p>Because of the present gigantic growth of transgression in our city--on the part of both minors and seniors among our juveniles and adults--great numbers of individuals occupying important judicial and political positions, including prosecuting attorneys, turn from time to time to society to help them in the war against crime. These appeals have actually diminished crime, but again, crime is menacing the peace of our freedom loving citizens.</p>
   <p>These kinds of appeals should be taken with seriousness, because the police forces cannot cope with the present situation. The cooperation of the people can offer them unlimited aid. But all forces of society must heed the call. Since our position is an important one, the city's lawmakers should set a precedent for the rest of society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0037.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The close consideration of each criminal process sometimes creates the impression that the one ambition of the defending attorney is to obtain the freedom of his guilty client. Recourse is made to various old laws, unforseen technical trifles brought out--the defendant is made out to be insane and sometimes a complete idiot, if only to snare him from the clutches of justice. Finally, all this is accomplished amidst the license of jurisprudence, attorneys' ethics, reasoning, and so forth.</p>
   <p>But it should not be overlooked that the lawyer for the defense is also a common citizen, who has besides the duties of a lawyer the duties of a citizen on his shoulders, who, before he became a practitioner of law, was first of all a citizen and by this privilege he profited accordingly. Finally, [he is a man] who ought to join forces with the rest of the people and help remedy the conditions of lawbreaking, for even he is a part of society. And yet in practice it seems otherwise. A majority of them are more concerned about <pb facs="5423968_8_0038.jpg" n="3"/>their profession than with their duties as citizens. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand why they work so aggressively to free the notorious lawbreakers from punishment.</p>
   <p>No-smaller, and perhaps a greater sin weighs upon the conscience of the politicians of Chicago, who with their influence free the petty as well as the major crime offenders. Sometimes, in the middle of night one of them awakens a judge in order that he may free his "political friend," for which [favor] he promises him votes during the elections. No wonder then that under such existing circumstances the fight against lawbreakers is unusually difficult, and sometimes, practically impossible. Because when the criminal is brought in through one door another sets him free--[he is] set free because of a certain flaw in the laws. Society will undoubtedly support the fight against transgressions of the law, but it wants and has the right to demand that the important leaders of this fight become more active as citizens and less active as professional lawyers.</p>
