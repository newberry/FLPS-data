   <p>(We have received the following correspondence with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>The military societies for the young men, providing pleasant recreation and accustoming them to discipline, obedience, and solidarity, are growing in number here in our St. Adalbert's Parish.</p>
   <p>At the present time the newly formed Battalion of Pulaski Volunteers is enlisting many new members. We have two uniformed military companies in St. Adalbert's Parish already. One of them is composed of youths who are eighteen or older, while the other is composed of youths who are from fourteen to eighteen years of age.</p>
   <p>It is proposed to organize a third company for men of more mature age.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1485.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Polish is the official language at all meetings of the cadets in St. Adalbert's Parish, and the officers and commanders carefully supervise this, seeing to it that the young boys speak only in Polish, and that they also perform their religious duties faithfully.</p>
   <p>Whoever wishes to carry a rifle, and listen, and learn, may come to our meetings.</p>
   <p>Candidates from fourteen to eighteen years of age may call on March 16, at eight o'clock in the evening at Hall No. 1, St. Adalbert Church, entrance on 17th Street. Those of eighteen years or older should call at the meeting on Thursday, March 19, at the same hour.</p>
   <p>The entrance fee for the younger boys is fifty cents and one dollar for the older boys. This reduced fee will be in effect only a short time. The <pb facs="5423968_8_1486.jpg" n="3"/>Committee reserves the right to accept or refuse any applicant.</p>
