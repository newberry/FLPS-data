   <p>"My Dear Mr. Wedda:</p>
   <p>c/o Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>My most hearty greetings to the Polish National Alliance convention assembled here.</p>
   <p>Let all real wishers of good government, all those who love their country and its institutions, listen now for a moment; listen with eyes aleft, listen to the voice of experience and the call of inspiration from the spirit of America which was Washington and Lincoln, listen and hear from them the call: "Carry on, Americans! Carry on! Carry on!" Carry on, now, against the fees of our household as you fought at Valley Forge, at the Argonne and at Chateau Thierry. "Carry on! Carry on!" Find disloyalty, if there be disloyalty, and scotch it; find dishonesty, if there be dishonesty, and crush it; find the right and cleave unto it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0738.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Keep your eyes ahead, Americans, but keep your feet on solid ground. Find the reason for discontent and meet it squarely; correct the cause where there is a cause and mercilessly destroy the excuse that is an excuse only. Find exact justice, and demand it, demand it for all men and exact it from all men. Remember the stuff you are made of, Americans. Remember the heritage which is yours. The stress of late days has strained all beyond measure. Be patient with one another, each one is equally responsible. Step and look within. Look each one to your own industry and trade. Look to your own conscience and moral responsibility. In the whirls of passing storms seize upon common sense, and holding fast, reach for others who may be hurled by. Forget not the others who are about you. It is as dangerous now as it was just outside the walls of Eden to ask in surprise: "An I my brother's keeper?" Remember, we shall go up or we shall go down together. The great Power which is the Spirit of America must not tolerate any attempt to array class against class, section against section, or sect against sect. Guard against this as you would against a pestilence; the nation has no greater enemy than one <pb facs="5423968_8_0739.jpg" n="3"/>who would thus divide the country against itself.</p>
   <p>More agitation and more motion are not progress. The vicious circle is in the shortest distance between honest effort and highest reward. Remember that one man is better than another only when he proves himself better. Give every well-behaved man his equality of opportunity and require from him his full share of accountability. Live and let live is not enough, we must live and help live, and as you live and help live, find always exact justice and enforce it.</p>
   <p>Within sight of my office is the imposing statue of that Polish patriot, Pulaski. In another nearby park stands the magnificent statue of that other Polish patriot, Kosciuszko. America can never forget the unselfish services of these Polish fighters in the cause of American independence. The Americans of Polish descent love liberty, therefore, they love America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0740.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>With very best wishes for the Convention, I am,</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>W. S. Hayes."</p>
