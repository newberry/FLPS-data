   <p>Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, has voiced an appeal which has affected the entire world. Ambassadors of the United States received copies of this speech a week ago in order to present them to the ministries of foreign affairs of the belligerent nations. For the first time in a hundred years, the President changed the accepted precedent and personally read his recommendations before the Senate of the United States. There can be no doubt that this document of President Wilson's is epochal and that it is the most important document of the entire century.</p>
   <p>For Poland it is of the greatest importance, because it places the Polish question separately and with emphasis as a matter of the gravest importance in the fixing and assurance of lasting peace in the world. The President said:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1071.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture upon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and that henceforth inviolable security of life, of worship, and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own."</p>
   <p>The National Department receives this proclamation with calm and seriousness, but at the same time with deep gratitude, and is sending a telegram of thanksgiving to the President today. At the same time the National Department asks all Polish organizations and publications to send similar telegrams to the President, and simultaneously requests that restraint and decorum be preserved in these telegrams and letters. We ask the Polish press to treat this address and the President's expression concerning Poland with intense gravity so as not to afford those who are hostile toward us and our enemies a pretext for injuring our cause, which has been set forth so favorably in the President's <pb facs="5423968_8_1072.jpg" n="3"/>proclamation.</p>
   <p>The time has not yet come for the National Department to mention the great task which it has undertaken and the preparations which it has made. The mention of the Polish question in the President's address is only the beginning. Therefore we may not speak yet. When the time comes, when we no longer need fear harmful interference with our work, we will announce our plans in detail to our compatriots.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the National Department of the Central Polish Relief Committee:</p>
   <p>J. F. Smulski, president;</p>
   <p>T. M. Helinski, vice-president;</p>
   <p>K. Zychlinski, vice-president;</p>
   <p>H. Setmajer, secretary;</p>
   <p>P. Rostenkowski, treasurer;</p>
   <p>Reverend W. Zapala;</p>
   <p>Reverend B. Celichowski;</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1073.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>S. Szwajkart;</p>
