<title level="a">BOY WHO STOLE MONEY FROM SAINT HYACINTH PARISH FOUND</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>John Rozmarowski, 14, who stole money from Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, pastor of Saint Hyacinth Parish, was found with part of the loot still intact. For two days the police force searched for him in vain, and it took a former policeman, M. Dominowski, who was suspended during the Swift administration for being "unfit," to find the youth. He was the one that found the hiding place of the young thief at the home of J. Piechowicz, 75 Cornelia Street. The boy was arrested last night at eleven o'clock, together with Piechowicz, who was booked for harboring a criminal.</p>
   <p>At the time of the arrest the boy had on his person $117.89 of the stolen money. It is possible that more of the loot will be recovered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dominowski later presented evidence that it was not his "unfitness" <pb facs="5423968_8_0107.jpg" n="2"/>that was responsible for his dismissal, but that his party outlook, or intrigues during the Republican control of the city administration, caused him to lose his position. He should be rewarded by the city for his part in this arrest.</p>
