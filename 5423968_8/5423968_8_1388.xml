   <p>The only link uniting, to a certain extent, Poles during their early sojourn in America were newspapers bringing them news from different Polish settlements in America. Occasionally voices were heard calling for closer unity among the settlements. The Polish Catholic Gazette wrote: "Our countrymen who do not belong to any organization, not even to a parish, do nothing for the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>If there are only five families, organize a society if only for the purpose of lectures and education, and then let the whole organization join the Union. Many of you have been paying dues for three, five, ten, or even fifteen years and then, either on account of business or because of search for work, were forced to move to some other town. You lose all the money you paid, all benefit rights, because you are not of the regular district, and other organizations are not willing to accept you because you are too old or they are demanding an initiation fee."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1389.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such arguments were convincing, especially in those days when settlements were not stable and the settlers were moving from place to place. There were also other causes of a moral nature inducing unity. Lack of understanding and of common action was felt more and more as the years went by. It was plainly visible that though there were many Poles dispersed over the broad lands of the United States, without proper leaders they would be swallowed up by other nationalities.</p>
   <p>In order to prevent this, a group of priests and laymen worked hard and with devotion to form a plan on how to unite all Poles in America into one strong link which could withstand denationalization. This link uniting us all in Christian love was to be the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The first idea of organizing the Union originated during the congress in Detroit in 1873. A committee was elected and empowered to prepare and convoke a second and bigger congress in Chicago. This congress was held in Chicago on October 14, 15, and 16, 1874 and was marked for the laying of the foundation for the Polish Union in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1390.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The duty of the Unions was to preserve the "holy faith" and nationality, mutual fraternal aid, and to work for the furthering of education. In order to accomplish these aims, the constitution was formulated; and in order that the constitution be faithfully and properly executed, an executive board was established. To aid them in their work, the executive board was given a newspaper, which, in its first decade was given the name Gazeta Katolicka (The Catholic Gazette), under the editorship of Mr. John Barzynski.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that in order to realize such great aims as fraternal mutual aid, spreading of education, and the uniting of all true Poles, funds were necessary. It was agreed to collect one dollar per year, dues from every member. This money was used for a good purpose in accordance with the order of the congress. Poor schools were given assistance, orphanages received aid, etc.</p>
   <p>The second congress devoted a great deal of time to the school question. It has the best evidence in the fact that since its very beginning the Union has protected the schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1391.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>During the congress of 1886, it was decided to establish the death benefits. This novelty was looked upon with misgivings. And so after the first death, the newly introduced mortuary benefit ceased to exist. Not till the congress of 1887, in Chicago, were better foundations laid for the death benefit idea which helped to create greater confidence in the new plan.</p>
   <p>The death benefits proved to be valuable in the growth and development of the Union. It was an incentive which grew out of common needs, and induced the Poles to join the Union; it was a chain that united hearts in common work for more effective mutual aid; it was a link of brotherly love; what happened to you to-day, may happen to me to-morrow.</p>
   <p>Since 1888, the official organs of the Union have been Wiaraj Ojczyzna (Faith and Motherland) and later, Narod Polski.</p>
   <p>On April 1, 1905 the Union had 18,344 members, and there was $129,877 in the treasury.</p>
