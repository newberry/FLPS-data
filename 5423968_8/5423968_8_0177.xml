   <p>In a few days four bandits will be hanged; young Polish men just beginning life. Two others are awaiting a life sentence.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to mention at present the murder they did. Sometime before we wrote plenty about them. They killed an innocent man without mercy. How did they become such cold-blooded murderers? Who made those young men such murderers? Who has injured and hardened those hearts? Who is to blame?</p>
   <p>Parents do not care much about their children's education and future; they do not question as to where they were last night, or with whom they keep company, and this is the reason for the results that led them to the gallows.</p>
   <p>This warning to the parents and also to the young men probably will teach some of the young boys and will change their life and bad habits, and will break the contact with the outlaws and the underworld of Chicago.</p>
