   <p>The American newspaper, Chicago Herald and Examiner, in publishing the casualty lists of the American Army listed, among others, the name of Joseph S. Kizior, a Pole, naturally, as the name itself shows, who was seriously wounded in battle, adding that Kizior is an Austrian. The father of the young Pole, Stanslaus Kizior, who lives at 2615 South Kolin Avenue in Chicago, could not stand this, and wrote a letter to the editors of the Herald and Examiner explaining that neither he nor his son is an Austrian, but both are pure-bred Poles. The Herald and Examiner published the correction and apologized for the error, which occurred because of faulty information. The paper added (for itself) that it corrects the error with pleasure.</p>
   <p>Every Pole should emulate Kizior's action whenever anyone knowingly or unknowingly deprives him of his true nationality and lists him with another.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0465.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Errors similar to the one in the Kizior case occur daily by the hundreds in American and other papers, while none of our people correct them, which failure is a wrong against the entire Polish community.</p>
   <p>Young Kizior, on enlisting in the American Army, gave his right name and nationality. Unfortunately, not all of our boys who enlisted in the American Army did likewise, for many of them joined under such names as Miller, Johnson, Smith, Goldstein,Fitizpatrick, and so on, as if they were ashamed of the good names of their fathers, and did not want it known that they are Poles. And it is from this that misunderstandings arise, even bringing upleasantnesses to their families and to the government authorities; for when any of these youngsters are killed or wounded in battle, the authorities go to their addresses, look for Millers or Smiths, and find instead Lisowskis, Skowronskis, Janowskis, or other similar Polish names; then they are at a loss, especially when it comes to the payment of insurance, to find the killed or wounded soldier's relatives.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0466.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On the other hand, this changing and twisting of Polish names on the part of the soldiers gives us no good idea of how many Poles have enlisted in the American Army, nor how many were killed or wounded. The Polish papers follow the American papers in publishing the Polish names in the casualty lists of the American Army, taking the names that are definitely Polish or similar to Polish. How many on these casualty lists issued by the military authorities are Poles who took names other than Polish, or did not list themselves a Poles, we cannot tell. And it is to our own interest, when our boys are killed or wounded, to point out to the American government and people how great a percentage of our young men we have given to the army and how much Polish blood is being shed for a great and sacred cause. In this way we would gain greater respect and the cause of our homeland--and its future--would profit immensely.</p>
   <p>The Jews, although they have not given a relatively high percentage of men to the army, at least not as volunteers, shout at the tops of their voices how many of their men are in the army. But the Jews are not twisting their names, they are underlining them rather, so that the Americans may know how <pb facs="5423968_8_0467.jpg" n="4"/>loyal and useful they are to this country. Even the Germans, as well as the Swedes, Bohemians, and other national groups do likewise in their own understandable interests.</p>
   <p>Among us there are a great number of individuals who are ashamed of their names and nationality, and, in this way, immeasurably harm our mutual cause. There are a great many Poles in Uncle Sam's army, many tens of thousands, but their names do not show it.</p>
   <p>If, during the census, the Poles in this country had not allowed themselves to be listed as Prussians, Austrians, or Russians, depending upon the occupation of the part of Poland in which they were born, there would have been more of us listed, and fewer Germans, Austrians, and Russians; as a consequence, we would be respected more in this country, and we would be more reckoned with in commercial, industrial, and political circles; we would have considerably greater influence and significance than we have now, which is entirely our own fault.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0468.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A good Catholic never denies that he is a Catholic; he will cross himself even in the street and proclaim his faith. In the same way, a good Pole should never deny his nationality anywhere or at any time, for it is at least no worse than any other. Follow the example of Kizior, who was indignant and protested vigorously, even though he was called an Austrian through an unintentional error. All Poles should act as did Kizior.</p>
   <p>Today it is the highest honor to be a Pole. Poland and her people have been recognized by the entire world, with the exception of the hated Teutons, and a Pole certainly does not need to--and should not be ashamed of his nationality. We have placed ourselves among the first nations of the world; we are fighting beside them for democracy and freedom of all the nations on earth; we have a great past, heroic and unblemished, and we desire a greater future for our homeland and people. At every point, then, let us "underline" our nationality and hold our heads high with pride when we say to people of other blood, "I am a Pole!"</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0469.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>A good member of the Polish National Alliance will also never be ashamed of his organization, but proudly wearing the Alliance pin upon his breast, and, when questioned, will answer to everyone, "I am a member of the Polish National Alliance!"</p>
