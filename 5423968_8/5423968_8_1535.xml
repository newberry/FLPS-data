   <p>A meeting of the Educational Department of the Polish League was held last night. At the meeting many important matters were discussed, and a number of resolutions were passed.</p>
   <p>Among the many matters taken up were the plans for opening of two more libraries, the fourth and fifth arrangements were also made to publish the second book. Plans were begun for an entertainment program to raise more funds, for the regular contributions have been exhausted. It was also decided to start another drive for the cause of the Educational Department.</p>
   <p>A complete financial statement for the past three months will be published within the near future.</p>
   <p>Reverend Jachimiak became a member of the Educational Department by special <pb facs="5423968_8_1536.jpg" n="2"/>invitation.</p>
   <p>According to previous plans, three lectures were included in this meeting, namely: Ignacy Kowalski on "Trzy Rozbiory" (The Three Partitions [of Poland]) and "Konstytucya Trzeciego Maja" (The Constitution of the Third of May); Szczesny Zahajkiewicz on "Thaddeus Kosciusko"; and Stanislaus Szwajkart on "Polish Insurrections After the Partitions".</p>
   <p>A collection for the Educational Department brought $2.75.</p>
