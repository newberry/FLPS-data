   <p>A great number of Poles served in the American Army during the recent World War. Many of those who enlisted and many who were drafted, did not have their second citizen papers. Some of them received their papers in the different camps. Naturalization certificates, however, were not given to everybody. There are 1500 certificates of naturalization waiting at the government bureau of naturalization in Chicago, and practically one-half of these are made to men with Polish names,living in different parts of the states of Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan. The Chicago bureau has all of the naturalization certificates from Camp Grant, Camp Custer and the Great Lakes.</p>
   <p>In the next few days we will publish a list of all certificates having Polish names, and those whose names will appear in Polish newspapers, let them call personally, as soon as possible, or write a letter to the office: American Naturalization League, 156 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois. The Bureau will try to give the certificates to all of those to whom they were made out. The government did not send these certificates out, due to lack of address.</p>

   <p>In Chicago and vicinity there are a great number of Poles who served in the American army and did not receive their citizen papers; such soldiers have a right to receive citizen papers. They will receive their papers free of charge by calling at the above mentioned bureau and presenting their honorable discharge. For the benefit of such soldiers the government has passed a special law, which excuses them from some of the formalities. Such soldiers receive their papers in a short time, sometimes in a few days, if in camp they did not turn down United States citizenship. The one who in camp, upon being asked, if he wished to become a citizen of the United States answered that he did not want the papers, that one now cannot receive his papers.</p>
   <p>Service in France is not necessary to receive citizen papers. It will be sufficient to present an honorable discharge.</p>
   <p>All of those who served in the American Army should take advantage of this opportunity. Candidates of this kind should hurry, because the term of their naturalization with the help of their war service, ends in one year from the time the government withdraws its armies from the area of the recent World War. A year from the time the armies are withdrawn one will not be able to <pb facs="5423968_8_0409.jpg" n="3"/>take advantage of this special statute of the United States Congress.</p>
