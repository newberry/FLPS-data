<title level="a">LIEUTENANT JOSEPH PALCZYNSKI CITED IN POLICE DAILY BULLETIN</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Police newspaper, Daily Bulletin, of January 8, carried an article in which Lieutenant Joseph Palczynski of the Chicago police, president of Council 41, Polish National Alliance (St. Hedwig's Parish) was especially commended.</p>
   <p>The article contains the report made by the captain of the 21st Police District, citing Palczynski for his "efficient and untiring work." The report read as follows:</p>
   <p>"To the first Deputy superintendent: At about eight o'clock in the morning on July 2, 1917, C. E. Beard, secretary and treasurer of the National Tea Company, and William Sales, an official of the same firm, went to the bank at 1628 North California Avenue to pick up $25,000. in cash.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0048.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"As the officials of the above-mentioned firm were returning from the bank with the money, they were attacked by three bandits who forced them to give up the money they carried,under the threat of death, and fled northward on California Avenue. The bandits disappeared in a moment; as it later developed, they went through an alley to Mozart Street, where an automobile awaited them.</p>
   <p>"Lieutenant Joseph Palczynski, of the 34th Precinct, arrived upon the scene of the robbery with several other policemen about five minutes after the robbery occurred. After the victims had given an accurate description of the bandits, he set out in pursuit. His efforts were to no avail, for the bandits escaped.</p>
   <p>"Lieutenant Palczynski then applied to higher police authorities to assign Miss Marie Boyd, a policewoman, to the 34th Precinct. In the meantime, the <pb facs="5423968_8_0049.jpg" n="3"/>victims were taken to police headquarters, where they were shown photographs of various bandits and robbers known to the police. Among these, they recognized one of their attackers, a man named Stead, who had been sentenced for robbery before. A warrant for his arrest was issued, but it was found that Stead had left the city immediately after the robbery.</p>
   <p>"Policewoman Boyd, under orders from Lieutenant Palczynski, worked steadily to gain some clue to his whereabouts, and finally, on October 19, 1917, she found that he had returned to Chicago. She arrested him the same day in a barbershop at Grace Street and Broadway.</p>
   <p>"Stead was identified by the officials of the National Tea Company as one of the men who had robbed them on California Avenue on that memorable morning. He was held under $50,000 bond.</p>
   <p>"The excellent outcome, the result of experience and diligence, has earned <pb facs="5423968_8_0050.jpg" n="4"/>Lieutenant Palczynski and Policewoman Boyd recognition in the Daily Bulletin.</p>
   <p>"Henry E. Gorman,</p>
   <p>"H. F. Schuettler,</p>
   <p>"General Superintendent of Police"</p>
