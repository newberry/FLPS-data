</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance was founded in 1880 as a purely Polish, free, independent, and patriotic organization.</p>
   <p>The first congress in Chicago passed the laws that the Executive Board of the Polish National Alliance should be composed of the Central Committee and the Censor whose duty, as the first officer of the Alliance, it was to control all activities of the Central Committee. He must also be heedful lest the laws passed by congress of the Alliance are violated.</p>
   <p>The aims of the Alliance according to the first paragraph of the constitution, are to care for moral and material development of the Polish element in the United States by forming and establishing certain institutions based on the principles of the Roman-Catholic Church. Such institutions are: Polish <pb facs="5423968_8_1372.jpg" n="2"/>Houses (separate from homes), schools, charitable institutions, and Polish industrial establishments.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 2--The guardianship over the Polish immigration in America.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 3--Political upbuilding of the Polish immigration as American citizens with the help of the official organ of the Alliance and by making closer contacts with the native American press for the protection of the Polish interests. It must be insisted upon that every new member should take steps toward securing American citizenship.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 4--The commemoration and observance of Polish patriotic holidays to the greater glory of Poland, and the fulfillment of the duties imposed upon us by our national honor.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 5--Temperance and moderation in the use of alcoholic beverages for the members of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Article III, paragraph 1 states: Because the Roman-Catholic religion is the "reigning" faith of the Polish people, we deem it our duty to abide by it and to live according to its precepts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1373.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Article III, paragraph 2 says: The Polish National Alliance is not taking part in religious discussions because it is the province of the Holy See and the bishops of the church.</p>
   <p>Article III, paragraph 3, states: Because whereas among the Polish nation are also a certain number of Poles who profess other religious beliefs besides that of the Roman Catholic, we obey the laws as set forth by the constitution on the 3rd of May, 1791, which guarantee them the freedom of religion and admit them, as Poles, to our organization that we all may work together for the good of the Polish nation. This last paragraph, or rather the practice of it, was the cause of the inflexible fight between the Roman-Catholic Union and the Polish National Alliance. This fight was intensified for a short period after the Alliance' congress in Cleveland in 1895. Up to that time the Socialists and the members of the Polish independent church were not admitted to membership.</p>
   <p>As a result of propaganda and agitation by the editor of Zgoda, Mr. Jablonski, <pb facs="5423968_8_1374.jpg" n="4"/>"for equal rights for all", the congress in Cleveland, after long and animated discussions, struck out the paragraph pertaining to religion and opened wide the gates of its institution declaring that the Alliance admits all Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians without restrictions to their political, religious, and social views. All the official divine services must take place in the Roman-Catholic Church because the Roman-Catholic religion is the religion of the majority of the Polish people.</p>
   <p>In order to secure the protection of the laws of the country, the charter was obtained; the institution was reorganized and the new constitution adopted during the extraordinary sessions of congress in Chicago which doesn't even mention religion. Anarchists and criminals are forbidden membership in the Alliance up to this day.</p>
   <p>This intense fight which broke out after the Cleveland congress, slowly subsided, because the Alliance, after showing a rapid growth in membership <pb facs="5423968_8_1375.jpg" n="5"/>and treasury, gained for itself the right to existence, and is today, as far as membership and property is concerned, the greatest Polish organization in the world. Formerly, to the Alliance, the Union was not patriotic enough, so now the Alliance is not religious enough for the Union.</p>
   <p>During its third congress the Union unites again with all the church societies and prepares for the fight with the Alliance. And so, when the delegates of the Alliance gathered in Chicago in September 1885, for the third congress, they were refused the divine services for the success of their deliberations. The Alliance immediately sent complaints to the ecclesiastical authorities. The matter reached, not only the bishops in America, but Rome as well.</p>
   <p>Of all the aims that the Alliance had set for itself, the building of Polish Houses, schools, charitable institutions, the fostering of Polish industry, the Immigrants' Home, and the commemoration of the Polish national holidays, only the last one was completely realized, the others <pb facs="5423968_8_1376.jpg" n="6"/>were attained only in part or not at all.</p>
   <p>Recently, however, the Alliance broadened the field of its activities for the congress of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and organized the committees for education, commerce and industry, immigration and colonization. There is also a committee for the assistance of the members who are victims of misfortune.</p>
   <p>Now that the Alliance has won the fight for its existence the other aims that it had set for itself may be realized. Impartial people agree that the Alliance was the first to celebrate the Polish national holidays. The spokesman for the Alliance says: "Let those who are finding fault with us ask our brothers in the Alliance who taught them to love Mother-Poland, who instilled in them the idea of the necessity of the union in thoughts and actions with our old and poor native land."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1377.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Toward the end of 1885 the membership increased considerably and a better future seemed to be dawning because few Polish priests were taking an active part in the work of the Alliance. This had such a salutary influence that at the opening of the sixth congress in Bay City in 1886 there were sixty delegates representing forty four groups. Altogether the Alliance had then forty four groups and 1,893 members.</p>
   <p>On the motion of Rev. D. Kajer, Mr. Brodowski drew up a resolution protesting against the violence and outrages committed against our brothers in the Prussian part of Poland and sent it to Berlin, Vienna and Lwow (Lemberg).</p>
   <p>In the same year, after paying off the shareholders, the Zgoda becomes the exclusive property of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>In order to better attract members to the new organization the founders <pb facs="5423968_8_1378.jpg" n="8"/>decided to include the death benefit in the sphere of its activities. But on account of its slow growth, it could not be put into effect until 1886 when the fifth congress,observing the notable increase of members, decided finally that in case of death of the member his wife receives <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and in case of death of the wife of the member he receives $250. At present the death benefits range from $300-$900.</p>
   <p>Since the reorganization of congress and the requirements of the law, the women have equal rights with men.</p>
   <p>The continuous attacks of the majority of the Polish Roman-Catholic priests compelled several Polish citizens to submit the constitution of the Alliance to the archbishop of New York and to the bishop of Newark in order to obtain their judgement. Both these church dignitaries approved the constitution completely. This approbation exerted a wholesome influence on the development of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1379.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Of no lesser importance to the Alliance were the activities of its censor, Mr. F. Gryglaszewski, who, as a federal building inspector, was constrained to travel continuously in an official capacity, all over this country. Never did he neglect even the slightest opportunity to spread the words of truth about our Alliance and was always coaxing our countrymen to flock under its banner, encouraging the timid and enlightening the misinformed. The results of his activities were seen in the increase of membership from 1,893 to 3,210 in one year.</p>
   <p>Another great move in the history of the Alliance was the founding by the Central Committee of the National Treasury, which was transferred to Rappersville, Switzerland after the Cleveland congress of 1895. The members of the Alliance never ceased supplying the National Treasury with money.</p>
   <p>In 1886 a Polish seminary was established in Detroit, Michigan through <pb facs="5423968_8_1380.jpg" n="10"/>the efforts of Rev. Dabrowski who appealed to the congress of the Alliance for the support of his endeavors. The members of the Alliance imposed on themselves a voluntary tax for the benefit of the seminary. The enemies of the Alliance, angered because several Polish priests became members, issued a statement in which our organization was depicted in the worst light and 1887, established a weekly Holy Water Sprinkler (Kropidto) whose express purpose was not only blackening, but if possible, complete annihilation of the Alliance. The publishers did not attain their intended purpose. The Holy Water Sprinkler expired after fifteen months, but as a remembrance it left a complete party of its adherents who received the name of the Holy Water Sprinklers.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1888 the Central Committee of the Polish National Alliance took an important step when it sent to the Prefect (Head) of the propagation of faith in Rome, Cardinal Ledochowski, a complaint against a certain part of the Polish priests on account of the constant and unjust persecution of the Alliance. The complaint was signed by 2,470 members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1381.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>The eighth congress, held in Buffalo in 1889, was a turning point in the history of the Alliance. In this congress three Polish priests took part. They were, Rev. D. Majer, Rev. W. Domagalski, and Rev. J. Wojcik. The congress was deliberating upon the subject of adding certain amendments to the constitution when Rev. Domagalski made a motion to add to paragraph 3, article IV "with the exclusion of the notorious infidels and the Jews". What took place then is described by Rev. J. Wojcik in the following words: "During the first day the motion was under discussion and was carried with a majority of votes. On the second day somebody made a move to discuss again the motion that was passed yesterday. Rev. Majer objects and threatens that the priests will leave the Alliance if the motion that was voted on is not accepted.</p>
   <p>"The matter was hushed up. But to our surprise it was again brought up for discussion during the afternoon session. We priests kept silent, for now we saw the machinations of the leaders. And so when that motion was finally rejected with the majority of votes, we left the hall."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1382.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>The minutes of the session adds that Mr. Sleszynski, a delegate from New York City, shouted enthusiastically after the priests, "You can walk out but the Poles will remain in the Alliance." The motion of Rev. Major was defeated with thirty-one votes against eight.</p>
   <p>The majority of the delegates were of the opinion that in the face of the proclamation of the National Government in 1863 (Polish Revolution of 1863) the Poles of Mosaic or other confession should not be kept out of patriotic activities because it would be against the principles, on which must be based a truly patriotic organization.</p>
   <p>Up to the congress in Buffalo, Rev. Domagalski was a contributor, without pay to Zgoda. His able articles were directed against the Resurrectionist Fathers for their hostile stand toward the Alliance. Later Rev. Domagalski went over to the Resurrectionists and directed his attacks against the Alliance, this time less ably but more brutally.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1383.jpg" n="13"/>
   <p>There is a belief in the Alliance that Rev. Domagalski intended to trip Rev. Majer with his motion about the exclusion of Jews and the notorious infidels because Rev. Majer was held in greater esteem and was exerting stronger influence in the Alliance than himself.</p>
   <p>After the motion of Rev. Domagalski was vetoed Rev. Majer together with other priests were forced to leave the Alliance and form a new organization, the Roman-Catholic Union. A severe partisan fight began to rage.</p>
   <p>For some time afterwards it seems that there were no Poles in America but only the Unionists and the Alliance men. Those who were not members of the Alliance were not regarded as Poles, and one that was not a member of the Union was not regarded by the Unionists as a Catholic. Whoever, in America, wanted to be a Catholic and a Pole at the same time found himself between the devil and the deep sea.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1384.jpg" n="14"/>
   <p>But now times have changed and the fights ceased.</p>
   <p>During the congress of 1889, Mr. A. Mallek of Chicago was elected general secretary of the Alliance. When the newly elected Central Committee came to take over the books and the treasury from the former general secretary, Mr. Morgenstern, he could not be found. He disappeared, taking the whole treasury with him. Fright and panic seized everybody. And to make matters worse the newly elected vice-censor, Mr. K. D. Nowak, taking advantage of his official position, began duping and cheating the parishioners of St. Adalbert's church in Buffalo, wheedling money out of them under various pretexts; such as sending a delegation to Rome with a complaint, etc. The Alliance was in a very critical situation. It was saved only through the energy of the Central Committee which immediately fired Mr. Nowak and sued the surety company that bonded Mr. Morgenstern.</p>
   <p>The second time the Alliance was in trouble was after the congress in <pb facs="5423968_8_1385.jpg" n="15"/>Philadelphia, in 1897, when its treasurer, Mr. Wleklinski, ran away with the funds. But this time also the energetic action of the Central Committee saved the organization. The defalcation was repaid. The Alliance showed a constant growth.</p>
   <p>During the congress of 1891 the delegates were greatly surprised by the letter of Dr. n from Washington, D. C., offering his library worth $7,000 to the Alliance, as well as his collection of important documents pertaining to Polish history and Polish immigration in America, with the condition that the Alliance use it as part of a public library and a national museum. The congress accepted this gift.</p>
   <p>During the divine services, before the opening of Congress in Detroit in 1891, Bishop Foley, who blessed the work of the Alliance, was supposed to have said, "I am well aware of the fact that there are certain Polish priests that persecute the Alliance, but you must not pay any attention to it, for we all know that there are some bad examples among the priests, and all the groundless charges and accusations will fall sooner or later."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1386.jpg" n="16"/>
   <p>And so they fell. In 1896 they began to build a new structure in which to house the offices and printing presses of the Alliance. The foundation stone was consecrated by Rev. Sztuczko, pastor of the Holy Trinity church. The building itself was not consecrated.</p>
   <p>It would be worthwhile to mention here, an interesting fact. Rev. Waclaw Kruszka received a letter from archbishop Kotzer forbidding him to perform the consecration of the new Alliance building, although Rev. Kruszka had no intentions of doing it as he was not even asked to take part in the ceremonies. One may easily guess who was instrumental in causing this order to be issued.</p>
   <p>The gradual and steady growth of the Alliance can best be shown by figures.</p>
