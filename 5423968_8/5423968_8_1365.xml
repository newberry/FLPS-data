<title level="a">MEMORIAL DAY PARADE TO THE FOOT OF KOSCI USZKO'S MONUMENT</title></bibl>

   <p>Summary:</p>
   <p>The celebration held Memorial Day at the foot of Kosciuszko's monument was a beautiful manifestation of Polish patriotism to the hero of two countries. Because this American holiday fell on a Saturday, a few Polish citizens thought that it would serve the purpose for the Polish people to pay tribute to Kosciuszke's monument in Humboldt Park and show the other nationalities that the Polish people in Chicago did not forget about their here.</p>
   <p>A few thousand Poles, among them the aged and the young, did not pay any attention to the prediction of bad weather but took part in this parade. The people gathered at the corner of Division and Milwaukee Avenues, displaying banners, flags and society emblems. The people along Division Street joined in the parade as they passed by until they reached the foot of the monument.</p>

   <p>The Polish cavalry was first in line at the post of the speakers' stand, the second group was the P. N. A. Singers' Society of America, under the direction of Mr. J. B. Wieklinski. They sang Polish songs and the Star Spangled Banner; the Polish army group under Capt. B. S. Maciejewski, paraded and displayed the Polish flag, banners and their uniforms.</p>
   <p>President of the committee in charge of this parade was Mr. Mazur, who gave the opening speech, this was followed by the P. N. A. Singers under Mr. R. Hensla's directions sang, "Look, Kosciuszko, at us from heaven"; Mr. P. Helinski made a speech thanking the Polish people for taking so much interest in memory of our hero Kosciuszke.</p>
   <p>Mr. Busse, County Commissioner, and Mr. Zalewski, gave speeches which were followed by all the people singing, "Boze cos Polske."</p>
