   <p>Yesterday evening at St. Stanislaus Hall, corner of Noble and Bradley Streets, the society, Polish Falcons, No. 2, gave an Orange Ball. Many people attended and enjoyed themselves immensely; music was supplied by Mr. F. Przybylewski's band. When it came to the "White Polka" the men began to vie with each other in purchasing oranges for the ladies, each wanting the lady of his choice to be acclaimed queen of the ball. More than seven hundred oranges were sold at the ball. Mrs. Berendt, of 3242 North Hamlin Avenue, was proclaimed queen. After she had been presented with a beautiful bouquet, she led the polonaise with Mr. J. Szymanski, director of the Polish National Alliance. Mr. S.J. Czechowicz, general secretary of the Polish National Alliance, and Mr. Szymanski, formed the second couple. The party was a huge success. We can expect that the mask ball, which this Society will give at Walsh Hall on January 12, will bring a substantial sum for the building of the Falcons' home. The board of directors of the Falcons, No. 2, is composed of the following: K. Zychlinski, president; <pb facs="5423968_8_1248.jpg" n="2"/>J. Mlotowski, vice-president; H. Setmajer, general secretary; J. Tylia, financial secretary; J.M. Romanowicz, treasurer; P. Kempisty, J.P. Kornaszewski, H. Niewolkiewicz, financial advisors.....[Editor's note: The committee on arrangements is then given.]</p>
