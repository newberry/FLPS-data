   <p>Whereas the Poles leaving America for Poland have met with great difficulties in trying to obtain American passports, Mr. John F. Smulski has entered a protest to the Department of State against the unnecessary regulations and demands. This protest has been taken into consideration, and the difficulties have been removed, which is evident from the following letter printed here in its original form.</p>
   <p>Department of State, Washington</p>
   <p>June 17, 1922</p>
   <p>Mr. John F. Smulski</p>
   <p>President National Polish Committee of America, 1214 N. Ashland Avenue Chicago</p>
   <p>Sir: The Department acknowledges receipt of your letter of June 13, 1922, in which you complain on behalf of the members of your organization, that <pb facs="5423968_8_0736.jpg" n="2"/>the restrictions imposed by this Department upon applicants for passports to Poland are onerous and request to be informed when the restrictions complained of may be removed or changed.</p>
   <p>In reply, you are advised that many of the restrictions complained of have been removed by this department within the past few days, as a result the department is now freely issuing passports to Poland without requiring, as heretofore, documentary evidence showing the necessity for visiting that country. You are further advised that the department is at this time considering the matter of abolishing all wartime restrictions relating to the issue and use of passports.</p>
   <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
   <p>(signed) Phillip Adams</p>
   <p>Chief, Division Passport Control.</p>
  </body>
