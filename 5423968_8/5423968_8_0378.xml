   <p>[Translator's note. The Weekly Zgoda, published at 1408 W. Division street, Chicago, is the official organ of the Polish National Alliance, a predominantly Polish national organization, founded in 1880, carrying also a life insurance business, but only as secondary in importance to its nationalistic purposes and aims among the Polish immigrants. The Polish National Alliance by the power of its organization, comprising about 300,000 insured members, and by the confidence it gained among the Polish people because of the wise and faithful discharging of its nationalistic mission among the Polish immigrants in this country - plays the role of a guardian in nationalistic affairs over the Polish immigrants, reliably showing them the right way to be followed and the wrong one to be shunned. With this elucidation in mind it will be easy to see the reason of the zealousness, shown by the editor in the following article.]</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0379.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are noticeable among the Polish immigrants in this country some ominous signs pointing to the fact that the evolution of the leading Polish thought in America is becoming depraved and demonstrates the decadence of Polish immigrants, of which decadence neither the Poles in this country nor those in Poland can be proud. We mean that the Polish nationalistic idea a are losing ground among the Polish immigrants, and in their stead there appears a conglomeration of new Polish nationalistic concepts which, if applied to the everyday life, may cause very undesirable effects.</p>
   <p>These ominous signs are appearing simultaneously from different directions, not in the least abruptly or transiently, but systematically and steadily.</p>
   <p>There is, namely, in some Polish-American newspapers a constant tendency to preach the destructive doctrine of a special Polish "race" in America - a race, which, even though dispossessed of the Polish language, is supposed to remain Polish in spirit. Such doctrine is being favored and stealthily propagated by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, for the simple reason that the <pb facs="5423968_8_0380.jpg" n="3"/>church administration would find it much more convenient to manage all church affairs with the use of one common language, English preferred, than to deal with multi-language congregations. The same kind of an Americanization tendency can be noticed in some of the Roman-Catholic Polish parishes, among the Polish clergy and parochial committees, favoring the thought that it would be possible to have "Polish churches" even if there would be no Polish language used either in the church or in the parochial school.</p>
   <p>In line with the above noted suggestions, there is being promulgated by our enemies a third theory, namely, that Polish insurance and benevolent associations should also discard their nationalistic tendencies and, following the example of American insurance associations, mind their insurance and humanitarian business only.</p>
   <p>Now, this last theory, very plausible to some, is naive in its form, destructive in its purpose and dangerous in its concealed tendency. First <pb facs="5423968_8_0381.jpg" n="4"/>of all, our Polish insurance organizations cannot imitate the American insurance companies, for the simple reason that our Polish immigrants formed Alliances and Unions for preserving the national languages and national traditions, rather than devising "companies" from which to draw material profits. Both institutions are, therefore, divergent in the fundamental purpose of their existence. Also - and this applies especially to the Polish National Alliance - most of our Polish organizations, carrying with them for practical reasons the insurance business, have been formed in the period of Poland's political enslavment, (1795-1918); therefore, by the necessity of national duty, they had to remain in unity with Poland so enslaved. This means that they had to keep up among the Polish immigrants not only the spirit of unity with the motherland, but also to see to it that said immigrants fulfil their material duties in helping to realize the independence of Poland.</p>
   <p>The insurance scheme has been introduced into our Polish organizations as a necessary cement with which to sustain the unity and coherence of the <pb facs="5423968_8_0382.jpg" n="5"/>first thousands, and then the tens of thousands of the members and groups of these organizations.</p>
   <p>Experience and practice have proved that without such cement, without such financial constraint to pay, there could not exist and prosper among the Polish immigrants any organization. Least of all would this be possible in the case of any outstanding organization that could sometimes collect substantial sums of money for Polish nationalistic and political purposes, which have nothing in common with the insurance "business."</p>
   <p>To those, therefore, who advise us to imitate the American insurance companies we reply that in such a case we would have to discard all our Polish nationalistic ideology and become drowned in the surge of American business in the name of the insurance dollar, and only the dollar, for there would be left nothing else. It is too obvious that we cannot <pb facs="5423968_8_0383.jpg" n="6"/>follow such advice on the part of some minds; constituting the third link in the chain of our Polish national decadence in this country. The majority of our Polish immigrants, however, fully approves the policy set up and followed by the Polish National Alliance and by other Polish organizations. It is sincerely hoped that this traditional order of things will be preserved indefinitely.</p>
