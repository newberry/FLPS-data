   <p>Purchase building for a higher school.</p>
   <p>$175,000 has been paid for an estate estimated to be worth a million dollars. Cheerful news came to us from Cambridge Springs, Pa., where the board of supervisors, the commissioners of education of the Polish National Alliance, and chairman, A. Schreiber, held a conference and, after thorough inspection The Hotel Vanadium was purchased. It will be used as a college and home for the aged and invalid members of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The following members of the P.N.A., and representatives of the Polish press were present: Censor of the P.N.A., A. Schreiber, Buffalo, N. Y; Vice-censor, H. Niedzwiedzki, Cleveland, O.; 13 Commissioners of the P.N.A. from various states, as members of the board of supervisors; 10 members of the board of directors, Chicago; J. Smietanka, Attorney for the P.N.A., and representatives of the following Polish papers: Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Zgoda, Dziennik Narodowy, from Chicago; Kurjer Polski, Nowiny Polskie, from Milwaukee; Dziennik Polski, Detroit; Narodowiec, Cleveland; and 13 members of the board of the P.N.A. from Pennsylvania.</p>

   <p>The Delegates of the P.N.A. and Polish newspaper representative arrived on Tuesday to make an inspection of the Hotel Vanadium. The palatial hotel is a seven story structure with 400 rooms which are completely furnished. The building is surrounded with trees. Mineral and spring water, as well as a small lake form a part of the 200 acre property, which is located in the highest section of Cambridge - Springs.</p>
   <p>The building, erected at a cost of $700,000, had been used as a hotel and health resort for millionaires, but because of heavy losses was advertised for sale; and we were the lucky buyers.</p>
   <p>A contract for $175,000 was signed, and the Polish National Alliance will take immediate possession.</p>
