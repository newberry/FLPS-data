   <p>Last Friday between the hours of 6 and 10 in the morning there was played the last act of a drama, whose main actor was Frank Lewandowski, wife murderer.</p>
   <p>The jail warden officially notified Lewandowski, that he was at his journey's end as far as his wandering on this earth is concerned and that he must pay with his life for his crime so the condemmed man began preparing himself for death. Governor Yates positively turned down the pleas of the attorneys of the condemmed man, demanding a new trial and with this confirmed a decree of death. The last religious consolation was given him by Rev. Zapala and in his last hours he was attended and comforted by the Sisters of Nazareth. Lewandowski psend his last moments in prayer and ended his life with the words "Jesus - Mary and St. Joseph".</p>
   <p>He went to his death bravely and convinced that God had forgiven him even if the people refused him forgiveness.</p>
