   <p>Compatriots!</p>
   <p>Over a year ago the Polish League of America was organized during Polish Day in Chicago. The purpose of this organization was to unite the forces of all the Polish people living in the United States for the common interest of the Polish national cause. At the mass meeting held on May 8 it was agreed to hold a convention of the Polish League every three years. It was also agreed, however, to hold the next convention during May of the following year, because that year was to be one of preparedness and organization. It was recommended to the newly elected officers of the Polish League that they engage themselves in bringing to life the Educational and Welfare departments and establish agencies of the League throughout the country, and in this way build a foundation upon which the League's various branches might develop their activity in the future.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1523.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For reasons beyond the control of the administration, this body was forced, after careful consideration and suggestions by the delegates, to delay this convention a few months and hold it in September. This change was also made on the grounds that a number of large Polish organizations were to have diets during the month of May of that year. This change lessened the possibility of failure of the meeting. In compliance with a motion that this convention be held in a city cast of Chicago, the administrative body chose Toledo, Ohie.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the time for this gathering is approaching, the officials of the Polish League of America urge all Poles residing in the United States to become members of this great organization, whose past and future may best be judged by what was accomplished last year. The Educational Department began functioning just a little more than six months ago and since then has won inestimable recognition. Without any doubt, the work of this branch will become far greater as soon as its constitution, which has been formulated, is agreed upon at the coming convention; in this way much prestige will be added <pb facs="5423968_8_1524.jpg" n="3"/>to its work and development. The Welfare Department has worked out its own laws and will present them for approval in September. As soon as it receives authorization, this department will also start its work, which will grow in importance.</p>
   <p>The officers have succeeded in establishing agencies of the League from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans; these agencies now number thirty and will be considerably more by the time the convention is called.</p>
   <p>Preparations for future activity have been arranged by the administration of the Polish League during this year, and will be carried out by the departments with the assistance of the agencies already in existence and those that are to he opened. Numerous unexpected obstacles and difficulties have been met by the governing body; these may have lessened the growth but have not destroyed the idea of the Polish League nor brought damage to its recognition in general.</p>
   <p>In order that the coming convention may bring about the most favorable results, <pb facs="5423968_8_1525.jpg" n="4"/>and manage not only to strengthen the organization but also to place it upon the most stable foundation for the development of its work, the undersigned officers of the Polish League desire to encourage all their compatriots in America, regardless of party affiliations, to enter this organization, which has noble aims and great hopes, in large numbers; in this way the League will be in a position to carry out its aims completely, when the forces of all willing workers are united on the field of action for the common good of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>In truth, during the course of the year, many objections were raised against the miner statutes of the League and many feasible reasons were given under the assumption that certain individuals were not permitted to join this organization. But these faults, compared to the more important purposes, are trivial and can be easily ironed out as soon as there is a demand for this from one side and co-operation from the other. That is why the coming months prior to the convention in September are suitable for taking up such matters. After reaching some general agreement you should recommend such changes as you <pb facs="5423968_8_1526.jpg" n="5"/>may deem necessary, relative to the statutes of the Polish League, to the administrative heads. Those who object to some of the statutes, those who oppose some of the actions of the League but are not against the main principles, yet are of the opinion that their entrance into the organization is barred, may bring up the matter at the convention where they will be heard and such modifications made in the statutes as will eliminate any further objections and dislikes in the future.</p>
   <p>All Polish papers are requested to publish this appeal.</p>
   <p>In the name of the administration of the Polish League,</p>
   <p>Joseph Napieralski, president</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Szwajkart, secretary</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, treasurer</p>
