  <body>
   <p>We are printing in the adjoining column a statement made by the censor of the Polish National Alliance, in which he defends and indorses the political policies pursued up to the present by the Alliance.</p>
   <p>We remind you that, according to the rules and by-laws of the constitution of the Polish National Alliance, the censor is the highest authority in this respect, and his decisions or the decisions of the Advisory Board cannot be appealed.</p>
   <p>In his explanation, the censor is not speaking only in his own name but in the name of the entire Advisory Board of the Polish National Alliance, that is, the thirty commissioners who live in various states and who do not have the means of forming a collective opinion.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All the commissioners of the Polish National Alliance, whose opinion the censor sounded, have agreed to one thing, namely, to that which the censor is announcing today and communicating to the Alliance members. In a fatherly manner, as befits the highest officers of the Polish National Alliance, the censor reminds the troublemakers that their insinuations about the Alliance are too small to hurt it.</p>
   <p>Our organization and its officers act in accordance with the [Alliance's] constitution and strive by all legal means for the liberation and union of all Polish lands. But nowhere in the constitution of the Polish National Alliance has it been stated that this Alliance should agree to the political policies which all sorts of socialists of the Prussophile camp want to force upon it.</p>
   <p>The censor appeals from his heart to the brothers and sisters in the Alliance who have gone astray and who have allowed themselves to be deceived by the prophets who are false to Poland and who are inclined rather to force the will of the majority into accordance with their personal views and opinions than to <pb facs="5423968_8_1067.jpg" n="3"/>submit themselves to the will of the majority. They rant and storm in the Alliance ranks, bringing in confusion and bitterness. It is not yet too late for these people to be converted and to listen to the voice of the highest officers of the Polish National Alliance, their chosen leaders, who do not love Poland any less than do these political fanatics, and who wish her well.</p>
   <p>Surely, everyone can perceive that the voice of the Advisory Board of the Polish National Alliance is the voice of the members of the Alliance in general, because the members voluntarily have chosen their state commissioners without any outside force or pressure, and have given these commissioners the authority to express themselves on the most important matters.</p>
   <p>Read today's article by the censor and judge for yourselves who is right and who is merely leading you astray, and then proceed in accordance with this judgment.</p>
