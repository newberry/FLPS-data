   <p>Summary: Last Sunday was a historical day in the annals of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, the largest Polish Roman-Catholic organization in America. The consecration of the corner stone of the now home of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union was performed yesterday afternoon. According to statements of those who witnessed the celebration, there has not been such a great celebration and parade since the unveiling of the Koseiuszko moment in 1904. The weather was ideal, a bright and fair autumn day. Over 50,000 people participated in the celebration.</p>
   <p>About 2 o'clock in the afternoon great throngs of people began to gather near the corner of Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Boulevard. All the homes in the surrounding territery were decorated with Polish and American colors.</p>
   <p>After a great parade, the Very Rev. Bishop Paul P. Rhode officiated at the consecration ceremonies. Many notables were in attendance.</p>
