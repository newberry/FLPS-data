<title level="a">ST. JOHN CANTIUS PARISHIONERS HOLD MEETING RELATIVE TO JOINING POLISH LEAGUE</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock a meeting was held in the upper parish hall by the parishioners of St. John Cantius Church relative to joining the Polish League, which was organized last year.</p>
   <p>The president, Joseph Walinski, of the newly organized branch of the Polish League, opened the meeting, and asked Reverend J. Kasprzycki to act as chairman.</p>
   <p>Reverend Kasprzycki, pastor of St. John Cantius Parish, spoke to the large audience about the wonderful advantages of belonging to the Polish League, for, according to him, there is power and victory in unity. He made reference to the opportunities it offers to its members, especially the younger generation, and urged everyone to take advantage of these opportunities by <pb facs="5423968_8_1532.jpg" n="2"/>joining the organization. The accomplishments of this growing institution were referred to, especially the opening of libraries, reading and lecture rooms, and the publication of patriotic pamphlets. To this he added the efforts that are being made to revive patriotic feeling in the Polish youth. He urged young and old to unite and work for our youth.</p>
   <p>The next speaker, Louis Kalisz, spoke in the same vein.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. Kowalski, then spoke. He presented the aims of the League, what is demanded of its members and what is offered. "It is a well-known fact that an organization is needed that will stand above partisanship," he emphasized. "By being connected with the League, one can go onward more bravely despite the agitation of our enemies, because the instigators who are fattened by their money will lose their field of activity", he continued.</p>
   <p>The advantages offered to Polish youth when the parents joined were indicated <pb facs="5423968_8_1533.jpg" n="3"/>by the speaker. He urged them to join if they wish to instill Polish patriotism in the hearts of their children. For their work the mothers and fathers will be rewarded with affection and respect.</p>
   <p>Reverend F. Matuszewski was the final speaker. He told the people to disregard those opposed to the League, and pointed out the good of the society.</p>
   <p>Upon the request of the pastor, over 200 persons gave their names to the Membership committee. An appeal by Reverend Matuszewski for contributions to the Educational Department of the Polish League brought $8.43.</p>
   <p>Great enthusiasm was shown by the audience, judging by the applause and responses.</p>
