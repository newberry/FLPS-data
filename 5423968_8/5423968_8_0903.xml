   <p>A special program celebrating the November Insurrection was given at W. Grylewicz's Hall, last Sunday. The affair was sponsored by a committee composed of members of national and church societies. Requiem services were held during the day at Blessed Salome's Church in honor of the dead. The services were celebrated by Fr. Joseph Pajkowski. The various societies at the parish attended in full regalia and banners.</p>
   <p>The evening program was officially opened by the chairman W. Siniarski. S. Mikstacki, secretary, was master of ceremonies for the evening. The entertainment consisted of: songs by the school children, under the direction of the nuns; the St. Cecil's Church <pb facs="5423968_8_0904.jpg" n="2"/>Choir, directed by Theodore Sobolewski; a poetical recitation by two schoolgirls, R. Jamruk and B. Chudowicz; and a solo by Miss Suchowska.</p>
   <p>Patriotic speeches were delivered by N. L. Piotrowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and by the chairman and the master of ceremonies. During the course of the program a collection was made for the poor of Upper Silesia, which netted $41.31.</p>
   <p>A mixed chorus, under the direction of J. Jakajtys, sang a medley of Polish patriotic songs. It was one of the best renditions of the evening. Another highlight was the declamation by M. Ogorzelec.</p>

   <p>The chairman of the program committee thanked the entire group for their wholehearted support. He apologized for the speakers who were unable to attend the celebration. The event was concluded with the singing of the Polish national hymn "Boze Cos Polske."</p>
