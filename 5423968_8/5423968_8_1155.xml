<title level="a">FIRST APPEAL OF THE POLISH CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Countrymen! We, the representatives of the five largest centers of the Polish National Treasury, meeting on October 2 at the Polish Roman Catholic Union building at Chicago, cognizant of our duty in relation to the mother country during the horrible European tragedy now being enacted, have decided, unanimously and in complete accord, to unite our efforts and those of the organizations which we represent under the leadership of the Polish Central Committee in America. The purpose of this committee is to consolidate the efforts of all Polish emigrants in the matter of helping the homeland.</p>
   <p>Knowing that the differences of opinion prevalent up to the present time and the constant formation of new committees and centers for collecting contributions to the national cause are most destructive to the cause, we recognize, certify, and recommend to all of our people that they support exclusively the following centers:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1156.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. The National Treasury of the Polish National Council.</p>
   <p>2. The Independence Fund of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>3. The Polish Treasury of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>4. The Kosciusko Fund of the Alliance of Polish Falcons.</p>
   <p>5. The War Fund of the Alliance of Polish Women.</p>
   <p>We are neither discontinuing these nor amalgamating them in one fund, because we wish to give recognition to the work accomplished thus far and to encourage the well-functioning executive organs of these centers to continue their good work. A single controlling commission over all five centers will, however, be appointed by the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>In the name of national duty, we appeal to all other centers, committees, and <pb facs="5423968_8_1157.jpg" n="3"/>organizations, collecting funds for aiding the homeland, to send the funds collected by them to one of the above-mentioned centers at once and to unite with one of them for the purpose of collecting further contributions, in order to put an end to the scattering of efforts.</p>
   <p>We decree and ordain that the Polish Central Committee in America shall immediately contact the homeland, and when a recognized national government is organized there by all three divisions of Poland, that the committee shall place itself at once under its orders.</p>
   <p>We decree and ordain that the Polish Central Committee in America is for us, our organizations, and our people in general, the only legal national authority which is to decide all Polish political questions, and to represent us before the Government of the United States.</p>
   <p>Finally, we call upon our worthy Polish clergy in America and the several <pb facs="5423968_8_1158.jpg" n="4"/>prominent countrymen outside the confines of our organizations to join us in order to co-operate with us in solving the important problems which face us at this critical time.</p>
   <p>We have absolute confidence that all of our people will support the Polish Central Committee and are certain that those who have accepted the guiding posts will be able to solve the problems of the times.</p>
   <p>Long live a united and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>Temporary Executive Committee:</p>
   <p>Anthony Karabasz, president</p>
   <p>Peter Rostenkowski, vice-president</p>
   <p>Anna Neuman, vice-president</p>

   <p>It has been decided to include the following prominent compatriots on the Polish Central Committee and to invite them to the next conference, which is to be held at 2 P.M. on Monday, October 12: His Excellency, Archbishop J. Weber, His Excellency, Bishop Paul Rhode, His Excellency, Bishop Edward Kozlowski, John F. Smulski, Theodore M. Helinski, Dr. Fronczak of Buffalo, Ignace K. Werwinski of South Bend, Indiana, N. L.

   <p>According to the motion which was passed, all gatherings of the Polish Central Committee will be confidential because of the demands of the times. The press will receive official communiques.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1161.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>All correspondence to the Polish Central Committee in America should be addressed to Stanley Osada, Secretary, 984 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
