  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday the Thousand Braves Society, group 877 of the Polish National Alliance, the largest of the Alliance groups of Chicago, celebrated its tenth anniversary.</p>
   <p>At 7:30 A.M. the members went in a body to Mass at Holy Trinity Church. The anniversary program took place in the afternoon at Walsh's hall. Many people attended the celebration and had the opportunity of seeing for themselves that the members of the Thousand Braves Society had not neglected working for its development. Today it represents a financially strong, well organized, and well managed society.</p>
   <p>To the people who took an active part in the program, we hereby extend our sincere thanks, and we especially thank the singers of the Chopin Choir, whose songs we all enjoyed. Miss Bronislawa Filip made a very good impression upon the audience, and earned enthusiastic applause with her vocal solo. The <pb facs="5423968_8_0996.jpg" n="2"/>impression was all the more pleasant since Miss Bronislawa is the daughter of Mr. W. S. Filip, founder and organizer of the society. The address of the spokesman for the Polish National Alliance, Mr. L. S. Mallek, caused surprise to many people, in that a man educated here and having little opportunity to study his native language and the history of Poland, should be able to speak with such thorough knowledge of the history of the Fourth Regiment, whose name this society bears.</p>
   <p>We thank the representatives of the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance, Commune 91, and separate groups, for their kind wishes. We shall try to make their wishes come true in the matter of the number of members, so that we may live up to the name of the Society.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
