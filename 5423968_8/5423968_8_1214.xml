   <p>Yesterday evening Group 409 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America arranged a rally at Mr. Krechniak's hall, at the corner of Huron and Noble Streets. The Poles of Holy Innocent's Parish came to this rally in large numbers. The hall was actually packed--a sea of heads.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Rybick, president of Circuit II was chairman of the meeting. Mr. J. Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy made the first address, pointing out our duties in respect to our mother country, which is now arising from her grave. He exhorted all to join the ranks of the volunteers and collect contributions for the Kosciusko Fund.</p>
   <p>It was obvious that Mr. Przyprawa's speech, which lasted more than an hour, voiced the convictions of the audience, because while he spoke the gravelike silence in the room was broken only by frequent thunderous applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1215.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The next speaker, Mr. J. Smulski, president of the Polish bank, made a fiery speech, although he emphasized at the outset that he had not allowed himself to be carried away by youthful enthusiasm, but had already weighed everything with an adult mind. Nevertheless his words, which fell like precious pearls among those assembled, betrayed the fact, that even he could not control the sea of emotion which is now filling the heart of every Pole.</p>
   <p>"When the time comes, I, too, will join you on the field of glory, and if the return of Poland's freedom depended on me, I should willingly, at any moment, offer my life and all of my possessions." These are the patriotic words which issued from Mr. Smulski's lips.</p>
   <p>He advised ardently and convincingly, that we here in America should not openly champion either side, that we should leave politics to our brothers across the sea, and that we ourselves should prepare for the great moment when we can bite our enemies and oppressors with the cunning of snakes. He believes that Poland's <pb facs="5423968_8_1216.jpg" n="3"/>dawn is coming, that the great moment is drawing near, that our worst oppressor--the audacious Prussian--must yield in this last battle to which Europe has challenged him.</p>
   <p>The speaker was applauded continuously because, though in effect his words were of granitelike hardness, they were as balm to the hearts of the listeners.</p>
   <p>Finally Mr. Rybick spoke in the name of the young people born here. He demonstrated that the young people here frequently love Poland more ardently, though they have never seen it, than those who were born there and that when the time comes and the need arises these young people will go, determined that they are going to a free Poland.</p>
   <p>The contributions collected at the gathering yielded about fifty dollars. Several volunteers who enlisted last night were sworn in. With the singing of "God Save Poland" and "Poland Is Not Lost," this impressive Falcon mass meeting at Holy Innocent's Parish was adjourned.</p>
