  <body>
   <p>There are numerous matters, concerning the duties and privileges of the Polish National Alliance women members, that should be thoroughly and jointly discussed and reviewed. To that effect the P.N.A. Women's Auxiliary convokes presently a general meeting, inviting to it the officials and representatives of all the P.N.A. groups, situated in the 15th Alliance District.</p>
   <p>The number of women, associated in the P.N.A. Chicago groups, reaches a very high figure. In order, therefore, that our activity could be most effective, it is necessary to arrange from time to time joint conferences. Common exchange of thoughts and thorough debating upon plans and projects will bring out successful results in the further course of our work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0820.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The P.N.A. Women's Auxiliary, desires to stand in solid unity with all individual groups in order that we may constitute a strong and solid whole; it believes that each and every woman member of the Polish National Alliance is wholeheartedly devoted to our splendid organization, and that she will neglect nothing to serve it honestly and constantly.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned meeting will be held Sunday, March 29, 1931, 2 P.M., at the Alliance meeting hall, 1406-08 W. Division St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is expected that there will be not even one representative of our local groups missing as there are important matters to be considered at that meeting.</p>
   <p>With sisterly greetings for the P.N.A. Women's Auxiliary: M. Milewski, president; S. Dworak, vice-president; A. Skierczynski, secretary; M. n, treasurer.</p>
