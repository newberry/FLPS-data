   <p>The weekly Zgoda, official organ of the Polish National Alliance, recently carried an article entitled "Peasants and Masters," which read as follows:</p>
   <p>"We were struck recently by the opinion of some of our Alliance members who sent in their pre-convention votes, that the Polish National Alliance is ruled by two cliques, namely, 'peasants' and 'masters'.</p>
   <p>"This is the first we have heard of anything of the kind. The Polish National Alliance, to our knowledge, was established not by peasants, not by masters, but by Poles, regardless of their social or economic status in Europe at the time of their emigration.</p>
   <p>"By calling to life such an organization as the Polish National Alliance is <pb facs="5423968_8_0924.jpg" n="2"/>today, a purely Polish ideal was crystallized. In it there are no millionaires or masters of any kind; there are only true Poles. No one can say that now, or at any previous time a 'peasant' or a 'master' is standing, or has stood, at the head of the Alliance. We of the Alliance are all equals, and usually the persons who are called to office are those who had least to do with lineal aristocracy.</p>
   <p>"The Polish National Alliance is an organization of the best of the Polish element here in America; its members are all working people who never aspired, and do not aspire, to be 'masters' because, in our organization, they cannot be. In the Alliance, everyone is equal, whether he wears a workman's denim shirt, a farmer's overalls, a priest's cassock, or the business suit of a clerical worker. We are all equal, all harnessed alike to our nationalistic task, our task of working with all our effort for our homeland and for the Polish element here in America.</p>
   <p>"Understand this, my brethren, that, in the Polish National Alliance, Poland <pb facs="5423968_8_0925.jpg" n="3"/>is foremost, and it is for Poland alone that you must work. The officers whom you have elected to guide it are just plain workingmen, just as you are. An organization needs leadership; someone must guide it, and it is our good fortune that our organization is not ruled by 'fine gentlemen' or millionaires, aires, but by workingmen, such as you yourselves are.</p>
   <p>"The Polish National Alliance was organized in 1880, that is, thirty-eight years ago; it was not organized by Polish millionaires or aristocrats, for you know yourselves that there were none such here then, and there are none here now. The organization was called to life by the Polish people in America, and to this day our people are ruling it. Forget the idea that some sort of 'fine gentlemen' are ruling you while you must support and obey them.</p>
   <p>"The Alliance is your 'child,' raised on your blood, the blood of the Polish people who understood better than any 'gentlemen' the need for banding together to work for our homeland. There are no privileges in the Alliance, no personal advancements, for whoever seeks them is not worthy of a place in our ranks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0926.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Such persons you will remove from amongst yourselves and replace with more worthy men. You have the absolute right to do this, and at the conventions of the Polish National Alliance you may choose from amongst yourselves those whom you regard as the best, most worthy, and most reliable.</p>
   <p>"'Masters' do not rule 'peasants' in the Alliance, and probably never will, for the Alliance knows only the true Poles who organized it and who, to this day, are maintaining and developing it so splendidly.</p>
   <p>"We would be insulting ourselves if we said or wrote statements to the effect that you are being ruled by 'gentlemen' for you cannot find a single one among us in the Alliance.</p>
   <p>"Forget that you were ever peasants ruled by masters, that the whip ever hung over your head. That does not exist today, not only in the Alliance, not only in this free land that is ruled by the people; it has already disappeared in Poland, where the former master might be living in greater <pb facs="5423968_8_0927.jpg" n="5"/>poverty than his former servant or bondsman.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance is the creation of the Polish people in America, and that people supports, maintains, and rules it, recognizing neither masters nor peasants, but true Poles.</p>
