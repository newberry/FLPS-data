  <body>
   <p>After the cloudy, cold, and rainy weather that we have been having despite the fact that it is already late spring, yesterday was a beautiful sunny day that filled the heart of everyone with joy. To the Poles of Chicago, the day was one of special attraction and significance. From early morning, a solemn air could be observed among the Polish people, and from mouth to mouth passed the joyous words: "This is the day of the demonstration at the Kosciusko Monument. Today we shall pay homage to the hero of two worlds! Today we shall express our patriotism to Poland and the United States."</p>
   <p>Polonia prepared itself for the occasion from early morning. Flags flow from the roofs of Polish homes in all parts of the city. Beside the White Eagle on its amaranthine field, there flow the American colors, gently <pb facs="5423968_8_0976.jpg" n="2"/>caressed by the mild wind and colorful in the rays of a bright sun. Most of the flags could be seen on Division Street where, year in, year out, Polonia marches in its annual parade to the monument of the hero of Raclawice. The Alliance building was decorated with taste and beauty, such as the occasion (and the fact that the parade usually begins there), demanded.</p>
   <p>The first floor offices of the Alliance Building were opened early in the morning. It was here that the able president of the women's division of the Polish National Alliance, Mrs. Mary Sakowski, distributed badges for the women to sell for the benefit of war victims in Poland. It is a significant fact that about eighty women offered their services for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Long before the designated time, throngs of people were gathering in front of the Alliance building. Hundreds of men, women, and children, dressed in their Sunday best, stood about awaiting one o'clock, which time had been designated for the gathering of societies planning to participate in the demonstration.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0977.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The societies gathered and formed into ranks in good order, thanks to the energy of the chief marshal, R. Kaszubowski, and his assistant marshal, L. Panka. Words fail one in the description of the parade which started toward the monument of the hero of liberty, in Humboldt Park, at about 1:30 o'clock. It was something so great, so imposing, so wonderful as to defy description. Masses of Polish people marched in a long column, having come from all parts of the city to do honor to the great warrior of liberty and to declare loudly and definitely that they desire a free, independent, and united Poland, and that, for such a Poland, they are willing to sacrifice their means, their blood, and their lives.</p>
   <p>At the head marched a company of thirteen policemen, followed by the band, the central administrations [of organizations such as the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, etc.], the Alliance councils, scouts, the Alliance of Polish Military Societies, the Polish Alma Mater, the Polish Young Men's Alliance in the Land of Washington, the Polish Women's Alliance, the schoolchildren, and a great number of people--in a word, <pb facs="5423968_8_0978.jpg" n="4"/>everyone in whose heart smolders a spark of patriotism. Who was not there? All Polonia attended, with the exception of those few who for many years have not been participating in nationalistic demonstrations, having taken upon themselves the task, rather, of creating dissension, of underhandedly attacking the true sons of Poland and agitating for keeping Poland under the from heel of the Prussians. Fortunately, there is but a small handful of these. Today no one reckons with them, and no one pays them any attention. The people go where their hearts and their duty call them.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance Councils that we managed to note marched in the following order: Council 3 from Holy Trinity Parish, forty-five groups; Council 75 from Holy Innocents Parish, fifty groups; Council 91 from St. Helen's Parish, about a thousand people; Council 87 from St. Anne's Parish, more than a thousand people; Council 39 from Town of Lake; Association of Industrialists and Artisans, Group 3 of Council 2, which did not participate as a whole. The Polish Enlightenment Society was also well represented, with the Reverend Mazur at their head. The Polish people of Brighton Park also <pb facs="5423968_8_0979.jpg" n="5"/>turned out in large numbers. The Polish National Alliance banner was carried by the Alliance standard-bearer, Joseph Chmielinski, who was elected to the post for life. He must have been very proud to know that he carried a symbol that represents more than 120,000 Alliance members who are ready for patriotic work, who are ready to hasten to the aid of our unfortunate homeland.</p>
   <p>The state militia, consisting principally of Poles, presented itself splendidly.</p>
   <p>Here and there amongst the marchers were bands that played Polish and American tunes; here and there, faces of people we knew passed by. The procession moved forward slowly but steadily, while on every face showed a dignity, a realization that in times like these, trying times for our nation, it is necessary to turn out in large numbers in orderly fashion. The human eye could not take in the entire mass, this whole sea of flags and national colors bathing in the red rays of the sun, all these faces, costumes, rifles, Falcon and scout groups, everybody and everything.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0980.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>No previous manifestation was ever more splendid, more imposing, more dignified fied than was yesterday's parade. It was in reality so great, so wide in scope that when the first groups were reaching the monument, the last division was still somewhere around Noble Street. On both sides of Division Street, as far as the eye could reach, people thronged, marvelling at this Polish parade. Street car service, naturally, was temporarily suspended. A demonstration of this sort is a great thing that is but rarely seen; it will long remain in the memories of our Polish people.</p>
   <p>Program at the Monument</p>
   <p>Before this long and colorful procession arrived at Humboldt Park, thousands of people had filled the park boulevards and lawns around the monument. The places of honor on the platform were already occupied by the dignitaries, including Congressman Medill McCormick, who awaited the arrival of the parade.</p>
   <p>When all the divisions, both civil and military, arrived--the Falcons and <pb facs="5423968_8_0981.jpg" n="7"/>children among the last--and gathered round the monument, when last distant tones of many military bands had ceased, Commissioner Adam Majewski of Circuit XV, Polish National Alliance, arose to open the program at 3:30 in the afternoon. In a few words, he described the purposes of the great public gathering, of which "Chicago Polonia must be proud," and called upon Julius Smietanka, Federal Collector of Internal Revenue, as chairman and M. Turbak as secretary.</p>
   <p>Address by Smietanka</p>
   <p>We are very sorry that, because of lack of space, we cannot give a more extensive report of the beautiful, vigorous, and uplifting addresses that were delivered by all the speakers in the park yesterday, and must limit ourselves to excerpts. The address by Smietanka was beautiful and informative. He spoke in English, endeavoring to inform the people of other nationalities who were present of the reasons for this demonstration, and of the feelings that fill our hearts as well.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0982.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>"You are to do honor to one of the greatest Polish patriots of the partition period of Poland, and one of the ablest generals of the American Revolution," said Smietanka, "and you can do it best by showing your enthusiasm for those ideals for which Kosciusko lived, fought, and gave his blood. To you Poles falls the honor of taking up the struggle where Thaddeus Kosciusko's sword ceased to be active. You Poles who came to this country in search of freedom, and we, your sons, born here, will be able to raise our swords and rise in defense of the greatest and dearest aims of all mankind, in defense of Poland's inalienable right to live.</p>
   <p>"We are being called upon to do this by the president of this great Republic which has entered the war not with the purpose of acquiring more territory, not with the purpose of oppressing other peoples, but to fight for the same principles that took Kosciusko across the ocean to stand beside Washington."</p>
   <p>A storm of applause and cheers filled the air when the speaker mentioned the fact that "Poles would not be worthy of themselves if they did not rise at <pb facs="5423968_8_0983.jpg" n="9"/>the call of that great president who has shown himself to be their best friend".</p>
   <p>"Will you sit peacefully and in silence at this appeal of the president? Do you not desire, together with America, to avenge yourselves upon our greatest enemy for all the wrongs we have been protesting against so vigorously-- whether it was when the savage Prussian persecuted your children in Wrzesn, not permitting them to pray to God in the language of their fathers, or when the Prussians passed the discrimination law, dispropriating the Poles by force?</p>
   <p>"This is an opportunity our children will not have, nor will our children' children. It is the best opportunity to show that we are worthy of the flag that gave us refuge and freedom."</p>
   <p>The speaker then called upon the youth to enlist in the army as volunteers, not waiting to be taken by compulsion. The elders he urged to do their part <pb facs="5423968_8_0984.jpg" n="10"/>by purchasing Liberty Bonds, for "if they cannot give their blood upon the altar of freedom, they ought at least give their money to aid in the defense of those rights for which Kosciusko shed his blood."</p>
   <p>Following this address, the orchestra, directed by Professor Henzel, played "America," at which the gathering burst into a storm of applause, baring heads at the first notes of this splendid hymn. The chairman then introduced Congressman Medill McCormick, who was greeted with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>[Address by McCormick omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>Following this address, the massed Polish choruses, under the direction of Professor Henzel, sang "Bogu Rodzica" ["Mother of God," a 14th century chant] and "Patrz Kosciuszko Na Nas z Nieba" ["Watch Us from Heaven, Kosciusko"], accompanied by the orchestra, after which the well-known patriot, the Reverend W. Zapala, arose to speak.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0985.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>His address was beautiful and filled with an ardent patriotism that greatly affected the audience. He quoted the words of Krasinski that "no one is a slave in the immensity of the universe". He demonstrated conclusively that every nation was created to live in freedom, that it might fulfil its destiny in the world.</p>
   <p>"We have always believed, and we believe now, that Providence has assigned to our nation the fulfillment of a great destiny, and we shall not forsake it. If we did, we would then have to forsake our ideals of independence, which today, here and everywhere, we are proclaiming, crying loudly that we have a right to exist."</p>
   <p>Continuing masterfully with his thoughts, the speaker declared that Poland had yet greater and more famous heroes, who struck upon golden gates with their swords, who hastened to the defense of Christianity, crushing the Turks and Tartars at Vienna, but our hearts do not go out to any as they do to Kosciusko.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0986.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>"The Polish people gather, and will continue to gather, around Kosciusko, for he knew how to reach the people, he knew how to win their support. He knew how to don the peasant's coat and, standing at the head of the Polish people, he went to battle for liberty, freedom, and independence. For this reason the Polish people honor him; this is why his heroic deeds are held in grateful memory."</p>
   <p>Passing on to present times, in which "our eyes are turned to future tasks and to historic moments that are about to happen," he said that the whole nation awaits with bated breath the moment when [King] Zygmunt will sound out the great watchword of liberty, and from beneath the Wawel will come the tremendous word that Poland lives, that it will continue to live.</p>
   <p>"We cannot express today the deep respect we hold for President Wilson," cried the speaker in a great voice, "for having told the world that Poland must be free, independent, and self-governing." (Long-lasting applause and cheers for <pb facs="5423968_8_0987.jpg" n="13"/>the President.) "We Poles shall not deviate from this program; we want to live, and to love our freedom and liberty to live."</p>
   <p>Since the children's chorus, under the direction of Professor B. Rybowiak, was not ready to appear, the chairman called the next speaker, Mrs. M. Milewski, member of the Polish National Alliance board of directors.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Milewski chose a fortunate subject, for noting that "it is not for a woman to speak of the deeds of the leader and hero, Kosciusko," she took from his testament a few especially valuable statements, and quoting them in order, applied them to our life here, and to present times.</p>
   <p>"We must awaken patriotism in those who do not yet know patriotism," she said, "that is what we must do here at the present time, for there are many here who would love their homeland if they could come to know it. And since 'the first step toward throwing off slavery is to want to be free,' while 'the first step to victory is to know your own strength,' then here in America it <pb facs="5423968_8_0988.jpg" n="14"/>is time to follow the leadership of the hero of two worlds, and lay aside our quarrels and selfishness. It is time to join hands in mutual effort to throw off the chains of slavery.</p>
   <p>"Having graditude to this country, we ought to be the first to answer the President's appeal, and show that we have not raised cowards here; but when America calls for defenders of the most precious ideals of freedom, we are ready to stand shoulder to shoulder and fight for that freedom."</p>
   <p>She then appealed ardently to the Polish mothers to give their sons, for the defense of those ideals for which Kosciusko fought, without pain in their hearts. "But when our sons go to war, the warm hand of the woman must not be lacking; as a nurse, she must save lives, or make the last moments of heroes more pleasant with her tender, maternal care." The speaker called upon the Polish women to enlist in the ranks of the Red Cross, and thus to do their duty, for the time is near when, just as Prussia rose to power after the fall of Poland, on the ruins of Prussia will arise a free and independent Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0989.jpg" n="15"/>
   <p>After the orchestra had played a number of American hymns, ending with "My Country, 'Tis of Thee," A. Czarnecki, associate editor of the Chicago Daily News, arose to speak. The speaker made a comparison between our situation here and that of our countrymen in Poland, taking, as examples, two monuments: the Kosciusko mound, where at present only soldiers in uniforms of the Central Powers may enter, despite the fact that it was heaped by the Polish people, and the Kosciusko Monument in Humboldt Park, to which anyone may come at any time; he described extensively the present situation in Poland, telling of the sorrow in every home, how from village to village, from hut to hut, from door to door, only misery and suffering travel. Moving in thought through all of the Polish provinces, he painted a sad picture of the disaster through which our nation is now passing.</p>
   <p>"A great war demands great love and great sacrifices," said Czarnecki, "and for that reason, our sufferings, all our sacrifices will be amply recompensed with the realization of the great ideals raised by President Wilson, for which he should be honored everywhere and always, when the results of which he has <pb facs="5423968_8_0990.jpg" n="16"/>spoken are attained, one of which is a free and independent Poland."</p>
   <p>He declared that he believes that all the Poles will do their duty, and that the Polish youth will enlist in the ranks of the army willingly, taking as an example that first valiant thousand who have already enlisted at the recruiting station at Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Street.</p>
   <p>"Remember this," said Czarnecki in conclusion, "that those of us who do not do our duty are aiding the enemy, the accursed Prussian. Let us have mutual love, and let us not give in."</p>
   <p>As the next number on the program, the massed choruses sang "Surmy Bojowe" ["Battle Calls"] under the direction of Professor Henzel, with accompaniment by the orchestra, following which Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, was called upon to speak. His address was a short one because of the lateness of the hour.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0991.jpg" n="17"/>
   <p>Zychlinski expressed a deep loyalty for this great country in behalf of those present, giving thanks to its president, Woodrow Wilson, for having done so much for our cause. The crowd cheered these words.</p>
   <p>"For the blood of General Pulaski," continued the president of the Polish National Alliance, "for the heroic deeds of Kosciusko, this country has declared that Serbia and Belgium shall regain their freedom, that the small nations must be free, and that Poland must be united, independent, and self-governing. Let us carry high that Star-Spangled Banner, let us enlist in the Army and Navy here, for this Army will, after crushing the Germans, enter a free, independent, and united Poland with us."</p>
   <p>The Falcon guard of honor then fired three salvos before the monument of Kosciusko, during which time wreathes were placed at its foot by the Polish organizations. Following this, L. M. Nowak came forward on the platform and read the resolution, which was accepted by the gathering with a storm of applause. The resolution read as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0992.jpg" n="18"/>
   <p>"We, forty thousand Poles, gathered here at this Polish-American demonstration on June 3, 1917, at Humboldt Park in Chicago, to pay homage to the immortal Thaddeus Kosciusko, who is the most brilliant example of the sacrifice of one-self for the democratic ideals of the United States, unanimously agree to follow in his path, and to uphold the principles he strived for, and which have been championed before the whole world by the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>"Vowing, at the foot of his monument, to sacrifice everything for America as well as for Poland, for defense and for the propagation of those principles of freedom that he supported, we express our deepest hope in the final triumph of the United States.</p>
   <p>"We, who for centuries have been in the first line of defense of the civilization of the world, take this vow in the face of the fact that on the Eastern front the struggle for freedom is waning, and furthermore in the face of the fact that, among the inactive today--an inactivity that is bringing ruin to <pb facs="5423968_8_0993.jpg" n="19"/>the cause--is the Russian army, in which are more than a million heroic Polish soldiers who could continue the struggle on the Eastern front if not for the fact that they are scattered throughout different regiments, companies, and battalions.</p>
   <p>"We, the Poles gathered here at the foot of the monument of Kosciusko, most ardently request of President Wilson that, after reaching an agreement with the other Allied powers, he does what he can to take the Polish soldiers from the Russian Army and create an independent Polish National Army. We could assure the United States confidently then, that the Eastern front would be held to the last Polish soldier, that the million Poles will remain true to the ideals for which the Star-Spangled banner was planted in the battlefields, even under the greatest fire.</p>
   <p>"Offering today the blood and lives of a million of our best sons and brothers, awaiting only that step by America, we raise the united cheer, coming from tens <pb facs="5423968_8_0994.jpg" n="20"/>of thousands of throats: "Long live the United States! Long live the free, united, and independent Poland!</p>
   <p>"H. Lokanski,</p>
   <p>"L. M. Nowak,</p>
   <p>"L. Zychlinski,</p>
   <p>"Adam Majewski,</p>
   <p>"A. Bradel."</p>
   <p>After the reading and acceptance of the resolution, Julius Smietanka, the chairman, thanked the public for so large a participation in this demonstration and called upon the massed choruses and the public to sing "Boze Cos Polske" ["God Save Poland"]. The tones of this supplicatory prayer for "our motherland and freedom," sung in full voice by the already thinning crowds, carried far. A short time later, only loiterers were left in the park, while the others went to their homes uplifted in spirit and inspired to great deeds.</p>
