<title level="a">VARIETY PROGRAM ENTERTAINS INVALIDS AT SPEEDWAY HOSPITAL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Last Wednesday, January 4, an interesting variety program of entertainment was presented at the Speedway Hospital during the evening. It was sponsored by the women's auxiliary of the George Washington Post No. 1 of the Polish-American Veterans' Alliance.</p>
   <p>The show as a whole was excellent. Credit should be accorded the committee for their efforts. Nothing was spared to make the program a succussful one. This is one of the many reasons why the invalids had an enjoyable time.</p>
   <p>After the conclusion of the entertainment every veteran of the hospital received a package of cigarettes and dainties.</p>
   <p>The opening number of the evening was a piano solo by Mr. Andrzelczyk-Jarmulowicz. This was followed by a solo dance performed by little Alice Sikora, daughter of one of the members of the George Washington Post. In <pb facs="5423968_8_0859.jpg" n="2"/>turn the following made their contributions: Mrs. Antoinette Zebrowska-Perlowska, piano solo; Edmund Paluszek and Carol Gorecki, acrobatics; young Eugene Lukaszkiewicz, violin solo, Miss Victoria Rosczewska played the piano accompaniment; Florence Paluszek, dance solo.</p>
   <p>A violin solo was played by young Edward Rosczewski, Victoria Rosczewska accompanied him at the piano. Miss Mary Gruszczynska intrigued the audience with her beautiful voice. A solo dance was given by Loretta Pendzinska. Songs by Victor Mika thrilled the veterans.</p>
   <p>The eleventh number on the program was a dance performed by Carol Zita and Eleanor Anis. After the reappearance of Mr. Jarmulowicz-Andrzelczy (sic), another piano solo was given by Eugene Domanski, after which followed a "clock dance" by Carol Gorecki, Florence Paluszek, Loretta Pendzinska, and Edmund Paluszek.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0860.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A group of songs were sung by V. K. Miki and Mary Gruszczynska, followed by a trio in which Mrs. Zebrowska-Perlowska, Miss Mary Gruszczynska and Victor Mika took part.</p>
   <p>The artistic part of the program was presented by the students and instructors of the Loretta Boris Dance School.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of this program was composed of: Jeannette Sikora, Agnes Polniaszek, Marianne Brzoska, Sophia Ulicka, and Marianne Cwiklinska.</p>
   <p>The committee as well as the women's auxiliary of the George Washington Post should be given a great hand for making this entertainment possible. In many ways they try to make the confinement of the invalids at the Speedway Hospital a pleasant one.</p>
   <p>The president of the women's post is the well-known social worker, Mrs. <pb facs="5423968_8_0861.jpg" n="4"/>Przeslawa Kobrzynska, wife of Dr. John P. Kobrzynski, who is treasurer of Zwiazku Oswiata i Obrony Kresow Polskich (Alliance For Culture and Defense of the Polish Frontiers).</p>
   <p>Members of the women's post and others offered free automobile service to the entertainers on the program.</p>
   <p>Credit should be extended to all members of the variety program, chauffeurs, and all those who helped to make the show a success, especially to the women's auxiliary.</p>
