   <p>One often hears the words ["Our children are our future"] uttered by older, more serious citizens; one reads them in editorials and letters from readers, because they actually state the truth--since our children are our future.</p>
   <p>At one time we older people constituted the youth upon which our fathers and mothers once looked and said "Here is our future!...." And they expected great things from us; and placed in us the hope that we would prepare a better future for the nation. Warriors grown grey in the battle for the Polish cause, dreamed the rosy dream that when they will go to their graves they will leave behind them the younger generation which will bring our nation and country a bright future.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And so these old national workers went to their cold graves leaving us the heritage called love of country and belief in our own strength--belief in a better future.</p>
   <p>Some of us accepted this heritage with great reverence and love; and, catching in our young hands the swaying national banner, raised it above the heads of the people and marched forward in the footsteps of our fathers with the motto:"For freedom and the people!" Others accepted this heritage with indifference. It was strange to them. They did not feel the spirit contained within it, and the ideals which it propounded--they threw it aside and...went astray.</p>
   <p>Some are advancing the future of the country--others retarding it.</p>
   <p>Children, they are our future! Yes--our future, but dependent upon the training we give them and the road on which we start them. For our future can be <pb facs="5423968_8_0545.jpg" n="3"/>great and brilliant, and can astonish the world with the strength of its spirit and its progress; or it can be sad and slavish, and continue to be [a sample] of disunity and internal strife.</p>
   <p>They too, who betrayed Poland, and showed a dwarfed spirit during the most difficult experiences of our country, were the youth on which fathers were constructing their future, and those too, who gave their lives on the field of battle for the sacred cause of freedom, who died as martyrs in Siberia or in the dungeons of prisons and citadels, were also forming our future. These constitute two types of youth, entirely different from each other. The first type was Poland's curse; the second, her blessing.</p>
   <p>Not considering our youth of Europe, which is also composed of various kinds--useful or harmful to the country, advancing or retarding our future--we want to say a few words about our Polish-American youth, of whom now we older Polish immigrants say: "This is Poland's future in America." Here too there <pb facs="5423968_8_0546.jpg" n="4"/>are two utterly dissimilar types of young people, not only among those born and raised here, but also among those who came to America in their childhood.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we have here quiet, hard-working, young people, full of zeal for national and social work and speaking Polish correctly because they try to develop themselves in this direction. They are members of Polish organizations, they are not ashamed of their mother tongue or nationality, and with dignity they defend our interests when we are attacked by American chauvinists. They take an active interest in our patriotic work, study at higher institutions of learning, often at their own expense, respect their parents and help them and strive for higher positions in the American community, and for Poland, the country of their fathers and grandfathers, although foreign to them, they have a deep respect, and work for it not without sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Of such youth we can say with pride: "They are the future of Polish immigrants on this hemisphere!"</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0547.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There is, unfortunately, another type of Polish youth in this country, differing in every respect from the first. They are those young people who are brought up by their parents carelessly, educated in the schools poorly, and are a credit to no one, certainly not helping the Polish community.</p>
   <p>These young people do not know how to speak Polish, because they are ashamed of the Polish language, and do not study it. They do not admit that they are Poles before strangers, they change their names to foreign ones, and when some German or Irishman impudently ridicules the Poles, these young people not only do not defend their nationality, but themselves attack it even more violently, in order to show how smart they are. Such a young Pole does not belong to any Polish organization, and avoids his people like the plague, and can most frequently be found on some street corner, chewing tobacco, swearing in English, and shamelessly accosting men and women.</p>
   <p>A creature of this type respects no one--not even his own parents; he goes <pb facs="5423968_8_0548.jpg" n="6"/>wild in strange surroundings, and frequently even becomes a criminal, bringing us shame when the American papers reveal his real Polish name.</p>
   <p>Upon such young people we cannot build our future either in Poland or in this country, because they are not our pride, but a stain upon our name, and even a burden on mankind.</p>
   <p>Our immigrants should investigate this matter, and make all efforts to see to it that these young people are brought up differently by their parents and schools, if we are to build our future here upon our young people.</p>
