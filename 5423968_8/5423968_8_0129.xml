<title level="a">CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PROSECUTION OF THE MURDERER OF GACY AND GOLEMBIESKI</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The readers perhaps recall the murder of F. Golembieski and P. Gacy, Poles, by Kryz, a Czech, in Town of Lake last year.</p>
   <p>Kryz was tried for the murder of Golembieski, and through the efforts of his countrymen, who collected a large sum of money for his defense, received a light sentence of only six years' imprisonment. Now he is to be tried for the murder of Gacy.</p>
   <p>In view of the previous sentence, the Poles of Town of Lake came to the conclusion that a special attorney is required to safeguard the interest of the families of the murdered men. For this reason a committee was formed, namely, Anthony Rus, Witalis Dziewidr and F. Golembieski (father of one of the murdered men), and an appeal has been sent to all Polish societies to contribute monetary support for the attorney.</p>
   <p>The following article has been received from the committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0130.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The appeal to the Polish societies to support the cause of F. Golembieski and Peter Gacy, who were murdered by Kryz, made the following contributions possible:</p>
