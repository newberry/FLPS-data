  <body>
   <p>This new and unexpected thunderbolt fell upon our already so oppressed nation.</p>
   <p>A life became extinguished, one which in the heaviest moments was an encouragement for the nation, a mainstay and a guiding star.</p>
   <p>No more is there at the helm of the battered national nave the man who guided, advised, protected and rescued from ruin the Polish people, for Poland.</p>
   <p>A soul has passed beyond, which has been the hetman of the entire nation during long years of slavery, giving hope to draw liberally from the treasury of the past, faith in a better future, teaching it to love the <pb facs="5423968_8_1091.jpg" n="2"/>years of long ago, and to apply one's self to the paths of a new life.</p>
   <p>No more will this eminent intercessor of suffering Poland speak to the "Peoples of the civilized world" in the defence of its ruthlessly violated rights, nor will his lute sob to the tidings of new sufferings of the Polish people. Terrible tidings about thousands of Polish children thrust into the cold grave of the raging hurricane of a historical blizzard will reach him, but already there, where spirits only soar, and thoughts are only allowed to rise.</p>
   <p>A fearless knight has closed his eyelids, who from the dawn of his youth has stood faithfully at the outpost, guarding the legacy of the fathers and the inheritance of future generations.</p>
   <p>From the historical darkness he has brought forth the luminous figures <pb facs="5423968_8_1092.jpg" n="3"/>of the Skrzetuskis, Kmicics, Wolodyjowskis, Podbipietas, and as many more, in order to inculcate in the present generation a part of that which has passed and which has been more than once spat upon by others and by our own people.</p>
   <p>He penetrated into the depths off the most hidden secret recesses of the common human soul and analyzing geniously, favorably and unfavorably its peculiarities, he created masterpieces of universal human types, showing himself also in that field as master of masters.</p>
   <p>With the flight of his imagination he reached also the times of the dark past, the ancient Roman period, the beginnings of Christianity, on whom at that time as on Poland today, instead of a royal crown, they wedged one of thorns.</p>
   <p>And desirous of sharing the lot of the wanderer with the people, he sailed the far off seas and comforted the hearts of his countrymen in <pb facs="5423968_8_1093.jpg" n="4"/>the Fatherland with the story about the "Latarniks," (lamplighters), and the "Puttkamers," confirming that the guiding thought of every wanderer can only be the thought about Poland.</p>
   <p>Besides, who will be able in these few words to apprehend the super-abundant treasures of feelings and thoughts which Henryk Sienkiewicz has put in his works? Who can attempt to arrive at the value of the services rendered by this master genius of the pen?</p>
   <p>But we lose in Sienkiewicz not only a painter of our annals and history and the expressor of our thoughts, but also a spiritual leader, who during this time of historical cataclism, loved, suffered and acted for millions. Standing at the head of the General Aid Committee in Switzerland, where he had been driven by the brutal superior force of the enemy, he became the alms giver of the nation. He was its king and spiritual ruler. He endeavored to obtain assistance for the Polish children, saving the flower and future of the nation from ruin, believing that there is as much Poland as there are Polish people on Polish soil.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1094.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>And alongside this gigantic work, which grew beyond the power of his venerable age, there was shining for him one thought and one aim, toward which he shaped the course of his being. To regain a United and Independent Poland.</p>
   <p>So then his death is for us a terrible blow, an irreparable loss. There speaks to us not only a painful heart, but also the mind. Who will fill the breach which remains after him? Who will grasp the hetman's staff in his hand, so that one of another nationality will bow his forehead before it? Who knows how to carry on with this burdensome and gigantic task under which he (Sienkiewicz) alone did not bend?</p>
   <p>Being taken aback with this surprising and unexpected news, we stand in the presence of the shroud covered casket like children at the grave <pb facs="5423968_8_1095.jpg" n="6"/>of their father, like birds who have had their wings cut, like exiles gone astray on a pathless track, raising an imploring look toward their Creator with the question: "Oh when, my Lord, will these tortures cease?"</p>
   <p>And yet we do not despair, we do not blaspheme, we do not imprecate, in the persuasion that even if a faithful knight and an irreplaceable leader has gone away from us in his body, there yet remains with us his spirit, which will shine for us amid the star-lit borders and the milky ways like "Lux in Tenebris."</p>
   <p>In the thought of the above, we members of the Polish Press Club of Chicago, gathered in a special meeting, call upon the entire society to rightfully honor the memory of Henryk Sienkiewicz through solemn devotions and mourning ceremonials, proposing to constitute a "Sienkiewicz Year," in which we will collect abundant donations for <pb facs="5423968_8_1096.jpg" n="7"/>the Henryk Sienkiewicz Fund, assigned for the aid of the children of the Polish nation, for which the deceased labored to the end of his days.</p>
   <p>Our colleagues of the pen in the whole United States we address, so that, without regard to their convictions and political principles, they would discuss in their convictions and political principles, they would discuss in their papers the meaning and influence of Henryk Sienkiewicz on our life of recent days and that they would contribute toward the multiplication of this Henryk Sienkiewicz Fund, which ought to grow to a million, because a million children today need our help and succor.</p>
   <p>Hence to action, fellow countrymen, to a great task which will be the best way in which we can honor the memory of our expired hetman.</p>
   <p>F. S. Barc, W. Papara, J. Przyprawa, H. Setmajer, T. Lasecki.</p>
   <p>Resolutions Committee.</p>
