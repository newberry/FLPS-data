   <p>The social system of American society is responsible for the existence of many foreign clubs and societies. Here, in the quiet residential districts, there is no social environment. This condition created the necessity of forming many kinds of societies and clubs among the foreign groups; and because of this lack of congenial social contact, Italians, Hungarians, Germans and other foreign groups were obliged to form societies and clubs of their own, where they feel united and free from any outside influence, and where they can feel at home, express their thoughts in their own language, and enjoy their native traditions.</p>
   <p>These societies and clubs are like large homes, where an active family life is prevalent. In these clubs our immigrant can hear the sound of his native tongue, the folk songs, and music, of his own country. In such clubs the younger generation enjoys the national dances of their fathers. The clubs maintain their national, edifying and invigorating spirit always.</p>
   <p>Our Polish schools, societies and clubs in America should be strongholds which guard our national treasures. Polish clubs act as schools for adults, who have not had the opportunity to learn their language properly. But this is not all, a Polish club is also a school for social refinement and good behaviour, where our people are taught how to associate with one another.</p>
