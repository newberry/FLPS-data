   <p>A bomb has burst, just as we had foreseen. We have just learned that Mr. W. Rylski, former chief of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, is openly urging the military divisions to rebel. He is trying again to break up the Falcons.</p>
   <p>Suspended from office by the Falcons for actions which did not permit his holding this honorable post any longer in the Alliance, which has room only for respectable people of noble character, he was unable to reconcile himself to the thought that after all that had occurred he should seek the oblivion of private life, as he promised to do. It seems that his troublemaking impulses are at work again and impel him to dare undertake this truly Satanic action.</p>
   <p>For his own personal aims, indifferent to the fact that he is committing a <pb facs="5423968_8_1218.jpg" n="2"/>twofold national crime, he takes advantage of our present confusion and our most sacred hopes to attack the very idea of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America and to expose to the enemy our most zealous young men, who are moved by a sincere desire to serve the homeland when it calls upon them to serve.</p>
   <p>He has been sending private orders to many of the Falcons--orders which have fallen into the hands of the Falcons' Board and which the latter has published in the press for the benefit of our immigrants. In his orders, Mr. Rylski urges our young men to join the ranks in order to go to Europe. This he does on his own responsibility, since such authority has never been given him by the Falcons. By these acts he displays so much ill will, knavery, and unsound judgment as to make us think that the punishment he received at the hands of the Board was not severe enough. For the good of all he should be locked up somewhere, or be examined to see whether he does not have a screw loose somewhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1219.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is hard to imagine how this man, who was thought sane during his year of public life, could permit himself such extravagances. This is sheer madness. Every individual has the privilege of indulging in such madness himself, on his own personal responsibility, but no one has the right to inflict it on others or urge them to indulge in it.</p>
   <p>Where? How? When? To what place? In what way? These are questions which come into everyone's mind. Why, no ships are leaving, and those that leave sail under a neutral flag. These ships may be captured at any moment by the belligerent countries, and anything suspicious found on them will be immediately confiscated as contraband of war. This does not exclude people, who are taken prisoner and interned within the borders of the warring countries.</p>
   <p>And then comes the second question: How are we to get past the border guards? What are we to do next? Who will provide us with food and shelter? Whose ranks shall we join? Let's not forget either that an armed man on foreign soil is subject to strict military laws and to a bullet in the head.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1220.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Madness! Madness!</p>
   <p>The Falcons' Board which we elected at the Pittsburgh convention, and on whose hands we put the rudder of the Falcons' ship, is watching European events as closely as possible and is ready to act whenever an opportunity presents itself. The Board is responsible for every step it has taken or intends to take.</p>
   <p>Therefore, our duty is to listen only to the Board's commands. If these commands are unsatisfactory, our duty is to place the Board on trial. In the Falcons' order one cannot disregard discipline and do things on one's own responsibility. The Falcons cannot allow in their midst troublemaking instigators who smack of madness.</p>
   <p>To wait patiently for that which the Falcons' high command orders is our duty. Individuals, especially discredited ones, should refrain from taking the initiative, as decisions of this nature can be made only after the will of the <pb facs="5423968_8_1221.jpg" n="5"/>majority is consulted. Thus reason commands; these are the dictates of political reasoning.</p>
   <p>It is fortunate that this unworthy gambling with the lives of young men was exposed at a time when it could still be counteracted. To strike out from the membership list of the Falcons the name of this self-styled "creator of the legions," who in our estimation is a knave and a madman, would be the best medicine to cure this illness and would prevent it from spreading to other people.</p>
   <p>Anyone listening to an individual so full of wild and mad impulses would commit a twofold national crime in the advance guard of our nation and should be considered neither a true Falcon nor a worthy son of his mother country.</p>
