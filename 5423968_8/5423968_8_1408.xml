   <p>The old year has past, with its record of work, accomplishments and battles.</p>
   <p>We are a year older, but a year older in experience. Through our mind flit moments of happiness and success, painful thoughts of the loss of a loved one, - in a word - we take stock of the past year and count our gains and losses.</p>
   <p>The old year is closing the nineteenth century. We are standing at the gates of a New Year and a new century, and look with fear before us, for no one knows what awaits us, what losses to expect, whom death will take from our circle of friends and relatives.</p>
   <p>The past was most successful for us, dear brothers.</p>
   <p>As children of one mother, our Holy Church, and sons of our country, we should and must always cling together.</p>
   <p>Divided, we will always wander and fall, temptations will lead us astray, off the straight road, and we will and in a mire of unbelief, with which we are surrounded, on all sides, but we will not fall, if we hold to our faith, together.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1409.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Poland was so long great, as she served God faithfully, but when her faith cooled, God forsook her and delivered her to her enemies.</p>
   <p>We wanderers should never forget, that we are Catholics and Poles belonging to a nation that by her greatness and honorable character has shown the way to other nations.</p>
   <p>Let us faithfully guard our treasures, let us increase in the New Year our number of members, with the same zeal as in the past year.</p>
   <p>Let us offer our work for the Polish Roman Catholic Union to the Heart of Jesus and ask our guardian "The Blessed Virgin of Czestochowa," to intercede to Her Son for us to shorten our wandering. Let us make a resolution to live in harmony and Christian charity, and work for one another and all for one.</p>
   <p>Do not forget, dear brothers, to fill our legions with young members.</p>
   <p>Urge the young brothers to join us and always and everywhere by words and actions, prove that we are Poles and faithful sons of our church, and if it is God's will, the sun of freedom will again rise upon us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1410.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We wish you and your families every success, and God's blessings in the New Year.</p>
   <p>We hope that you will continue to help us in our work and perform your duties to the Polish Roman-Catholic Union faithfully.</p>
   <p>Our sisters and members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union we also wish success in furthering their organization and blessings of God in their work.</p>
   <p>The Venerable Clergy, who so warmly support our organization, we give sincere thanks for their efforts up to this time and ask them to continue in the coming year to give us their support and help us grow.</p>
   <p>The more members, the larger our circle, the longer we stay in our battles with the enemy, the sooner we will attain to the ideals and aims of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>Management of the Polish Roman Catholic Union</p>
