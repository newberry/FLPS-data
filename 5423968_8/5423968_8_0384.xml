   <p>A letter from one of our parishioners:</p>
   <p>I am very much in favor of your weekly Przebudzenie and rejoice at the fact that the Polish National Church is making progress.</p>
   <p>Two years ago I and my family used to live near the church where we attended all services.</p>
   <p>But one day something came upon me and I persuaded my husband to withdraw our savings from the parish bank and to buy a pretty little house in a new neighbourhood. At first I was busy with my new household and so the time passed; but later I started to feel lonely among all the strange neighbors.</p>
   <p>I realized that my new home, although it was much prettier than the old one, was impractical. It was too far from the church and my children could not attend the Polish school. Even my husband was very much disatisfied with <pb facs="5423968_8_0385.jpg" n="2"/>the new conditions and quite often reproached me with my idea to move to a "new neighborhood."</p>
   <p>This new neighborhood is inhabited mostly by Dutch, Scotch and some Italian people. Both of my grown up daughters married without my knowledge; one, an Italian, and the other one, a Dutch boy. Upon learning of these wild marriages I felt heartbroken, and my husband further grieved me by saying that it was only my fault.</p>
   <p>He said that if we had lived in a Polish parish our children would have attended Polish affairs and joined various lodges, and in that way they would have found Polish husbands for themselves. As it is now, he said, our daughter will not endure living with an Italian husband.</p>
   <p>Sooner or later we shall have her with a child back in our home, and the burden of providing for both of them will fall upon my shoulders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0386.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Anything my husband said about this is true and, because I wish everybody, especially the members of our parish, the best, I warn them against moving too far away from the parish and the church.</p>
   <p>Since we have two more children and we don't want them to follow in the footsteps of our older daughters, we have decided to sell the house and to move closer to our parish. At least, my little Jan will be able to get to know God and will learn the Polish language.</p>
   <p>At the present time we cannot find anybody who would buy our house, but at the first occasion we will thank God if we succeed in selling the house and make up for my unfortunate mistake of moving from the Polish parish. A mistake which resulted in so much distress for both my husband and me.</p>
   <p>J. R.</p>
   <p>Member of the All Saints Parish.</p>
