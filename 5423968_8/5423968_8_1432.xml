   <p>A patriotic program to commemorate the anniversary of the [Polish] November Insurrection against Russia in 1830 was given last Sunday, November 28, at the parish hall by the Polish societies of St. Casimir Parish. The auditorium was full before the program was started at 3 P. M.</p>
   <p>Albert Dranicki, president of the manifestation committee, after opening the exercises with a short talk, introduced the president of each society, and called upon Reverend W. Furman and Valentine Szymanski to act as chairman and secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Song, "Mazur," St. Casimir Parish Men's Choir under the direction of Mr. Dombek.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1433.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. Declamation, "The Starving," Miss Josephine Oranicka.</p>
   <p>3. Song, "On the Other Side of the Vistula," parochial school children's choir.</p>
   <p>4. Speech, Victor Pijanowski.</p>
   <p>5. Declamation, "Cross and Sword," F. Wojciechowski.</p>
   <p>6. Song, "For the Graves," Bell of Freedom Singing Society, under the direction of J. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>7. Speech, "Polish Youth," Mr. Andruszkiewicz.</p>
   <p>8. Song, patriotic air, St. Casimir Parish Women's Choir, under the direction of Mr. Dombek. (Its rendition was so stirring that the choir was compelled to give an encore.)</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1434.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>9. Declamation, Stanislaus Bona.</p>
   <p>10. Song, "Poland Is Not Yet Lost," Bell of Freedom Society.</p>
   <p>11. Declamation, young Malkiewicz.</p>
   <p>12. Song, "There Is a Country within this Country," school children's Choir.</p>
   <p>13. Speech, "Early Polish History," S. Nicki.</p>
   <p>14. Declamation, "Polish Song," Thomas Bona.</p>
   <p>15. Song by School Children.</p>
   <p>16. Declamation, "Prayer," little Maginska.</p>
   <p>17. Song "Mazur," Parish Choir under direction of Dombek.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_1435.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>All the speeches, songs, and declamations were well done and amply rewarded with applause. Credit should be given the nuns for the school children's fine performance, and Mr. Dombek for his expert direction.</p>
   <p>Before the conclusion of the program, at the suggestion of Reverend P. Rhode, a collection, netting $5.21, was made for the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>Following the concluding speech the pastor, the audience joined in the singing of the [Polish] national hymn, "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated for the occasion with American and Polish colors.</p>
   <p>Valentine Szymanski</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
