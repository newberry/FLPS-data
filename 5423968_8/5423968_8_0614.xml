   <p>An example worthy of imitation is given us by our energetic compatriots in Europe, who unanimously demand their rights for the Polish language.</p>
   <p>There is no place in the German part of Poland where men and women do not gather and raise their voices in protest against the unlawfulness and violence perpetrated upon them by Germans.</p>
   <p>They protested against the law prohibiting private lessons in Polish, against religious lectures in German, and the last law against the use of the Polish language in the mails. The more they are persecuted and their freedom curbed, the more spirit they show, the closer they draw to action.</p>
   <p>Their national life never had such a strong undercurrent as it has today, when a terrible and powerful enemy is grasping their dearest treasures. That warm attachment to their native tongue and energetic defense of it to which the whole nation turns, has made them in reality guardians of Polish nationalism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0615.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There was a time when Poles in Germany, not being pressed by force, were giving their consent to Germanization willingly and often used the German language, and with inborn politeness gave way to the Germans.</p>
   <p>It is different today. Taking our country away, they locked the door for us to everything, prohibited the use of our Polish language in our singing and plays. If it were in their power, even our births would be controlled. The enemy has undertaken to destroy us completely, but we, upon whom this fierce war is declared, are not frightened. We fight and with God's help will win, for this war is for our national life, to retain our dearest and holiest inheritance from our forefathers. We have not fallen so low as to deny our sacred past for a dish of German pea soup and bend our knee to the tyrant who in the past gave tribute to our monarchs and thrived on our bread. Our brothers are going forward, fight and work together, differently than we do.</p>
   <p>We do not fight for our rights, we do not battle for an oppressed country, neither do we work sincerely to raise our material and moral standard. In the race for the dollar, and in the battle for existence, we forget our fatherland, and do not try to retain the Polish spirit in our children. We care little <pb facs="5423968_8_0616.jpg" n="3"/>to gather our youth under the standard of God and country.</p>
   <p>Our Polish is limited to performances, lectures, and political speeches, which are attended mostly by people who brought patriotism and faith with them from their fatherland.</p>
   <p>Where is our youth? Where is that flower of our nation? You will not find it where it should be. Slowly but surely it is drawing away from its fathers, from older organizations, and behind their backs is joining English organizations, amuses itself in American fashion, in alleys and halls of the lowest kind.</p>
   <p>What we have accomplished up to this time is the result of the work of those who loved their fatherland and served God faithfully, but what will happen when they are gone?</p>
   <p>The greater part of our young people are not willing to join Polish or church organizations but form their own groups under an English name, hold meetings in that language and have sport events of the newest fashion but, what is worse, they are ashamed of their names and extraction.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0617.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This picture is perhaps strongly worded, but everyone will admit there is much sad truth in it and it is time that the work, generosity, and patriotism of the older generation should be acknowledged by the younger generation.</p>
   <p>It is true, the conditions of our life differ greatly from those of our brothers in Europe. In the battle for bread, we should not forget our duties to our fatherland, nor shirk the patriotic work, but in earnest cling together and retain the position that our great Polish history has given us.</p>
   <p>That is what our brothers in Poland are doing. Let us take this example from them, hold together as they do, be united in matters pertaining to us, but foremost guard our Polish language, and encourage the young people to imitate youth in Poland, to love that which is Polish, and in doing so we will fulfill our duty to our mother, and our country.</p>
