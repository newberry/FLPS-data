   <p>There is proof that the Catholic church has lost a million souls in the 19th century as a result of mixed marriages. This loss will be still greater as time passes on, and more grievous, because unfortunately the Catholics themselves are contributing to the weakening of Catholicism.</p>
   <p>One source of these irreparable to the Catholic church are mixed marriages.</p>
   <p>This is indeed a sad affair and the Catholic church, abandoned and betrayed by its own children can do nothing to prevent this harm. Even though the Catholic husband or Catholic wife receives from the mate or spouse of another faith permission to bring up the children in the Catholic religion, you know that even if the pact had been sealed seven times, the children of such a marriage are usually brought up in some other religion.</p>
   <p>Unwise, therefore, is every Catholic who contracts a mixed marriage, and unfortunate is the mother who agrees that her child should be brought up in a strange religion.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0602.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Catholic church, in fact, tolerates mixed marriages, but this is no reason that it should praise them. For that reason it agrees to mixed marriages under three conditions: 1) The married couple must each promise that they will bring up their children in the Catholic religion; 2) The Catholic side of the marriage must promise that he or she will try and bring about the conversion of their mate or spouse; 3) The non-Catholic side of the marriage must promise that he or she will allow their mate or spouse to live according to the principles of the Catholic church.</p>
   <p>Without exception there is not one such marriage in which as time passes on one or the other side does not admit that it would have been better if the marriage had not been concluded.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the greatest enemy of the Catholic church is the mixed marriage, and it is so, due only to the general position of the Catholic church. We Polish-Catholics should go further and avoid, in general, mixed marriages with those of other nationalities. Quite often we come across a case where a Polish man or woman marries one of another nationality, thinking that there is no harm done. The one who so thinks is very much in error.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0603.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Marrying one of another nationality, even if he or she be a Catholic, makes a person indifferent toward his own nationality and at the start one can be convinced that the children derived vrom such a marriage are lost to the Polish race. How easily the parent loses the sense of his nationality; how easily the son or grandson loses the sense of religion and goes over to non-Polish quarters, or non-Catholic.</p>
   <p>The one to whom the sense of nationality is not an empty expression, the one that carries from his parental home the ardent love of native language and customs, that one should never desire to conclude matrimony with a person of another religion or nationality.</p>
   <p>Marriage is the most faithful friendship for duration of life; it is the most complete union of thought and feeling. How can such a union be possible in a mixed marriage? How can you love a person to whom everything we love an honor as sacred is strange and indifferent?</p>
   <p>Young people concluding often such hasty and unconsidered marriages, carried <pb facs="5423968_8_0604.jpg" n="4"/>off with blind passion, deaf to the voice of judgment, do not see or feel at the moment the difference of nationality.</p>
   <p>They have accustomed to another language in school and in their work or profession, why can't they get accustomed to it in their family life? Oh! What a sad mistake! The language is truly not the whole nationality but the language is necessary to reveal the nationality.</p>
   <p>When you begin to speak in your family home in another language, then you have dug a grave for your nationality, it has died within you forever. Love will not overcome the obstacle dividing the husband, a Pole, and the wife of another nationality; love only temporarily screens it with seductive brightness. And when the passion subsides the married individuals see with dismay that there is missing between them that friendship, because there is lacking the spirit of companionship and, furthermore, there is no good fortune in their lives.</p>
   <p>The Polish husband then has two extremes from which to choose: either deny <pb facs="5423968_8_0605.jpg" n="5"/>his national impulses, discard from his heart all the ties binding him to matters pertaining to his fatherland or, remaining a Pole, exposes himself to indifference on the part of his wife and to family disputes which poison his life.</p>
   <p>From the two evils, he chooses the one which in his opinion offers the least resistance, he ceases to be a Pole. He gradually moves away from Polish society, breaks his relations with his countrymen, and does not even read Polish books or newspapers, not wanting to irritate his wife.</p>
   <p>What now can we say about the sad change in family conditions caused by a mixed marriage? The Polish language remains forever a false note destroying forever the harmony of family life.</p>
   <p>For this reason the mixed marriage is almost without fail the cause of loosening of family relations. The wife of another nationality sees in every Polish word, in every Polish letter which she does not understand, some dislike, lack of confidence and bad intentions. She remains forever a stranger, inwardly, to the husband and his family.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0606.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The husband of another nationality does not want his children to pray in Polish. The heart of the Polish wife bleeds at the thought that her child should pray in some other language. How can these contradictions be reconciled? Whose opinions will prevail? What sort of rearing can the children have under such conditions?</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, we see such examples quite often. No matter from which side we consider the sad consequences of such alliances, they always appear before us, a vicious circle of contradiction, internal strife, sorrow, and bitterness.</p>
