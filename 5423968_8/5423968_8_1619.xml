   <p>We have received the following communication for publication in Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>"Knights of St. Casmir Society, of St. Michael Archangel Parish, in South Chicago, decided, at its meeting held on May 20, to join the Polish League and support it.</p>
   <p>"Every member gave fifteen cents--twelve cents for the Polish National Fund and three cents for the benefit of the League. The money will be sent to the secretary or treasurer as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>"Knights of St. Casmir Society is blessed with exemplary unity and harmony, for which, we are indebted to our captain, Francis Jurkiewicz, who has been our leader since the founding of the society. He spares neither pains nor trouble <pb facs="5423968_8_1620.jpg" n="2"/>in teaching his soldiers the military art.</p>
   <p>"May the Lord bless those who work for the good of humanity. Honor to the [Polish] League.</p>
   <p>"Martin Kusnierz, secretary,</p>
   <p>"8926 Superior Avenue."</p>
   <p>This is the second society which has joined the League in a body. The first was the Patriotic Organization of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. Who is next?</p>
