   <p>Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. Last Wednesday the impressive ceremony of the opening of the Officers Training School founded by our Polish Falcons was held at the Polish National Alliance College. Representatives of the Polish National Alliance, the Alliance of Polish Falcons, and the Polish Roman Catholic Union, as well as scores of other guests among which were many Americans, were present at the ceremony, which was held in the College's auditorium, where the directors of the College welcomed the guests.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Professor Harrington, who called upon Mr. Stachowicz of Erie to act as chairman. Mr. Jasiorkowski, editor of Sokol Polski (The Polish Falcon) acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>A speech appropriate to the occasion was delivered by Mr. Dziub, commander of the Falcons and also an officer of the Officers Training School. At Dziub's order, the Falcons present swore allegiance to The Star-Spangled <pb facs="5423968_8_1022.jpg" n="2"/>Banner and to Poland by raising their hands.</p>
   <p>This was followed with speeches by Mr. Starzynski, president of the Alliance of Polish Falcons; Prof. Stanley Popiel, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Peter Rostenkowski, vice-censor of the Polish National Alliance; J. Werwinski; Gronkowski, a student; and the mayor of Cambridge Springs.</p>
   <p>During the ceremony telegrams came from Bishop Paul Rhode, John Smulski, Stanley Kowalski, Mr. Borowski, the Commune of the Polish National Alliance at Rochester, New York, and others.</p>
   <p>The College's auditorium was beautifully decorated, and the entire ceremony had a serious and inspiring tone. About one hundred Falcons took part in the ceremony.</p>
