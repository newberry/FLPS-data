<title level="a">LAYING OF CORNERSTONE FOR NEW HOME OF THE POLISH WOMEN'S ALLIANCE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday the Polish Women's Alliance celebrated an important event: the laying of the cornerstone of their new home on North Ashland Avenue near Milwaukee Avenue. The celebration was a tremendous success in spite of the cold and wind, which made the parade almost unbearable. Many societies from the Polish Women's Alliance, the Polish National Alliance, and the Falcons joined in the parade.</p>
   <p>The parade began shortly before 3:00 P.M. at the Home of the Polish Women's Alliance....[Translator's note: Here follows the route of the parade.] and ended at the new Home of the Polish Women's Alliance. As the parade proceeded along the way, the other societies joined. [Translator's note: Here follows a long list of the names of all the societies which took part in the parade.]</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0214.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The parade was headed by a platoon of police, under the command of Lieutenant Polczynski of the Shakespeare and California Avenues station. Following [the platoon] came a Polish band; and then, the societies. The delegations of the various societies, in 59 carriages and 3 automobiles, brought up the rear.</p>
   <p>When the last-named [group] arrived at the site of the new Home of the Polish Women's Alliance, the ceremony of dedicating the cornerstone was begun by Reverend [K.] Sztuczko, with the assistance of Reverend [K.] Gronkowski and [W.] Zapala. Then the history of the Polish Women's Alliance from its inception; several pieces of money; lists of the administrations of the Polish Women's Alliance, the Polish National Alliance, and the Polish Roman Catholic Union; one edition of each of the Polish newspapers issued in Chicago; signatures of the guests; and bread and salt were placed within the stone. Mr. Miller, the building contractor who has charge of erecting the building, cemented the stone in its place. The ceremony was very impressive, and will long remain in the memories of our Polish women and the many guests who were present.....</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0215.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>[Translator's note: Here follows a list of all the important personages who attended.]</p>
   <p>After the ceremony our gracious ladies prepared a little reception for their guests at the old Home of the Polish Women's Alliance. The guests were seated at three tables; and, after a modest, but excellently prepared, repast, there were speeches by the more prominent guests who are known for their activities in various fields.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Here follows a very long list of all those present at each of the three tables.]</p>
   <p>Following the supper the first speech was delivered by Mrs. A. Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance. She spoke about the duties of Polish women as mothers, and of the importance of the new women's building as a haven [for immigrants] in a strange land; and expressed sincere words of gratitude for the <pb facs="5423968_8_0216.jpg" n="4"/>large number of participants on this happy occasion. Then she called upon Mr. Anthony Czarnecki to act as toastmaster. Some little girls then offered their congratulations to the Polish Women's Alliance, and presented it with wreaths. Mr. Czarnecki called, in turn, upon the many guests. They all mentioned the merits of the Polish Women's Alliance which, in such a relatively short time, had succeeded in developing such a strong organization, and now had begun the construction of its own Home. They all hoped that it would continue to develop and grow, in order that it might serve the Polish people and our unfortunate country. Excellent speeches were delivered by Reverends K. Sztuczko, Gronkowski, and Zapala; and by Mr. M.B. Steczynski, president of the Polish National Alliance, who emphasized the fact that the Polish Women's Alliance can always look upon the Polish National Alliance as an older brother, ready to serve it with advice and help. He continued that there were still fallow fields that had never been plowed, waiting for the Polish Women's Alliance. Excellent speeches were also delivered by Mr. Leon Mallek, director of the Polish National Alliance; Mr. Miroslawski, attorney; Mr. A. Czarnecki; Mrs. [M.] Sakowska; Mrs. Laudyn; Dr. Mary Olgiert Kaczorowska and others. We cannot <pb facs="5423968_8_0217.jpg" n="5"/>give you all of the speeches here because they would require too much space. We are, therefore, mentioning only the names of the speakers: S. Adamkiewicz, Judge [John E.] Owens, Judge Uhlit, Thomas Marshall, former Judge Michael F. Girten, (in Polish) who suggested that November 12 be Polish Day in Chicago, Mrs. Lucia Wolowska, Mrs. [W.] Chodzinska, Mrs. Kadow, Mrs. P. Sawicka of Milwaukee, Mrs. Wargin of Milwaukee, Mrs. Sakowska, Mr. L. Pinderski, Mr. Edmund Jarecki, Mr. S. Kuflewski, Mr. [Peter P.] Mindak, Mr. John Czekala, Mr. M. Perlowski, Mrs. Tomaszewska, Mrs. [W.] Kuflewska, and Miss E. Napieralska. During the interval between the speeches Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch sang two numbers with piano accompaniment. She was received with a storm of applause. Before the end of the banquet congratulatory telegrams were read.....[Editor's note: The list of senders is given.]</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Czarnecki ended the banquet with a fine speech, in which he thanked everyone for participating in this beautiful celebration. The banquet ended at about 9:00 P.M.</p>
