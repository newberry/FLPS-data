   <p>The invitations issued by Mr. Victor Bardonski brought together a few local residents to one of the halls of St. Stanislaus of Kostka College to talk over the founding of a Students' Aid Society.</p>
   <p>The aim of this Society was explained by the President of the meeting Mr. Bardonski, n and others. The purpose would be to encourage the parents of Polish children to send their children to a Polish college. Aid will be given to children of parents without means. The public should be acquainted with this Polish institution, whose standard must never be lower than the standard of similar institutions so as to assure for this Polish college the fullest support of all interested. The members of the meeting did acknowledge the need for such a society, and all those present were ready to join and entered their names as members with the secretary.</p>
   <p>A committee was elected to write by-laws which will be submitted for reading at the next meeting.</p>
