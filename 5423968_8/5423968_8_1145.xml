<title level="a">PATRIOTIC RALLY OF POLISH WOMEN'S SOCIETY ROCK</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>On Sunday, December 30, at 3:30 P. M., a patriotic rally, sponsored by the Polish women's society Rock, Group 987 of the Polish National Alliance, was held at Julius Slowacki's Hall. Quite a few people attended, but for a district the size of Town of Lake the number was decidedly too small.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Mary Sakowski, director of the Polish National Alliance, opened the meeting, and announced that the Polish women's society Rock, sympathizing in the sadness and destitution of our sisters and brothers across the sea, did not consider it fitting to arrange a ball as was formerly the custom on the society's anniversary, but instead, in order to interest and rouse to action not only sister members of the Polish National Alliance but the people in general, it decided to arrange this meeting. She called upon Mr. F. Pawlak to act as secretary and then proceeded to open the program.</p>
   <p>The piano duet by Misses Adel and Anna Malkiewicz was so well executed that <pb facs="5423968_8_1146.jpg" n="2"/>the audience forced them to give an encore.</p>
   <p>The vocal solo by Miss Nyrtel, with piano accompaniment by Miss A. Malkiewicz, was received with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The recitation "In Our Land," written by S. Orpiszewski and read by Mrs. Caroline Synowiec, was heartily applauded. This reading appropriate to the present times, was read with such deep emotion and understanding that nearly everyone had tears in his eyes.</p>
   <p>Next Mrs. M. Sakowski spoke. She began her speech with a discussion of the present desperate situation in our homeland, showing that there is not another nation in the world which could show in its history that it has gone through what Poland is now experiencing, where brother is forced to kill brother, not of his own volition or in defense of his convictions, but on the command of a mutual enemy, and in the defense of this enemy at that. Further, Mrs. Sakowski pointed to our present inability to act and said: "A hundred <pb facs="5423968_8_1147.jpg" n="3"/>years of servitude left us unprepared. A hundred years did not teach us how to respect one another or how to organize ourselves. It is terrible that today instead of organizing, joining forces, and exerting all efforts to rescue our homeland, we mistrust one another, and accuse one another of accepting Russian rubles and Prussian marks, while our country is being destroyed by hunger and fire. Let us end our quarrels and arguments and get to work. If we cannot help our homeland actively, then let us collect funds and contribute to it. Let us organize ourselves and unite. We have large organizations here, like the Polish National Alliance, for which it should not be difficult to enlist new members. Surely if it were clearly explained to everyone how the Polish National Alliance spreads enlightenment and tries to aid its members through its various departments, everyone would gladly join it".</p>
   <p>Mrs. Sakowski went on to list the benefits derived from the various departments, the high school, and the home for the aged. Toward the end of her speech, she asked that a collection be taken up for the Independence Fund; this was done at <pb facs="5423968_8_1148.jpg" n="4"/>once and yielded $5.67.</p>
   <p>Following Mrs. Sakowski's speech, a hand-embroidered tablecloth contributed by our president, Mrs. A. Morzynski, was raffled off.....Mrs. B. Malkiewicz, Mrs. C. Synowiec, and Mrs. F. Pawlak, members of the committee, also contributed various objects, for which tickets were issued to those present free of charge.....</p>
   <p>After the program was completed, everyone joined in singing "God Save Poland" and "Poland Is Not Lost."</p>
   <p>In the name of the women's society Rock, Group 987 of the Polish National Alliance, I have the honor of expressing sincere thanks to all those present and to Mr. Hojnacki and Mr. Brzezinski for their help during the raffle.</p>
   <p>Francis Pawlak</p>
