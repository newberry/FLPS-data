   <p>It is true that the proverbs uttered by our forefathers are being exemplified, as for instance the one which says: "Whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad." That very punishment has been inflicted upon our most relentless enemy, the Germans.</p>
   <p>The German, wanting to kill our feeling of national pride and our dreams of a future, great and free Poland, tried to force his German culture on us as rapidly as possible. He prohibited the use of our native language. In order to make us give up our idealistic dreams, he surrounded the degenerate sons of Poland with solicitous care, showered medals of merit upon them, and made all sorts of concessions to them. This was done to tempt us, to give us an example of the kind of care with which he would surround those who sold themselves to him. When this failed, he seized the means to which his <pb facs="5423968_8_0514.jpg" n="2"/>[German] empire is capable of resorting to snuff out the little spark glowing at the bottom of our hearts: torture of children and confiscation of lands.</p>
   <p>When this failed--because the children would not learn the German language sufficiently well--he accused us of being incapable of learning so highly cultural (?) a language.</p>
   <p>Can this accusation be deserved? I do not think so. The peasant's son, born under a straw thatched roof, apparently could not learn the German language although he was offered all sorts of inducements (and was finally forced to learn it, all to no avail). Today, he is living on the broad lands of Uncle Sam and, though he works hard all day, he goes to American evening schools. He studies the language of this country, becomes naturalized, even learns to love the language of this country and its customs and memorials, and stands ready to defend it. Still no one forces him to do this, or rewards him for it.</p>
   <p>Is he able to understand the higher American culture? Yes, because he is free <pb facs="5423968_8_0515.jpg" n="3"/>here and feels himself the equal of any citizen of this country. The United States does not use threats of confiscation to force anyone to learn its language or to become a citizen. It does not prohibit anyone's using his native language. Instead, this country spreads her starry wings and shows everyone that she wants to be his adopted mother, to give him full rights, and to surround him with the same love that she bestows upon her own children. She teaches him to love this country and enlightens him.</p>
   <p>The German, on the other hand, in his greediness forgot, or was not sufficiently understanding, to give the Poles time to forget their mother and develop affection for their stepmother. He wanted to exterminate the Poles too fast. He did not realize that his ruthlessness merely served to fan the little sparks glowing in the bottoms of their hearts.</p>
   <p>The proverb is being exemplified in the case of the Germans and they themselves admit it.</p>
