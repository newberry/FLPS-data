   <p>In the name of the committee investigating Senator Lodge's Bill on Immigration, the president of the Polish National Alliance of America, Mr. F. H. Jablonski, has sent out numerous letters to prominent mayors and police chiefs of various cities, asking them to send their opinion of the Poles living in their respective cities, stating how many attend schools, how many have police records, etc.</p>
   <p>The following are the replies we received:</p>
   <p>Chief of the Department of Statistics, New York, writes:</p>
   <p>"The number of Polish people in New York City is quite large compared to other nationalities. The Poles are hard workers, law-abiding, and are always striving to accustom themselves to our ways of living and teaching. We haven't a record of Polish people with criminal records handy.</p>
   <p>John T. Nagle, M. D."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0099.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chief of Police, Boston, Mass., writes:</p>
   <p>"The yearly report of arrests made in this city is quite large, but the Poles constitute only a small per cent of this great number. They are law-abiding, quiet, and possess an enterprising mind. They are very good farm workers.</p>
   <p>A. P. Martin."</p>
   <p>The secretary to the Mayor of Milwaukee, writes:</p>
   <p>"After receiving your letter of Jan. 21, I was instructed by the Mayor to answer it. According to our records, it is a pleasure to be able to say that the people of Polish nationality in our city are hard workers, courteous, law-abiding, and good citizens, in my opinion.</p>
   <p>F. Paringer."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0100.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Mayor of Detroit, Michigan, writes:</p>
   <p>"Our city has a greater Polish population than any city in the United Stakes. One section of our city is inhabited chiefly by Polish families. "Many of the immigrants were poor when they arrived in our city, practically without friends or relatives but they were ambitious and hard workers, always striving to better their ideas and accustom themselves to our ways of living.</p>
   <p>"Many of the intelligent people are teaching their neighbors to read and write the English language, so that they may become good American citizens.</p>
   <p>William K. Maybury, Mayor."</p>
   <p>Mayor of Buffalo, N. Y., writes:</p>
   <p>"I am answering your letter of Jan. 21, regarding the population and standing of Polish-American citizens in our city.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0101.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"It gives me great pleasure to be able to say that our city consists of thousands of Polish families, many of whom are courteous, trustworthy, and a hard-working class of people.</p>
   <p>Conrad Diehl, Mayor."</p>
   <p>Mayor of Manistee, Mich., writes:</p>
   <p>"In our city we have over 5,000 Polish people; we also have over 600 children of Polish parentage between the ages of 5 to 16 attending our public schools.</p>
   <p>"Only 288 people were arrested in the year 1897. The population of Manistee is about 30,000. I think that the number of arrests in comparison with the population here, give us a good record as law-abiding citizens. The greatest number of these arrests are classified as minor offenses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0102.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"I am fully convinced that Polish citizens are a loving (sic) class of people; thrifty and hard workers.</p>
   <p>"Many have bought farms; but their main intention is to improve themselves financially, and educationally. In this manner they will soon get accustomed to our ways of living, thus becoming loyal and intelligent American citizens.</p>
   <p>Thos. Smurthwaite, Mayor."</p>
   <p>Through the permission of the Mayor, the Secfetary of Police of Toledo, Ohio, writes:</p>
   <p>"In response to your letter asking our opinion of Polish people, I must say that we have very little trouble with them; they are kind and a trustworthy group of people.</p>
   <p>Chas. H. Durian, Sect. Police."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_8_0103.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>From Boston, Senator Lodge's home town, we have data of criminal offenses by the three leading nationalities:</p>
   <p>(1) Italians, 18 out of 1,000 arrested.</p>
   <p>(2) Poles, 16 out of 1,000.</p>
   <p>(3) Hungarians rate third on minor offenses the per thousand average prosecuted is Italians, 44; Hungarians, 33; Poles, 29.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Quincy writes:</p>
   <p>"In response to your letter of Jan. 21, about the character of Polish-American citizens in our city.</p>
   <p>"I take great pleasure in saying that we have a great number of Polish people in our city, and only a small percentage of them ever appear in court as <pb facs="5423968_8_0104.jpg" n="7"/>violators of the law.</p>
   <p>A Letter From Boston, Mass.</p>
   <p>"In the town of South Boston we have a Roman Catholic church supported chiefly by the Polish people, and their children are striving to make an outstanding name for their school; because they are being taught the English as well as the Polish language.</p>
   <p>"They support all the city and state laws with the utmost sincerity; and are always willing to support Polish movements whether in the city, state, or in the country.</p>
   <p>"They are ambitious, good workers, and always trying to reach the top, financially.</p>
   <p>Thos. A. Mullen."</p>
