   <p>Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, co-editor of the Chicago Daily News, has justly called our attention to the fact that the Poles should enlist in the army and fleet of the United States as Poles. They should not change their names for names of people of other nationalities, because by this they hurt not only themselves but our cause.</p>
   <p>We do not believe that some of our young people are ashamed of their Polish ancestry and names, but if this is the case, they reveal a singular lack of intelligence. After all, stupid people are not needed anywhere, and that is why they change their names.</p>
   <p>If they do this, it is also possible that they do it for the rather obscure reason of simplifying the pronunciation of their names for the Federal officials. No one demands this of us. No sensible and intelligent person denies his ancestry, much less Polish ancestry. If you feel you must change your name <pb facs="5423968_8_0478.jpg" n="2"/>because it is hard to pronounce, change it to a more easily pronounced Polish name.</p>
   <p>We believe that the appeal of Mr. Czarnecki, who is well known in American circles, and who nevertheless has not changed his name to Johnson or Smith, but has the Americans learn to pronounce it, will have some influence on our young men, and that they will be proud of having the privilege of bearing Polish names and will cease changing them.</p>
