<title level="a">[ANNUAL MEETING OF I. O. S.]</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Independent Order of Svithiod held its annual meeting in this city on Wednesday, February 3. Forty-three delegates were present, representing twenty-seven lodges. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Olof Pearson, in Room 210, of the Masonic Temple. In a happy manner Mr. Pearson welcomed the delegates and congratulated them on the development of the Order, and its strong financial condition....</p>
   <p>Since it was organized, about fifteen years ago, the Order has paid the following amounts as benefits to members of the various lodges:</p>
   <p>1.) Insurance to 199 deceased members, $167,480; 2.) Aid in illness, $90,379.63; 3.) Burial aid, $20,806.68; 4.) Donations, $9,576; Total, $288,242.31.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1222.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The fact that such large amounts have been paid to members during the past years clearly indicates the extent of the activity of the organization; it also constitutes evidence that co-operation and union will accomplish much.</p>
   <p>The cost of $1,000 life insurance amounted during the past year to $11.80, and for $500 insurance, the cost was $5.90. The contribution to the sick benefit fund is about $6 per member, per year....</p>
   <p>During the past year, 623 people have applied for membership in the Order, and 516 have been admitted. Two new lodges have been organized, and there are now twenty-seven lodges with a total membership of 3,634.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1223.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The revision committee, consisting of Alfred Wickstrom, J. Jansson, and N. O. Wiberg have gone over the accounts of the Svithiod and reported them in good, order, and correct in every way. The capital of the Order has been deposited in the State Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Officers for the coming year were elected as follows: President, H. E. Hanson; vice-president, John Erickson, Rockford, Illinois; secretary, John Sandgren; treasurer, Axel Blomfeldt. Members of the executive committee were elected as follows: J. G. Sheldon, Nels Molin, C. A. Anderson, Nels Linn, John Brunzell, C. A. Carlson. Trustees were elected as follows: Olof Pearson, Gust Dahlgren, H. Hedin, E. T. Carlson, A. Fagerson. Dr. James <pb facs="5423404_3_1224.jpg" n="4"/>A. Nelson was appointed supervising physician. The revision committee consists of the following: Axel Dahl, A. P. Olson, Frank Lindquist.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed at the last annual meeting for the purpose of making proposals for changes in the constitution of the Order, reported and their recommendations were adopted in general. It may truly be said that this meeting was outstanding in regard to the prevailing harmony and evidenced honest effort to put into effect laws to strengthen the Order. All the delegates expressed their satisfaction with the decisions made, convinced that they would contribute to the advancement of the interests of the Order.</p>
   <p>After the conclusion of the business meeting, the delegates gathered for <pb facs="5423404_3_1225.jpg" n="5"/>supper in the Swedish Businessmen's Club, where speeches and entertainment brought the gathering of the order to a happy conclusion.</p>
