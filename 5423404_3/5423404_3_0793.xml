   <p>As previously reported by this paper, the Lake View Free Church, 3516 Sheffield Avenue, opened a night school some months ago for newly arrived Swedes who wish to learn English under competent instructors. From the beginning it was evident that this school was fulfilling its task in an excellent manner, and the number of pupils grew from week to week until there is now an enrollment of 433. Directing the school is the congregation's pastor, Harry Lindblom, who is a university graduate. He and a young woman, a public school teacher, are the head instructors, and they have several assistants.</p>
   <p>The high standards maintained are evidenced by the fact that the Board of Education has now recognized the school as being fully equal to the city's own night schools. From now on the plan of instruction will follow closely that of the public night schools; and at the end of the course the pupils <pb facs="5423404_3_0794.jpg" n="2"/>will receive the same kind of diploma as that issued by the Board of Education after the completion of the corresponding public night-school course. Such a diploma will be of value when the recipient later applies for citizenship.</p>
   <p>In connection with its school the church also conducts an employment bureau, which tries to find jobs for the pupils. No fee is charged.</p>
