   <p>The course of popular educational lectures which the Illinois Scandinavian Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Good Templars arranged here in Chicago came to a close last Sunday. The course lasted for four days, during which time six lectures were given, five in the English language. There were also several conferences among study leaders from the various lodges of the Order.</p>
   <p>The introductory lectures was given last Thursday by Morris Levin who spoke on the life and work of the famous Helen Keller. On Friday, New Year's Eve, a party was arranged, and Editor Oscar W. Larson gave an informal talk. Recitations, songs, and music made up the rest of the program, and everybody had an enjoyable time.</p>
   <p>On Saturday, two lectures were given. In the afternoon Maude Ball spoke on "Man and His Work". This was undoubtedly the most interesting lecture of the <pb facs="5423404_3_0864.jpg" n="2"/>entire series. In the evening, St. John Tucker lectured on "The Old Norse Religion"; he considered several parallels of the social problems of today.</p>
   <p>John Keracher lectured Sunday afternoon, and in the evening a party was given for all those who had participated in the lecture course, and their friends. The highlight of the evening was a talk by Mary O'Reilly entitled "What Is the Matter with Our Schools?" Another number on the program was the playing of a scene from Soderberg's play "Gertrude". The rest of the program was rich and varied, and provided a fitting finish for the lecture series.</p>
