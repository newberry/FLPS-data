   <p>The first of a series of soirees to be given by the Viking Society was held last Sunday at the Phoenix Hall, Division Street. More than five hundred persons attended this affair, which as to the quality of entertainment, was on a much higher level than most attempts by lodges in general. This event, which will be followed by similar ones each Sunday during the current season, was characterized by unusual refinement and orderliness, yet far from being stultified and tiresome.</p>
   <p>Assisting on the program were the Orion Male Quartet, Miss Thunstrom, pianist, and A. Olson, folk lore reciter and comedian. An extremely pleasant added attraction was "Bror Sundeen" (Brother Sundeen) from Stockholm, Sweden; this gentleman was said to be a "Mind reader", and a mind reader he was. His experiments baffled all those present.</p>
   <p>If this affair is an example of the high standard to be maintained by the Vikings, we are heartily in accord with their endeavors. The officers of the Society are: G. Myhrman, president; Alf Carlson, vice-president; P.S.Lunden, financial secretary; O. Anderson, recording Secretary; J. Ingemanson, corresponding secretary; and A. Soderlin, treasurer.</p>
