   <p>[Translator's note: Summary of reply by Dr. Anna Holm to G. W.'S criticism in an earlier issue of the Nyheter on the play "Laughter and Tears" staged by the Swedish Theatrical Association.]</p>
   <p>According to Dr. Holm, the criticism by G. W. of the performers appearing in the play has been resented by many. The exhibition was performed by amateurs, and the reviewer should have considered them as amateurs and not as great professional actors and actresses. Especially does Dr. Holm object to the reviewer's remarks about Miss Brusell. The type of criticism employed by G. W. leads Dr. Holm to ask somewhat caustically whether G. W. may not have developed too strongly physically and too slightly mentally for the task he had undertaken. The hearty and frequent applause by the large audience present at the play furnishes proof to Dr. Holm that the acting was good, and she extends <pb facs="5423404_3_0130.jpg" n="2"/>a hearty welcome to the theatrical group.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In a note below the letter from Dr. Holm, G. W. states that, as Dr. Holm finds him lacking in mentality it would be no use for him to answer her reply to his review.</p>
