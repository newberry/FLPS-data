   <p>The women's society Ingeborg, celebrated its tenth anniversary last Sunday afternoon with a great festival at the South Side Turner Hall. The program was opened with an address of welcome by the chairman of the society, Mrs. Ida Johnson. A Chicago trio composed of A. V. Hedir, Miss Elsie Larson, and Miss Elvira Almberg sang. The Iduna Military Band rendered music.</p>
   <p>The speaker for the evening was G. Bernhard Anderson, who spoke, in his splendid way, of the great need for the work now being done by the women's society, and gave some data of their accomplishments. Since it was organized on November 25, 1898, the women's society Ingeborg, has paid out $5,598 to members who were ill, and $786 for burial expenses; it has donated $91.75 to members, and $45 to families not members.</p>
   <p>The society has also donated $25.00 to the needy in Norway, and $206.15 to the same in Sweden; to Swedes in San Francisco, $130.50; to the Swedish Old People's Home in Park Ridge, $415.00; and to the tubercular sanatorium in Denver, $200. At the close of their fiscal year, July 1, the society had a cash balance of <pb facs="5423404_3_1166.jpg" n="2"/>$8,100.53 and a membership of 452.</p>
   <p>A splendid dinner was served after the program, and a dance followed, closing the celebration. The whole affair was successfully carried out, to the satisfaction of all its members. To Hanna Johnson and those who with her ten years ago laid the foundations of the society,and to those who later joined it, we express our hearty thanks.</p>
   <p>During the program, a diamond brooch was to be given Miss Johnson for her faithful work, but she firmly refused to accept it. Later, it was given to her privately.</p>
