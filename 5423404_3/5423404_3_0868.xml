   <p>Carl Skogsberg's lecture before the Swedish Study League last Friday, on Mark Twain, the famous American author and humorist, did not draw as large a crowd as one would expect, but those who did attend the lecture were amply rewarded.</p>
   <p>The lecturer opened by comparing Mark Twain with other great authors of modern times, and pointed to certain similarities between him and Hans Christian Andersen, the beloved Danish creator of beautiful fairy tales. He then went on to give an outline of the author's life, and an analysis of some of his best-known works.</p>
   <p>The meeting was presided over by Axel G. S. Johnson, president of the organization. Following the lecture, a letter from the secretary of the Swedish National Society of Chicago was read, in which the Study League was requested to appoint two regular delegates to represent it at the <pb facs="5423404_3_0869.jpg" n="2"/>Society's meetings. After some discussion it was decided to do so.</p>
