<title level="a">FUND RAISING CAMPAIGN FOR AUGUSTANA HOSPITAL</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>At a recent meeting of the Illinois Conference of the Augustana Synod, which owns and operates the Augustana Hospital here, it was decided to open a fund raising campaign. The Board of Directors is now preparing plans for the drive which is expected to bring $150,000 into the Hospital's treasury. This sum is needed in order to retire bonded debt which falls due this year. Due to the reduced income caused by the depression it is absolutely necessary to reduce the debt in order to operate on a sound financial basis.</p>
   <p>The drive will take place during the week of June 12 to June 19, and campaign managers are now arranging meetings which are to be held here in Chicago as well as in Rockford, Galesburg, and also in Chesterton, Indiana, and St. Joseph, Michigan, preparatory to the opening of the actual drive. At these meetings campaign workers will be given instructions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1331.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Individual subscriptions are already being received even now, and it is reported that they have already reached the sum of $34,000. In one single Augustana congregation on Chicago's North Side four thousand dollars have been pledged. Such a beginning bodes well for the success of the campaign.</p>
