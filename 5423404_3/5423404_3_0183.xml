<title level="a">CARL MILLES' TRITON FOUNTAIN DEDICATED</title></bibl>

   <p>Last Thursday was "Swedish Day" in the Chicago Art Institute, for it marked the dedication of the Triton Fountain. The Fountain is the creation of the renowned Swedish sculptor Carl Milles and it was donated to the Art Institute by a group of local Swedes. The significance of the ceremony, predominantly a Swedish affair, was enhanced by the presence of Professor Milles, and the scene was the McKinloch Memorial Court, where the fountain has been placed. Percy B. Eckhardt was in charge of the program, and he jokingly remarked that it is about time Sweden reciprocates by giving us something in exchange for all the Fords and other products she receives from us.</p>
   <p>The dedication ceremony began with two song numbers by members of the Swedish Glee Club, then the Swedish consul, Oscar Lundquist, and the vice consul G. Bernhard Anderson, addressed the gathering. Two songs followed these addresses.</p>
   <p>The fountain was officially accepted by a trustee of the B. F. Fergusson Monument <pb facs="5423404_3_0184.jpg" n="2"/>Fund. The creator of this fine work of art, Professor Milles was then introduced, and he told in simple words of some of the ideas which he had tried to incorporate in his fountain. He received a hearty ovation. The ceremony ended with the singing of "Hor oss, Svea," (Hear us, Sweden) and "The Star-Spangled Banner".</p>
