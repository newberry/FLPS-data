   <p>The Society held their third annual meeting March 25, at the Chicago Historical Societies Building, 142 Dearborn Avenue. Mr. Franklin H. Head welcomed the Swedish people. Pastor C. G. Wallenius of Donovan, Illinois was detained so E. W. Olson was elected chairman for the evening. Pastor J. E. Hillberg read a message sent in by Pastor Wallenius, his subject was: The Swedish American Literature and its meaning for the Swedish American world.</p>
   <p>The secretary's report this year showed that during the year two of the society's desires have been realized. The first year book of the society has been printed. The library has moved to the Swedish Theological Semminary's new building in Evanston where a room has been obtained for its use. Several valuable gifts have been received during the past year. Actual memories from Stockholm Linne Publications and a large collection of Swedish American newspapers were given by Consul G. N. Swan of Sioux City, Iowa, another valued collection is on the way from Prof. C. W. Foss of Rock Island, Ill.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0519.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The society plans to buy of Dr. O. N. Nelson in Minneapolis his library and this is nearer realization as Consul A. E. Johnson of New York has subscribed $100.00 to a purchasing fund on the condition that at least nine other like donations be secured. The price asked for the library is $2,000. Consul Johnson has also donated $60.00 for the purchase of book shelves; other money collected for the library amounted to $50.</p>
   <p>The management decided during the year that English shall be the official language of the society due to the fact that Americans could be interested in the under-taking, particularly offsprings of the Swedish Americans and it might also be that other Historical Societies with which we now exchange literature, might take part in this undertaking. Articles presented in Swedish will be printed in the Year's book in that language.</p>
   <p>The auditors of the treasurer reported $38.83 in the society's general fund, $48.00 in the library fund, and the lifetime membership fund $50.</p>

   <p>Hon. E. W. Olsen gave an interesting report of his visit to Madison, Wisconsin as delegate to the American Historical Association's annual meeting. Hon. E. Mannhardt, secretary of the German American Historical Society of Illinois read a very interesting report of their work so far, and of the historical movement in general in this country. Wefind that another society has existed since 1889 which is incorporated by the name of Swedish American Historical Society, so the management made a motion to change their name to Swedish Historical Society of America. Other changes were offered so as to make the work more effective.</p>
   <p>The following members will manage the affair of the society for the coming three years: G. N. Swan, Sioux City, Iowa; D. Nyvall McPherson, Kansas; newley elected were J. Lundahl, A. J. Carlson and J. G. Sheldon all of Chicago; and for two years in the place of C. G. Largergren who resigned, Pastor J. E. Hillberg of Evanston, who already had been appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
   <p>The society made a motion to get C.H.S.Sprincharn in Malmo, Sweden to secure records of the first colonists historically speaking. Mrs. George B. Keen of Philadelphia was requested to secure chapters about New Sweden in Justin Winsor's, "Narative and Critical History of America."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0521.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The management had suggested that the society take initiative regarding the holding of a conference with the teachers in the Swedish American schools, this led to a short but lively debate. The motion was laid over until next year's annual meeting. Council G. N. Nelson suggested that the society try and assemble literature from different states that might come under the society's interest even try and secure titles of such books, through the large libraries.</p>
   <p>Consul C. A. Ekstrom of St. Louis had made the trip to Chicago especially for this meeting and told of his interest and desire to work with and for the society's welfare. Talks of the same nature were given by Hon. F. A. Larson and others. The society management will appoint the various committees and then adjourn.</p>
