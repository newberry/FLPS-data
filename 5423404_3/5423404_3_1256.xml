  <body>
   <p>The Order of the Vikings held a grand picnic at Elliott's Park last Sunday. The [weather was perfect]and more than two thousand Swedish-American men and women took advantage of the opportunity to shake off the dust of the city [amidst beautiful surroundings]. They did enjoy the change, and the picnic was one of lively participation by those present from start to finish. The official program for the day was not long but it was excellent. After a brief introductory speech by Grand Chief Herman Carlson, Editor F. A. Lindstrand gave a heart-to-heart talk to the Vikings about their history past and present. The speech made a strong impression if one can judge from the hearty applause. A poem for the occasion, written by Editor Malmquist, was read by the author and evoked enthusiastic applause. The Vikings' band lived up to its reputation. The rope-pulling contest between the lodges Frithiof #6 and Runan #7 resulted in defeat for the latter, <pb facs="5423404_3_1257.jpg" n="2"/>but it required vigorous pulling by the Frithiof boys to win the battle. All the thirteen lodges of the Order were well represented, but the prize for the fullest representation goes to the next-to-the-youngest lodge, Balder #12, DeKalb, Illinois...The day was splendid; everybody was pleased, and the Vikings have shown once more that they are able to accomplish something fine when they set out to do so.</p>
