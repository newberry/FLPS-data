   <p>The Swedish National Festival, held on Saturday, February 10 at the Auditorium, was a success in every respect. Our countrymen of Chicago were thoroughly interested in the program. The three thousand who attended the festival were enraptured from beginning to end.</p>
   <p>The Swedish folk dancers opened their program with a "Hambo", which they executed with grace and perfect tempo, and put the audience in an enthusiastically appreciative mood for the entire evening. All well-known and popular folk dances were presented.</p>
   <p>The folk dancers group, whose American tour included the Auditorium exhibition, is made up of six couples from as many sections of Sweden; each couple wearing the official costume of their respective sections.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0335.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>While every dance was awarded wholehearted applause, the applause given "Vingakers Dansen" was so outstanding that the folk dancers were forced to present it a second time.</p>
   <p>As an additional attraction, the Swedish Ladies Quartette and the Harmony Male Chorus offered several well-chosen songs, both groups drawing such a volume of applause that they sang several encore numbers.</p>
   <p>For the benefit of our countrymen who found it impossible to attend the festival, we are pleased to announce that the touring Swedish Folk dancers will give a farewell performance at the south side Turner Hall on February 25. The Turner Hall being a much smaller hall than the Auditorium, we are sure of a sellout. We would advise all who desire to obtain tickets to do so before it is too late.</p>
