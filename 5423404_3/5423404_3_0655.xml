   <p>Last October, the Svithiod, a Swedish-American paper in Des Moines, Iowa, published an appeal for a Swedish-American press association. The paper has since been discontinued, and it seems as though the appeal it issued will die a similar death. It appears that the call from the Svithiod was merely a "voice in the wilderness". A feeble echo of the appeal has resounded from afar and near, but it has been dissipated in the regions of political storms or in the cloud3 of narrow-mindedness.</p>
   <p>We Swedish-American newspapermen sit in our little editorial cubbyholes, writing "leaders" for our people; we reprove our fellow Swedes for not sticking together, as, for example, our brothers, the Norwegians, do; we warn against the Swedish trait of jealousy; we sigh at the thought that <pb facs="5423404_3_0656.jpg" n="2"/>the Swedes are elbowed into the shadows because of their lack of achievement; we weep because the sense of nationality is feeble, while we still believe that the Swedish language and Swedish customs can be maintained in a strange country, by means of associations devoted to political, religious, and social purposes. But in the midst of all this, we forget ourselves, forget to be logical, forget to practice what we preach.</p>
   <p>If it be true that "in union there is strength", that "united we stand, divided we fall", then the instinct of self-preservation should make us unite into a press association strong enough to embrace every city or town this side of the Atlantic, where a Swedish paper is being published.</p>
   <p>Is it necessary to point out to our wide-awake Swedish-American journalists the advantages of the organization and the maintenance of such an association? We do not believe that it is. The advantages are clearly discernible and will <pb facs="5423404_3_0657.jpg" n="3"/>become more and more manifest when and if a Swedish-American press association is formed.</p>
   <p>Newspapermen of broad vision and warm hearts have lived and died in their cubbyholes without their like-minded colleagues of the press ever having had the chance to know them personally. Their great thoughts and noble motives have become known to us through the columns of their papers, but the hand we would fain have pressed has remained at a distance, and we have had no chance to look into the eyes that would flash with anger when truth was trampled underfoot. Carl Fredrik Peterson,... our foremost historian and philosopher, is now dead. How many of our journalists knew him? Otto Craelius fell from our ranks, yet hardly one in twenty of his colleagues of the press had ever met him.....A Swedish-American press association might aid in bringing together in person, the newspaper men who are now independently fighting for common ends.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0658.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But who will be the Moses that will be able to lead the Israelites through the wilderness? It may be thought that the man for the task should be some Chicago editor. We doubt it. One man does not dare; another might, but inasmuch as he is not a doctor of philosophy or a professor,....since he does not even belong to the "old guard", his voice would not be listened to, should he take steps to bring the Swedish-American newspapermen together.</p>
   <p>Some years ago, there existed in Chicago a Swedish-American press association; but it succumbed, and only the memory of it remains. It does not seem desirable to revive this association, because the majority of its members consisted of people that did not understand journalism at all. In addition, the publishers, who also belonged to the association, were unable to agree. It would be necessary, therefore, to organize a new press association, a society to which no person could belong who is not of the profession--a rule which would also exclude the publishers from membership in the association, though they might be given the status of honorary members.....</p>
