   <p>The Swedish Historical Society's Publishing office has recently received a third edition of "Annals of the Swedes on the Delaware", by the Reverend Jehu Curtis Clay, who was pastor at Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Episcopal Church, in Philadelphia, 1831-1863, and who always was proud of his Swedish origin on his mother's side.</p>
   <p>The first edition came out in 1835 in Philadelphia, and the second in 1858 in the same city. Both these editions have now disappeared. It has, therefore, been regarded necessary to print this third edition, which has been made possible through the generosity of director Charles S. Peterson president of the Swedish Club, Chicago. He has taken upon himself the payment of a large part of the printing expenses. The book, printed in English, is very interesting, and ought to be read by our immigrants here.</p>
