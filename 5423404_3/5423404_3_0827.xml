   <p>The Illinois branch of the Scandinavian Workers' Cultural League will hold its usual summer course July 28--August 3, and it will be held at Sherwood Camp, which is located in beautiful surroundings on Lake Villa. Students will thus also have an opportunity to enjoy swimming and fishing.</p>
   <p>The program includes lectures on the following subjects: "Co-operation," by Dr. Sandberg; "The History of the Labor Movement," by E. Bechtold; "Medical Science," by Dr. Lawson; "Marxism," by A. Pearson; "The Temperance Movement," by Ivar Johnson and "The School Systems of the United States and of the Soviet Union". (Name of lecturer not given). At night various educational and entertainment features will be presented around the campfire.</p>
   <p>The fee has been set at one dollar per day, which comes to seven dollars for the entire course, including board and sleeping quarters. More detailed information may be obtained by writing to the League's secretary, Sven Westberg, <pb facs="5423404_3_0828.jpg" n="2"/>905 Belmont Avenue, Chicago.</p>
