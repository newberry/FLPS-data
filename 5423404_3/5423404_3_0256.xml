   <p>Saturday evening, February 8, a banquet was given in the large auditorium of the Viking Temple for the delegates of the lodges of the Order of Vikings. Alex J. Johnson, editor of Svenska Kuriren, delivered an address, "The Swedes in America," of which we print the following excerpts:</p>
   <p>"We Swedes do not have to feel downcast when we compare our ancestral descendancy with that of the people who came in the "Mayflower." In the same decade of the sixteen hundreds, a large number of Swedes came here on the "Kalmare Nyckel" (Key to Kalmar).</p>
   <p>If we who are assembled here do not wish to brag that we are direct descendants of these honored fathers, the reason is partly because of our well-known shyness and partly because of our having heard since <pb facs="5423404_3_0257.jpg" n="2"/>childhood that man is descended from Adam and Eve. Under these circum-stances it is rather problematical to do justice to family trees, for the more we delve into them, the more extensive they become.</p>
   <p>"You know as well as I do how the Swedes have progressed in the United States. We know that there are members of our race in all activities, civil as well as political, of the community, in all honorable trades and in all professions.</p>
   <p>"I am not boasting of our nationality when I maintain that had not the inflexible Man of the Scythe intervened, John Johnson would have been elected president of the United States instead of Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>"The Swedes in the United States have been unjustly libeled, and much of the unexpected prejudice and distrust against them is due, in my <pb facs="5423404_3_0258.jpg" n="3"/>opinion, to the fact that we have among us certain busybodies who are selfish and self-seeking, always trying to put themselves in the good graces of those in power.</p>
   <p>"The only way in which we may re-establish respect for our nationality, according to my convictions, is to remain as law-abiding now as before, and yet be independent."</p>
