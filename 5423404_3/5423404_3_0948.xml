   <p>The annual amateur wrestling championship matches are near at hand. The great Central Athletic Amateur Union Championship matches in all weight-classes for the Midwestern States, will be held on Friday, the 28th, and Saturday, the 29th in Swedish American Athletic Association Clubhouse at 752 Barry Avenue. As in previous years Swedish-American Athletic Association and its wrestling coach, <pb facs="5423404_3_0949.jpg" n="2"/>Carl Goranson, has also this year been entrusted with the responsibility of arranging these competitions. During the last three years the Swedish-American Athletic Association has carried home the lions share of points. The club, which this year receives the highest number of points, will be awarded an honorary prize donated by F. Stevenson. The respective winners in the different classes will receive S.A.A.A's Gold-Silver and Bronze Medals.</p>
   <p>A review of this fall's football results shows our club to be well placed in the International League's 1st Division, with only three points behind the leaders and it hopes to be able to go thru the spring season without defeat, and thus qualify for the "finals". During the fall season twelve games were played, and seven won, two were draws and three lost, total goals scored 34, and 17 last. The scores were: Harry Johnson 9, Norling 8; Stuve Franzen 4; Carl Johnson 3; Hugo Johnson 3, "Pete" Petterson 2, and Edw. Bjorklund, C. Hultgren, "Knecken" Johanson, Harry Johanson, B. Rosen and Wicksell each one goal.</p>
   <p>In its ordinary lineup the football team has mustered the following players reading from goal: Torsten Erickson, G. Wihlborg, Nelson (Vesperman), Sven <pb facs="5423404_3_0950.jpg" n="3"/>Felldin, S. Hagman, Edw. Bjorklund, Carl Johnson II, "Pete" Petterson, "Knecken" Johanson, Harry Johanson, Norling and Hugo Johnson.</p>
   <p>At the start of the season "Gotland" Hultgren left for Detroit, where he now plays on a Swedish team. Just before the end of the year the team's captain and o.h.b., Sven Hagman, left for San Francisco, where his football playing ability is in demand. Both of these boys are expected back in Chicago in the spring.</p>
   <p>Ernie Olson the old "all around athlets and football player" is manager with Gust. Carlson as his assistant.</p>
   <p>The club's reserve team has successfully played in the 2nd Division. It has usually mustered the following players: T. Hagg, H. Carlson, Friman, Hedendahl, V.Lindberg, "Texas" Arvidson, Benno Anderson, Arnold Anderson, Hilding, "Osse" Carlson, E. Ek. Sten Carlson and Wally Johnson also played a few games. (H.J.)</p>
