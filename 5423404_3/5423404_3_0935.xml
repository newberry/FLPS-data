   <p>A meeting was held last Thursday in Cafe Idrott by persons interested in gymnastics, and about thirty people attended. Herbert Swalgren presided and explained why the meeting had been called. After some discussion it was decided to form a society for the purpose of engaging in gymnastics and physical culture and to encourage the interest in such activities among Swedes in Chicago. The following officers were elected: Herbert Swalgren, president, Ruth Soderstrom, secretary, and Carl Tapper, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Interest in gymnastics has not been lacking among Chicago Swedes, but for certain reasons, among them being the difficulty of obtaining suitable quarters, nothing has come of it until now. At this meeting the question of location was taken up, and Herbert Swalgren and Axel Weeberts were appointed to investigate the possibilities and submit recommendations at a later meeting.</p>
   <p>The members have planned to start practice in February and to form one troupe <pb facs="5423404_3_0936.jpg" n="2"/>for ladies and one for men. Fifteen persons of both sexes signed up as members of such troupes at the end of the meeting.</p>
   <p>The question of a name for the organization was also discussed, but a final decision was postponed, since it was considered to be too important for a hasty decision. It was pointed out that this club is to represent not only Swedish gymnastics but also Sweden itself as a leader in physical culture.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held Monday, February 1, and everyone who is interested is invited to attend. Judging by the interest which was evidenced last Thursday, there is every reason to believe that this gymnastic club will be successful and will fill a long felt need among our countrymen in Chicago.</p>
