  <body>
   <p>In this morning's mail we received a letter from which we quote the following:</p>
   <p>"The undersigned is a Swedish immigrant who has been in this country only two years. He has become ill and needs treatment in a sanatorium. Will you be so kind as to furnish me with the information necessary to obtain this service. An early reply will greatly oblige,</p>
   <p>Yours truly..."</p>
   <p>Imagine, if you can, the many disappointments and heartaches which this young man reveals in his letter. He left Sweden only two years ago, filled with high hopes of finding better opportunities to earn his living and perhaps thereby to help his aging parents. He probably came from a poor home where there were many mouths to feed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1337.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But now it is he who needs help. Friends and countrymen, this young man is one of the many, many boys and girls who are knocking at our door. Let us speed up our work, so that we can say to these poor and sick: "Come, we have a place for you:" Friends, do not forget the Sanatorium:</p>
   <p>Gustaf Hywall</p>
