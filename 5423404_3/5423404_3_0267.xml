   <p>The banquet in honor of Ira Nelson Morris, in The Swedish Club, last Tuesday evening was a very successful affair. More than two hundred persons, ladies and gentlemen, belonging to the elite of Chicago's Swedish population inclusive of numerous representatives of the clergy were present in the beautiful quarters, which were tastefully decorated. Back of the guest of honor could be seen the Stars and Stripes entwined with the Blue-yellow of the Swedish flag.</p>
   <p>After those present had done justice to the culinary part of the evening's program, Mr. Charles S. Peterson delivered a speech, which came from the heart and went to the hearts. The speech, in part, follows:</p>
   <p>"Honored Guest, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0268.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We have had many distinguished guests within these walls; but never have we had better reason to honor a visitor, than we have tonight. We honor him doubly, as American citizens because he has served our country well; and as American citizens of Swedish descent because in serving the land of our adoption so well, he has also helped the land of our birth, thereby doing us the invaluable service of maintaining, through very difficult times, the friendly feelings of the past between the United States and Sweden.</p>
   <p>"If today that friendship is firmer than ever, if the understanding between the two nations is better than ever before, we owe it above all men, to our guest of honor tonight. Had it turned out differently, ninety-nine and nine-tenths per cent of us would without hesitation have done our duty to this our country; but, it is only human to say, that it would have been done with a heavy heart. Every right-minded man will stand by his wife, if he is unfortunately compelled to choose; but he does not turn with a light heart against his old mother. Because our guest tonight had the good judgment in trying times <pb facs="5423404_3_0269.jpg" n="3"/>to distinguish between the outward appearance and the actual state of things, and thus maintained a friendship and amity, where another man might have created suspicion and distrust, we owe him a debt, that we can never quite repay. We hope he will accept this little affair tonight as a small sing of our feelings towards him."</p>
   <p>After this speech, which received an enormous applause, Mr. Gustaf Holmquist and those present sang "Star-Spangled Banner," whereupon, Chief Justice Harry Olson, at the behest of the master of ceremonies spoke. Judge Olson's speech was largely a repetition of what the club's president had already said. He concluded his speech by expressing the hope of continued beneficial cooperation between the United States representative in Sweden, Minister Morris, and the land of our forefathers. This was followed by Stenhammer's "Sverige," excellently rendered by Gustaf Holmquist and an extra number followed, the "Battle Hymn of the Republic," where everybody joined in the refrain.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0270.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The next speaker was the Swedish Vice-Consul of Chicago, Mr. J. Bernhard Anderson, who delivered a good and original speech. He pointed out that the Swedes should stop boasting over the heroic deeds their forefathers performed during the Thirty Years' War, etc. They should instead, he advised, offer their thoughts for the present; with the Swedish-Americans' share in developing; this country. They have so well protected their own, as well as the honor of their adopted land that they did not need to borrow any honorable reflections, as to their loyalty and patriotism; from olden times, he declared.</p>
   <p>As a practical proof of the correctness of the speaker's assertion, Liberty Bonds of $1,000 denomination were purchased by many of those present, without any high-pressure salesmanship. After Consul Anderson's speech, a few violin numbers were given by Miss Ebba Hjertstedt and Mr. Edgar A. Nelson--all very well received.</p>
   <p>Congressman Medill McCormick, also candidate for U. S. Senator for Illinois <pb facs="5423404_3_0271.jpg" n="5"/>was next to be heard. What he had to say was mostly of a humorous nature. A few song numbers were given by the alto singer, Edna Swanson Ver Haar. Her rendition of "Land of Mine" received a well deserved applause.</p>
   <p>Finally the guest of honor, Minister Ira Nelson Morris, was to be heard. To those who heard him at the mass meeting at Orchestra Hall last Sunday, his speech this evening must have been a disappointment, as it was only a repetition of what was said on that occasion.</p>
   <p>Clearly and simply he painted a mental picture of conditions in Sweden at the outbreak of the war, and the present conditions since the treaty between the U. S. and Sweden. He spoke on the great friendship between the U. S. and Sweden, and how our 100,000 Swedish-American soldiers on French soil, through letters to kinsfolk and friends in Sweden, had helped, in spite of a strong <pb facs="5423404_3_0272.jpg" n="6"/>neutrality, to have its sympathy lean towards the "Allies."</p>
   <p>He spoke long and sincerely about Sweden and the Swedes, about the war, which will shortly be won by the Allies, and of what grand and glorious times were in store for us. The program concluded with the singing of "America" in unison.</p>
   <p>The "Taffel-music" was furnished by Meek's orchestra.</p>
