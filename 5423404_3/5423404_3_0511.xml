   <p>"Swedish Engineers Society" is the name given to a society organized last Saturday evening, the function of which will be to furnish an exchange of views between Swedish engineers of Chicago and other societies of engineers.</p>
   <p>G. A. Akerlind, consulting engineer of the National Pump Car Company and the Roger Ballast Car Company was the first to issue the call for a meeting at Kunz Remmler's. The meeting was attended by twenty ex-members of the Swedish Engineers club who have abandoned this organization because its work is unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>After a discussion on important questions of organization, the following members were elected officers: Henry Nyberg, automobile manufacturer, chairman; Albin Rissler, engineer, vice-chairman; G. A. Akerlind, engineer, secretary; F. Seaberg, engineer, financial secretary and cashier. The members of the Executive Committee are Inspector C. A. Alzen; Henry Ericson, architect; A. G. Lund, Superintendent at the Illinois Steel Company; John Brunner; and Fred Norlin civil engineer. The meeting was followed by a dinner <pb facs="5423404_3_0512.jpg" n="2"/>to which the press was invited and during which Mr. Nyberg acted as master of ceremonies. A toast was offered to the Swedish Engineers of America, especially those of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Secretary Akerlind's address is 1702 Railway Exchange Bldg.</p>
