<title level="a">MONUMENT IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN JOHN ERICSSON</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>It has been suggested that a monument be erected in honor of Captain John Ericsson, the constructor and builder of The Monitor. The Hon. John J. Fitzgerald of New York has introduced a bill in the United States Congress, calling for an appropriation of $100,000 for the purpose.</p>
   <p>The following resolution was passed at the regular meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Order of Viking on February 14 in Chicago:</p>
   <p>"Whereas it has come to our notice, that a bill has been introduced in the U. S. Congress by the Hon. John J. Fitzgerald of New York, calling for an appropriation of $100,000 for the purpose of erecting a monument in memory of the constructor and builder of the 'Monitor,' Capt. John Ericsson, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas it is the sense of this body of patriotic Swedish-Americans <pb facs="5423404_3_1039.jpg" n="2"/>that a nation as great and rich as ours should in some fitting way honor the memory of those men who in the hour of need did some great service to the country, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas Capt. John Ericsson, through the building of the 'Monitor' not only checked 'Merrimac's' triumphant path towards the North, but also revolutionized naval warfare, therefore,</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved that the Independent Order of Vikings, in convention assembled in the City of Chicago on the 14th day of February, 1914, commend this bill, and urgently and respectfully request all Swedish-American Societies to urge their respective Honorable U. S. Senators and Honorable U. S. Representatives to favor this bill in honor of our illustrious countryman, and further</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved, that a copy of this resolution be furnished to each <pb facs="5423404_3_1040.jpg" n="3"/>delegate of this convention to be forwarded to his respective Honorable U. S. Senator and Honorable U. S. Representative, a copy also to be forwarded by the Grand Lodge to the two Honorable U. S. Senators of Illinois and each Honorable Representative of Chicago, and further</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved that this resolution be printed in the Vikingen, our official organ, and released to the Swedish-American press, and further</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved that we urge all subordinate lodges to pass similar resolutions and forward same to proper parties."</p>
