   <p>Brage Lodge No. 2 of the Independent Order of Vikings laid the cornerstone of its new home at Sheffield Avenue and School Street at a festive ceremony last Sunday. Brage is the first Swedish lodge in Chicago to have its own building, and for this reason, the occasion was particularly significant. At two o'clock in the afternoon, members of the Viking order gathered in and about Clifton Hall, and marched in an impressive parade through the streets of Lake View. Several other lodges also participated, carrying their standards and banners.</p>
   <p>The ceremony at the building site was opened by the order's grand master, Editor Frederick Malmquist, and the Viking's orchestra then played several numbers of Swedish music. The Orpheus Singing Club sang "Wonderful Land," "Our Country," and other fine Swedish songs, whereafter the grand master laid the cornerstone.</p>
   <p>Reverend Herman Lindskog was the main speaker, and pointed out that the modern <pb facs="5423404_3_1157.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish Vikings do not come to these shores to raid and spread terror, but to do their share in building up a new continent and creating a new and better society. He also declared that this cornerstone was much more than merely the foundation of a lodge building, since it also signified the cornerstone of Swedish culture, tradition, and achievement in a new land.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malmquist, in his speech, called attention to the fact that Brage, during its seventeen years of existence, has grown from a small beginning into one of the largest lodges of the Viking order, with a membership of almost eight hundred. Whether members or not, all Swedes join in wishing Brage continued success in its new building.</p>
