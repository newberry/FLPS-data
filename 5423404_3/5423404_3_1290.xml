   <p>p.11...A veteran's club was organized by members of the I.O.S. at a meeting held at Three Links Hall on Chicago Avenue last Saturday evening. Admission to the new club is won only by those persons who have been members of Svithiod at least twenty years. About one hundred men and women came. The oldest veteran was Dr. Holm who is now seventy-one years; and the youngest Dr. Johnson, who is forty-two years. One of the leading members among these "oldsters" is Mr. Frank Lindquist, who delivered a speech of welcome. After him appeared Mr. J.P.Johnson, who in an interesting talk dwelled upon the past history of the Svithiod Society.</p>
   <p>Appropriate songs were enjoyed thru the beautiful singing of the Lake View Sextette. The singers were encored again and again. Instrumental music <pb facs="5423404_3_1291.jpg" n="2"/>was rendered by Messrs. Lehman, violin, and Victor Svenson, piano.</p>
   <p>A festival poem, composed by Mr. J.P. Vest, was read on the occasion by the author.</p>
   <p>The women gave a fine luncheon during the happy evening.</p>
