   <p>The League has just announced its program for the coming season, which extends from September 30, 1921, to April 28, 1922. On the former date a meeting will be held at which Editor Herman Cederblad will speak on "The Importance of Educational Work." The next lecture of the season will be given by Dr. Herman Lundborg, of the University of Uppsala, Sweden, on "Racial Hygiene and its Problems." Later on, Donald A. McQueen, high-school teacher, will give a series of lectures under the headings "A Study of Institutions," with the following subdivisions: 1. "Law and Government"; 2. "Religion"; 3. "Science and Industry"; 4. "Civilization Today."</p>
   <p>After the start of the new year there will be lectures by Benjamin Mills and Editor Oscar W. Larson, who will speak on "The Art of Public Speaking" and "Socialism and Communism," respectively. Then follow two talks by Irwin St. John Tucker under the common heading, "The Empires of the North." The first one will deal with "The Sea Empire--the Vikings", while the other one will be <pb facs="5423404_3_0858.jpg" n="2"/>on "The Land Empire--Gusavus Adolphus".</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the season Dr. Einar Joranson will give a series of lectures on "The Background of Nineteenth Century Europe."</p>
   <p>The final meeting will be held April 28, and it is planned to make it a festive event. Several individuals and clubs have promised to attend meetings throughout the work-year and to contribute to the entertainment with music and song. All in all, the League's 1921-22 season looks very promising.</p>
