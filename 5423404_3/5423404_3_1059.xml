   <p>met last week to discuss several questions of major importance.</p>
   <p>It was reported that the freight charges for the transportation of the Linne statue from Sweden to Boston will amount to 25 pounds sterling, or approximately $150., and it was decided at the meeting to leave decision of the matter to the firm of Meyer &amp; Company in Sweden. Another report was to the effect that the Grand Trunk Railway had promised to ship the monument via this railroad from Boston to Chicago free of charge. An offer from a sculptural artist in Stockholm to accompany the statue across to Chicago and to supervise the assembling and erection of the statue was declined, inasmuch as a competent person, at a considerably lower rate, can be found locally.</p>
   <p>Mr. Robert Lindblom renewed at this meeting his previously stated desire to be relieved of his duties as chairman of the Society and its executive committee, inasmuch as he is about to go to Europe and may be absent from Chicago for possibly a whole year. This gave cause to a lengthy discussion which resulted in an appeal to Mr. Lindblom to retain the presidency of the Society, especially in view of the fact that the burden of chairmanship in his absence could be placed upon the shoulders of the seven vice-presidents of the Society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1060.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Lindblom thankfully acknowledged the "vote of confidence" accorded him, and consented to remain in his capacity.</p>
   <p>At this juncture mention was made of the fact that the by-laws of the Society provide that the presidential gavel, in the absence of the president, shall be in the hands of the vice-presidents in the order they are recorded. In view of the possibility of the regular president's lengthy absence, and particularly in view of the lack of interest displayed by the first vice-president, the meeting decided to suspend the rules and elect an executive president to serve during the absence of Mr. Lindblom. The roll call showed that the required majority was present, and Mr. Andrew Chaiser was duly elected to fill the position.</p>
   <p>The treasurer reported that a cash sum of $10,844.81 had been paid into the fund and was at this time at the Society's disposal. An additional sum of $4,000. has been pledged and will be in the treasury by August 1.</p>
