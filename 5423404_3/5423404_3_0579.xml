   <p>On the anniversary of Mr. Axel J. Johnson's thirtieth year as editor and publisher of the Svenska Kuriren, several of his friends arranged a banquet in his honor at the Swedish Club, where over one hundred gentlemen were present. The festivities opened with a splendid Swedish supper, whereupon the master of ceremonies, Mr. Charles S. Peterson, in a short speech told of the purpose of the purpose of the gathering, and extended a hearty greeting to the guest of honor.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Sweden's representative in Chicago, Consul General Sigurd T. Goes. In well-chosen words he thanked Mr. Johnson for his unselfish work in the interest of our countrymen and the preservation of Swedish traditions.</p>
   <p>"Editor Johnson," he said, "has not only extolled the good and beautiful in our native land, but also pointed to the many advantages we enjoy in <pb facs="5423404_3_0580.jpg" n="2"/>our adopted country. I know, that Sweden's Minister in Washington as well as my colleague in New York City, Consul General Clarholm, highly value Mr. Johnson's abilities as a newspaperman, and I take it upon myself to express both theirs and my own sincere congratulations upon Mr. Johnson's thirty years of fruitful cultural work in both Sweden's and America's interests."</p>
   <p>After this speech the master of ceremonies read a long letter of greeting from Sweden's special commercial representative in Washington, Mr. A. R. Nordvall. The next speaker was the Swedish vice-consul in Chicago, J. Bernhard Anderson, who spoke of Mr. Johnson as a citizen in general and a newspaperman in particular. Carl R. Chindblom delivered a fine speech in honor of Mr. Johnson, whereupon a number of telegrams and letters of greetings from different parts of the country were read. Among the telegrams was one from Mr. Charles K. Johanson, New York, and one from another newspaperman, Mr. Swan J. Turnblad, publisher of the Swedish Tribune, in Minneapolis. Former Judge Alfred O. Erickson, delivered a well-received, humorous speech, wherein he wished Mr. Johnson would be granted another <pb facs="5423404_3_0581.jpg" n="3"/>thirty years of effective newspaper work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson was then asked to speak. His speech was flavored with humorous episodes which were received with applause. He began by touching upon his early years as the owner of the Kuriren, his activities in politics, and conditions in general in the newspaper world and politics. He concluded his speech by expressing his heartfelt thanks to those present for the honor they had brought him, and for the friendship and co-operation they had showed him and his undertaking. With this, the festivities should have come to an end, but the master of ceremonies just happened to remember that one of Mr. Johnson's friends of long standing, Senator Fred Lundin, had not spoken. He accommodated the gathering by delivering the evening's most powerful speech, which was received with thundering applause. He concluded with an appeal to all who wish to show true friendship for Alex J. Johnson, to make every effort toward his nomination as County Commissioner on the Republican ticket, at the primaries, September 11. A small but very effective orchestra rendered the music during the banquet. The Chicago <pb facs="5423404_3_0582.jpg" n="4"/>Quartet with Mr. Anthony aided in maintaining an animated feeling throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>During the evening a poem written by Mr. O. A. Linder, editor-in-chief of Svenska-Americaneren, was read with much amusement. Mr. Frithiof Malmquist, editor of Svenska-Americaneren, also tuned his "lyre" in Mr. Johnson's honor. The verses, however, were not read, but given to Mr. Johnson in private, to be perused at his convenience.</p>
