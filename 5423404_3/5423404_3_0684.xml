   <p>The Scandinavian press has supported the Republican Party until a short time before the meeting of the Republican Convention. The Scandinavians had hoped until the last moment that the leaders of party for law and order would be sensible and put such candidates on their ticket, as would be able to gain the confidence of the voters of Scandinavian nationality. But how they were mistaken. The chosen candidates were men of such doubtful reputation that the Scandinavian press which had so far adhered staunchly to the Republican Party, could do so no longer.</p>
   <p>Svenska Amerikanaren thinks that the Republicans should have chosen honest and able candidates for the vacant posts, in order to put an end to the corruption in the party. But instead of doing that they have nominated political adventurers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0685.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Skandinaven, the greatest Scandinavian newspaper in the West, considers it an honor to break with the present corrupt administration, to be independent Republican - further considers it its duty to notify its readers that the Republicans will be defeated on October 13th.</p>
