   <p>Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's Calendar and Yearbook for 1911 is now off the press, and has been mailed to our subscribers free of charge. We always try to make the latest edition of this handy little book better than the preceding one, containing more interesting information and more accurate data.</p>
   <p>The Calendar and Yearbook contains a list of the members of the Swedish royal family, with birthdays and other data. It also contains the gospel texts for every Sunday of the year. There is a complete list of United States consular districts in Sweden, and also the names and office addresses of Swedish consuls in this country.</p>
   <p>There are a number of articles on various subjects of general interest, each written by an expert who has made a special study of his particular subject. This series begins with an article under the caption "Between <pb facs="5423404_3_0727.jpg" n="2"/>You and Me" by the editor in which he outlines the policies of the paper and the principles for which it stands.</p>
   <p>Another article contains a short biography with pictures of every member of the staff of the Tribunen-Nyheter. Our readers will probably be surprised to see how many people it takes to publish a first-class, modern weekly newspaper.</p>
   <p>Other articles contain statistical data and information pertaining to a great variety of subjects; this may come in handy during the year.</p>
   <p>All in all, we are proud of this Yearbook, and feel that it can hold its own with any other publication of its kind. Our original intention was to mail it only to those who renewed their subscription for next year, but we later decided to present all our subscribers with a copy at once, inasmuch as we know that most of them will take the paper in 1911 anyway.</p>
