   <p>p.1..... Next Tuesday it will be twenty-five years since Carl von Linne' found his place in Lincoln Park - as a replica of "Dyfverman's" statue in "Humlegaarden."</p>
   <p>The commemoration ceremonies will take place next Sunday, and an enormous crowd is certain to be present.</p>
   <p>It was at a meeting on June 7, 1887, that our countrymen here laid down the foundation for a Linne' monument society. At this meeting Mr. C.J.Sundall was in the chair, with Mr. C.F.Paterson as secretary. At the Board of Directors'</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1031.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>meeting about a month later, the following officers were chosen: Dr. John A. Enander, President, C.J.Sundell, Robert Lindblom, R.S.Peterson, O.G.Lange, P.M. Almini, Andrew Chaiser and P.M.Wilson, Vice Presidents; Lawrence Hesselroth, Rec. Sec'y.; Victor Tengwald, Cor. Secy.; H.P. Brucewitz and C.Eklund, Contr. Secy.; C. Widestrand, Fin. Secy. and John R. Lindgreen, Treas.</p>
   <p>Dr. Enander resigned as President in March 1889 and was followed in office by Robert Lindblom and Andrew Chaiser. of the old directors the following are still alive: Chas. Eklund, near ninety years old, Oscar F. Widman, Sam Freeman, Gustof Swenson and A. Strombeck.</p>
   <p>The collection of funds was pursued energetically and in November 1888 the order for the monument was placed with Otto Meyer &amp; Co., Stockholm.</p>
   <p>The cost of the statue is $62,000, to which must be added the cost of the granite base.</p>
   <p>The four allegoric figures at the base were missed for a long time and were finally <pb facs="5423404_3_1032.jpg" n="3"/>substituted with four flower urns, but at last even Linne' in Lincoln Park received his "four wives," as the popular expression likes to term them.</p>
   <p>Dedication took place Saturday May 23, 1891 in the presence of an enormous crowd of people, the greatest gathering of our people we have ever had here. In the parade, which preceded the dedication, four thousand persons participated, as did fourteen musicians, who to the tunes of "Bjorneborgarnes'March" filed into the park and formed a square around the statue. The unveiling speech was made by Robert Lindblom, whose daughter pulled away the cover. In behalf of the park commissioners and the State, speeches were made by Gen. Stockton and Mayor Washburne. The Swedish Glee Club, under the direction of Prof. John R. Ortengren, sang; C.F.Peterson read a poem of his own for this occasion, and Dr. Enander gave an historical lecture of Linne' and his work.</p>
   <p>After the ceremonies people gathered at Thielmas Garden and Inn, where an animated atmosphere prevailed the rest of the evening.</p>
   <p>For Sunday a grand memorial parade has been arranged with a large number of organizations: The Singers League, the National Dancers, the lodges Svea and North Star, Svithiod lodge, Ladies of Svithiod, I.O.G.T., society Gustaf II Adolf, <pb facs="5423404_3_1033.jpg" n="4"/>Viking lodge, Ladies of Vikings, the societies Thor and Unity, Vasa lodge, Scandinavian Leagues, Swedish Engineers Society, Swedish-American Athletic Club, Soldiers League, etc. Music will be furnished by Vikings Band, speech by John E. Ericsson, chairman of the committee, songs by the United Singers League, Swedish festival speech by Professor J.E.Hillberg, song by Swedish Ladies Trio, festival poem by Werner Melinder, English speech by professor John M. Coulter of Chicago University and by United States Minister to Stockholm, Ira Nelson Morris.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sven Windrow, who was Chief Marshal at the dedication ceremonies twenty-five years ago has been appointed Honorary Marshal to lead the parade alongside of the Marshal Knute G. Carlson.</p>
   <p>The parade starts at Belmont and Clark Avenues at 2 o'clock P.M., and about 25,000 people are expected to take part. All meet at the music pavilion in Lincoln Park at 3 o'clock P.M.</p>
