  <body>
   <p>The observance of midsummer is becoming a regular custom in Swedish-America. This year preparations are already under way in many Swedish colonies throughout the country for midsummer festivals of a nature to give the participants not only a few hours of fun and merrymaking, but pleasant memories to be stored for years to come.</p>
   <p>These festivals are definitely of a national character. Swedish is used in speeches and song, Swedish games are played, and young and old dance Swedish dances to Swedish music. Among the celebrants one will even find a few dressed in Swedish national costumes, and the beautiful yellow and blue may be seen waving in the summer breeze, side by side with Old Glory.</p>
   <p>These midsummer events play an important role in our cultural work, and efforts have been made to eliminate from them such features as are of questionable value and which do not reflect credit on the Swedish name. The programs <pb facs="5423404_3_0305.jpg" n="2"/>that are now offered are of such a nature that every Swedish-American should enjoy them, and the festivals, in communities where they have become annual events, represent a strong unifying force among our nationals.</p>
   <p>It has often been suggested that a national day be designated for Swedes in America. We think this is a good idea, and should not be a bit surprised if Midsummer Day were chosen for the occasion.</p>
