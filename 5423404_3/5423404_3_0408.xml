   <p>The Norwegian Vikingship, which will be exhibited at the future World's Fair in Chicago, is soon to be ready and will sail to America early in the month of April. It is a reproduction of the Vikingship, which was found in 1880 by a sailor imbedded in sand close to Landefjord, Norway. This old relic, which is supposed to have been built in the 800's, was dug up and carried to the University Museum in Kristiania. The idea of showing a copy of the ship at the World's Fair in Chicago came up during "The Leif Erickson Movement." A collection was made in order to build a reproduction to be sent over here. It is 72 1/2 feet in length, 16 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the middle. Both ends are very high. The building material is oak. The ship has 32 oars, each of them seventeen feet long. The idea is to let the ship sail the Atlantic without any help from any other boat. Magnus Anderson is appointed captain.</p>
   <p>Several prominent Norwegians in New York gathered last Sunday at the place of Harry Randall and decided to meet the ship with a steamer when it arrives in the <pb facs="5423404_3_0409.jpg" n="2"/>harbor in May.</p>
   <p>It is going to stay in New York for a few days, a festival is going to be arranged aboard. The ship will then continue through the Hudson River, Erie canal and the lakes to Chicago.</p>
