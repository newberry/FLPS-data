   <p>The Swedish Element in America is the title of an extensive biographical work which has just been published by the Swedish-American Biographical Society of Chicago, and which gives much instructive information concerning the Swedish contribution to the cultural and material development of America. It consists of three volumes totaling 1,548 pages.</p>
   <p>One volume contains the biographies of Swedish-Americans who have been persuaded to write their own story about themselves and their work. There are some five hundred such biographies which, of course, only account for a fraction of the Swedish element in this country, but we all know how reticent Swedes can be.</p>
   <p>The two other volumes are more interesting, and will be of value as reference books on Swedish-American history. Charles S. Peterson is the president of the <pb facs="5423404_3_0711.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish-American Biographical Society, and E. G. Westman was the editor in chief of this work. Among those who have contributed articles are several noted Swedish-Americans. The illustrations are well chosen.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Element in America is really a subscription work, and the financing of the venture was secure before it was started. But a limited number of copies are available, and the price is twenty-five dollars for all three volumes. The de luxe edition costs fifty dollars.</p>
