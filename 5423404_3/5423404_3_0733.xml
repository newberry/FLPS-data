   <p>The History of the World, written for the layman, by Johan Bergman and Emil Svensen.</p>
   <p>The study of history is of great value to anybody who undertakes it, and in this particular work the authors have attempted to present to us the real history of humanity; not only the history of kings and wars, but also that of peace and the common people.</p>
   <p>The writing of world history has up to now been neglected by Swedish authors. We have had, to a great extent, to depend on translations, and these have been of a rather scientific nature not so well adapted for popular reading.</p>
   <p>A great many Swedish-Americans have from time to time asked us where a popularly written world history in the Swedish language could be obtained, and we finally decided to do something about it. From one of the leading <pb facs="5423404_3_0734.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish publishers we have imported a limited number of copies of this historical work, which is considered the best so far written in the Swedish language. It consists of six volumes, of altogether 3,420 pages, bound in half Morocco, with gold cuts; a fine example of Swedish book binding art.</p>
   <p>The price of the complete work is $18. On the receipt of this amount we will send all six volumes by return mail. We give the purchaser ten days in which to decide whether or not he is satisfied with the deal. If within that time limit he returns the books we will return the money.</p>
