   <p>Joe Stecher was unable to defeat John Frieberg of Chicago, when the two "gladiators" met on February 5 at Springfield, Massachusetts. On the contrary, John Frieberg came out with flying colors. And since Stecher is considered the second best wrestler in the country, one understands what this victory means to our countryman.</p>
   <p>Stecher had agreed to throw Frieberg twice within ninety minutes, or, if he could not accomplish this, he would consider himself beaten. He was unable to throw the Swede within the time set. Instead there were a number of times when he himself, was in danger <pb facs="5423404_3_0967.jpg" n="2"/>of being "laid flat". For Frieberg had, time and again, applied a powerful toe-hold to his opponent, which, if it had been completely locked, is synonomous with "good night", for the one on whom it is applied.</p>
   <p>Stecher applied his well-known scissor-hold once or twice against Frieberg, the hold which few have been able to win over. But the second time he attempted it, Frieberg felt the press of his opponent's powerful legs around his own mid-section. It is there the hold does the so-called trick. He understood at once, and responded with a toe-hold so powerful that Stecher was forced to give up his hold.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0968.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The match on the whole was defined as gentlemanly on both sides. None of the so-called "rough stuff" was used, which made the contest so much the more interesting and enjoyable. It also obtained for both men many new admirers, the winner, especaially. Frieberg was the aggressor practically throughout the match.</p>
   <p>This victory earns for Frieberg the right to meet the champion in the heavyweight division, Earl Caddock. If he wins in his contest against Caddock, we will have a Swedish world champion in wrestling.</p>
