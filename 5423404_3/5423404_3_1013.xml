<title level="a">THE SWEDENBORG BUST TO LINCOLN PARK</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The bust of Emanuel Swedenborg, donated to the Swedes of Chicago by Mrs. L. Brackett Bishop, as announced in the columns of this paper a couple of weeks ago, will be placed in Lincoln Park. C. S. Peterson has obtained a formal promise to that effect, and the Park Board has been gracious enough to invite the Swedes to choose the place in which they want the bust to stand. This choice was made last Sunday, when a committee, headed by C. S. Peterson and accompanied by J. A. Torstenson of the Lincoln Park Board, explored the park in order to find the most suitable place. It was decided to put the memorial on the northern end of beautiful Simmon Island, which is near the lake. The terrain here is somewhat elevated, so that the bust will be seen from a long distance. It is an ideal spot on which to erect a memorial to this great Swedish naturalist and mystic.</p>
   <p>The bust is four feet high, and is to be placed on a base eight feet high.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1014.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thus,the total height of the memorial will be twelve feet. It will be surrounded by flower beds and fountains.</p>
   <p>Architect Andrew Sandegren has offered to make the drawings for the base, and they will be ready in a couple of weeks. The cost of the base and of putting the bust in place will be paid by Swedenborg's countrymen in Chicago. The money is being raised by subscription.</p>
