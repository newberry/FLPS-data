   <p>The Swedish film, "Festive Sweden," was presented last Friday in Orchestra Hall, which was filled to capacity. The consensus is that this is the best Swedish-made film which has ever been shown here. It seems that Swedish producers are finally beginning to realize that the Swedish-American public prefers to see Sweden as it is today, not as it was fifty or one hundred years ago. Somebody must have told them that pictures of old, dilapidated farm houses, stone-strewed farms, hungry-looking cattle, and old men and women in makeshift clothes do not present a true picture of Sweden, but tend to give Americans of Swedish ancestry, as well as others, an entirely wrong idea of the country. After seeing last Friday's performance, a young Swedish-American girl remarked, "But are Swedish children really so well dressed and nice looking?" Many others were undoubtedly just as pleasantly surprised as she was. And where could they have gotten their wrong impressions of Sweden and its people if not from some of the films that have previously been shown here?</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0779.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We hope that this one will be seen by many, and that it is the forerunner of many more Swedish films of the same kind.</p>
