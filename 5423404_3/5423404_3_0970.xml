   <p>p.11.............The world famous Swedish athletic leader, Director, J. S. Edstrom, - well-known here as the "main-spring" in the Olympic Games" in Stockholm 1912, has, for some time together with his family, been visiting Chicago, where he has many relatives and a host of friends from earlier visits here.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edstrom is half Chicagoan. His wife who he married in 1899 is the daughter of the merchant Oscar Theodoe Randall. Mr. Edstrom is one of Sweden's best known and most popular personalities; this is largely due to his leadership in athletics, but also to his jovial and upright dealings with all. Mr. Edstrom is not a stranger in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0971.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the nineties he was for several years connected with many of our largest electrical power companies. At present he is chief for Sweden's largest electric company "Allmanna Svenska" in Vesteras.</p>
   <p>Monday Mr. Edstrom will leave for Canada, and it is his intention to make his return voyage to Sweden on the steamship Stockholm, which ship also brought him here.</p>
