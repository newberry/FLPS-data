   <p>The meeting was opened at 9 o'clock, by the president Herman Carlson. All delegates except two were present. These two, however, were represented by substitutes. The officers for 1904 presented their reports. The report by the Great-Secretary indicated that the order, during the past year has made good progress... The committee on finance reported that they audited all the accounts of the Order and found them correct. The committee recommended that the cabinet of the past year be declared free from financial <pb facs="5423404_3_1218.jpg" n="2"/>responsibility to the Order. The reports were accepted by the meeting.</p>

   <p>The dues to the Great-Lodge were set at ten cents each lodge member, per quarter. Several motions were made for changes in the constitution. These, with other bills for the advancement of the Order, were presented to the meeting and were ordered to be sent to the individual lodges for their action.</p>
   <p>The next Great-Lodge meeting is to be held in Chicago, February, 1906.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned at 10 o'clock, after which a banquet was held for the delegates, in the adjoining club room.</p>
