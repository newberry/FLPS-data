   <p>p.11...........A May festival was celebrated last Saturday evening by the Svithied Lodge, Number 1, I.O.S. at the North Side Turner Hall. Rarely has the hall been as crowded as on this occasion. It was the twenty-first May festival of the ledge and one of its most successful ones. The Svithied Military Band greeted the audience with its music, and then the president Gustaf Peterson gave his speech of welcome. Swedish Women's Quartette sang "Aftonrodnaden" (Sunset) by Abt, and Mr. William Dahlen entertained the public with his silver clear tenor in Prince Gustaf's beautiful song "I Rosend Doft" (In the Fragranes of the Rose). After still another had been rendered by the band, "The Holy City," by Adams, was sung by a young boy, Frederick C. Erickson. G. B. Anderson, the lawyer, gave an exquisite speech, which was the signal for thunderous applause. After the speech, Mr. Dahlen sang an aria from the opera"Martha" by Fletow, followed by a speech by the quartette. Now followed by a play by the Swedish Theatrical Company, "Han Ar Icke Svartsjuk" (He's not Jealous). The roles to <pb facs="5423404_3_0381.jpg" n="2"/>the great entertainment of the audience in the comedy were taken by the following members in the company: Chr. Brusell, as August Walter, physician; Mrs. Anna Pfeil as Amanda, his wife; Ernst Behmer, as proprieter of the iron-works; Borgstrom, Amanda's uncle; Fred Bolling as Herman, the old servant. After the play the May-queen was crowned, and afterwards speeches and singing interchanged. Mr. Dahlen sang "Du Gamla," Du Friska" (Thou Old, Thou Sound), the public joining. The May-queen was young Miss Peterson, 1521 North Francisco Avenue. After the program, dancing followed, lasting till long after midnight.</p>
