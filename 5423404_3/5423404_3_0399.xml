   <p>The Columbian Exhibition, as the World's Fair is called, was dedicated May 1, by the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, and so was the Swedish Pavilion at the Fair. An enormous crowd of people of all nationalities were present at the general dedication. Theodore Thomas' famous orchestra, 600 pieces, played "Columbian March" by J. R. Paine. The invocation was delivered by Rev. W. H. Milburn; the Director General of the Fair made his speech. The President then gave his address, which was greeted with lively ovations. A banquet followed the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Pavilion at the World's Fair was dedicated in the afternoon. The dedication address was delivered by the director of the Swedish exhibition, Arthur Leffler. Both the Swedish and the American Flags were unfurled.</p>
   <p>A banquet was given in honor of the Swedish-Norwegian Minister Grip. Toasts were offered to President Cleveland and for King Oscar. Robert Lindblom, who has been very active in the work in the Swedish Pavilion, received the Royal Order of Vasa.</p>
