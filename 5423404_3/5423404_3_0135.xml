   <p>The famous work by Jules Verne, "Around the World in Eighty Days," has been dramatized in several languages, one of these the Swedish.....From Sweden, the piece has been transplanted to Swedish-American soil, and how well it has thrived here may be testified to by all the three thousand people who, on last Thursday, attended the presentation of the Play at the Auditorium. The Swedish National Association had undertaken the task of presenting it, and the Association fulfilled this task in a brilliant way. No expenses had been considered too great for the realistic reproduction of scenery, of that one became aware from the very start.</p>
   <p>As to the presentation itself, it may be said in general that the various actors gave a very satisfactory interpretation of their roles.</p>

   <p>Between the second and third acts, the audience had the pleasure of listening to singing by Miss Beulah West, and the enthusiasm over her songs was great. The audience simply would not stop applauding.</p>
   <p>In closing, it needs to be stated that the orchestra, under the direction of Professor J. S. Meck, contributed largely to the prevalence of joyfulness throughout the evening. To the Swedish National Association, we wish to call out a loud da capo.</p>
