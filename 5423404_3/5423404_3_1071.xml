<title level="a">NORDSTJARNAN, CHICAGO'S OLDEST SWEDISH SOCIETY, OBSERVES FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The sick benefit society Nordstjarnan (The North Star), well known among the older generation of Chicago Swedes, will observe the fiftieth anniversary of its founding next Monday. This organization, the oldest of its kind in the city, came into existence December 16, 1879, and there were sixteen charter members.</p>
   <p>The society Nordstjarnan was orginally organized as a singing society, and inasmuch as the present Nordstjarnan Singing Club was formed by members of the former, that club can also celebrate its fiftieth anniversary this year.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1880 some musical instruments were purchased, and members of <pb facs="5423404_3_1072.jpg" n="2"/>Nordstjarnan began to rehearse musical numbers regularly. This marked the beginning of the later so popular Nordstjarnan orchestra. This band, its members dressed in blue uniforms, attracted much attention when it took part in parades and public festivities arranged by Swedish-American organizations of that period.</p>
   <p>The society made its first public appearance March 20, 1880, in Svea Hall on the North Side, and on the occasion of its second anniversary, which was celebrated in Loellner's Hall on Blue Island Avenue, the wives and sweethearts of the members surprised them by presenting the society with a Swedish flag which they themselves had made.</p>
   <p>During the first few years Nordstjarnan's activities were primarily of an intellectual and cultural nature, and within a short time it possessed a quite extensive library. A few years ago the entire collection of books was <pb facs="5423404_3_1073.jpg" n="3"/>given to the Swedish Home for the Aged in Evanston. The society also arranged evening entertainments, with lectures and discussions on educational topics, which became very popular with the public. On such occasions the choir and the orchestra would also take part in the program, and on account of these and similar beneficial activities, Nordstjarnan won a high place in the esteem of Chicago's Swedes.</p>
   <p>At intervals this society even arranged public festivals, and during the winter season it hired such places as the First Regiment Armory and the Coliseum Annex for its public balls. No other single Swedish organization ever dared to try such undertakings.</p>
   <p>During the past half century Nordstjarnan has paid out $51,121 in sick benefits, and $26,892 for funeral expenses. In addition, $2,116 has been spent in the form of gifts and cash aid to members and others in need. A <pb facs="5423404_3_1074.jpg" n="4"/>considerable amount of money has also been required to keep the choir and orchestra going. In the spring of 1893 the society sent $1,000 for the relief of the people of Norrland, Sweden, and just before that it aided fire victims in the cities of Umea and Sundsvall.</p>
   <p>Of the sixteen charter members seven have passed away in the course of time. The society's first president was Lee Borell, and the present one is Chas. H. Lindberg, who has served in that capacity since January 1, 1923.</p>
   <p>Sunday, December 15, members and friends of Nordstjarnan will celebrate the jubilee at a festive gathering.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In the title of this article Nordstjarnan is designated as the oldest Swedish society in Chicago. Evidently this is not correct. According to Page 1, lines 5 &amp; 6, it is the oldest of its kind, that is the oldest sick benefit society.]</p>
