   <p>p.11.Swedish Engineers' Society held its annual meeting Saturday at Swedish Club Rooms, 1258 No. La Salle St. A rather large number of members was present in spite of the inclement weather. Mr. C. Ongman, last year's Vice President, opened the proceedings. The Secretary's and Treasurer's reports were read, which showed an increase in membership with fourteen to a total of 286, and receipts amounted to $934.87. Several interesting meetings had been held during the year, and the Society's supply of technical reading matter had been used extensively by the members.</p>
   <p>The Society had during the year participated in the collection of funds for the John Ericsson Memorial, and had also become a member of the Swedish Old Peoples Home Society. After these reports were received with approval, the different committees rendered theirs, whereupon the newly elected officers were installed in their respective positions.</p>
   <p>The new president, Mr. John E. Ericsson, gave a short speech, thanking them <pb facs="5423404_3_0480.jpg" n="2"/>for the honor bestowed upon him, and expressing the hope that the Society's work in the ensuing year would be crowned with as much success and progress as the circumstances would permit.</p>
   <p>The meeting then adjourned and the members met in the dining hall, where a delicious luncheon was served.</p>
