   <p>The annual general meeting of the Swedish Engineering Society was held last Saturday night in the auditorium of the Svithiod Singing Club. The following were elected as officers for the coming year: John S. Gullborg, president; Axel Akers, vice-president; A. Cederoth, secretary; Oscar B. Norgren, treasurer.</p>
   <p>John S. Gullborg, the Society's new president, has for many years enjoyed an enviable reputation as an engineer and inventor. At the present time, he heads the Alemite Die Casting and Manufacturing Company, which is now about to build a new, up-to-date plant on Belmont Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gullborg, soon after his graduation from engineering school in Sweden, made his first invention while working in Huskvarna, where armaments are manufactured.</p>

   <p>Since he came to America, about thirty-four years ago, he has made many inventions, some of which are of great industrial importance. He is about fifty-seven years old.</p>
