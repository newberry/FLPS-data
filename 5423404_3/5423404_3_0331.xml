   <p>An outstanding festival was celebrated last Saturday here in Chicago, the Svea Society was celebrating its 50th anniversary. Svea Society was organized on January 22, 1857 and elected C. J. Stollerand as leader. He later was a general in the U.S.Army and secretary to Consul C.J.Sundell. The banquet last Saturday was held in the Svithiod Singers' Club Room. You may have an idea that at a fifty year birthday celebration one would meet a small army of grand veterans, but there were only a few. Once in a while we would meet and shake hands with one of the old guard members, such as George W. Hertzman, C. A. Helander, E. O. Forsberg, John E. Tengberg, Sven Olin and others. The societies' present leader Hon. W. C. Nelson was master of ceremonies for the evening. He introduced the first Chicago quartette who under the leadership of Wm. Dahlens entertained with their colorful singing. After that Anders Schon spoke of the societies' beginning and its earlier usefulness. The supper was elegant. The societies' cashier John E. Tengberg at this time was presented with a very pretty Society Emblem donated by Gustaf L. Svenson. Svea's membership is not large but good. However, the treasury is particularly strong, $4,000. The officers of the society at present are the following:</p>
