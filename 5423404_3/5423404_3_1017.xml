   <p>A great number of the city's Swedes made their way to Oakhill Cemetery last Sunday to attend the unveiling of the memorial stone which has been placed on the grave of the late Dr. John A. Enander.</p>
   <p>The grave is located on the top of a small hill, and is flanked by great trees, forming a guard of honor, as it were. On it there now stands the beautiful memorial which has been erected by American Swedes in tribute to their greatest leader.</p>
   <p>The stone is of light brown Swedish granite. On its front face is placed the likeness of Dr. Enander in copper relief, done by the artist Carl J. Nilsson; there is also the following inscription: "John A. Enander. Born, May 22, 1842. Died, September 9, 1910". And at the bottom: "This stone was erected by Swedes in America, and unveiled May 22, 1921."</p>
   <p>After the unveiling ceremony was completed, a program of song and music was <pb facs="5423404_3_1018.jpg" n="2"/>presented, and Dr. Philip Andreen delivered a speech in which he paid homage to this great Swedish-American leader.</p>
   <p>The stone was delivered by the monument firm of Gust Kalzen, of Geneva, Illinois. its cost was $3,000.</p>
