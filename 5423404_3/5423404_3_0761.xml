   <p>The radio station WIBO, which is owned by the Nelson Brothers Bond and Mortgage Company, and which is known throughout the country as "the Swedish station," has just announced that it has made a new affiliation which is bound to increase its already great popularity, especially among the Swedish public.</p>
   <p>The station has now become affiliated with the National Broadcasting Company and with the Chicago Evening American, which newspaper has been closely associated with the development of broadcasting since 1922. This new combination has attracted much attention in the daily press. WIBO will from now on be able to offer the latest domestic and world news as well as the best of other radio entertainment. As our readers well know, the National Broadcasting Company is the world's largest producer and distributor of radio programs.</p>
   <p>The new set-up becomes effective next Tuesday, when WIBO will present a special introductory program.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0762.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The station's regular Sunday evening program as well as the special program given at 9 P.M. every Friday, which consist of Swedish music and entertainment announced in Swedish and are very popular among Swedish-Americans, will continue unchanged. The station is operating on a wave length of 526 meters and 570 kilocycles.</p>
