   <p>Now is the time for those afflicted with weak lungs to plan where to spend the fall and winter. Many thoughts go to the Swedish Sanatorium at Denver, Colorado, and every week we receive many requests for accommodations.</p>
   <p>As quickly as possible we are trying to provide space for these sufferers. During the month of July we received eight patients from different parts of the country. Another who has been promised room is a lady missionary, who has just returned from China, where she lost her health while aiding others. She was permitted to stay with friends for a while, but it was impossible for them to give her the care she needed. She is without any means and was in a rather difficult plight. Someone then thought of the Swedish Sanatorium. After proper inquiry, the management offered to take her in.</p>
   <p>We are doing a good and noble work, and our institution is worthy of the full confidence and support of our people.</p>
