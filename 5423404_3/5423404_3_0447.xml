   <p>The following pamphlets have been published by Captain A. Lofstrom's publishing house:</p>
   <p>Dalkullan Almanack and Kalender for 1906.</p>
   <p>This calendar-almanac is the best of its kind appearing in the Swedish language in this country. This holds true both as to contents and to make-up. The Dalkullan is rich in brisk stories and poems; pleasant tales and descriptions; songs with melodies added. To begin with, there is a "Vermlandsvisa," then <pb facs="5423404_3_0448.jpg" n="2"/>"A Love Story," and an account of "How I Became an Athlete." Later on, Herm. Stockenstrom teaches us "The New Mother Tongue".....Finally, one comes to "The Effects of Punch"; listens to a ditty about "Par and Lisa"; to finish with "Du gamla du friska" (You old, bright, and cheerful) The booklet costs only five cents.</p>
   <p>Dalkullan Sangbok is a little pamphlet, containing selected Swedish songs and ditties. The pamphlet costs fifteen cents.</p>
   <p>"Poetic Flowers" (second bunch) is the title of an attractive little pamphlet of poems, translated from the English language, and published by P. G. Almberg <pb facs="5423404_3_0449.jpg" n="3"/>and Co., 62 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago. The collection consists of forty-three poems, and among the translators we find practically all of our foremost poets: Stockenstrom; Bonggren; Wicklund; C. F. Peterson; Elmblad; Aurell; Craelius; Sundell; Linder; Skarstedt; Bernays...</p>
   <p>It is only a few months since we had the pleasure of announcing the first bunch of "Poetic Flowers," and in that pamphlet, the publishers promised to present a second bunch if the first was well received. In the preface to the present collection of poems, one finds the statement that the first collection "met cordial acceptance", wherefore the publishers consider themselves under obligation to redeem their promise to present the second bunch of the "Poetic <pb facs="5423404_3_0450.jpg" n="4"/>Flowers." It now remains for lovers of literature among the Swedes to make good this fulfillment of duty by acquiring a copy of the booklet as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The collection of poems is worthy of a place in any bookcase.... The collection bound, costs forty cents.</p>
