   <p>Pastor Otto Hogfeldt, editor-in-chief of Missions-Vannen (Friend of the Missions) observed his fortieth anniversary as a Swedish-American newspaperman early this month. For it was in July, 1889, that Hogfeldt, who was then a young man, took over the post as editor of the above-mentioned publication.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of this anniversary the owners of Missions-Vannen gave a banquet in his honor, on July 5, in the Ridgeview Hotel in Evanston.</p>
   <p>A. Julin, well known among the older generation of mission friends, acted as master of cermonies, and pastor A. Lydell paid tribute to the guest of honor in a speech that came straight from the heart. He was then presented with a beautiful gift. The feast ended with a speech by Editor Hogfeldt and a prayer by A. Julin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0690.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hogfeldt was born in Tisselskog parish, Dalsland, Sweden, August 10, 1861, and when only sixteen years old, he began to take part in the activities of the Free Church people as a Sunday-school teacher. It was his ambition to become a preacher, and since the outlook at home was not bright, he decided, when he was about twenty years old, to go to America, and he settled at Ishpeming, Michigan, where he remained about one year. He then went to Ansgarius College at Knoxville, Illinois, and after graduating from that institution became pastor of the mission congregation at Iron Mountain, Michigan. He held that post until 1889, when he moved to Chicago to become a member of the editorial staff of Missions-Vannen.</p>
   <p>Hogfeldt's work as a newspaperman has been of a kind that has won him respect from all quarters. With a sharp intelligence and a sharp pen he has fought everything which he has considered wrong, in religious as well as in political matters. And he has always been true to his convictions, regardless of consequences. This is the reason why he now stands among the leaders <pb facs="5423404_3_0691.jpg" n="3"/>of the Swedish-American press, and he is also one of the veterans of that press.</p>
