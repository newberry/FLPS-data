  <body>
   <p>When Dr. Olof A. Toffteen, noted educator and Assyriologist, left Chicago in 1920 on an extensive study trip to Europe, his departure was regretted by many, since it caused the temporary closing of the Scandia Institute, which was founded and operated by him, and which had earned a splendid reputation as an educational institution. However, Dr. Toffteen returned to the city a few days ago, and plans to reopen the Institute in the near future.</p>
   <p>He went first to France and Belgium, and from there to Germany, where he traveled extensively. Later, he went to Sweden where he remained for nine months. He then returned to Berlin, and lived there until he embarked for America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0800.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Toffteen is again making his home at 4753 Dover Street, and is now looking for suitable quarters for his school. For the time being, his teaching activities are limited to tutoring, but he expects to reopen the Scandia Institute next fall.</p>
   <p>Needless to say, his many friends here are happy to have him back after his long absence.</p>
