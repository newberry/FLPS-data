   <p>p.11..... The lecture at the Swedish Cultural Institute at Speltz Hall, Lake View, last Sunday afternoon was attended by an attentive audience. Countrymen and Countrywomen from both the South and West sides attended, but, strangely enough there were fewer from Lake View than expected from that section.</p>
   <p>Miss Margaret Dahlstrom sang a very beautiful song, accompanied by Mrs. Engstrom. Pastor Leonard Stromberg gave a lecture on "Religion and Culture". It was characterized by lofty ideals and noble thought. After this Mr. A. Hagman sang two Swedish songs. They were request numbers. The program ended with a declamation concerning the native land.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday at three P.M. the well-known Editor, Poet and Man of Letters, Dr. Jacob Bonggren will lecture on Swedish, and Swedish-American Literature. During The Last Twenty Years."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0921.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Other numbers on the program will be music and song.</p>
   <p>Since meetings of various kinds are held at the same time in different halls in the same building,it is to be carefully noted that the Cultural Institute Lectures are held in the large hall. Its entrance is to the right at the top of the stairs.</p>
   <p>Admission is free, and the lectures begin at three P.M. sharp. Those who wish to secure good seats should come early.</p>
