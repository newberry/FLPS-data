   <p>The interest in contributing to the fund for the erection of a statue to Linne' is steadily increasing. Many different societies in the middle west are working hard and with great enthusiasm for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Many societies are arranging lectures, concerts, balls, and bazaars and are taking in hundreds of dollars in admission fees.</p>
   <p>A meeting was held last Tuesday night with the committee of the Linne' Society. The chairman reported that he had held a conference with the Commissioners of Lincoln Park the other day concerning a place for the statue. It was decided that the greenhouse should be demolished and its place be given to the new monument among the flowers. A letter from sculptor Dyverman, Stockholm, Sweden, was read at the meeting. Dyverman offered to deliver to the committee models of the statue for 9,000 Swedish kronen, and the foundry factory, Meijer &amp; Co., Stockholm offered to cast the whole monument in copper for <pb facs="5423404_3_1063.jpg" n="2"/>50,000 and in zinc for 10,000 Swedish kronen.</p>
   <p>After the letter was read the chairman said he did not think it necessary to raise the suggested 40,000 then. He thought that $28,000 should be enough. Several speakers said that no conclusion should be reached until there was at least $10,000 in the treasury of the fund.</p>
