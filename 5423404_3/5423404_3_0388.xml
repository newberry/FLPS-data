   <p>p.11.................The Swedish National Society gave a fine banquet last Saturday evening at the Svithiod Hall on Wrightwood Avenue. The guests were those who had been engaged in the work of presenting "Vermlandingarne" (Vermeland Folks) at the Auditorium and about two-hundred club delegates had charge of the banquet. Mrs. Anna Carlson was due homage to the many tasty courses.After that a commemoration speech was made by Mr. C.J.Erickson in which a hearty expression of thanks was accorded the singers for their interest in the work which has brought such successful results. Those who appeared at the Auditorium festival were especially remembered in the speech. Svithiod Singing Club sang "Vart Land" (Our Land) - Runeberg and Pacius - and in return for tumultuous applause, "Gubben Ar Gammal." (The Man is Old) Mme. Ragna Linne' and Messrs J. W. Olson and Chr. Brusell made the festival still more interesting by singing various other songs which were well rendered.</p>
