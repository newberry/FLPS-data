  <body>
   <p>An exceptionally high class banquet was held on Tuesday Apr. 10, by the Svithiod Grand Lodge in honor of Axel Blomfelt, treasurer of the Grand Lodge. It was celebrating his forty-eighth birthday.</p>
   <p>The banquet was suggested and put on by the Verdandi local lodge of Chicago and was held at the popular festival hall of the Finstad and Johnson restaurant.</p>
   <p>Although the banquet was sponsored by the Verdandi local, of which Mr. Blomfelt was a member, every Chicago local was well represented; over a hundred enjoyed the celebration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Blomfelt was visited at his home by a committee in a special automobile in which he was brought to Finstad and Johnson's large, well selected place, where the surprise reached its peak and where all friends partook of the excellent foods prepared for the occasion.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Sandgren officiated as master of ceremonies. Mr. Axel Schott bade <pb facs="5423404_3_1205.jpg" n="2"/>the assembly welcome, making a very appropriate speech on the occasion, [in honor of] the highly esteemed brother, in whose honor they had gathered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Blomfelt was presented a beautiful silver loving-cup as a token of appreciation for his untiring activity, both in local and grand lodge service. Blomfelt's modest statement that he had only done his duty throughout and that he had not earned such an honor was made very short by the applause awarded him by a full house that insisted that he deserved even more honors.</p>
   <p>Attorney Bernard Anderson, John Ericson, and Alderman Bihl spoke of Blomfelt's service; so did Joseph G. Sheldon, president of the Svithiod Grand Lodge.</p>
