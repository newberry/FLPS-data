   <p>The majority of Swedish societies in this country have popular education on their programs, and each one appoints a librarian to take charge of the society's book collection, whether it is a large one or consists of only a few volumes.</p>
   <p>Like the other officers of the organization, the librarian submits an annual report, but usually this report consists only of a list of additions to the library which have been acquired during the year. Seldom does it tell of any positive effort to increase circulation, and, as a rule, new acquisitions are mentioned only when they are considered particularly valuable, or when they have been donated by some prominent person. When one listens to such reports, one is often tempted to doubt if the educational aspect of the society's activities is taken very seriously.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0456.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In many cases, the book collection is a mere adornment, as is the case in some well-to-do homes where the head of the family buys a fine collection of books in expensive bindings to impress his friends and visitors. We certainly do not mean to imply that the leaders within our societies are activated by similar motives. But we do think that in these days of keen competition, the less spectacular, but no less important, educational and cultural pursuits are apt to be neglected in the struggle for publicity, increased membership, and funds.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that a society which has popular education on its program does not fulfill its duties if it neglects its library activities. Any society which is fortunate enough to own a worth-while book collection should make it a point to have the books easily available, and to encourage reading. If the society does this, it will gain in solid, inner strength, and membership in it will be of greater value.</p>
   <p>Another suggestion we would like to make is that a catalogue be prepared of every library, large or small, and that books be loaned to non-members as <pb facs="5423404_3_0457.jpg" n="3"/>well as to members. The catalogue would show at a glance what the library has to offer, and its literary treasures would be made available and useful to a much larger number of people. Such a procedure would constitute a great improvement. We Swedish-Americans do not possess large and representative collections of Swedish literature, but there is no lack of interest, if only it be properly encouraged. How can we expect any substantial progress in this field unless we make the best possible use of what we already have?</p>
