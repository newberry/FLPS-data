   <p>As reported a couple of weeks ago, three district lodges of the Illinois Scandinavian Grand Lodge of the Order of Good Templars have been making preparations for a study course, which is to be given in the Good Templar Park at Lake Geneva from August 4 to August 7 inclusive. The plans are now complete, and the program for the series of meetings is much like that which has been adopted by the leaders of similar summer courses given in Sweden. Youths from various communities in this part of the country are given an opportunity to attend open-air classes, where they will receive instruction in the many activities carried on by the Order of Good Templars, as well as in other subjects of educational value.</p>
   <p>We do not know whether or not outsiders are invited to attend this course, but <pb facs="5423404_3_0830.jpg" n="2"/>its leaders undoubtedly desire as large an attendance as possible. For the larger the number of pupils, the more publicity will be obtained for the activities of the Order, and the more widely will the ideas and ideals for which it stands be distributed. The location of this summer school is particularly well suited for its purposes, and the beautiful park is an ideal place in which to spend a week, especially for the city worker who seldom has a chance to breathe the fresh, invigorating country air.</p>
   <p>This summer course is a laudable undertaking, and those who have taken the initiative and have done the preparatory work deserve credit. Let us hope that other organizations will follow the example which this organization is setting. The study courses and lecture series which are being given during the winter are of great value, but why should these activities be discontinued as soon as the warm season sets in? In most of our societies, work is practically at a standstill during the summer, and the slack might well be taken up by study courses and lectures. And if such activities could be carried on in the open so much the better. Students would then benefit both mentally and physically.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0831.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This study course which will open August 4 will not be the first one of its kind to be held here. A similar one was given a few years ago, also in the Good Templar Park, under the direction of the noted proponent of popular education, Professor Olson, from Sweden. He delivered a series of highly interesting lectures. That course was sponsored by another organization, but the majority of those who attended it were Good Templars. The Order may therefore be said to have been the leader in this field, and other organizations should follow. We have particularly in mind our many well-conducted sick benefit associations. They too have popular education on their program. But for various reasons that phase of their activities has been somewhat neglected.</p>
