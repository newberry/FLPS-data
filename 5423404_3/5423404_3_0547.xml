   <p>Swedish-Americans of the older generation remember well that forces were at work developing good citizenship among immigrants and reminding them of the privileges and duties conferred upon an American citizen long before present-day Americanization methods were initiated, and even before many of those who now lead the parade had seen the light of day. These forces consisted of the Swedish churches and societies and the Swedish press.</p>
   <p>The role which the newspapers have played in Americanization work is as old as the papers themselves. If one looks up old issues of the Tribunen, he will find as far back as twenty-five to thirty years ago numerous articles urging readers to learn the English language and to take out citizenship papers. These articles also pointed out the advantages and responsibilities inherent <pb facs="5423404_3_0548.jpg" n="2"/>in American citizenship. What the Swedish-American press has done and is still doing in this field is not sufficiently appreciated by those who are now acting as spokesmen for Americanism. They seem to labor under the delusion that the foreign-language press is an obstacle to those who try to get immigrants to learn English and become American citizens. But those who really understand the true situation know that this idea is entirely wrong, and that, on the contrary, the foreign-language is the most important factor in facilitating the Americanization process. It is, as it were, the bridge by means of which the immigrant crosses over into American society.</p>
   <p>Occasionally, intelligent and unbiased individuals give the foreign-language press credit for the important work which it is doing. In the old "Swedish" city of Galesburg, Illinois, a home-coming celebration took place last week, and on that occasion the Republican-Register issued a jubilee edition in which considerable space was given to flattering comment on the Swedes. Among other things we read: "Through their churches and their newspapers they (the Swedes) have learned to appreciate their new country. One can hardly overestimate the <pb facs="5423404_3_0549.jpg" n="3"/>importance of the role which the Swedish-American newspapers have played in implanting in Scandinavian immigrants the principles of American citizenship."</p>
   <p>As already stated, Galesburg is an old Swedish town, and the Republican-Register knows what it is talking about. A better knowledge of our citizens of foreign birth is required before current misunderstandings can be corrected. These citizens have one desire which overshadows all others: namely, to compare favorably with their native-born brethren in every respect, including loyal citizen-ship.</p>
