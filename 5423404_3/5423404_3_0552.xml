   <p>During recent months an unusually large number of our readers and friends have made us happy by writing us and expressing their good will and their confidence in the Tribunen-Nyheter. They have commented on the high quality of its contents, its liberal policies, and its never-ceasing efforts in behalf of the common welfare.</p>
   <p>Some of their tributes have been printed in our letter column. Below is one of the most recent ones. The writer is a man of the people, an independent thinker with a clear head and a warm heart. He renews his subscription, and goes on to say:</p>
   <p>"What I like best about the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter is its excellent editorial page. Very seldom does one run across anything there which does not <pb facs="5423404_3_0553.jpg" n="2"/>strike a responsive chord in the heart and brain of every reader who is spiritually awake and can think straight. This shows that the editorial staff is alert, that it understands the needs of the nation in these epoch-making times following the great world catastrophe.</p>
   <p>"In regard to the labor question, which is coming more and more to the fore, the Tribunen-Nyheter recognizes its duty toward those who by the sweat of their brow keep the wheels of industry turning. This is more than can be said of many other and more powerful newspapers, such as those of the great metropolis in the East, which always belittle the workers, but fail to call attention to the misdeeds of the big corporations and to the menace of the moneyed powers. We have at present so-called leaders who really belong to the time of England's Henry VIII and Spain's Philip II; and it is an open question whether they would have been tolerated even in those days.</p>
   <p>"In regard to the question of war and peace, the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter <pb facs="5423404_3_0554.jpg" n="3"/>sides with those who, in the event of war, have everything to lose from the slaughter which characterizes war, and not with those who apparently have everything to gain. This is in contrast to the position assumed by another Swedish publication in Chicago, which, only two years after the end of the World War, published an editorial on our relations with Mexico which bore the title, 'The Danger of Waiting Too Long'. This is not intended as a reflection upon anybody; it merely shows the difference in attitude among those whose task it should be to enlighten the public. No flattery is intended, but I wish to say that I like to call the Tribunen 'my paper'."</p>
   <p>It is only natural that we should be pleased to get letters like this one, and we have received several such lately. These expressions of appreciation are very encouraging to the editorial staff, which always trys to present an unbiased opinion on controversial questions. We thank the writers most heartily for their expressions of approval.</p>
