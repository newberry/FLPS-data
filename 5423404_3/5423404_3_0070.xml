   <p>Last Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, marks a new era in the history of Swedish singing in America. That date, Nov. 24th, 1892, gave birth to the American Union of Swedish Singers (Svenska Sangarforbundet i Amerika.)</p>
   <p>This conselidation of the Swedish singers has grown out of a suggestion made some time ago by the Lyran Singing Society of New York. The plan was discussed by the many Swedish singing clubs in various parts of the country. Great enthusiasm was evinced and before long it was decided that an organizing meeting should be held. Because of Chicago's geographical location, this city was chosen as the place for the meeting. Delegates from societies numbering close to 400 persons attended this meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0071.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is only a beginning, however, as the indications clearly point to the fact that the rest of the societies will join, as soon as they find it practicable and possible. By next year, in July, when the Union will have its first singing festival, it is our guess that between two and three thousand Swedish singers shall visit our city and with their beautiful singing add to the ever-increasing prestige of the Swedish culture. The World's Fair will be a befitting background for this first annual festival of the American Union of Swedish Singers.</p>
