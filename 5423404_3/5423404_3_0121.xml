   <p>The Swedish Drumatic Society had the pleasure last Sunday afternoon of playing to a full house at the Garrick Theater. The Society presented the old inimitable popular farce, "Andersson, Pettersson, and Lundstrom," by Frans Hedell. Because of the scenic facilities at the Garrick Theater and Mr. Fritz Schoultz's well-known ability where costumes are concerned, the effect of the play was greatly enhanced. This was especially noticed in the first and the last scenes. A certain degree of stage fright was noticeable at the start in the three principal figures, but this gradually disappeared as the play progressed, and the carpenter apprentice Andersson, played by Werner Melinder, the tailor apprentice Pettersson, played by Carl Liljegren, and last, but not least, the jolly shoemaker apprentice, Lundstrom, played by Ernst Behmer, gave evidence that the actors understood their roles correctly. The same may be said of Ernest Lindblom, Ernst Ekberg, Carl Milton, C. Sheldon, and John Milton, in their various roles. Wilma Sundberg-Stern, representing the <pb facs="5423404_3_0122.jpg" n="2"/>fairy of fortune in the first, second, and sixth scenes, was perhaps more fortunate in regard to costume than to acting, but as Andersson's girl in the fifth scene, she was superb. Sara Nordstrom and Sigrid Lindberg also made the best possible out of their respective roles. The nymphs, the trolls, and the dwarfs, acted quietly and in a traditional manner, and the peasants danced in great style. Lundstrom's ditty in the third act about the "Revolution of the Norwegians".....was quite quick in places, but on the whole it seemed rather tame. There was considerable applause, however, at a few high points in the song. Among the various scenes, the fifth deserves most praise for warmth of execution throughout. The music was played in an irreproachable manner by Meck's orchestra. Of course there was plenty of applause and curtain calls.....</p>
