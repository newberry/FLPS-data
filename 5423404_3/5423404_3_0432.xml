   <p>The Society for Advancement of Scandinavian Study held its annual meeting here, Friday and Saturday, on the invitation of Northwestern University.</p>
   <p>The society has adopted the program of working for the rooting of Scandinavian culture in America, and the members of the society are mainly teachers, of the languages of the North, at universities, colleges and high schools. The society now has nearly five hundred members, and during the coming year strong endeavors are to be made for the gaining of new ones.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, which is being conducted under the presidency of professor Jules Mauritzson, many learned and interesting lectures are being given, and nearly a whole session was spent in discussing various practical questions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0433.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Both for the purpose of being able, in a more vigorous way, to increase the membership, and also in order to gain recognition of Scandinavian studies,it was decided to elect four district secretaries; namely, Dr. Amandus Johnson, University of Pennsylvania, for the eastern district, professor J.A.Halerk, Fort Dodge, Iowa, for Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Illinois; professor A.A.Stromberg, Minneapolis, for Minnesota, the Dakota states, and Manitoba, and Dr. E.J.Vickner for the western states.</p>
   <p>In his capacity as chairman of the committee for Scandinavian language study in public high schools, professor Stomberg had gathered complete data concerning the number of schools where instruction is offered in Swedish or Norwegian, together with the number of students in the Scandinavian language classes. Swedish is being taught in twenty high schools, with 1,015 students, and Norwegian in 32 high schools with 950 students, or a total for Swedish and Norwegian of 1,965. Compared with the total of students two years ago, there is an increase of nearly 65 per cent.</p>
