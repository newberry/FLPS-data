   <p>The place was Grand Opera House; the play was Johan Jolin's "Laughter and Tears"; the producer was the Swedish Theatrical Company; the time was last Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>The play itself is nearly half a century old, but its quick, playful dialogues seem to have lost but little of their power to take hold of the public. But the presentation! "Oh you hard, cold world!"</p>
   <p>The player who did his work best was undoubtedly Mr. Schycker, His "Hyhinette" was a nearly perfect presentation, but then this role was about the simplest <pb facs="5423404_3_0132.jpg" n="2"/>to enact. Miss Brusell's "Agnes Brand" was rather miserable; her diction was had - one got the impression that an old, toothless woman was speaking. Miss Brusell intends to take up a theatrical career. I believe the kindest advice to her is, "Don't"!</p>
   <p>Mr. Behmer made me doubt that his somewhat reputed dramatic talent exists; his "Ferdinand" became a cheap clown.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brusell as the landowner "Oliphant" was good, and gained great applause. "Augusta," the wife, a prim and not very lovable lady, was played excellently in every detail.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lindblom made an excellent presentation of "Assessor Togeson." But the <pb facs="5423404_3_0133.jpg" n="3"/>assessor's son "Bernhard" was played badly. Mr. Fernlundh did not master his role. Mr. Carl Liljegren played surprisingly well, and Mr. Bolling, need not feel ashamed of his play, but his role was insignificant.</p>
