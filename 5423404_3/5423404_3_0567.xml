   <p>This organization gave its first public entertainment, a concert, last Saturday in the Swedish Club. The event was a complete success.</p>
   <p>Before the beginning of the concert the young organization's president, Frithiof Malmquist, editor of Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter, addressed the large audience and outlined the history and purposes of this organization of Swedish newspapermen in Chicago. He also announced that its honorary member, C.S. Peterson, president of the Swedish Club, had made two generous donations to the organization, one of two hundred dollars, and another one, which might be termed a promissory donation, pledging himself to give one hundred dollars per month for the rest of his life, to an emergency fund which is now being established by the League. The fund is to be used for the alleviation of suffering among poor and needy Swedes in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Individual performers and choruses took part in the musical program, donating their services, and an enjoyable evening was had by all.</p>
