   <p>At the last monthly meeting, December 17, the following officers were elected to serve during 1916: John Brunner, president; C. A. Bolin, vice-president; Carl Save, secretary; Axel Akers, treasurer.</p>
   <p>John Brunner, the new president, was born in Varberg, Sweden. After graduating from the Technical Institute of Stockholm, he worked for the Swedish National Railroads until 1888, when he set out for America.</p>
   <p>His first job here was as assistant engineer in the bridge building department of the Boston and Maine Railroad. Later on, he became chief engineer with the Mount Vernon Bridge Company of Mount Vernon, Ohio. After some time, he left this company to become assistant chief engineer at the Carnegie Steel Company's plants in Pittsburgh. Due to his reputation as a construction <pb facs="5423404_3_0483.jpg" n="2"/>engineer he was appointed engineer of bridges for Pittsburgh in 1896, and held this position until 1899, when he became city engineer of Pittsburgh. In 1902 he moved westward, and took a position as assistant superintendent of the northern plants of the Illinois Steel Company</p>
   <p>Brunner took an active part in the arrangements for the Swedish Engineering Congress, which was held here in Chicago last fall. He is a valued member of many Swedish societies.</p>
