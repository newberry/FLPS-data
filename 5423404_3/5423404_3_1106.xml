<title level="a">SVITHIOD YEARLY REPORT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The yearly report of the work done by The Independent Order of Svithiod during the year of 1918 has been published. The secretary, John A. Sandgren, therein points out that despite certain unfavorable circumstances as for instance, the fact that a large number of members served in the nation's army and navy, which meant increased risk and addition to expenses as did also the pneumonia epidemic, progress has been made. There is an increase, both in membership and of funds. The following is a short summary of the financial status of the lodge:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Assessed income of the Grand Lodge</cell>
     <cell>$93,420.25</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Interest on loans</cell>
     <cell>$13,650.95</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Other income</cell>
     <cell>$10,006.53</cell>

    <row>
     <cell>Total</cell>
     <cell>$117,077.73</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1107.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Expenses:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Insurance benefits</cell>
     <cell>$65,550.00</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Administration expenses</cell>
     <cell>$ 9,152.35</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Total</cell>
     <cell>$75,702.35</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>Thus funds have increased with $42,375.38. Assets of the Grand lodge increased to $298,825.90.</p>
   <p>Nine hundred seventy-six new members have been admitted, which is a fact of importance, considering the circumstances. Mortality has been greater than usual during the last three months due to the influenza and pneumonia epidemics, which were responsible for no less than sixty deaths.</p>
   <p>During the first nine months of the year, the mortality rate stayed at the average of sixty. Thus, total deaths during the year numbered one hundred <pb facs="5423404_3_1108.jpg" n="3"/>and twenty.</p>
   <p>More than six hundred members served in the war. Nine are reported dead from illness, or killed on the battlefield. They are: John B. Johnson, Chicago; Anton W. H. Lundell, Chicago Heights, Ill.; Oscar S. Anderson, Chicago; Thomas Edward Anderson, Chicago; Andrew Oswald Anderson, Chicago Heights; John Stone, Chicago; John Edward Eckhart, Chicago; James Salle, Joliet, Ill.; Arvid Gustav Johnson, Rockford, Ill.</p>
   <p>The total membership on the thirty-first of December, 1918, was 9,846, carrying a total insurance of $5,800,400. There are one hundred and ninety-eight honorary members,bringing the total to 10,044. The total number of lodges is fifty-eight. $31,715.59 in sick benefits have been paid through the lodges; funeral benefits,$7,100, and donations,$1,161.47. Total cash on hand in all the lodges: $169,988.17,showing an increase of about $12,000. Altogether,the total assets of the Order amount to $468, 814.07, of which $35,500. are invested in Liberty Bonds and War Savings Stamps. Since the organization of the Order, the following payments have <pb facs="5423404_3_1109.jpg" n="4"/>been made:</p>
   <p>Life insurance benefits to 1,100 members.</p>
