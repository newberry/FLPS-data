   <p>The social given at Phoenix Hall last Saturday evening by the Jupiter Sewing Society was one of the most attractive and most enjoyable socials we have attended for a long time. The decorations in the large hall were exceptionally beautiful. We had never seen better decorations at any Swedish social in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The program was executed to the full satisfaction of the audience, and the individual presentations were received with thunderous applause. The star number on the program was Frans Hodell's one-act play, "Five Stories Up." When one considers the fact that some of the actors were amateurs who had appeared on the stage on only one or two occasions before, one must admit that the acting was good. Transcriber Papier (Mr. Oscar Pearson) and Seamstress Lisette (Mrs. Alice Colini), who are more accustomed to the stage than the rest, played with ease, with no apparent awkwardness. Again and again these two were interrupted by thunderous applause. Mr. Folke Randel was partly successful in his role as Thure Hjentenpil, but on occasions he failed <pb facs="5423404_3_0143.jpg" n="2"/>to interpret this character correctly. Harold Hakanson, in the role of Mate Jacob Vader, was lacking in life and warmth, and Miss Ellen Eklund, in the role of his sweetheart, Seamstress Carolina, was in consequence not so good. The rest of the program was well presented. The social did not end till about four o'clock Sunday morning.</p>
