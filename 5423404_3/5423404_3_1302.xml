<title level="a">NEW VIKING HOME ON THE SOUTH SIDE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Thanks to energetic work and successful campaigning, the South Side lodges of the Viking Order have enjoyed a great increase in membership as well as in their cash balances during the last few years. Consequently, the question of building a home of their own has been under consideration for some time. A conveniently located site has been finally found, and the project has already progressed to the point where a building lot has been bought. It is located on the northeast corner of 69th Street and Emerald Avenue. Its dimensions are 148 by 98 feet, the long side facing 69th Street.</p>
   <p>Nine lodges are co-operating in the undertaking, namely: Angantyr, No. 4; Frei, No. 5; Runan, No. 7; Harald, No. 13; Gotha, No. 14; Valhalla, No. 21; Sten Sture, No. 45; Harmony, No. 53; and Trygg, No. 55. They are represented by the following trustees: John L. Alvin, A. E. Anderson, and John Johnson. The well-known attorney and real-estate man, John A. Linden, who is himself <pb facs="5423404_3_1303.jpg" n="2"/>a member and former Grand Master of the Order, acted as broker.</p>
   <p>Definite building plans have not yet been decided upon. The project involves the expenditure of roughly one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
