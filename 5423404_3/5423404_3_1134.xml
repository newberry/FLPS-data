   <p>The September meeting of the Swedish National Association was well attended. According to a report, several needy persons had received financial help during the past month. Honorable A. O. Eberhart, honorary member and governor of Minnesota sent the following telegram which was read at the meeting:</p>
   <p>"Mr. F. A. Lindstrand, Swedish National Association, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"Upon returning to the city I found the beautifully engrossed and framed copy of the resolution for my honorary membership in your Association. It was a most pleasant surprise as well as an interesting reminder of my visit with you on the occasion of the last festival at Elliott's Park. The photographs were also received and I wish to express my sincere thanks to you personally as well as through you to the Association for this kind rememberance. I shall always cherish this occasion as one of the most pleasant memories of my life. With best wishes I am, very sincerely yours, A. O. Eberhart, Governor."</p>
