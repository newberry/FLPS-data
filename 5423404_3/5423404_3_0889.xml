   <p>Oscar Montelius gave a lecture Thursday evening at Association Hall, 155 La Salle Street, and although his lecture was important enough to attract a large crowd, the attendance was smaller than expected.</p>
   <p>The lecture was the first of three arranged by the Swedish Historical Society of America. Dr. Joshua Lindahl introduced Professor Montelius.</p>
   <p>Professor Montelius, a lecturer of great ability, spoke on "Iron Ages," a subject in which he is Sweden's foremost authority. He limited his lecture to a discussion of the use of iron from the so-called historical period to the period when its use became universal.</p>
   <p>The Iron Age varies in different countries. In Scandinavia iron was first used about 400 years B. C. instead of bronze.</p>
   <p>It was the latter half of the Iron Age that the lecturer discussed. The beginning of the Iron Age in Sweden goes back a long time in history.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0890.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Although we are little acquainted with prehistorical periods in the north lands, we know iron was used there in various weapons and other articles which have been preserved since that time, that is, for about two thousand years or longer. We have been fortunate enough to discover these objects to bear witness to the early use of iron. They reveal the culture of the people, their religious habits, and the fact that our pagan forefathers lived in a higher plane of culture than is generally thought. It has been established beyond all doubt that travel between Sweden and Europe went on in those times. This fact is recorded in history where it is shown that in Southern Europe there are traces of the Swedes that went there to trade. It was just to such discoveries that Professor Montelius devoted most of his lecture. The things he explained being so important, we wonder why so many people missed the opportunity of listening to him.</p>
   <p>The second lecture was held Saturday evening at the Emmanuel Church on <pb facs="5423404_3_0891.jpg" n="3"/>Sedgwick Street. As expected, the attendance at this lecture was larger than at the previous one. The lecturer explained the use of articles by our northern forefathers during the Bronze Age. Even in 1500 B. C. in the most remote parts of the land there was a culture which came in contact with the European and Greek cultures. It is thus that we account for traces of foreign influence in the North, and influence which reveals itself in our forefathers' methods of manufacture and their records of foreign trade. In those times both iron and silver were unknown, and all weapons were made of bronze or gold. Copper and tin, the raw materials for bronze, were purchased from other countries. This is born by the fact that although copper mines were unknown in Sweden, its inhabitants made many articles of molded bronze. The speaker showed pictures of bronze swords, axes, needles, and other articles, explaining their development, both as to use and ornamentation.</p>
   <p>Men's wearing apparel during these old periods was made of wool and was <pb facs="5423404_3_0892.jpg" n="4"/>held up by a belt or strap over the shoulders. Women's dresses were made of the same material, and their headdresses were similar to the ones of today. One of the most important accomplishments was the way in which our ancestors chipped stones during the Bronze age. Writing was unknown then, and our only clues to this old culture are the objects that were used.</p>
   <p>These articles show that the prehistoric Northerners owned animals and implements to cultivate the land, that they planted oats, wheat, and corn, and that rye was unknown. Toward the end of his lecture the professor spoke of a time 2,500 or 3,000 years ago when the waters of the Adriatic extended over the Alps and to the foot of Denmark.</p>
   <p>On Friday evening the Swedish Historical Society gave a banquet in honor of Professor Montelius. This banquet was original in that the guests did not have to listen to any speeches.</p>
