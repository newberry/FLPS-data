   <p>The widely announced Olympic week in Chicago has been a failure so far. Mayor Harrison opened the races last Saturday when he read a message from President Wilson which a group of Boy Scouts brought from Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Singers, composed of 380 men, appeared on the program Sunday night before a crowd of 9,000, and they presented a well executed program seldom heard here before, Nevertheless, we must state that the affair was a failure from the viewpoint of athletes and the committee on arrangements. The committee in charge did not seem to know their business. The athletes in Sweden, who did not accept director Peterson's tempting invitation to come here and participate in his games, are to be congratulated.</p>
   <p>Several thousands of school children presented plays and dances Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. There will be master races Friday and Saturday.</p>
