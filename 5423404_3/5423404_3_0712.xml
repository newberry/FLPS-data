   <p>The Swedish cultural Association of America has just published a pamphlet entitled The Swedish Spirit and Genuine Americanism, written by the Associations president, Chief Engineer Albin Witting, of this city.</p>
   <p>The pamphlet explains the program and purposes of the Association, and is thus a valuable aid in dispelling existing misunderstandings concerning its activities. It is divided into several chapters with the following headings: "The All-Swedish Convention in 1933," "What is the Swedish Spirit," "The Swedish Spirit--Our Innermost Being," "The Character of the Swedish Spirit," "The Acts and Accomplishments of the Swedish Spirit," "The Culture of the Swedish Spirit," "One Hundred Per Cent Americanism," "A 'Professional' Swede," "False Americanism," "E Pluribus Unum," "Genuine Americanism," "What America Demands of Us," "The Program of the Swedish Cultural Association," "The Swedish Cultural Association and the Swedish-American Societies," "The Swedish Language," "Only One Road to Travel," "The Torchbearers of Humanity," "The <pb facs="5423404_3_0713.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish Cultural Society of America," "Conslusion".</p>
   <p>These captions speak for themselves, indicating the contents of the publication. It is distributed free of charge, and requests, accompanied by postage, should be addressed to the vice-president of the Association, Carl Festin, 610 East 75th Street, Chicago. [Translator's note: The pamphlet is printed in Swedish and the Swedish title is Svenskheten Och Den Akta Amerikanismen. The literal translation of "Svenskheten" would be "Swedishism," which is related to Sweden as "Americanism" is related to America, but I have never seen or heard such a word used, and I can not think of any term which covers the meaning better than "The Swedish spirit".]</p>
