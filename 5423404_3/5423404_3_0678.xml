   <p>p.6..........A newspaper which seeks to keep up with all the winds of opinion, must some times express a correct point of view. This important event occured a few days ago even for the Chicago American newspaper which recently went whole-heartedly "Bryannic"and upheld the demand that the Phillipines be allowed to have home rule immediately, and that aquinaldo be recognized in the capacity designated. But the campaign is long since past, and now since the newspaper think its past position of no expective advantage, so it suddenly changes its attitude towards the whole power and apparently gets more clearity of vision. Lately it has begun to reason with its old camp-mates, the so-called "anti-Imperialist."</p>
   <p>So much for the American! Certainly it gives use to the suspicion that newspapers belonging to the opposing party has taken its support away from young Aquinaldo, just because of his agreement and present friendly relation with the administration. But perhaps it is necessary for it to second the administrations of the Phillipine policy! Maybe this is all for the best!</p>

   <p>Now, since Hearst's Chicago American has reversed its opinion completely we should, together with the rest of the world sit agog and expect its Swedish speaking parrots', Peterson's National Tidnings (National Newspaper) and Turnblad's Svenska Amerikanska Post (Swedish American Post) to take the course of action.</p>
