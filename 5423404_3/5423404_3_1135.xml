   <p>The Grand Lodge annual meeting of the Order of Svithiod was held at the Hotel Sherman May 30, and 31. Ninety-four delegates were present representing forty-four of the forty-six lodges of the order, with a membership of 8,500. Reports were read and approved. There is $74,393.36 in the treasury. The records showed that payments have been made during 1912 in regard to life insurance, sick benefits, and funeral help.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected for 1913: Grand Master: Nels H. Olson, Chicago; Vice-Grand Master: Max Anderson, Spokane, Wash.; secretary: John A. Sandgren, Chicago; treasurer: Knut S. Carlson, Chicago; Chief Doctor: Doctor A. T. Paulson. Members of the executive committee were also elected. The newly elected Grand Master was born in Sweden, and is now a prominent attorney in Chicago. About three hundred persons attended the banquet.</p>

   <p>A sightseeing tour took many of the delegates through Chicago's parks and boulevards. Lunch was served after the trip at Verdandi Hall at Edgewater. The Military Council of Uniform Rank gave a banquet at the Sherman Hotel for the delegates Sunday evening which was attended by seventy-five persons. This gathering brought the convention to a close.</p>
