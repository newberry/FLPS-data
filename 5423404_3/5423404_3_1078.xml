   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Svithiod has published its financial report for the year 1928. The income during the year was $234,707.38, of which sum $60,609.71 represents interest on invested capital. The disbursements amounted to $126,929.26, of which amount $88,200.00 was paid out to beneficiaries under policies of deceased members, and a sum of $21,264.59 to defray diverse expenses in connection with the Order's property in Minnesota. Miscellaneous disbursements totalled $19,464.67. The Grand Lodge's total assets December 31, 1928 were $1,300,493.37, out of which a sum of $1,142,800.00 is invested in mortgages bearing interest at an average rate of 6%.</p>
   <p>Policies in force aggregate $8,635,200.00, and the total membership of the Order is 15,922, divided among 67 lodges.</p>
   <p>The various lodges during 1928 paid out $71,422.80 in sick benefits, $6,445.25 in funeral benefits, and $5,930.40 in donations. The total combined resources of the various lodges and the Grand Lodge amount to $1,728,359.03, which shows an increase of $142,060.25 over 1927.</p>
   <p>The estimated value of the Svithiod's Old People's Home at Birch Bluff, Excelsior, Minneseta, is $120,580.00, subject to an incumbrance of $35,000, which, in view of its existence of only four years, must be considered a very successful result. At present fifteen aged members are being eared for at this home.</p>
