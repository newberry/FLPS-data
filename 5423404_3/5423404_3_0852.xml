   <p>The study course in architecture offered by the Verdandi Study Society opened last Wednesday night in the Idrott restaurant's new building, Belmont and Wilton Avenue. A large audience filled the lecture room, but unfortunately the lecturer, librarian Einar Soderwall, who was to give the introductory talk on "India's Art," was prevented by illness from attending. He has recovered, however, and will talk tonight on the same topic.</p>
   <p>On the opening night, last-minute arrangements were made and entertainment consisting of song, music, and recitations was provided, so that the evening was in no sense wasted by the large audience which had gathered. Similar entertainment will be given following each lecture.</p>
   <p>This lecture course offers a fine opportunity for those who desire really educational and intellectual entertainment.</p>
