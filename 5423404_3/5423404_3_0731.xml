   <p>Song Book, published by the American Union of Swedish Singers of Chicago, is now on the market. It contains a fine selection of our best Swedish, quite a few American, and some Norwegian songs, many of which will be sung at the great singing festival in New York and during the Swedish-American Concert tour to Sweden next year.</p>
   <p>The book comprises some fifty songs carefully selected, and among them are some new ones which have never before been sung publicly in this country. There are Swedish songs by Wennerberg, Lindblad, Bellman, Josephson, Prince Gustaf, Pacius, Korling, Hallstrom, Wideen, Witt, and other well-known Swedish poets. Among the American songs we find "Annie Laurie," "Swanee River," "Star-Spangled Banner," and "America"; and Norway is represented by "Olav Trygvason," and Grieg's "The Great White Choir".</p>
   <p>There are also such internationally known compositions as Gounod's "Soldiers' Chorus," and Wagner's "Pilgrims' Chorus".</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_0732.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Song Book is printed on fine paper, and the cover is artistically decorated. It is on sale at O. F. Nelson's, 66 Sherman Street.</p>
