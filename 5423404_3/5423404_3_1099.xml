  <body>
   <p>The Independent Order of Svithiod has held its annual meeting and from various reports we publish extracts from that of the Financial Secretary.</p>
   <p>Membership increased by 1,446 new members in 1926 and Dec. 31, 1926, there was a total of 16,099 members. The number of lodges is now sixty-six. Total assets of the Grand Lodge on Dec. 31st amounted to $1,029,875.11 which shows a gain of $103,031.14 over 1925. Cash on hand and securities held by the various lodges amounted to $388,794.93, making the grand total owned by the Order $1,418,670.84.</p>
   <p>With particular interest we note that the Order's separate "Old People's Home Fund", during its three short years of existence, has grown to $49,814.20 which was accumulated through voluntary contributions. Plans for the Home have been drawn and construction will begin within the near future.</p>
