   <p>The chief of the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior, Fred Clayton Butler, has issued a notice in the department's Bulletin No. 77, part of which reads as follows: "The foreign language press is a strong and valuable medium for spreading education and enlightenment among its readers. There are millions of persons in this country who cannot read English, but who can read their own language; it is senseless to deprive them of this source of information by not using the foreign language papers. By not using their papers, we also deprive ourselves of the only means by which we can communicate with them through the printed word.</p>
   <p>"A little thinking will make clear the far-reaching implications of a law banning all publications printed in a foreign language. It would prevent the importation of books and all other reading material not printed in English, and many of the world's masterpieces of literature would be made <pb facs="5423404_3_0566.jpg" n="2"/>inaccessible to us. Our scientists and artists would become spiritual hill-billies through being unable to keep track of what is going on among their colleagues in other countries. It is unbelievable that such a thing could happen to America."</p>
   <p>Well spoken, say we. Mr. Butler's words show good judgement and a clearheaded understanding of the question; and we wish all other Americans were able to take the same unprejudiced attitude. Misguided patriotism should not be permitted to destroy, or even to infringe upon the freedom of the press.</p>
