   <p>"West Gota Gille" of Chicago, founded by Dr. J. A. Enander, January 3, 1902, hereby wished to extend an appeal to our countryman in America, to contribute towards the erection of a national monument on the grave of the last Doctor John Alfred Enander at the Swedish Cemetary, Oak Hill, in Chicago.</p>
   <p>For more than five years Dr. Enander's earthly remains have rested in mother earth with only a small insignificant marker on his grave.</p>
   <p>Dr. Enander's work was of such great scope, his work to retain and preserve Swedish traditions among our scattered countrymen in the new world of such importance, that his memory is well worth a national monument on his resting place.</p>
   <p>In order to make this possible, all our countrymen and women, near and far away, who appreciate Dr. Enander's unselfish work for the preservation of Swedish Language, Literature, History and Culture in American, must join hands in this most worthy under <pb facs="5423404_3_1035.jpg" n="2"/>taking. By doing so we show ourselves appreciative of everything noble and elevating, which through Dr. Enander and his contemporaries was done at a time, when open cosmopolitanism held sway and threatened to drown our out own nationalism.</p>
   <p>Great was Dr. Enander as Poet, Speaker, Author, and Editor, he was greater as a true son of Svea.</p>
   <p>His greatest work as Swedish Biographer expresses it, was this, that, "He kept the Swedish Flame ever burning during a critical period, when it might have gone out forever in America."</p>
   <p>He always reminded his countrymen of our inheritance from the old land, which is the noblest and richest of gifts, and should ever be revered.</p>
   <p>His contemporaries in America had left Sweden during a time, when the nationalistic feeling was at the lowest ebb ever known. To have awakened latent and slumbering senses beck to activity within the thousands of Sweden's sons and daughters in America, that is Dr. Enander's grand deed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1036.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Dr. Enander has not of course been alone in this work, many there are she share his honors, but no one will deny him the right to the first place.</p>
   <p>To him and the men, who, during this critical period, stood at his side, we can justly apply these proud words: "They made the Swedish scattered folks into a nation again.</p>
   <p>Is not the memory of such a man and his work worthy of immortalization through a national monument?</p>
   <p>We firmly believe it is, and we are also of the opinion, that our countrymen agree to this unanimously.</p>
   <p>And it is to these that we turn with an appeal for contributions of funds, small or large amounts, according to the heart and pocketbook of each. If we all lend a hand and pull together, we are bound to succeed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_3_1037.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Contributions should be sent the President of "West Gota Gills," Mr. John A. Freedain, 842 Fletcher Street, Chicago, Illinois. All contributions received by him will be made public in the Swedish American Press.</p>
