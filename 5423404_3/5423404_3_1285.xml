   <p>p.11..In company with about twenty members of the widely-branching Svithiod order, this newspaper's reporter took a trip to Galesburg, Illinois, with the praiseworthy aim in mind of writing one thing and another, about the trip and the purpose, for the many readers of Svenska Tribunen. The hands of the station clock pointed to twenty minutes after nine, when we, or more correctly, the train rolled out of the station, straight for the much praised Galesburg. It forward went, like the raging of waters.</p>
   <p>At noon, we reached our destination, and five minutes later were at Brown's Hotel. Dr. A.G.Nyvall, from Moreland, and we, soon became accustomed to the lively little city. We found a coachman's stall on one of the back streets, and, therein, a horse and buggy. An eyelash flash and later, we found ourselves driving around the city, taking in the sights. The outsider often <pb facs="5423404_3_1286.jpg" n="2"/>sees what the native does not observe. So also, with us on our helter-skelter course. Outside of the fine looking, spacious, and busy business houses, which almost without exception, belong to our countrymen, there stood the stateliest coaches hitched to small shaggy horses taken straight from the plow. One saw at one, that the small creatures of nature, felt themselves lost in their richly mounted harness, like a pretty nosed young maid from Smaland, when she, for the first time, puts on a hat, adorned with stuffed birds and wax flowers. One needed only to look upon these equipages to realize that the farmers in the vicinity of Galesburg do not do things peace-meal.</p>
   <p>At eight o'clock in the evening the Svithiod boys from Chicago and Moline, certain members from the lodge, Frey No. 16 of Moline, who had arrived on the afternoon train, went to work of organizing the Independent Order of Svithiod as first lodge in Galesburg, Vasa, Number 17. The lodge was instituted with forty <pb facs="5423404_3_1287.jpg" n="3"/>charter members, and fourteen applications were received for the next meeting. After the lodge work was completed, an unusual supper was served, and about one hundred persons partook. Immediately after the delicate dishes were out of sight, the lodge's grand master asked for the floor, gave thanks from the grand lodge, to all the Galesburg folks, who worked to get a lodge organized in their city. Special distinction for zealous work was given to Mr. Oscar Thorelius, in the form of a gold medal presented by the grand lodge. Mr. Thorelius felt himself a little embarrassed by the distinction, but as a man of the world, and apothecary by profession, he considered himself doubly obliged to answer the fine words of the grand master. He made an attempt, but became lost. His faithful dog, Prince, in the meantime, saved the situation by nicely scolding the whole company. After this little, not at all, unpleasant interruption in the program, our Chicago lawyer, Mr. Sheldon, was introduced, and gave a fine little talk to the assembly. Thereafter, there was singing by an amateur quartette and, a few words by Dr. Carl Nyblad, pastor of the Swedish Episcopal Church, of Galesburg, and <pb facs="5423404_3_1288.jpg" n="4"/>corresponding secretary in the newly organized lodge. Short talks were also given by Mr. Axel Blomfeldt and Dr. A. G. Nyvall of Chicago, George Sandberg and others from Moline and Galesburg. Two poems in which the newly organized lodge was wished every success were then read, the former written by editor Nils Mannow, and the latter by your reporter.</p>
