   <p>During the past days the Chicago Public Library has had its collection of Swedish books greatly increased, and the books that have been added are valuable. The directors of the library have sent us a list of the new books, but the list is so extensive that we simply cannot spare the space for it. Hitherto, Norway and Denmark have greatly outshone Sweden on the shelves of the library; and Sweden has been treated as a stepchild in comparison, chiefly because no advocate of Swedish literature has been a member of the library board. Now there is a Swedish-American on the board in the person of Editor F. A. Lindstrand, and thanks to his interest and energy, the committee on new books decided to buy these books, which have just arrived from Sweden.</p>
