   <p>Carl R. Chindblom, our Chicago born Swede, is highly honored in being appointed Attorney for Illinois Board of Health. This is a very responsible position, and his appointment is an honor indeed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chindblom was born in Chicago on December 21, 1870. He graduated from Augustana College in 1890, after which he taught for some time in the newly built Martin Luther College of Chicago.</p>
   <p>While serving as a teacher, he was also active in politics, which activities made for him many friends and admirers. He is a prominent political speaker, and in 1894, was especially esteemed for his speeches made through Michigan while serving the Republican Central Committee of that State. From 1896 to 1900, he served the Republican National Committee throughout the campaigns. His efficient service to all brought him his new appointment.</p>
