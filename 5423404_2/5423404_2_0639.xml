   <p>Of the nine thousand lives which annually are being sacrificed on the altar of tuberculosis in the state of Illinois alone at least sixty-three hundred could be saved if the patients were given proper medical care, and other precautions were taken in the early stages of the disease.</p>
   <p>Medical examinations of the pupils of our public schools at least once a year, and an educational campaign by means of the daily press and pamphlets, would undoubtedly do much to minimize this scourge, and the money spent on such preventive work would not by any means be wasted; on the contrary, the state would actually save cash as a result of it.</p>
   <p>In order to fight off successfully an attack of this dreaded sickness it is important that it be detected early; and not only does the patient then have a much better chance of recovery, but contagion may more easily be prevented.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0640.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every citizen of the state should demand that the necessary funds for a campaign directed against the ravages of tuberculosis be appropriated immediately.</p>
