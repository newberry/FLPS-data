   <p>Our present government points with pride to all it has done for the American farmer, and it is true that appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the current fiscal year are reaching the awe-inspiring sum of thirteen million dollars. But what is that compared to the colossal amounts which are being spent on our navy? Expenditures this year are estimated at approximately $135,000,000; the building of two dreadnaughts alone will set the country back some $23,000,000. But of course, the United States is a "world power" now and has to live up to its name. Such a ship is expected to be used for active service over a period of twenty years.</p>
   <p>Should it not be possible to spend such immense sums for more productive and peaceful purposes? The cost of one battleship would pay for the construction of a modern highway from New York to Chicago. For that money fifty trade schools <pb facs="5423404_2_0265.jpg" n="2"/>could be built and equipped, in which seventy-five thousand young men could learn the fundamentals of some trade. The proposed White Mountain Reservation, comprising 250,000 acres of land which is not suitable for farming could be bought and reforested. For three quarters of the price of a single man-of-war, 240,000 acres in the Salt River Valley in Arizona could be irrigated, providing homes and a good living for eight thousand families. In addition, such a project would produce taxable property to the value of twenty-four million dollars.</p>
   <p>Such figures as those given above bring home the fact that we spend an awful lot of money on our armed peace, and one must wonder if it should not be possible, at this stage of civilization for the nations of the world to enjoy peace and at the same time spend their money for more productive purposes.</p>
