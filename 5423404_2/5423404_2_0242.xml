   <p>Naturally we are not so childish as to believe that our American newspapers read our editorials and copy them. But the Chicago Daily News and Chicago Tribune have in their last editorials the same opinion regarding taxes and their usage for purposes of war with Germany. They, as well as we, warn -don't "kill the goose that lays the golden egg."</p>
   <p>It has been said that the Secretary of Treasurery, McAdoo, was in favor of high "brackets" of taxation. A small loan of three billions, loaned to our Allies, could not conceivably swell the money market or cause inflation.</p>
   <p>But should we loan too great an amount of money to the Allies, we will find ourselves short of funds for necessary purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0243.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our people have already suffered from the effects of the war through increased prices, although this is, of course, merely reflection of the higher prices, which the Allies are willing to pay for on commodities, since they are very much in need of them.</p>
   <p>A particular and far reaching objection to the Government's proposed tax increases, is the fact that the proposed measure would be retroactive for last year.</p>
