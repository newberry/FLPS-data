   <p>An exhibit of paintings was opened last Saturday in the Idrott, a co-operative temperance restaurant, located at 5248 North Clark Street. Alfred Jansson, the well-known Swedish-American landscape painter, is showing some of his latest canvases. For a long time Jansson specialized in winter scenes. His work was recognized as being of high quality, and was much in demand. But the same thing finally happened to him that happens to most artists who confine themselves to a narrow field, without seeking fresh impressions. He began to repeat himself and gradually all his pictures began to look alike, because,of a lack of diversity in motifs. Fortunately, he realized the danger himself, and in order to escape this threat to his art he went to Sweden, where he remained for more than a year, and apparently was very productive. This change of scene was good for him. When he returned to America and shortly afterwards took part in an art exhibit it was evident that his art had been revitalized, so to speak, and that he was no longer so limited in his choice of motifs.</p>

   <p>His present exhibit shows clearly that he is more versatile than his friends and critics ever thought possible. His style is different. The exhibit comprises eighteen paintings. There are eleven summer landscapes and one still life among the work. The latter is a remarkable piece of art. All of the summer scenes are very fine, with a soft and discreet color tone, most of the winter landscapes are lovely too. In fact, in the entire exhibit there is only one painting that does not appeal to us.</p>
   <p>Jansson's friends are giving a party in his honor, next Friday night, in the Cafe Idrott.</p>
