   <p>The Swedes in Chicago have subscribed to over $2,500,000 for the Third Liberty Loan. For the reason that many Swedes bought Bonds, without having their purchases accredited to any particular group, it is almost impossible to estimate the exact amount they have purchased.</p>
   <p>Nels J. Lindskoog, Grand Secretary of Viking Order, had, up to Saturday, sold obligations for $9,700. Within other lodges and societies the work in connection with these subscriptions is progressing satisfactorily. The lodge "Kronan" of the "Vasa Order" increased its subscription from $100 to $500. The lodge "Siljan," "V. O. A." subscribed for $100. The lodge "Trohet," "S. F. A." subscribed for $100. The lodge "Hyde Park." "S. F. A." subscribed <pb facs="5423404_2_0206.jpg" n="2"/>for $50. The lodge "Lake View," "S. F. A.," held a Liberty Loan Meeting April 19, and bonds for $1200 were sold.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Engineers' Society, of Chicago, purchased bonds for $100. In Swedish Lutheran Ebenezer Congregation last Sunday, bonds for $10,000 were sold at The Bethel Society on the South Side, all subordinated societies subscribed to the Second Liberty Loan, as did The Immanuel Society, when the subordinate societies voted to donate their subscriptions to the parent body. "Dorcas" Society brought bonds for $250. In the Humboldt Park District, The Mission Society has sold bonds for $33,000, which they hope to be able to raise to $35,000.</p>
   <p>The Swedish - American ladies activities in the interest of the Third Liberty Loan have been very effective.</p>
