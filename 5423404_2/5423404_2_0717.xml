   <p>There are many able Swedish engineers in Chicago who have won recognition and who are holding positions of great responsibility in various industries. Today we are presenting one of them, C. G. Axell, who is head of the drafting department of the great Commonwealth Edison Company.</p>
   <p>Carl Georg Axell was born May 14, 1879 in Uppsala, Sweden, and graduated from college in that city in 1899. He continued his studies at the Technical Institute of Stockholm, and graduated from its electrotechnic department in 1902, after having taken a special course in the theory and practice of alternating electric currents.</p>
   <p>Later, he went to America, and in June, 1903 he took a position with the Commonwealth Edison Company here in Chicago. He started as a draftsman in the engineering <pb facs="5423404_2_0718.jpg" n="2"/>department, was later transferred to the department of power stations and substations, and still later was placed in charge of the planning of new plants, including cost estimates.</p>
   <p>During the years 1904-1906, he was occupied with the expansion program at the Fisk Street power plant, particularly with the installation of four new steamturbine generators, and electrical equipment in general.</p>
   <p>Early in 1907 Axell was selected to head a group of engineers preparing plans and cost estimates for the electrification of the Quarry Street power station, and the installation of six fourteen-thousand-kilowatt steam-turbine generators.</p>
   <p>Since he became chief of the drafting department in 1909, he has been responsible for the planning of all power stations and substations which deliver current for power and light in the city and which also supply current for the operation of railroads and street railways.</p>
   <p>Since 1913, it has been his job to inspect all construction and new installations taking place in the Company's central plants. When one considers that the total <pb facs="5423404_2_0719.jpg" n="3"/>capacity of these plants is 604,100 kilowatts, which is equivalent to a horsepower of 800,000, one can readily see that he has his hands full.</p>
   <p>Axell belongs to the Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago, and was its vice-president in 1911. In 1913-1914, he was its secretary. He was secretary and treasurer of the Swedish engineers' convention, which was held in Chicago last fall, and much of the credit for the success of this event belongs to him.</p>
   <p>He also belongs to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the National Electric Light Association, Svithiod Singing Club, and the Swedish Club.</p>
   <p>In 1906 he married Theres Smedberg. They have one son.</p>
