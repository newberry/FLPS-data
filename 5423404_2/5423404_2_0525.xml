   <p>A farmer of Bloom township, Illinois, owner of a 113-acre farm, wishes to make a deal with some charitable institution that will pay a small amount of cash for the farm and six dollars per acre annually as long as the present owner or his wife is alive. They are now seventy-seven and sixty-six years old respectively. The tax paid on the property is now $804 annually, and the aged couple cannot live on what is left of the income which the land yields. But a charitable institution does not pay taxes and should therefore be able to make a profit on the proposed transaction.</p>
   <p>A few years ago this farm was worth a neat little fortune, measured by the standards of common people, and even at that it never provided more than a comfortable living for its owner. But it represented other values besides. It was a home and a guarantee of a secure old age. However, <pb facs="5423404_2_0526.jpg" n="2"/>due to the heavy taxes and other difficulties caused by the present depression, it has now become a burden, still a dear burden, though, and we may be sure that the old farmer lay awake many nights before announcing his proposal.</p>
   <p>Investigation by Washington officials into stock market speculations in Wall Street has brought to light astonishing revelations. To mention a few of the highlights of the disclosures, it was learned that Nicholas F. Brady, W. F. Kenny, and John J. Raskob cleaned up $291,770 each in two weeks of speculation in radio stock, and such representative men as Walter P. Chrysler, Charles J. Schwab, and Percy A. Rockefeller netted $145,855, $58,342, and $29,171 respectively on a similar bard job. But in a recent address before the Iron and Steel Institute, Schwab complained about the high taxes and said, among other things, "We have done our bit and are sitting high and dry. It is up to the Government to balance the budget. When this is done general confidence will return and exert its stimulating effect on the banks, so that the flow of credit will get started again."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0527.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The common people have been paying and are still paying for the swindle profits of high finance. When, for instance, Harry M. Warner managed to boost the price of the stock of his firm so high that he made a market profit of between seven and eight million dollars it was not the amateur speculators alone who contributed to his profit but the common people throughout the land also paid their share, and it was this kind of goings-on that destroyed the much talked about confidence, which is now missing. Schwab may be sitting pretty, according to his own admission, but men of his type are not justified in complaining about high taxes. Profits on entirely unproductive speculation, such as that cited above, really ought to be confiscated, and the procedure could hardly be termed unfair. But when farmers lose everything that they have worked hard for all of their lives, it actually amounts to confiscation of the most unjust and heartless kind. For they have not helped bring about the present economic situation by speculation.</p>
