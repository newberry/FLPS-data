  <body>
   <p>In Swedish circles, the announcement of the candidacy of G. Bernhard Anderson for election as a Municipal Judge will be received with pleasure.</p>
   <p>As the new State law makes it possible to oust undesirable judges, and to replace them with judges now sitting in peace and police courts, we will certainly heartily back our dependable candidates.</p>
   <p>G. Bernhard Anderson was born in Sweden in 1867, and was brought to Chicago a year later. He finished the elementary and high schools in Chicago, after which he graduated from Augustana College, in Rock Island. He taught school for two years in Salt Lake City, Utah, then attended Harvard University, graduating in 1891. The following year he received the degree of Master of Arts.</p>
   <p>During 1893, he studied at the Upsala University in Upsala, Sweden. Upon <pb facs="5423404_2_0995.jpg" n="2"/>his return to Chicago, he studied law at the Kent College of Law, graduating in 1896, and practiced law from then on. In addition to his wide-spread legal practice, he also taught in the Chicago Law School. No other Swedish-American has so often been called upon to appear as a lecturer or a speaker of the evening at festivals, large and small.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson, with his well-founded legal experience, his wonderful personality, and his good-heartedness, is just the man to serve as a Municipal Judge.</p>
