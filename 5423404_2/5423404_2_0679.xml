   <p>The Swedish druggist Oscar L. Kallberg, has just opened a new drugstore at 4624 Lawrence Avenue and is thus entering again the field of activity which was his for a long period of time, during which he acquired a large circle of friends and acquaintances. About three years ago he became seriously ill of a heart ailment and was forced to endure a long period of inactivity, but since he is now going into business again, it must be assumed that he has regained his health.</p>
   <p>Kallberg has a great many friends here, as was amply demonstrated when he recently observed his fifty-second birthday, and homage was paid to him by many groups, especially by his brothers of the singing fraternity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0680.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Kallberg graduated from college in Sweden in 1892 and became an apprentice in a Stockholm drug store in the following year. In 1903 his studies were completed, and he received his degree as Doctor of Pharmacy at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. For about fifteen years he served various Swedish drug companies as a pharmaceutical chemist, whereafter he emigrated to the United States.</p>
   <p>His first position here was that of manager of the prescription department of Brewer and Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he remained about a year and a half. He then moved to Chicago, where he went to work for the Swedish drug firm of Wessman &amp; Strom, with which he remained five years.</p>
   <p>After managing several drug stores in this city Kallberg bought one of his own about fourteen years ago. It was located at 3633 Fullerton Avenue, and he operated it for eleven years and a half, until three years ago he was forced to retire on account of illness.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0681.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>His new drug store is located at 4624 Lawrence Avenue and was opened to the public on June 6.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kallberg's many friends rejoice that he not only has regained his health but has also gone into business again, and all who know him hope that he will remain active for many years to come.</p>
