   <p>At the recent American Legion convention, a committee representing the World War veterans of all the Allied countries submitted a proposal advocating the establishment of a world court for the purpose of abolishing war. The Legion endorsed the proposal unanimously. This vote marks one of the most significant and humane decisions ever made by the Legion. None are better qualified to express an opinion on war than those who have fought, suffered, and taken personal losses, while those who were privileged to stay at home took the profit. The soldiers' opinions about war really carry weight, for they have observed it at first hand.</p>
   <p>War is primarily caused by the greed of powerful individuals of both sides; the great masses are either unable to prevent it or lack the united will to do so. At the close of a war, those who actually fought it begin to understand who, if any, benefited by it, and who will eventually have to pay for it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0160.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When the spirit that prompted the American Legion to vote for the substitution of a court of justice for war becomes general, and the people act accordingly, then, and not before, will war be abolished.</p>
