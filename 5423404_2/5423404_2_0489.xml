   <p>Agnes L. Peterson, assistant director of the women's division of the Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., has just issued a bulletin which contains much information, including statistical data, on the status of working women in the United States. Its contents are based on careful and extensive research and are of considerable news interest, but what makes it especially interesting is Miss Peterson's supplementary remarks and explanations.</p>
   <p>Certain phases of women's long and hard struggle for equality with men may now be said to have been won, but Miss Peterson shows that the result leaves much to be desired, and is nothing to brag about.</p>
   <p>It is true that women have obtained equality with men in many respects, but in exchange for the economic security and sheltered existence afforded them by the home, heavy burdens have now been placed upon them. In addition to <pb facs="5423404_2_0490.jpg" n="2"/>taking care of the home, many of them now find it necessary to help provide for the family by outside work. And to top it all off, as a natural consequence of women's emancipation, the old-fashioned knightly and courteous attitude of men toward "the weaker sex" is gradually dwindling.</p>
   <p>The great majority of employed women are so dependent on their jobs, need them so badly in order to support themselves and members of their families, that they dare not bargain for higher pay and improved working conditions, and, as a rule, they are not qualified to compete for the better paid positions. According to data gathered by Miss Peterson among some sixty thousand women workers, more than half of that number spent their entire income for the support of their families. Another investigation covering about thirty thousand families, revealed that one fifth of the employed women were the sole breadwinners of their families. In another group, comprising some seventeen thousand unmarried women it was found that one out of five of them provided for a family without the aid of any male relative.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0491.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>What women have lost in their struggle for equality with men they must seek compensation for in the form of equal pay for equal work. Women workers always have been, and still are, discriminated against on account of their sex. For the same jobs which pay them twelve to fifteen dollars per week men are getting thirty to forty dollars, and this double wage standard, together with the disappearance of men's age-old protective attitude toward women, has lead to a deplorable exploitation of the latter, the consequences of which are of the gravest concern to the entire nation. The physical and mental health of these women is being undermined and the future of the race is endangered.</p>
