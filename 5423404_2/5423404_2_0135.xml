   <p>p.6...Not long ago a laundry was blown into the air. A number of the personnel were killed. Naturally, an investigation began in order to determine who should really be blamed for the accident. The upshot was that guilt could not be established.</p>
   <p>But the whole affair still has something interesting about it. Before the coroner's jury, the machinist, Pegel, said: "The law demands that a person must pass an examination and obtain a certificate of permission in order to operate a steam-machine." This should be some guarantee of the machinist's competence. But what is to be done when competent machinists are placed to run poor machines and defective boilers? The boiler in the laundry was, it must be said, such that it could literally go to pieces even if tended by the most able worker. Hence to bother with examining the machinist who operated it, was a farce. However, it must be stated that there is some <pb facs="5423404_2_0136.jpg" n="2"/>satisfaction in being blown to pieces knowing that the machine attendant at least is qualified to do his work.</p>
   <p>Out of the community treasury a certain number of thousands of dollars is allowed annually to a gentleman ( a Mr. Schlacks), who is supposed to inspect the boilers. When this person is selected by our remarkable Mayor from at least several hundred workers, then it is not difficult to understand how Doremus could run his laundry with worthless machinery. One begins to understand that a Boiler Inspector is also one of the many Inspectors for the Harrison-machine: in other words, one who was occupied otherwise at the time the Doremus steam-boiler catastrophe. So machinist Pegel's complaint is too harsh, if not wholly uncalled for!</p>
   <p>A boiler explosion can be unmotivated, and so if one only could secure fatalists as machinists and Factory workers one could be enabled to forget about certificates of competence and charge future catastrophes of this kind directly to fate and not to her favorite, Harrison.</p>
