   <p>Everybody knows the three singing ladies who make up the Northland Trio, which for several years has gladdened Swedish hearts back here in America and in the Old Country. They are Rose Pearson-Burgeson, Mary Peterson, and Signe Mortenson. But what most people do not know is that Mary Peterson is also making a name for herself as a painter. Painting has been her hobby for several years. When the trio had completed its tour of Sweden in 1926, she remained in Stockholm and studied painting under Edward Berggren, at the Stockholm Art Academy. Upon her return to Chicago, she continued her studies at the Art Institute here under Mr. and Mrs. Oberteuffer.</p>
   <p>The first exhibit in which she ever took part was one arranged by Swedish artists, and she won a prize. Since then her paintings have been accepted at exhibits sponsored by the Illinois Academy of Fine Arts and by the Swedish-American Art <pb facs="5423404_2_1355.jpg" n="2"/>Association. A short time ago she was notified that one of her canvases has been accepted by the selecting committee of the forty-fourth annual exhibit of American painters and sculptors in the Chicago Art Institute. It is worth noting that twelve hundred paintings were submitted to this committee, while only fifty-seven were accepted. Many of the paintings which will be seen at this exhibit have been loaned by prominent artists.</p>
   <p>After such success it is not surprising that Miss Peterson has hit upon the idea of arranging a separate exhibit. It will be held in the near future in the art gallery of the Illinois Women's Athletic Club, Ill East Pearson Street. The exact dates are November 10 to November 19 inclusive. At this show the art-conscious public will have an opportunity to see how the popular singer, in the course of a few years, has developed into a notable painter.</p>
