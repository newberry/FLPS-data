   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>Permit me to compliment you on your article of last week entitled "Practical Results," to point out once more that both the new John Ericsson League of Patriotic Service and the Swedish Branch of the Third Liberty Loan Campaign committee have been organized for the sole purpose of demonstrating our countrymen's patriotism in the most effective manner; for, as you so rightly say, our patriotism should never be questioned.</p>
   <p>How can we Swedes best work for the new Liberty Loan? The answer is, by making up our minds right now to support it with our money, our influence, our example, and by our spoken and written words. Other national groups in Chicago are already hard at work demonstrating their interest in this great cause, and we Swedish-Americans should not and cannot allow ourselves to do less than they.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0215.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>An appeal is being made to the many who are still able to subscribe small amounts, and particularly to those who, for many years and for reasons of their own, have kept their savings in safe-deposit vaults, in their homes, or in other places. Perhaps the entire Loan of three billion dollars could be raised, if this hidden wealth could be coaxed out of hiding and converted into Liberty Loan bonds....</p>
   <p>Countrymen! Support the new Liberty Loan, particularly with any idle money you now have in hiding.</p>
