  <body>
   <p>The well-known Swedish American artist, Signe Palmblad, opened a separate exhibit of her paintings last week in the quarters of Cafe Idrott, 5248 North Clark Street. It contains almost one hundred numbers, sixty-five of which are oil paintings. We are not going to give a detailed review of this exhibit outside of saying that it contains many fine numbers, and we suggest that our readers go and see for themselves. It is worth noting that the Chicago Tribune's art critic has visited the show and in last Sunday's issue of the paper he wrote some interesting things about Mrs. Palmblad's work. He especially admired her reproductions of national costumes from various provinces of Sweden.</p>
   <p>The management of Cafe Idrott deserves credit for its landable interest in Swedish art and handicraft. Mrs. Palmblad is the third Swedish painter to exhibit there this year, and a short time ago the Cafe also housed a most <pb facs="5423404_2_1347.jpg" n="2"/>interesting exhibit of Swedish handicraft. The current show will remain open for three more weeks. The coming Christmas holidays afford a good opportunity to go to see it.</p>
