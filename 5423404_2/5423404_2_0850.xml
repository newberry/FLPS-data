   <p>Chicago, the fourth largest city in the world, has within its confines many prominent Swedish-American industrialists, and we have selected one of them as the subject of this week's Foreground article. He is Albert Ivar Appleton, head of the Appleton Electric Company.</p>
   <p>He has just returned to Chicago from a visit to Sweden. This city has been his home for most of the years since he came to America in 1885. His childhood home was in Onsala parish in Halland, Sweden, a district which is rich in historical relics and memories. He was born there March 20,1872, and was thirteen years old when he came to America with his parents. As <pb facs="5423404_2_0851.jpg" n="2"/>soon as he was old enough to do so, he had to support himself, and he went to work in a machine shop. Within a few years, he had advanced to the position of department chief with the Independent Electirc Company here. He remained on that job for a number of years, until he was made assistant superintendent of the Springfield Drop Forge Company, Springfield, Massachusetts, where he remained for about one year. Returning to Chicago, he became part owner and president of the Harvard Electric Company. Two years later, he sold his interest in the firm, and organized the Appleton Electric Company, of which he became president and treasurer. He is still the head of the company, which has prospered under his leadership. About three years ago, it built a modern plant at Wellington Avenue and Paulina Street, and is now among the leaders in its field. In the early part of 1922, the company expanded its activities by purchasing the plant and equipment of the Anderson Electric and Equipment Company. The price was $160,000.</p>
   <p>Appleton belongs to several Swedish organizations, among them the Swedish <pb facs="5423404_2_0852.jpg" n="3"/>Club.</p>
   <p>In 1910 he married Lillian C. Wihk. They have two children.</p>
