   <p>As reported on another page of this issue, our countryman, J. A. Torstenson, president of the firm of J. A. Torstenson and Company, has been made a member of the Lincoln Park Board by Governor Len Small. He succeeds Andrew Lanquist, who resigned some time ago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Torstenson was born in Nor Parish, Varmland, Sweden, and was only a young fellow when he came to Chicago in 1882. He did not stay here long that time. Like so many other young Swedes, he followed Greeley's advice and went west. But for for some reason or other Torstenson did not like it so well in the West, and with in a year he was back in Chicago, where he has made his home ever since.</p>
   <p>As we have already mentioned, he is the president of the firm of J. A. Torstenson and Company, which was established by him in 1890, only eight years after his <pb facs="5423404_2_0892.jpg" n="2"/>arrival in America. For a number of years the firm engaged exclusively in the wholesale paint and dye business. About ten years ago, when his two sons Elmer and Henry were old enough to enter the firm, Torstenson not only expanded the old business but also began to deal in pane and plate glass.</p>
   <p>For many years the company had its offices downtown, but at the outbreak of the war, when both of the boys joined the Navy, the offices were moved to the warehouse at 860 Fletcher Street; all departments are now under one roof.</p>
   <p>For years Mr. Torstenson has taken a sincere interest in all problems involving the welfare of our city, but he has refrained from seeking any public office, and the appointment to the Lincoln Park Board came as a surprise to him. However, there need be no doubt that he will discharge his duties in an honorable manner.</p>
   <p>Mr. Torstenson is a highly-valued member of the Elim Swedish Methodist Church, and is also on the board of directors of the Bethania Home for the Aged in <pb facs="5423404_2_0893.jpg" n="3"/>Ravenswood, which is operated by the Swedish Methodists.</p>
   <p>Thirty-two years ago he married Augusta Josefina Akerstrom, who was born in Stockholm. They have three children, the two boys already mentioned, and a daughter. About four years ago, the family moved into its own modern and comfortable home at 706 Junior Terrace.</p>
