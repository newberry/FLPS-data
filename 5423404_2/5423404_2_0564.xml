  <body>
   <p>Many of those who try to explain the current unreasonably low prices of agricultural products point out, as the chief reason, the fact that there is little or no demand in foreign countries. However, this explanation does not conform with official reports, which show a steady increase in grain exports. If prices depend on supply and demand, these exports should cause them to rise rather than to fall lower and lower.</p>
   <p>According to tables released by the Department of Agriculture, the annual domestic consumption of grain amounts to six hundred million bushels. When this is subtracted from the estimated crop, there remains a surplus of 118 million bushels which is available for export. During July, August, and September of last year, 127 million bushels were exported, and consequently a shortage should have developed even last fall, making it necessary to <pb facs="5423404_2_0565.jpg" n="2"/>resort to imports. This seems to have been the case. It is now being said that our supply of wheat is insufficient, and that, as a result, bread prices will go up. But in spite of this, the farmer gets only half as much for his products this year as he did two years ago.</p>
   <p>Here is a situation which requires thorough investigation and immediate correction.</p>
