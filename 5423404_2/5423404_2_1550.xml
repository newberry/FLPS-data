   <p>The Swedish-American ballet dancer, Harriet Lundgren, made her debut as prima ballerina last November 9, in "Il Trovatore," which was presented at the Chicago Opera House. Her dance numbers were received with thunderous applause, her dressing room was filled with flowers and out-of-town friends, and admirers sent congratulatory messages.</p>
   <p>Our young countrywoman wishes, through our columns, to convey her hearty thanks to Mrs. Othelia Myhrman and to the American Daughters of Sweden for the manner in which this organization feted her on that occasion.</p>
   <p>The head of the opera company, Herbert Johnson, has asked her to give dance lessons in the opera's new ballet school, but she hesitates to <pb facs="5423404_2_1551.jpg" n="2"/>accept the tempting offer, because she feels that she needs the time to practice her own dance numbers before each performance.</p>
