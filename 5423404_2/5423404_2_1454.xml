   <p>p.10... The fifth Swedish Art Exhibit at the Swedish Club and a large number of interested visitors during the week. The exhibit wound up Sunday evening with an overflow crowd of spectators, at which time also the prizes were given out.</p>

   <p>Professor J.E.Hillberg, who also gave out the prizes concluded with a speech.</p>
   <p>Many of the paintings on exhibition had not been included in the catalog, and thus were unintentionally overlooked in our last issue. In this connection we will mention a beautiful winter landscape scene by the painter, Martin Lundgren.</p>
   <p>Several paintings were sold during the exhibit; works by Ben Hollberg, Gelhaar, Hoffsten, Ada Enander, Nyholm, Graftstrom and Einar Sodervall.</p>
   <p>In connection with this exhibit must be mentioned the Chicago Artists banquet at Hotel La Salle Thursday evening, which was exceptionally well attended. Mr. Henry S. Henschen as Master of Ceremonies extended a hearty welcome to all and particularly to the sculptor David Engstrom, whereupon he introduced the many speakers. Charles S. Peterson spoke about and for the Swedish - American <pb facs="5423404_2_1456.jpg" n="3"/>Art Exhibit; the president of Chicago Art Museum, spoke on the development of art in Chicago; other speakers were Herman F.
