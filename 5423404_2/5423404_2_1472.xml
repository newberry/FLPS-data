   <p>The Swedish-American Art Exhibition, arranged by the Swedish Club here, began March 12, and concluded last Sunday. The public has been very well satisfied with the exhibition. Thirteen pictures have been sold. Prizes for the best paintings were distributed out last Saturday. At this time, Attorney C. R. Chindblom made an address. He said that the Swedish-Americans should be proud of the exhibition. First prize of $100 was awarded to John Carlson of New York City, for his picture, "Desolation." Second prize, $50 went to Arvid Nyholm of Chicago, for his "Novellette," and third prize went to Prof. Birger Sandzen, of Lindsborf, Kansas, for his "Early Moonrise." Two prizes were awarded for excellence in sculptor. The first, $50 went to Charles Haag of Winnetka, for his statue "Effort," and a second prize went to Carl Nilson for his bust of "Enander."</p>
