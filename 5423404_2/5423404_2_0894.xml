   <p>The term "a self-made man" is often meaningless and pretty well worn out by now, but it still hits the nail on the head when applied to certain exceptional individuals, such as the man we have selected as the subject of this week's Foreground article. He is Bror Erik Johnson, general manager of Gately's two great clothing stores in Chicago. </p>
   <p>When everything is said and done, it must be granted that Mr. Johnson has chiefly himself to thank for the position in which he finds himself today. And the qualities which have brought him there are the usual ones in such cases, namely, ambition, energy and honesty.</p>
   <p>He hails from Smaland, Sweden, and possesses to a high degree the toughness <pb facs="5423404_2_0895.jpg" n="2"/>and capacity for hard work which characterize the people from that part of the old country. He was born in Kalmar, August 1, 1886, and had to begin earning his daily bread early in life. Among the jobs he had was that of glassblower, and he stuck to that for about two years. At the age of 17, he set his course for the "far west," where some of his brothers and sisters had already arrived ahead of him. About a year later his parents also came to America to be with their children. The family settled near North Branch, Minnesota, which is a typical Swedish-American district. His parents are still living there, and his brothers and sisters have their homes in various parts of the state, and have done well for themselves.</p>
   <p>Johnson had tough going during the first few years in the new country; but being a Smalander he could not be downed. In 1904 and 1905 he went through the complete business course at the Gustavus Adolphus College, and shortly after graduation he obtained employment with the Gately firm, which has a branch in Duluth. Discharging his duties conscientiously at all times, he <pb facs="5423404_2_0896.jpg" n="3"/>soon won the confidence of his employer, and step by step rose to more responsible and better paid positions in the firm. He can now look back on fourteen busy years, during which he advanced from the position of collector to that of general manager. After having worked in Duluth for about ten years he was called to Chicago four years ago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson belongs to the Illinois Athletic Club. In 1918 he married Miss Hedda Anderson of Chicago, and they live at 6121 Woodlawn Avenue.</p>
