   <p>The Grand National Concert at the Auditorium last Sunday night, gave the public a real value. The large place was almost filled in spite of the bad weather.</p>
   <p>Madame Clausen, who was supposed to be the most prominent attraction on the program, could not make her appearance. She was replaced with the soprano Rosa Raisa and the baritone Arman Crabbe, both prominent artists.</p>
   <p>The concert was opened with an organ solo, Soderman's "Maid of Orleans," by Emil Larson, former professor at the Augustana College. Professor Larson enjoys the reputation of being a master at the organ and the piano, and on this occasion he played his selections with his usual skill on the Auditorium's organ, one of the best in this country, much to the people's delight. The audience rewarded him with warm applause.</p>

   <p>Then came the National Chorus with "Sweden," by Sten Hammar, and "Nature and The Heart," by Otto Lindblad. This chorus is the most prominent one among the Swedish choruses in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Armand Crabbe has a powerful high baritone voice. He sang three songs and was forced to several encores by the public's enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Miss Nicoline Zedeler, violinist, reaped great applause in her "Midsummer Dance," by Tor Aulin, and played several extra numbers. The National Chorus sang "In The Storm," by Durner, and "The Peasant Girl," with William Dahlen as the soloist, who also sang "Du Gamla, Du Fria," The Swedish anthem. Mr. Larson played on the organ several Swedish folk songs arranged by himself. Mr. Mossberg sang "Baldersbalet," with words from Frihiof's Saga.</p>

   <p>Then came the Russian opera singer Rosa Raisa, who got the public spellbound with her high and clear soprano voice. She received a beautiful bouquet of red roses, bound together with a ribbon in the Swedish national colors. The program concluded with "Northland," by Sten Hammar, and "Den Store Hvide Flok," by Grieg. The concert was very successful and the best one so far given in Chicago at this season.</p>
