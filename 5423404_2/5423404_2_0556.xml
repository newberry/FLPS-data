   <p>Conditions among farmers of the western states give cause for serious apprehensions. There are, to be sure, quite a few prosperous farmers, but a goodly number of them complain they are not getting as much for their products as it costs to produce them.</p>
   <p>President Howard, of the American Farm Bureau Association, is of the opinion that the American farmer is in danger of becoming a sort of slave. He goes so far as to compare American agriculture to that in Russia. His fears may be somewhat exaggerated, but the fact remains that the average annual income of our farmers is calculated to be $189, and on that income he is supposed to educate his children, provide his family with life's necessities and such extras as medical attention, etc.--in short, live and conduct himself as a civilized human being of the twentieth century. It simply cannot be done.</p>
   <p>Inprovement can be brought about through better organization and better methods <pb facs="5423404_2_0557.jpg" n="2"/>of distribution. High freight rates and middlemen's profits are the main causes of the low prices paid to farmers, and they are also the chief reasons why farm products are priced so high when they reach the consumer in the city.</p>
