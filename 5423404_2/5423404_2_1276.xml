   <p>The quadrennial reunion of the American Union of Swedish Singers closed yesterday with a festival in honor of Sweden's famed poet, Carl Mitchell Bellman, at Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>The program was entirely musical. The great chorus of six-hundred voices, under the direction of Gust Carlson, rendered selections from the works of Bellman and also sang "Hur Skomt", by Reissiger,and "Bart Land", the great Swedish anthem, by Josephson.</p>
   <p>"We consider this the greatest and most successful singing festival that was ever held by any nationality", said President O. F. Kelson. "The cultivation of music among the Swedish people in this country is upheld largely by the American Union of Swedish Singers, which is composed of fifty-four different societies in all sections of the country and in the principle cities. The children of the Swedish people in this country are taught the folk songs of the fatherland, which date <pb facs="5423404_2_1277.jpg" n="2"/>back in their origin for centuries, and the object of this association is to so perpetuate these songs that they may be heard in the homes of people of Swedish parentage long after their ancestors who came here from Sweden have passed away".</p>
   <p>This general reunion of the Swedish song societies of the United States is held every four years and is always eagerly anticipated and very largely attended by the Swedish-Americans.</p>
   <p>Mme. Anna Hellstrom, the noted Swedish singer and member of the Royal Opera of Stockholm, Sweden, was a guest at the festival, and will now make a concert tour, stopping at Rockford and Moline, Illinois; Redwing, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota, and then east through Pittsburg, Worcester and New York City.</p>
   <p>She will then return to Chicago, and, on August 26, will take part in the production of the Swedish opera "Wermlanningarne", by Dahlgren, at the Auditorium.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1278.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mme. Hellstrom will take the part of Anna, the principal feminine role, and John R. Ortengren, formerly a member of the Royal Opera, Stockholm, will take the part of Eric, the principal male role.</p>
   <p>When asked through an interpreter concerning her impressions of America, Mme. Hellstrom said: "I have only one thing to say to everything you ask me, and that is that I am delighted with my reception here. I have received nothing but courtesy both from the Americans and the American-Swedish people. In regard to the chorus, I will say that I have never listened to a chorus composed of so large a number of people which sang better. I am charmed with America".</p>
   <p>This is Mme. Hellstrom's second visit to this country, the first being two years ago, when she was engaged by the western division of the Society of Swedish Singers of the United States as soloist during their celebration in Minneapolis.</p>
   <p>Mme. Hellstrom will return to Stockholm, immediately after her appearance at the Auditorium.</p>
