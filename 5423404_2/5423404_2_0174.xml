   <p>The worst hysteria is now past, even among those who, during the War, appeared to have lost all consideration. In the latter time, we have heard nothing of the beautiful Rooseveltian thought prohibiting the printing of all literature in any language but English. Even the proposed law prohibiting wholesale immigration appears to be laid on the shelf, to be taken up possibly by the next Congress, after having a little more experience in regard to employment conditions after the War. We hold fast to our view for the present that immigration laws are strict enough, and that they offer plenty of protection against such foreign elements as are <pb facs="5423404_2_0175.jpg" n="2"/>considered detrimental to the peaceful development of our Republic. Certainly, one hears much talk of the Bolshevist movement in the United States, and the press does its share to frighten the people. One can only wonder if there is not another and greater danger to guard against. Lloyd George's well-known utterance: "I fear less the revolution, than the reaction," does not lose its applicability in our own circumstances. Fortunately, the worst is past, even in that respect. The reign of fear and the public spy system ended with the War. How uncalled for was the former, and how unnecessary was the latter. What havoc they both worked, we can now realize.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0176.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Light on this matter comes to us from an entirely unexpected source. We read in the March issue of Everybody's Magazine an article entitled: "Our Aliens, were They Loyal or Disloyal?" by George Creel, director of the well-known Bureau for Public Information, which came into existence when war was declared. From the description of Mr. Creel's person and his work, which was spread by the American press, one received the impression that this man is conceited and narrow-minded, and that his information bureau should have been called "the Bureau for the Suppression of Information."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0177.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>One receives a wholly different impression by reading his article in Everybody's. In it he professes non-partisanship and liberal mindedness. This is entirely contrary to the view presented to us in the past.</p>
   <p>We would like to reproduce the entire article, but everyone may satisfy himself on this point by thoroughly acquainting himself with this article by purchasing the magazine for the sum of twenty cents. One receives a wholly different view after reading this article in regard to the "disloyalty," which, it maintained, <pb facs="5423404_2_0178.jpg" n="5"/>prevailed among the foreign population in the United States, and against whose dreaded machinations, the machinery of Government was put into motion. A security watch, called the "American Protective League" with a total membership of 250,000 was organized.</p>
   <p>"If one speaks in percentages," says Creel, "then the real disloyalty was not great enough to even put one spot on the shining patriotism of the millions of Americans, whom we are wont to call "adopted." Nothing in the whole world ever became so completely confuted by later developments, as all these habitual misrepresentations, which, at the outbreak of the War, filled us with forebodings. Who does <pb facs="5423404_2_0179.jpg" n="6"/>not recall the fear of "wholesale disloyalty," which shook us daily? There were to be revolutions in Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati; armed uprisings here and there; small armies would be needed to conduct thousands of rebellious foreign enemies to the internment camps. One predicted incendiarism, sabotage, bombings, murder, and uprisings. Hardly any imagination was necessary in order to describe how America's adopted children turned with hatred against the foster mother.....Never has any land been so completely organized against spies. Not even a pin could be dropped in the home of anyone bearing a foreign name without it reverberating like thunder in the ears of some listening detective. And what was the result?</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0180.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Registration, according to the strictest rules as had been laid down by the government authorities, showed that there were five hundred thousand German alien enemies in the United States, and between three and four million Austro-Hungarians. These figures naturally did not include the millions of naturalized citizens, or the children of these millions. Of this figure, they found reason to permit the internment of only six thousand, and a large number of these were later given their freedom after it was found that there was no reason to hold them under direct surveillance.</p>
   <p>If we look at the report on investigated crimes, we find that 1,532 persons were arrested for spying; sixty-five for threats against the <pb facs="5423404_2_0181.jpg" n="8"/>President, and ten for sabotage and for conspiracy under the criminal law. 908 persons were prosecuted, which number includes all I. W. W. cases. Even this does not mean they were proven guilty, for many indictments have been declared unfounded, and in some instances, no trial has yet taken place.</p>
   <p>"Taking into account all cases of intrigue and treason, and the cases of disloyalty which in some cases, succeeded in filtering through the fine mesh of the net of investigation, we find that none of the other warring countries could show a similar good record of cooperation <pb facs="5423404_2_0182.jpg" n="9"/>and loyalty!" The most interesting part of the article was a description of the persecution of foreigners by the so-called 100% Americans, whose activities President Wilson finally deemed necessary to curb by personal interference.</p>
   <p>We will return to this subject in the next number of the Swedish Courier.</p>
