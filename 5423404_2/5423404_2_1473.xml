   <p>Charles Hallberg, well-known Swedish-American painter, whose marine canvases have made him famous here in the United States, is now also winning acclaim in his old country and receiving generous praise from Swedish art critics. We quote from the Gothenburg Business and Maritime Journal:</p>
   <p>"The current exhibit of the Swedish-American marine painter Charles Hallberg at Olsen's Gallery furnishes fresh proof of the artist's remarkable progress since his last visit here eight years ago. As we remarked at that time, this artist is in a class by himself, and does not travel along the crowded highroad of art. Without leaning on the teachings and experiences of others, he has developed an approach and technique all his own. The driving power behind his work is his inherent love for the sea in all its various moods, coupled with his sensitive, artistic personality, which has gradually become more and more polished. As he perfected his technique, he was able to follow his creative instinct wherever it led him, and it led him toward the sentimental. We dare say that it is this tendency in his art which has endeared him to the American public, for the American, with all his hardheaded business sense, admires <pb facs="5423404_2_1474.jpg" n="2"/>the sentimental in art, and this is what Hallberg gives him. Not that this artist would stoop to pander to the public taste, but he himself is basically, sentimental.</p>
   <p>"In Hallberg's works, his love for the sea and his understanding of it are predominant; his Atlantic and North Sea motives are characteristic in this respect, in that they reveal the sentimental undertone in his art.</p>
   <p>"In his motives of Lake Michigan, sky and water merge in a peaceful duet; the fine blending of opal, green, and silver, mixed with gold, displays the artist's acute sense of color tones and harmonies.</p>
   <p>"This little exhibit by a swedish-American immigrant, who left these shores in his early youth, furnishes ample proof of the possibilities for genuine artistic development offered by the New World to those who have it in them to take advantage of such opportunities.</p>
   <p>"We are not at all sure that Hallberg, the simple, lonely sailor, even though <pb facs="5423404_2_1475.jpg" n="3"/>aided by his ambition and talent, would have reached such artistic heights here at home as he has done in America. Our social and conventional prejudices often operate to the disadvantage of those who are striving for artistic self-expression."</p>
