   <p>A few years ago, it was customary with the employers to refuse to negotiate with a labor union when their employes were striking. The employer declared that he was willing to negotiate with his own workers, but would not stand for interference by outsiders in a matter which concerned only himself and those who were working for him. The great non-thinking masses agreed with him, reasoning as he did, if reasoning at all. The representatives of the press said "Yes! Amen;" and some of them considered it the height of insolence for men who had never worked for a certain employer to take the liberty of mixing in the matter.</p>
   <p>Times are changing. Little by little, the employers began to realize that their workers were not their slaves, but had the right to leave <pb facs="5423404_2_0445.jpg" n="2"/>whenever they desired, and the employer must, in such case, find new workers. The labor unions were strong then, and whey would not permit a qualified worker to work at cut rates, or for a longer period than the normal hours without extra pay, for that would hurt not only the individual worker, but the working class as a whole. Organized labor, therefore, demanded higher wages for the individual worker. The consciousness of class grew in the workers, and soon the employer could not obtain enough workers, except through the labor union. Having arrived at this point, he could not,of course, refuse to have the leader of the union take part in the negotiations concerning disagreements between employer and employe. The chorus of reaction quieted down.</p>
   <p>The consciousness of class grew, and a few days ago the union of hotel porters in Chicago took pleasure in announcing that the organization would not confer with the organization of hotel owners, but only with the hotel owners as individuals. This piece of fun became expensive <pb facs="5423404_2_0446.jpg" n="3"/>for the workers, and they paid heavily for their lesson. But the press and the unreflecting mass of people once more raised the Indian shout. Of course, the shout was that once again the workers were wrong. People were wondering how the workers could expect the sympathy of the public when they acted so unreasonably--and yet they simply applied the principle the employers had enunciated against them a few years ago, and at that time the employer's attitude had been loudly acclaimed.</p>
   <p>We would be grateful to anyone who could furnish us with an explanation of the remarkable logic of these people.</p>
