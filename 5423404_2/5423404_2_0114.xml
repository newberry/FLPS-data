   <p>In the year 1894, Eugene V. Debs and some other persons, laborers or labor leaders, were enjoined by the courts from public speaking, from writing or receiving letters, and a number of other restrictions were placed upon them; they were hardly left free for any action but eating. Debs was accused of having broken the injunction, and the federal authorities jumped on him. First he was accused of contempt of court, and later he was the defendant in one of those court cases in which the judge is legislator, judge, and sheriff in one person; in which the accused is not permitted to meet his accuser; in which no jury expresses judgment in the matter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0115.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Debs was sentenced, of course. He was sent to prison for one year. He was also held under accusation for the very acts for which he had been sentenced at the time of disregard of the injunction, but the District Attorney dropped the case since no evidence could be procured against him. And the authorities knew that no jury would sentence him.</p>
   <p>This happened in 1894. The present year is 1905.</p>
   <p>Now note the difference. Mr. Armour and the members of the beef trust were enjoined by the court just as were Debs and his associates. They have disregarded the injunction again and again. But they have been summoned to court for their actions of contempt. A grand jury has been sworn in to investigate the extent of the disregard of law exhibited. If this jury <pb facs="5423404_2_0116.jpg" n="3"/>finds that the law has been broken they will have their day in court. They will have the chance of facing their accusers, and the best legal talent to be had for money will be present to cross-examine the accusers, and finally the matter will be left to the decision of the jury.</p>
   <p>Let us rejoice that sometimes men who are accused of breaking the law get a fair trial. Let us not get angry that Armour and his associates are getting a full hearing under the law, however slow. But, on the other hand, let us not forget the illegal methods employed when Debs was sentenced.</p>
   <p>The difference in these two court cases show clearly that there are two ways of executing the laws in our courts: one for the rich, another for the poor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0117.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And even people who mean well look with disdain at Debs and with forgiveness at Armour.</p>
   <p>Debs was sentenced.</p>
   <p>Will Armour too be sentenced?</p>
