<title level="a">THOMAS HALL'S EXHIBIT</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Swedish-American landscape painter, Thomas Hall, has had a separate exhibit of aquarelles in the quarters of the Chicago Galleries Association, 220 North Michigan Avenue, since the beginning of this month, and it has attracted considerable attention among art patrons, so much more so since these aquarelles mark Mr. Hall's first efforts with this type of painting. As our readers will know, his landscapes have been shown at numerous exhibits, Swedish as well as others, for a long period of years.</p>
   <p>When he first began to dabble with water colors, he received much encouragement from critics and friends, many of whom saw a greater future for him in this field than as an oil painter, in spite of the fact that much of his previous work has been well received by art critics, and undeniably has shown that he possesses a fine color sense and a highly developed artistic individuality. These qualities are also apparent in his current exhibit. One look at it convinces one that Hall prefers the middle of <pb facs="5423404_2_1378.jpg" n="2"/>the road. He belongs to the modern school, but is careful not to go to extremes. And his art does not become repetitious and monotonous, for he travels around a good deal, looking for new motives and receiving fresh impressions. There is also something refreshingly new and spring-like about his present exhibit.</p>
   <p>Almost half of it represents sea and seashore motives, and some of them impress with their power. Among them are "Rocks" and "Low Tide," which we consider the best ones. "Dusk" has an entirely different motive, and expresses fine artistic sentiment. There are also several paintings in a lighter and more cheerful mood, summer scenes, such as "Harbor of Rockfort" and "Over the Hills." The latter is a really fine painting.</p>
   <p>The exhibit closes next Saturday, but those who are prevented from seeing it will have an opportunity to view Hall's art at other shows which will be held during the winter, and especially we have in mind the Swedish <pb facs="5423404_2_1379.jpg" n="3"/>artists' annual exhibit, which will open in the Edgewater Beach Hotel next Saturday.</p>
