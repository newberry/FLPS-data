   <p>The Garner-Wagner relief bill, providing for a total appropriation of 2,122 million dollars, was passed by the House last Thursday with 202 votes against 157, and no less than twenty-five Republicans voted for it. The bill will now go to the Senate, where it is expected to pass without much delay, but President Hoover is likely to veto it. The Democrats in the Senate will vote for it to a man, and the Republicans, who are anxious to get away from Washington and begin their vacation, are not planning any strong opposition, since they count on Hoover to veto the measure anyway.</p>
   <p>The President especially objects to the paragraph of the bill that gives the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which is to handle the money, authority to grant loans to any group or private individual who can give valid reasons why the loan should be given, and who can furnish acceptable security. The <pb facs="5423404_2_0287.jpg" n="2"/>President feels that this provision invites favoritism, through which the funds of the Finance Corporation might be quickly exhausted, the Government's credit undermined, and a balanced budget made impossible to attain.</p>
   <p>The President's apprehensions may be partly justified, but he is voicing them somewhat belatedly. There was good reason for such fears two years ago, when immense sums were voted for similar reconstruction purposes, and also later when the Finance Corporation was formed for the purpose of giving loans to financially embarrassed corporations and firms. So far a very small part of the appropriated millions has been spent for the alleviation of unemployment or for the benefit of the needy workers.</p>
   <p>The unemployment situation is now so grave that it is imperative that Government aid be forthcoming immediately, and further delay must not be risked simply for fear that the really needy may not benefit fully from it. The hungry millions simply cannot wait for a perfect plan to be worked out in detail. Authorities in New York, Chicago, Detroit, and other large cities <pb facs="5423404_2_0288.jpg" n="3"/>throughout the country are unable to provide funds for the feeding of the unemployed. Their resources are completely exhausted and it is not only unwise but actually dangerous further to test the patience of the hungry people. Help must be given now, either through the provisions of the Garner bill or by means of some other measure.</p>
   <p>The sentiment in the Congress is now such that any fairly sensible relief bill can be passed. The responsibility rests on the leaders. They can, if they will, muster enough votes to pass a reasonable bill even over the President's veto.</p>
