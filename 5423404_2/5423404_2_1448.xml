   <p>The annual art exhibit sponsored by the Swedish Club opened last Saturday, and will close next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Some fifty Swedish-American artists are represented by a total of 125 pieces. In regard to size, this exhibit just about equals that of last year, when there were 128 pieces. But in quality the present exhibition is, undoubtedly, several steps ahead of its predecessors, and if this tendency keeps up we are justified in expecting much of the future.</p>
   <p>The painters, as usual, are in the majority with 114 canvases by 45 artists.</p>
   <p>In the sculpture group, there are eleven pieces, representing five sculptors, of which all but one are from Chicago. Frank Gustafson exhibits a bust of Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, and Carl M. Linner has three, one of which is of Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1449.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A large number of people attended the opening and, according to what we heard, many of the pieces exhibited will be sold during the next few days.</p>
   <p>C. S. Peterson, the president of the Swedish Club, was in charge of the evening's program, which included a speech by himself and one by an official of the Art Institute, who declared the exhibit formally opened. Artists from the Bush Conservatory of Music rendered several song and instrumental music numbers.</p>
   <p>Several prizes have been donated for the occasion; they will be awarded later in the week.</p>
