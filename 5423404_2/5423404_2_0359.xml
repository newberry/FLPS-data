   <p>A committee appointed by the City Council is now conducting an investigation of the recent strike in the garment industry of Chicago, and the conditions which led up to it. A few hearings have already been held and have disclosed that the strikers worked under very distressing conditions, and that in several instances their employers were guilty of gross neglect and breach of law and regulations.</p>
   <p>One girl, called as a witness, testified that she started working at six o'clock in the morning; her forewoman, however, instructed her not to punch the time clock until half past seven. She quit work at a quarter of six in the evening, and thus the state law which limits the working day of women in industry to ten hours was evaded. Another girl told of working from six to six, and yet was unable to earn more than six dollars <pb facs="5423404_2_0360.jpg" n="2"/>a week, at the very most. A third stated that when work was slow she made about seventy-eight cents a week, and that her husband earned a similar sum.</p>
   <p>Other girls testified that during the busy season they worked from half past seven to a quarter of six; when they also gave up their half-hour for lunch they were able to earn as much as eight dollars a week. However, the average wage came to about five dollars. They were required to buy the needles which they needed for their work. If a garment was damaged or ruined, the guilty girl was charged from one and a half to two dollars; if it could not be determined who was responsible, each member of the group was charged twenty-five cents. Three hundred girls shared one washroom. On the whole, it was evident that they were subjected to pretty harsh treatment by the management.</p>
   <p>It is only proper that such conditions be given an airing, but that alone is not enough. The situation calls for a thorough cleanup by the factory <pb facs="5423404_2_0361.jpg" n="3"/>inspector and by the health department.</p>
