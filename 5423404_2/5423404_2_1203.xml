   <p>p.12. The most magnificent concert, which for many years has been given by Swedish Song-Stars, will be held in Orchestra Hall, Sunday P.M., April 10. The two artists who will give this sensational concert are the opera-star, Marie Sundelius and the world renowned tenor, Aroldo Lindi(Harold Lindou). The affair has been called "sensational," as the program is of such construction, that no one can leave the concert hall without admitting, that they had just heard what they had always wished and longed for. And a concert which enrapts the most particular song-critics and song-lovers must truly be named sensational.</p>
   <p>Marie Sundelius we have heard before in Orchestra Hall on many occasions, and with the greatest of pleasure and enthusiasm. She is always welcome among us, and this time more than ever, as she herself together with Aroldo Lindi, is arranging this concert. Her reputation is this time twofold at stake. The concert must of necessity, rank way above anything ever before presented. On this occasion both artists besides their individual single presentations also will sing several "grand" duets, making this affair an opera performance as well. A large number of Swedish songs will be presented together with numerous extra numbers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1204.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this connection it should be mentioned, that Marie Sundelius is indirectly responsible for Aroldo Lindi's wonderful progress. She it was, who arranged it so, that Lindi was given the opportunity to sing before the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera Company. And what then followed is song history. The late Director Aspergren of New York assumed the responsibilities for Lindi's musical education in Italy, and there it was, in the world's foremost opera house, "La Scala" in Milan that Lindi's star ascended on the operatic firmament, and spread all over the world in its scintillating glory. In Caruso's native land they know what a tenor is and should be. In order to "go over" in Italy, a voice is required and ability to sing. Since his debut at La Scala, the "Smalandske tenor-heroe" has been praised and feted for his wonderful singing, be it in Rome, Portugal, Spain, France, England - Covent Garden, where he and Wme. Jeritza on the "Royal Evening" sang and played the leading roles in La Tosca - or latest with the Chicago Grand Opera, where he also sang, Lindi is the new Caruso, and Caruso is the acme and climax of everything that is and has been called tenor as long as the world has existed. You cannot possibly deny yourselves the pleasure of hearing these two great artists at their first joint concert in Orchestra Hall.</p>

   <p>The next evening - April 11, - the program will be repeated at Rockford, Illinois, where the Shrine Temple has been engaged for the occasion. Also here a packed house is expected, and here as well as in Orchestra Hall, Harry Carlson will accompany the artist at the piano.</p>
