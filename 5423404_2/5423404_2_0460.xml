   <p>Cook County Agent C. O. Williamson, who is a Swede, last Thursday made his report of the activity during the first quarter of the current year.</p>
   <p>He reported that the account books of his predecessor were not in good condition. This applied especially to the year 1890. The report stated further that the aid on relief lists contained the names of a great number of people, who upon investigation have been found not to be in need of assistance. In one month alone he had found it necessary to eliminate eighty-five names from these lists. During the month of January 2, 845 families had received medicines, clothing and other forms of help, during February 2, 793 and during March 3, 282 families. The disbursements during these three first months of 1892 were $6,043.75, $13,203.53 and $10,271.74, respectively.</p>
