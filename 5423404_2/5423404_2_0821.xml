   <p>During the last few weeks events have taken place which are of great importance to this banking institution as well as to the business life of our city. The Foreman National Bank and the Foreman Trust and Savings Bank will unite their great resources with those of the State Bank of Chicago, and the result will be an institution with a capitalization of thirty-eight million dollars, and deposits of two hundred and twenty million dollars.</p>
   <p>But this modern business transaction has a deeper significance, and that is the reason that the officers and Board of Directors of the State Bank of Chicago make this announcement to all those who have been our friends during the Banks fifty years of existence.</p>
   <p>To us this important event marks the fulfillment of a lifelong ambition. Not that we have cherished bigness for its own sake, but we have wanted to give you the best possible service from one of the world's most complete banking <pb facs="5423404_2_0822.jpg" n="2"/>institutions, in return for your friendship and confidence. We will now be able to do so through the union of the two great banks. A friendship of fifty years' standing is not easily broken.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the spirit within a bank, the intimate understanding among individuals, is of great importance, and in order to preserve the ideas and ideals which we have developed during fifty years of steady growth we have merged with a bank whose ideals and ideas coincide with our own.</p>
   <p>To you whom we have served for so many years we promise to continue to take the same personal and intimate interest in your financial problems that we have had in the past. The officers with whom you have been accustomed to do business will remain with this new and greater institution. The confidence that you have had in your bank, and the friendship that you have felt for its officers and directors, will become even more justified in the future, for this new institution will do everything within its power to become your bank in the years to come, just as we have been your bank in the years that have passed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0823.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>To the friends whom we have won during fifty years of service we guarantee that the principles on which the State Bank of Chicago was founded and on which it has prospered, have also been in force in the bank with which we are now uniting, and will remain in force in the new institution.</p>
   <p>It is a great pleasure for all of us, individually and as a group, to send this message to the friends of the State Bank of Chicago, and we sincerely hope that it will be received in the same spirit in which it is conveyed.</p>
   <p>Board of Directors and officers of The State Bank of Chicago,</p>
   <p>La Salle and Monroe Streets.</p>
