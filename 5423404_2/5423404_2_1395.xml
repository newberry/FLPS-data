   <p>The Swedish-American artist Martin Lundgren is the subject of a flattering article in the current issue of the art periodical Palette &amp; Chisel, organ of the Palette &amp; Chisel Club, of which he has been a member for many years.</p>
   <p>The front page of the issue is adorned with a reproduction of one of Lundgren's latest paintings. The article begins by pointing out the fact that most Scandinavian and German artists are raised in artistic surroundings, and that their artistic sensibilities and gifts thus receive a stimulus which causes them to take to art at an early age. An American youngster is brought up in a different environment. And if and when he becomes interested in and begins to study art, it is more or less accidental.</p>
   <p>Lundgren was born in Skane, Sweden in 1871. His father was a cabinetmaker <pb facs="5423404_2_1396.jpg" n="2"/>and an interior decorator, and conducted a considerable business of his own. He was especially gifted as a painter of flowers.</p>
   <p>Martin had two brothers, one of whom showed unusual ability in drawing, and entered the Art Academy in Stockholm at the age of sixteen. But he died a few years later. Martin was the youngest in the family, and like his brother, showed artistic ability. But his father died when the boy was only eleven years old, and he had to begin working for his living at an early age. His oldest brother continued the father's business, and Martin worked for him for about five years, until in 1890 he decided to go to America. He went to work here as an interior decorator, and worked at that trade for some years. But he was not satisfied with the training and education that he had, and began to study at the Art Institute here in Chicago in 1904. He remained at the Institute for four years, and studied under such masters as Alfons Mucha and Louis Betts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1397.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During the last twelve years, Lundgren has devoted much time to fresco work, and has been engaged in the decoration of many public buildings. He has done, among others, eight fresco paintings in the State Capitol at Columbus, Ohio. But he loves landscape painting, and devotes most of his spare time to it. For many years, he has taken part in art exhibits, especially in those that have been arranged for Swedish-American artists.</p>
   <p>He belongs to the Illinois Academy of Fine Arts, the All-Illinois Society of Fine Arts, and the Swedish-American Art Association.</p>
   <p>Lundgren married Ida Lundgren in 1900. They have two daughters, of whom one, Harriet, is a noted ballet dancer.</p>
