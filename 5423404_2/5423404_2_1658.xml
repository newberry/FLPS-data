<title level="a">THE VETERAN SINGERS' ANNUAL FEAST</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The annual feast of the Veteran Singers was celebrated last Saturday at the Swedish Club by about fifty veterans, who participated in songs in Chicago before 1898. After the traditional "smorgasbord" had been served, the following officers were elected for next year, namely: president: Foreman Charles Nelson; vice-president: factory owner Theodor Johnson; and secretary for the fifth time, machine engineer Fritiof Sjoberg. The newly elected officers installed themselves, gathering around the large punch bowl by making glittering speeches, which were received with great enthusiasm. The honorary president, William Wilson, directed the songs with an energy one must admire. Charles Erikson, William Wilson, and Charles Wahlgren, who, together with Henning Johnson, now deceased, started the first single quartet in Chicago. They sang several old songs of past days. Mr. Erikson still sings first tenor in a way that the younger generation must admire.</p>

   <p>Editor Hjalmar Nilson from Minneapolis, and chairman for the Swedish Singing Society in America, suggested that all the Chicago singers should participate next year in order to make the Society's feast in Minneapolis a success.</p>
   <p>We are told that several veteran singers went directly to the church to attend the Sunday morning service after the feast, but this report has not yet been confirmed.</p>
