After completing his high-school work, he studied law at Lake Forest University and received his L.L.B. degree in 1899. He was a well liked member of the Swedish Club. His two brothers and Mother Johanna Maria Anderson survive. The funeral was held from 6736 Cornell Ave. with interment in Oakwood Cemetery.

He lived with his mother at 6736 Cornell Ave. His place cannot be filled.</p>
