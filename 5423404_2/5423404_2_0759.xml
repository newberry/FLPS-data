   <p>Professor Sigfrid Laurin has been a popular and prominent member of our Chicago Swedish colony for about a year since his arrival from Sweden.</p>
   <p>Professor Laurin was born in Hoganass, Skane, Sweden. His father was a minister; his mother was the daughter of P. G. Ahnfelt, pastor and author. Laurin's idol since boyhood was his mother's brother, Oscar Ahnfelt, who was known as "the evangelical troubadour".</p>
   <p>After attending the public schools, Laurin became a student at the Lund Cathedral School in 1885; afterwards he became one of the prodigees of the Royal Musical Conservatory in Stockholm. Here he was decorated a number of times.</p>
   <p>In 1894 he was called to the Bethany College at Lindsborg, Kansas, where <pb facs="5423404_2_0760.jpg" n="2"/>he was the chief piano teacher until 1897, when he left for a two-years visit to Sweden. He returned to Lindsborg in 1899, where he taught for another four years, after which, he again came to Chicago where he became famous as a piano teacher. The famous pianist, Rudolph Ganz of Chicago spoke very highly of both Laurin and his students, which is an unusual praise.</p>
