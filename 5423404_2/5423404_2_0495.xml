   <p>As previously reported, a national women's party has been formed for the purpose of achieving complete political and civil equality for women. In line with this program, a proposal for a constitutional amendment which will nullify certain privileges that are now accorded male citizens, and which will give both sexes equal rights and equal duties, is being formulated.</p>
   <p>The improved economic position which women have gained during the last fifty years, and especially their successful fight for the franchise, have caused many people to believe that full equality of the sexes now exists. But such is not the case. There are still many antiquated laws on the statute books, dating from the time when the male ruled supreme, when women were considered inferior and their rights were rather limited. In certain States, for instance a mother does not share with the father the authority over their children, and <pb facs="5423404_2_0496.jpg" n="2"/>a wife may not dispose of her own money as she pleases. Such laws should, of course, be annulled. But even when that is done, there will still exist certain inborn prejudices, passed down from generation to generation and which are not easily stamped out. They should not be overlooked by the new women's party.</p>
