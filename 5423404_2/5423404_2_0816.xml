   <p>The Belmont-Sheffield Trust &amp; Savings Bank's new building at the South-West corner of Belmont and Sheffield Avenues was formally dedicated for use last Friday.</p>
   <p>The new building is 6 stories high. The ground floor is occupied by the bank and several stores, the second and third floors are being rented out for business offices and the three top floors have been made into a bachelor hotel.</p>
   <p>This bank was organized about a year and a half ago. In this short period of time the deposits have grown to $1,500,000. It may be called a truly Swedish bank, as it was organized by Swedish men, with their own money, and its officers and directors being almost all Swedish. Following are the officers:J. Henning Johnson, president and cashier; Earl M. Anderson, 1st vice president; C. J. Schwarting 2nd vice president; George F. Anderson, 3rd vice president and Roy Segersten, assistant cashier. Mr. J. M. Westerlin is chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
