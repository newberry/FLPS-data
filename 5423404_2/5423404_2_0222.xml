   <p>Oversubscription of the Liberty Loan came as no surprise, though it progressed slowly. Under such circumstances, enthusiasm comes sharply to the few in the home stretch. We all believe that the war must be prosecuted vigorously to insure a just and lasting peace. Unfortunately one cannot say that peace has come closer because of the events of the last few days. We do not believe that the Kaiser will be quick to bow his head, or give up, against superior numbers. He does not appear to be at all concerned regarding our subsidy of the war, but on the contrary is engaged in great war plans.</p>
   <p>However, the allies have unquestionably won great victories on the West front. But one cannot say that this advance will quickly terminate the war. The winter is at hand, and judging from experience of this war in previous years, a practical stand-still will again ensue. The German position on the Western front, is somewhat <pb facs="5423404_2_0223.jpg" n="2"/>precarious. Nevertheless, large bodies of troops are shifted from this front, to others in greater danger. On the other hand, no one can minimize the advances of Germany on the Eastern front where the Russian have suffered great losses. The Russian people as a whole do not wish to continue the war and at best are now fighting in a lukewarm manner. This attitude on the part of the Russians make clear why the theatre of war has suddenly moved to the South. Dispatches to Washington say that the Italians have suffered a crushing defeat which in part was due to treason. Germany, in some way, seemed to have knowledge of the supplies and position of the Italian Army. Spies have without doubt given to Germany and Austria this valuable information, which resulted in the Italian defeat. This is as you know the ardor of war on foreign soil a spy is either hanged or shot. In the homeland they are looked upon as great patriots, and martyrs. Military experts do not view Italian defeat with much concern. They believe it possible for General Cadorna, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Armies to successfully meet the Germans in future engagements. What the allies really need is a centralized command in order to do away with overlapping and duplication. Europe is of the general opinion that the entry of the United States in the war will prove to be the deciding factor. And it is this that we must keep continously before us; because we are called upon to sacrifice the most,the government ought to keep us well <pb facs="5423404_2_0224.jpg" n="3"/>informed regarding all operations from the theatre of war. It is very unwise to neglect to do this. Confidence between the people and government is the country's best and surest protection in time of national peril.</p>
