   <p>A bill is pending in Congress, which provides for Federal aid to states that wish to undertake the rehabilitation of their forests by instituting scientific forestry and reforestation. Even if this bill should not be passed, its very existence will surely have served a good purpose, for it has called the attention of the nation to the fact that its magnificent forests are disappearing.</p>
   <p>Many states have made laudable attempts to repair the devastation which has been caused by profit-hungry lumber companies. If nothing is done, continental United States will be almost devoid of forests within a few years. To think that less than a hundred years ago this country possessed thousands upon thousands of square miles of the most beautiful and stately forests imaginable!</p>
   <p>It is still possible to save them from complete destruction, and with them <pb facs="5423404_2_0313.jpg" n="2"/>the national wealth which they represent. But the proper authorities must get busy before it is too late. There is urgent need for rational forestry instituted on a large scale. The passage of the bill now pending would mark a step in the right direction. If it is adopted it will undoubtedly do much to speed up efficient forestry in those states where, up to the present, little or nothing has been done to protect the forests which are so important to our national economy.</p>
