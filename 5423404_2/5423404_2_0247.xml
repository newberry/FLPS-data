   <p>If we are to believe President Wilson, we are standing, at the present moment, at the edge of a chasm.</p>
   <p>In a letter, printed in the press of the country, and addressed to Senator Stone, the President says regarding the latest diplomatic conflict with Germany: what we are fighting for in this case are the very essentials which make America a sovereign nation. The nation cannot give them up without admitting its own impotence, in fact relinquishing its independent position among the nations of the world."</p>
   <p>Without a doubt, these fine phrases are to most people somewhat of an exaggeration <pb facs="5423404_2_0248.jpg" n="2"/>of the present state of affairs. Why would the United States in fact relinquish its independent position among the nations just because American citizens be warned not to travel on ships carrying armaments.</p>
   <p>It does not strengthen President Wilson's position in view of the recent admission by German diplomats that defensive armament on a cruiser may become offensive against a submarine. But those who support his methods, and who demand that the people and the congress alike submit to his leadership refer to the principle that a belligerent nation cannot compel a neutral nation to relinquish its acknowledged rights without threatening its neutrality. This, they claim, is what Germany tries to do by compelling the United States to adopt an attitude which England could not avoid considering unfriendly and non-neutral.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0249.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If we really wish to remain neutral and at the same time wish to defend our neutrality, then we ought to pay no more attention to England than to Germany as regards their conception of our neutrality. Our only guide must be to treat everybody alike, and leave them to settle their differences, with no intrusion on our part.</p>
   <p>We must stand up for our rights, but only insofar as it benefits our own people. Onesided insistence upon ones right is of doubtful value. Often it creates unnecessary friction both in daily life and in the broader spheres.</p>
