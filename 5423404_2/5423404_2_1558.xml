<title level="a">THE SWEDISH CHORAL CLUB'S CONCERT</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Swedish Choral Club, directed by Harry T. Carlson, gave its annual spring concert last Wednesday in Orchestra Hall.</p>
   <p>The program included Mendelsohn's great oratorio "Elijah" and for the solo parts of this magnificent composition the Club presented the soprano Olive Nevin, the contralto Isabel Zehr, the tenor Watt Webber, and the baritone Frederic Baer, all of whom performed their demanding parts with distinction. [Translator's note: Apparently the above-mentioned singers are not Swedes and do not belong to the Club, but are engaged for the occasion.]</p>
   <p>In this composition there are, besides solo and choir parts, also parts for <pb facs="5423404_2_1559.jpg" n="2"/>duets and quartets, but they were rendered by the entire choir on this occasion.</p>
   <p>The performance of the choir measured up, in every respect, to the high standard which it has set at previous concerts. It could use a few more tenor voices, but those that it has are very good, and it excels in soprano voices.</p>
   <p>The co-ordination between the choir and the soloists was perfect, and the audience showed its appreciation by enthusiastic applause. The attendance was not as large as is customary at these concerts, but there was no lack of spirited interest and enjoyment of the fine performance.</p>
   <p>The music was rendered by the Choral Club's own organist, Stanley Martin, and a group of musicians from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
