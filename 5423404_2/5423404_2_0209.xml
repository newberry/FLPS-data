   <p>That our countrymen and countrywomen are all eagerly supporting the Third Liberty Loan drive is being confirmed everyday. Many individuals, business houses, clubs, societies, churches, and newspapers are in feverish activity for this cause. Since no account of Swedish subscriptions, has been kept, it is impossible to even estimate the total, but it can be truly said that the Swedes have done their share and with honors. The main thing is that "Uncle Sam" should get the money as soon as possible, and with this aim in mind, the Swedes are now working.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Order of Svithiod, which bought $5,000 worth of bonds of the Second Liberty Loan, will take a like amount of the new issue as well as $1,000 in War Saving Stamps. Svithiod's Veterans' club used one-third of its total reserves for Liberty bonds. Alpha Lodge, No. 50, I. O. S., at its last meeting, subscribed for $100.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0210.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The officers of the lodge have propounded the necessity of supporting the government, with the result that the different lodges are holding more than $10,000 in government obligations.</p>
   <p>The Viking Grand Lodge officers and the leaders in the different districts have promised the fullest cooperation. District "Brage," at its last meeting, subscribed for $500, and a number of its members subscribed for $700.</p>
   <p>The society "Iduna," which subscribed $1,000 to the Second Liberty Loan, has decided to subscribe for a like amount for the new loan.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0211.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Vasa's district lodge, "Illinois, No. 8," has decided to use a large amount from the treasury, for the purchase of government obligations, and the other lodges will no doubt do likewise.</p>
   <p>Lake View, No. 116, of the Scandinavian Brotherhood, which meets at 1041 Newport Avenue, and is one of the youngest lodges, will buy a $100 Liberty bond.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Typographical Union Sick and Benefit Society will buy a $100 bond, and will announce additional purchases at the organization's next meeting.</p>
   <p>Since the above was written the following Svithiod lodges have subscribed for Liberty bonds: Balder, No. 12, $500 (before $500); <pb facs="5423404_2_0212.jpg" n="4"/>Svea Dottror, No. 57, $500, (before $500) Alpha, No. 50, $100; Elida, No. 54, $100; Unity, No. 44, $200. According to reports, the majority of the lodges will follow suit, so the "Svithiod" contribution will be a considerable amount.</p>
   <p>The Grand Secretary, of the Vikings, Mr. Lindskoog, has himself sold obligations among the members for $4,150 in denominations of $50 and $100.</p>
   <p>Polhem, No. 70, will buy Liberty bonds for $500, and also make it possible for members to purchase these bonds on the installment plan, the lodge guaranteeing the subscribed amount. Lake View, No. 166, S. F. A., has called a special Liberty Loan meeting for April 19. Viola, No. 174 S. F. A., will buy bonds for $150. Among the Vasa <pb facs="5423404_2_0213.jpg" n="5"/>lodges, Kronan, No. 170, and Bernadotte, No. 241, have each bought bonds for $100.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Trinity congregation subscribed more than $5,000; the young people subscribed for $2,000 at one meeting. It is also worth mentioning that this congregation collected over $1,700 for the Field-Mission Fund, and can boast of a service flag with 60 stars.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Ebenezer congregation recently held a big street demonstration to awaken interest for the Liberty Loan campaign. The whole affair was handled by a committee of twenty members.</p>
   <p>What Swedish-American women are doing, has been mentioned before, suffice it to say that they are very active and are securing excellent results.</p>
