<title level="a">THE SINGERS' CONVENTION AND FESTIVAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last week might well be called Swedish Singers' Week, for the great convention of the Swedish Singers' League of America set its mark on the city, and everything Swedish in Chicago centered about the singers and their song.</p>
   <p>The convention opened Thursday morning, and its most important meeting took place that same afternoon, when several important questions concerning the League's activities came up for discussion.</p>
   <p>Delegates from the various divisions throughout the country attended, as well as the two representatives from Sweden, Count C. E. Taube and engineer Gustaf Hultquist, who conveyed greetings from the honorary <pb facs="5423404_2_1604.jpg" n="2"/>president of the singers in Sweden, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Needless to say, the two representatives of the singers in the old country received a hearty ovation.</p>
   <p>On Thursday night, veteran Chicago singers were the hosts of their brothers-in-song from various parts of the country at a banquet in the Swedish Club.</p>
   <p>During the convention, two great concerts were given in the Medinah Temple, one on Friday night and the other on Saturday night. On both occasions, the concert hall was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, the final day, the singers gathered in Riverview Park, where comradeship and the traditional singing spirit manifested themselves with <pb facs="5423404_2_1605.jpg" n="3"/>a minimum of restraint. The general public took part in the festivities, and it is said that never before has a Swedish event drawn so many visitors to the park. Some twelve thousand people entered the grounds during the day, and everybody enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>
   <p>The Chicago arrangements committee had made special provision for the entertainment of the visiting ladies. On Saturday, a luncheon was given for them in the Lincoln Park Restaurant.</p>
   <p>It was a great week and a great convention.</p>
