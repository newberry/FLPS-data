   <p>David Lloyd George, who is touring America as an apostle of peace, has just completed his visit to Chicago, where he was received with all the honors due the foremost European statesman of our day. The acclaim was spontaneous, and, in parting, he declared that nowhere had he experienced a more kind and hearty reception. During his visit here he addressed large gatherings and was admired by all. But, in spite of all this, he received no assurances of support for his appeal for help from this country in untangling the present confusion in Europe; and this fact is easily explained.</p>
   <p>America entered the war with the purpose of destroying German militarism and securing world place. She saved her allies from defeat, and desired a just peace at the end of hostilities. But when victory was theirs and their own destruction had been averted, these allies disregarded America's wishes, and made a peace in <pb facs="5423404_2_0154.jpg" n="2"/>which force was the main factor. This peace not only caused much suffering, but carried within it the seeds for another world war. It should be clear by now that lasting peace can never be attained as long as justice and mutual good faith are absent from peace conferences. Europe's troubles are caused by the Europeans themselves. They must get together in a spirit of co-operation and friendliness to help themselves and solve their own problems. Otherwise, no outside help can do them any good.</p>
   <p>If the European powers would make a sincere effort to iron out their own difficulties, America would undoubtedly be willing to come to their aid. But until that effort is made, peaceful America should mind her own business and avoid entanglement in the complicated affairs of Europe.</p>
