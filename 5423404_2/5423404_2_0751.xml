   <p>Prof. Albert A. Michelson came back to Chicago the other day after a trip to Europe. He brought back the Noble Prize which he was awarded in Stockholm. Prof. Michelson was tremendously pleased with the beautiful city of Stockholm and the Swedish hospitality. He also had a private audience with King Gustaf V. Extensive celebrations were not carried out this year due to the passing away of the former King Oscar.</p>
   <p>Prof. Michelson says in an interview: Now that I have been awarded this prize, I got a first hand knowledge of the Swedish friendliness which I have heard spoken of in America, and as I have also had proven to me by my two assistants in the labratories, who have been so faithful and helpful in my work to them I owe a beautiful thanks. When I come home with the prize they will not be forgotten. From the highest in authority down to the workers I came in contact with the most friendly and genial hospitality which was accorded me. Even the boys on the streets were quiet and well behaved. I will next summer think of the midsummer's wonderful sun, about which I have heard so many interesting things written. I would like to live there my whole life. There money is not almighty God. The Swedes find time to inform themselves <pb facs="5423404_2_0752.jpg" n="2"/>by reading literature both novel and real; one does not find that heartless, never that restless chasing that we find in Chicago. Here I found a pleasant country and a pleasant people.</p>
