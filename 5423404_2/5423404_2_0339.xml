   <p>The League of Nations is trying to stamp out white slavery, and a Swedish delegate, Mrs. Bugge-Wicksell, has done much to bring this problem to the attention of the League. Legislation has been proposed which would provide for deportation of persons found guilty of this crime, and for special investigation of cases in which women are offered positions in foreign countries, as well as for more rigid control of persons who travel from one country to another.</p>
   <p>It seems to us that political considerations should not be allowed to prevent America from co-operating with other nations in this effort to rid humanity of the scourge of white slavery. There is a great difference between such cooperation and actual membership in the League, and one is tempted to ask if the United States can really afford to decline the invitation to join other civilized nations in such a humanitarian undertaking.</p>
