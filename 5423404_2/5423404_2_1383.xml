   <p>This year's art exhibit in the Swedish Club closed last Sunday night, exactly one week and a day after it opened. A large number of artists and others interested in the exhibit were present, and waited anxiously for the jury to announce the names of the prize winners. As previously reported, the awards were larger and more numerous this year than ever before.</p>
   <p>The Swedish vice-consul for Chicago, G. Bernhard Anderson, officiated, and before announcing the winners he made a fine speech on the significance of art. First prize,$200, in oil painting group was awarded to J. Theo Johnson for his "Music and Mode". It was evident that the jury's judgment was in accord with that of the public, for this canvas also took the popularity prize of $100.</p>
