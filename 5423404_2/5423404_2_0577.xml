   <p>The American Forestry Association is doing a great service to the nation by calling attention to the necessity for a rational protection and preservation of our forests. The wanton cutting down of millions upon millions of trees which has been going on during the last few decades, with consideration for nothing but immediate profits, has done the country much harm--in fact, more harm than is realized by the general public. The high prices on wooden materials, and the actual shortage of such products as wood pulp, used in the manufacture of paper, are warnings which should be heeded. We also wish to point out the close relationship between deforestation and climate, precipitation, floods and soil erosion.</p>
   <p>One gets an idea of the amount of deforestation which has taken place when one <pb facs="5423404_2_0578.jpg" n="2"/>considers the fact that of the immense forests which once covered sections of the United States only one-sixth remains. It has been calculated that within sixty years there will be nothing left, unless immediate and efficient measures are taken, including both reforestation and preservation of the forests that we still have.</p>
   <p>We do not believe that the question of efficient forestry will ever become a political issue, but it certainly is of the greatest economical importance.</p>
