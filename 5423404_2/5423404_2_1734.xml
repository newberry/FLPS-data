   <p>For the great Song Festival in Minneapolis, in July, our Swedish singers, belonging to the Chicago branch of the Singing Association, are now making great preparations.</p>
   <p>The famous singer, Solomon Smith, who had been engaged for the Song Festival, was taken ill, and cannot attend the Festival. On account of this, it has become necessary to omit the great concert which was to have been held at the Auditorium, and at which he was to have sung. Instead of this concert, however, a great Song Festival is to be held at Sharpshooters' Park on Saturday, <pb facs="5423404_2_1735.jpg" n="2"/>July 18, by the Swedish Singing Association in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The following societies belong to the Association: Swedish Glee Club; Svithiod Singing Club; the singing societies Lyrani, Orpheus, North Star, The North, Iduna, Harmony, and Frithiof. From the above, it is evident that the event will be the most glamorous one of the season, it will be a real song festival, and it ought to command the presence of all lovers of good Swedish singing. The program will be the best possible. It will be published later.</p>
