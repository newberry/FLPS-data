   <p>A good example of what can be accomplished with very little money but an abundance of determination and love for work is set by our countryman C. O. Hillstrom.</p>
   <p>Hillstrom arrived in this country from Sweden in 1872 and lived for the first few years in Chicago. He was an organ builder by trade. After a few years he moved to Chesterton, Indiana, a small town which was almost a suburb of Chicago. Here he began a factory of his own. During these years he has been very successful. He now employs about seventy men. His factory occupies a space of thirteen town lots and several new additions have been made. An invention by him, the Hillstrom Organ Tester, has been patented and received prize awards at various expositions. His factory now turns out about 2,500 piano stools per month.</p>
   <p>Men like Hillstrom are an honor to the Swedish culture in more respects than one.</p>
