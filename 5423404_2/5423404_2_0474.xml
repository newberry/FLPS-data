   <p>The Republican presidential nominee has given his viewpoint in an article recently on the duties of the President. During the four years as Secretary of War, he became acquainted with the duties and responsibilities of the President. If he seeks honor and power only for the time being, instead of giving his best service to the nation, he is not worthy of the honor.</p>
   <p>He must feel that it is better not to be President than to be a poor one. The duties of President are many and varied. He is elected by the people, and he is their representative and therefore, should try to serve their best interests. He should not forget that he owes his power to the people. When the people fail to have confidence in his integrity or his judgment, then his work becomes a burden. But if he carries out the desires of the people he can serve his country without fear and will demand the respect of the whole Country.</p>
   <p>The Republicans have chosen C. A. Johnson, as their Candidate for Governor of North Dakota.</p>
