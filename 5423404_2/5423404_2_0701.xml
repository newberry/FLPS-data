<title level="a">THE SWEDISH LEGAL BUREAU</title>

   <p>The Swedish Legal Bureau has been in operation here in Chicago for several years, ever since the Swedish consulate here discontinued the collection of inheritances for Swedes in this city following the death of relatives in the old country. It has done a great job in handling such cases, assisting Swedes not only in this country but also in Canada and in the American possessions.</p>
   <p>Such estate and inheritance cases often require much research and complicated legal work before they can be settled justly. Swedish-American heirs are seldom able to be present in the Swedish courts, and most of them need the services of an American lawyer to look after their interests. It is of great importance for the heir to be represented by an experienced man, who also has good connections in Sweden.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0702.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such a man is our well-known countryman, A. R. Grosstephan, the owner and head of the Swedish Legal Bureau, and former secretary of the Swedish Consulate in Chicago. He enjoys the full confidence of his clients, and his office is, so to speak, a clearing house between Swedish-Americans and their relatives in Sweden, as far as legal matters are concerned. There are many Swedish men and women in this country who are grateful to M. Grosstephan for the efficiency and honesty with which he has handled their affairs.</p>
