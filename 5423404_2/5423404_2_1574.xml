   <p>p. 11. "The Singing Vikings" is the cognomen which the Swedish National Choir, the singing society ("De Svenske,") should use during their proposed American tournament this summer. It begins in New York City with a concert in Carnegie Hall, June 1, and continues Westward to arrive in Chicago, the capitol of all Swedish-Americans, June 5. The American program will take one and one-half months, and "De Svenske's" return to Sweden is scheduled for July 14.</p>
   <p>If nothing unforeseen happens, it is the intention of the Chicago Swedish Choral Club to set its course for Sweden at about the same time. Leaving Chicago June 1; two or three concerts will be given in the East, before they embark upon the 5/5 Stockholm on June 4, arriving in Goteborg (Gothenburg) on the 14th,where the first concert will be given in the Concert House the next evening. The course then goes Southward along the west-coast of Sweden, with concerts in the larger cities and in <pb facs="5423404_2_1575.jpg" n="2"/>Copenhagen's Tivoli, which concert will be in charge of the well-known Danish-American of Chicago, Max Henius, who is held in high esteem in his native land. From here the tour goes through Southern and Eastern Sweden with detour to the Island of Oland, arriving in Stockholm July 2. Three concerts will be given, one on July 4, which, no doubt will be a grand celebration of our National Holiday.</p>
   <p>In another steamer, chartered for the occasion, the choir goes to Finland, where concerts will begin in Abo and Helsingfors, and to which the Finns are looking for ward with great interest. Mixed choir-song is the Finns' specialty, and the performance will perhaps be more closely scrutinized than anywhere else.</p>
   <p>Added interest is given this Finnish visit through the simultaneous arrival of the Swedish 5/5 Drottningholm in Helsingfors, bringing with it eight-hundred Finnish-American delegates to a congress.</p>
   <p>After the Finland concerts, Norland will be visited. Whether or not the itinerary will include Ostersund depends upon the wishes and desires of the people there, <pb facs="5423404_2_1576.jpg" n="3"/>otherwise the tour will continue through Dalarne and Varmland to Oslo and possibly Trondhjem and Bergen,Norway. The tournament will end at Skara in the early part of August, in order to accommodate those who wish to return on a Swedish steamship August 6.</p>
   <p>Mr. Axel Hulton, the choir's business manager, who just returned from Sweden after having planned the itinerary, reported great interest in the Chicago Choir's second tournament to the "Old Land," all points visited on our last trip will extend to us a hearty "welcome back," and new places not formerly visited are much interested. The memory of the last tournament in 1920 is still fresh in the minds of the people, the songs they presented and the exemplary performance of the individuals.</p>
   <p>About seventy people will participate with Edgar Nelson, as director. He has been the leader since the choir's inception.</p>
   <p>Who the soloists will be had not as yet been decided upon, nor the non-singing participants.</p>
   <p>The choir belongs to Sweden's Choir Society which has a membership of more than seven-thousand. <pb facs="5423404_2_1577.jpg" n="4"/>The president is the late Secretary of State, Sandler; and the Secretary, Civil Engineer, Graner, member of Royal Swedish Railway's Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, who was the tournament's protector last time, has also this time voluntarily assumed the same protectorship.</p>
