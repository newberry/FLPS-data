   <p>[Half-tone, four columns-fifth of a page, picture of architect's drawing of the Clark-Foster Building]</p>
   <p>The Clark-Foster Syndicate, an organization of Chicago Swedes, has bought the building lot located on the southeast corner of Clark Street and Foster Avenue. Its dimensions are 80 by 135 feet, and on it will be erected a bank and office building, the architect's drawing of which is reproduced above.</p>
   <p>Interest is added to this undertaking by the fact that a new Swedish-American bank, the Builders and Merchants Bank, will have its quarters in this new building, which is so conveniently located in the heart of the Swedish district in Edgewater.</p>
   <p>Behind this new banking venture are a number of leading Swedes in Chicago. To <pb facs="5423404_2_0873.jpg" n="2"/>begin with, it will be capitalized at $230,000, and Gustaf Hallblom, an experienced banker, will be its president.</p>
   <p>The Clark-Foster Building is expected to be ready for occupancy in the latter part of next summer, and the new bank will open its doors about August 1. The address of its organization committee is 5207 North Clark Street.</p>
