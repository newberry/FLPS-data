<title level="a">THE CONCERT AT THE AUDITORIUM</title></bibl>

   <p>A spirit of genuine festivity prevailed at the Auditorium Sunday evening where a large and animated audience had gathered to enjoy the concert by the students from the University of Christiania, Norway, and a real success it was. At their very entrance upon the stage, and later at every opportunity, the Norwegian singers were given an ovation which increased in warmth as the evening progressed. Genuine heartiness was evidenced in these ovations; clearly the audience was joyful at being in close rapport with the celebrated visitors.</p>
   <p>The Swedish National Association, through Mr. Beruh Anderson, presented the singers with a laurel wreath. Mr. Anderson's brilliant speech of presentation <pb facs="5423404_2_1708.jpg" n="2"/>was frequently interrupted by most intense applause, adding force to its representative character.</p>
   <p>Listening to the singing of this great chorus was true enjoyment. The young, rich and vigorous voices of the singers presented a magnificent tone material which, untrammeled, developed its full force and harmony. Rhythmic agility and sovereign strength in harmony and in delivery were outstanding characteristics. Almost magical was the ability of the voices to melt in a beautiful ensemble as of just four mighty homogenuous voices with the tenors, both in forte and in pianissimo completely controlled and balanced against the mighty basses. Singing, thus complemented in all its phases, is heard but rarely, as is also the lightening energy and minute exactness present in the elements of forte.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grondahl, the director, evidently possesses the ability both to select <pb facs="5423404_2_1709.jpg" n="3"/>the voices and to nurture and train them, therefore, this unusual melting together of the voices, in which every individual voice fulfills its role with wonderful taste and precision. Mr. Grondahl, as director, is the man of superior leadership, who controls the masses by his confident energy enlivened by hidden fire and exceptional understanding.</p>
   <p>As stated, the concert was a great success, but, of course, the victory is not to be compared with the shining success of the concerts by the students from Lund University in Sweden last summer. And the reason? No chorus of singers can sing as well as the Swedish student chorus, none in all the world.</p>
