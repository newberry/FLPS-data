   <p>The patriotism of Chicagoans, or perhaps it was simply their curiosity, was evidenced in full last Wednesday when President Roosevelt arrived in Chicago. The streets around the Northwestern Railroad Station were crowded with people seeking to gain a glimpse of the Father of our country. Several hundred police officers were put into service in and around the station.....A section of Kinzie Street was closed to the public, by cordons of police officers and a regiment of cavalry. No vehicle was allowed to pass this holy place during the solemn period, which lasted one hour. The streetcars were kept back and blocked the streets. The citizens were not permitted to pass the street crossings; they were kept back by the clubs of the officers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0037.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A state of quiet and solemnity prevailed as if God, the Father Himself, had visited the city and Kinzie Street.</p>
   <p>A law-abiding people is pleasing to God, and true patriotims is worthy of our regard, but we hate and despise idolatry. President Roosevelt is a fine man, but he is, as we ourselves, merely human. In this, our democratic (?), country people shake their heads and smile indulgently at the ovations given the crowned heads of Europe when they travel through their countries - and so do we. But we are logical and laugh also at the silly behavior of the people when our president visits a city.</p>
   <p>The English-American press, which disdainfully speaks of the ovations tendered <pb facs="5423404_2_0038.jpg" n="3"/>European monarchs by their people, employ pages of its contents to describe how the president of this country eats, sleeps, and acts when on a hunting trip, and if some day the president happened to be tired so that he would not feel like telling the reporters of his condition, the reporters would send woeful telegrams relating that the president's condition was unknown.</p>
   <p>All of this is folly and not patriotism, and the sooner this fact is realized by the Americans, the better it will be for them and for the country.</p>
