   <p>When a person has broken the law, and the court determines the punishment, it happens in many cases that the culprit is let off with a fine; and if he is able to pay it he does not have to serve time in jail or prison. But if he cannot he is placed behind the bars. Such a case is a touching demonstration of privileges enjoyed by the moneyed man, under circumstances where money really should not count at all.</p>
   <p>The injustice of this system should be clear to every thinking person, but up to now it has, nevertheless, been permitted to continue.</p>
   <p>However, former Municipal Judge Cleland, of Chicago, has now prepared a proposal which is to be submitted to the legislature in Springfield, and which may correct this situation, that is to say, when and if the lawmakers get ready to <pb facs="5423404_2_0365.jpg" n="2"/>to act on it.</p>
   <p>Judge Cleland's proposal provides that if a person who has been sentenced to pay a fine is a citizen and regularly employed he shall be given thirty days in which to pay it, if such extension is necessary. Such a provision would place the poor man on an equal footing with his fellow citizen who has money and, in many cases, save him from the disgrace of serving time in a penal institution. The justice of such a procedure is evident, and it is to be hoped that the legislature will make it into law. There should be equality before the bar of justice, not only in theory but also in practice.</p>
