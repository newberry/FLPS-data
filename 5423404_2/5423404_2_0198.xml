   <p>Below is shown a table of the amounts subscribed by the different nationalities for the Third Liberty Loan, as far as it has been possible to secure the information. Only about 55 % of the subscriptions of these nationalities are known. What was subscribed by many Swedish-Americans , who did not state their nationality is not known. Officially, the amount subscribed to by the foreign nationalities, is set at $741,437.000. or 173/4% of the whole amount. The number of subscribers within the same group is estimated at seven millions or 411/2% of all subscribers.</p>
   <p>Tabulated, the subscriptions are as follows;</p>

   <p>Other nationalities have contributed less than a half million each. Under the heading of "Miscellaneous" are listed $43,988,400, subscribed to by persons of foreign birth or descent, which could not be classified under any nationality. Further, as "Unclassified," are listed $66,272,600., and as "Late Subscriptions," $21,478,900. How much of these sums should be accredited Swedish-Americans' accounts is impossible to say, we know, however, that many subscribed for large amounts as Americans without stating their nationality.</p>
