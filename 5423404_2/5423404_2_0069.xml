   <p>At a luncheon given Friday, Jan. 9th, by the Better Government Association, Morrison Hotel, District Attorney Edwin A. Olson, delivered an address, in which he severely criticized the corrupt practices prevalent in the courts of Cook County.</p>
   <p>It is not a secret, he stated, that some of the judges accept bribes, ignore perjuries and permit criminals to buy their way to freedom. By these shameful practices the courts are largely to be blamed for the upward trend of criminality in Chicago and Cook County, he asserted. Mr. Johnson further stated that he had seen and heard of cases where a criminal openly had been accused by the court of committing perjury and admitted this charge before the court, but that the case against the criminal nevertheless had been dismissed. The increasing criminality is not to be laid at the doorstep of the police, Mr. Olson strongly pointed out, as they make frequent and justified arrests, but it is the shocking result of a laxity of the courts and the sinister workings of politics.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0070.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Olson's concluding statement was that he has been convinced that the only remedy for this evil is to have the criminals arraigned before the Federal Courts, for which hoodlums and bandits have a wholesome respect.</p>
