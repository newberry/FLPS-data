<title level="a">THE ROYAL SWEDISH KRONOBERG'S MUSIC CORPS WILL VISIT THE UNITED STATES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Royal Swedish Kronoberg's Music Corp is coming to the United States and is to give a concert at Orchestra Hall, Sunday, April 12, under the auspicies of The Swedish National Society. The corps is affiliated with the Royal Kronoberg's Regiment, and its director is Erik Hogberg. The corps consists of thirty-five musicians. It made its first public appearance on the concert stage in 1888 in Stockholm, Sweden. Then it visited thirty cities in Germany, the homeland of the music, where the people and the music critics were charmed by the fine musical presentations. Director Hogberg is one of Sweden's most prominent military musicians. When he was appointed director for the Kronoberg corps in 1898, he was musical director at the Royal Opera, and at the Royal Orchestra in Stockholm. He has concluded his musical education in European culture countries.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1262.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program, which he will present here in Chicago, will consist of compositions by Rossini, Grieg, Lindblad, Peterson-Berger, Sjoberg, and by himself. The Kronoberg parade march and the Retreat of the Swedish Army will conclude the program.</p>
