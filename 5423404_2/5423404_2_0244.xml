   <p>p.6......The New Americanism as preached by Theodore Roosevelt, has, according to our conception, much in common with the old "Knownothingism," which we thought dead and buried more than fifty years ago. Since this happened, the United States has fought its Civil War, (which was not a war between immigrants and native born). It has fought Spain, acted as mediator for peace between Russia and Japan and during the past two years has been threatened with war both by Europe and on its own continent. And during the last fifty years the influx of immigrants has more than doubled the country's population without once giving the slightest pretext for bringing up the question of Americanism. It is only during recent months and particularly with reference to the coming election, that this has been made an active question. At present there is no occasion for this, as the foreign-born or so-called hyphenated citizens are fully as loyal towards <pb facs="5423404_2_0245.jpg" n="2"/>their adopted country, as are any of the descendants of the first settlers. It has caused great antagonism among many of us to hear Roosevelt's prattle about "the right Americanism" and his threats towards the "not desirable" citizen, and his other irresponsible criticisms about Hyphenated Americans. Judging from the resolution passed at the last Republican Convention, Mr. Roosvelt's sun as a leader is setting.</p>
   <p>President Wilson has followed Roosvelt's tracks, and done his utmost to arouse the ire of the foreign-born citizen against the present administration - and in this he has been successful.</p>
   <p>But all this foolishness we must overlook. We cannot be deprived of our rights as citizens, unless it be through our own shortcomings. When the time comes, we will bring our rights into play, as heretofore,for the benefit of our adopted land.</p>
   <p>For us to go forth talking about and emphasizing our patriotism is both unnecessary and improper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0246.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We therefore think, that the Swedes in Chicago should decline the invitation extended to them and other nationalities by a mystic association calling itself "Committee for the Promotion of Loyalty to the United States," which we learn, intends to call a mass-meeting here July 4th, with Theodore Roosevelt as the "speaker of the day."</p>
   <p>Among the members of the "Committee" we find: "Biankini, Czarnecki, Shustek, Palandech, Stepina" and similar Bohemian and Polish names. With those nationalities as represented by these gentlemen, we recognize no solidarity or common ties. We don't need to unite them or anyone else, to work for the welfare of this country, nor do we need their moral support to maintain our loyalty, which has never been found lacking.</p>
   <p>The "honorable invitors" have requested an answer. Here it is.</p>
