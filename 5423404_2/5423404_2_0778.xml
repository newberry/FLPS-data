   <p>An impressive funeral took place last Thursday at....Rose Hill cemetery. Doctor Lawrence Hessebroth, one of the oldest and most prominent Swedes in Chicago, passed away. The funeral procession was one of the largest ever accorded a Swede in Chicago. More than fifty carriages were counted in the cortege, and masses of flowers also bore testimony that the deceased was not forgotten. The group of old time Swedes in Chicago is growing smaller, not many are left of the early settlers.</p>
   <p>Lawrence Hessebroth was one of those old reliable ones. He put his all into the work he undertook, and....during his whole activity in Chicago he....sought in every way to further the cause of the Swedes and Swedish-Americans.</p>
   <p>Lawrence Hessebroth was born November 25, 1844, in Dalsland, Sweden. He <pb facs="5423404_2_0779.jpg" n="2"/>graduated as a pharmacist in 1864, immigrated to America during that same year, and shortly afterwards settled in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the Civil War, he served for a time as pharmacist, and afterwards as physician on a vessel of the Mississippi squadron. He won much praise for his work in this capacity. After the war, he....settled in Chicago.....The Kronan pharmacy, 107 East Chicago Avenue, is his creation, and it remains a worthy monument to his activity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hessebroth took an active part in politics.....He was also greatly interested in Swedish music. The Swedish Glee Club has lost one of its best members at his death. He ranked high within the Order of Masons, and belonged to a number of other societies as well.</p>
   <p>In 1872, Lawrence Hessebroth married Sofia Mathilda Blom....who survives him.</p>
