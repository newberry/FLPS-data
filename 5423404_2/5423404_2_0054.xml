   <p>The democratic candidate for Congress, Mr. Ole Johnson Ryan, gave the following excellent address at Des Moines, Iowa last May. We wonder where this gentleman picked up the name "Ryan".</p>
   <p>"Master Charman, Yentelmans and Lady: Ay never med spetz en republic convenston before, men ay tank ay haw got so gut rit to mak spetz for sweed mans some live on Manasota, as gankee fellow had to mak spetz for gankee mans doren est en.</p>
   <p>"Ay livin on Mansota long time Master Charmans, ay ben nerly born on Mansota, plenty more sweed faller living on Mansota, mor-en millin of it, all good mans, and Master Charmans ever teme ve neden pressedent for the Unite States, bout forty tusend gankee faller esten yump op and vant to make himsefs for pressedent and ven him didn't get nomnason him scratch the tecket like.... schuse me Master Charmans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0055.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We got pile schmart sweed faller so mak gud pressedent on Mansota, and ay ben hare to nominate one of it, Mr. Knud Nelson, Shidg county, Mansota. Hay ban gud substansable farmer, and ay nomnate him for top of rupblic tecket.</p>
   <p>"Knud Nelson him ron farm yus so gud som any man on Mansota hay ban hard vorker. Hay can hire two mans so ron farm, and Knud him can ron business round Vashingtown Unite States captol hoos strate as string. Af Knud be lected pressedent him vod yust keep vone gud mans and dissharge hole cabnet. Two Sweed mans can do yus so much vork as all do gankee faller on Vashingtown and Knud Nelson ban gude mans. Any mans like Nelson who can keep chinc Bug and code bur out 640 acre land on Mansota, can run hole Unite States like top.</p>
   <p>"Ah hawe me farm in Mansota, and me broder Ole him got farmsted vesten sim yim river Dakota Territory. Ve hod plenty bad crop and Ole him put big moryaje on farmstead and first yer Clevlan him bane pressdent come long grass hooper him ate op everytang on Ole farmstead but moryaje, and ve vont <pb facs="5423404_2_0056.jpg" n="3"/>so get gude mans for pressdent so Clevlan him vont get in agan.</p>
   <p>"Ay tank Master Mac Kinley batter pay him bill before him vont to run for pressdent, him ben hole talk vid Democrat en Mansota.</p>
   <p>"Same tame Harrison him run for pressedent ay reden sweed paper, Ben Harrison hay are Uncle for Ole Thompson sweed faller him live en Mansota, so ay vork hard for Harrison and ay get gude many more sweed faller him vork for Harrison too, and as soon him are elected ay not hear von vord from him, hay aynt so rite me letter and say tank you. And him med minister for Shili out of Irish mans and hay not give sweed faller yob tall, only Posten Office, and ve hav big fite vid gankee faller bout dat.</p>
   <p>"Harrison aint so gude sweed mans like Knud Nelson and of you lect Knud ay bat hay vont go shoot in duck in nice veder. Knud Nelson bane planty gude shoot vid gun but hay vil tind to bisness en Vashingtown and shoot duck sunday.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0057.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"You tank mor-en millin sweed mans en Mansota keep still and let voomans out vest ron hole bisness? Not bay a....ay dont tank so.</p>
   <p>"Af you don't give Knud Nelson nomnason, sweed mans him vil made tammany hall out Mansota, and med combinaso vid Irish mans on New York and run hole Unite States yust de same him vont it. But if you put Knud Nelson on top republic ve carry Mansota and ve carry ever staten nort side Mansota.</p>
   <p>"And ay bat Knud Nelson him vont send faller out vid powder mashine med rain for ten cant acre and now him can't stop it.</p>
   <p>"Ay ban tankful for tame so ay med this spetz and ay hope ay aint so use two much big vords. Sweed mans can make besten spetz ven him can use few Enlish curse vord. Ay tank you yentlemans and lady for your kind intentions."</p>
   <p>That was the Democrats' way of knocking Knud Nelson. We all know he is a staunch Republican, but the Democrats want it to appear that he is a dumb and ignorant farmer.</p>
