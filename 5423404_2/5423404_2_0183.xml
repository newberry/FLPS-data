   </div>

   <p>It is not only possible, but rather probable, that President Wilson has failed in his noble aims, that his own elevated ideals show themselves to be impracticable. He does not wish to permit himself to be satisfied with a league for peace such as has been proposed in this country by ex-President Taft, and a few others with him of like mind. We take it for granted that such a league for peace is nothing more than a balance of power of the old kind, though, instead of calling itself a "holy alliance," it has adopted the more appealing and popular name: "The Peace Society of Nations." In Taft's league for peace, as in the "holy alliance," the concepts of peace and freedom are hypocritical. Peace would depend upon dictatorial language, and freedom limited by prescriptions of the <pb facs="5423404_2_0184.jpg" n="2"/>great for the little. Then, it is much better to speak freely, and decline as Clemenceau did in his well-known December speech. That he has all France behind him, is known to all who know human nature, and especially the character of the French people. Surely, we Americans would not differ on the subject if our own country had been attacked and pillaged, and had lost millions of her strongest sons. We would then, most likely, not worry so much about world peace and world bliss, as about our own security from new adventures of the same sort.</p>
