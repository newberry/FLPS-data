   <p>The Death Toll in Chicago through Railway crossing accidents was unusually large during the year of 1889. Not less than Two-hundred fifty persons lost their lives in this manner - fifty more than during the previous year. In one day alone, on Tuesday of last week, seven people were killed at railroad crossings, four within the City limits and three, the Revell family, in Wilmette. All these murders, for they can hardly be called anything else, must primarily be laid at the doorsteps of the railroads and secondarily upon the city administration</p>
   <p>It is expressly provided for in the City's ordinances that the railway companies must install, or cause to have installed, safety gates at all crossings and provide a watchman at all such places. They are further required to provide all other pre-cautionary measures for the safe guarding of lives for all, who in their daily <pb facs="5423404_2_0463.jpg" n="2"/>pursuits have to cross the tracks. But these laws have been and still remain a dead letter on the statute books and the railroads no doubt will be permitted to add victim after victim to their list and without fear of punishment to increase the already horribly large number of deaths because of negligence and indifference on their part.</p>
