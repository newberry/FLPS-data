   <p>One of our best known and most highly esteemed members of our Chicago Swedish colony, Frank J. Lindsten, passed away Tuesday, October 16, 1906, at his home at 1700 Wellington Avenue. Pneumonia caused his death.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lindsten was born June 7, 1846 in Linderas, Kronobergs Lan, Sweden. He was for many years a member of the well-known clothing dealers, The Lindsten Clothing Company, 1715 North Clark Street. In 1896-97, he served as the supervisor in the Town of Lake, and from 1898 to 1900 he was a county commissioner of Cook County.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lindsten's funeral was very impressive. Reverend Gottfried Nelson, of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lake View, preached an unusually stirring sermon. Over seventy carriages followed the remains to the Graceland cemetery. Three carriages were filled with flowers, tokens of real respect.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0986.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We express the deep sympathy of the entire Swedish colony for the six bereaved children, two sons and four daughters. Their father will be sadly missed in church and lodge circles throughout Chicago.</p>
