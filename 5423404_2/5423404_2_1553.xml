   <p>Ullie Akerstrom, a Swedish girl, will make her first appearance here in Chicago at the McVickers Theater tonight. She was born here in Chicago. She is very talented, and while still quite young, made several appearances here as an amateur. Her style was original, and as a dilettante she was an attraction. She made her first professional appearance at the Boston Theater of Boston during a twenty-six week engagement. Her next engagement was in New York, where the Gotham critics praised her highly. They said, "She is the most gracious dancer New York has seen in many years."</p>
   <p>She will appear here in a new Musical Comedy written by herself. The title of the comedy is "Annette, the Dancing Girl."</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians are proud of their daughter.</p>
