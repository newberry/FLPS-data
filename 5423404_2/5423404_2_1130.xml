   <p>A Swedish cemetery has been added to the long list of cemeteries in Chicago. Last week's newspapers carried announcements to that effect. Some keen and energetic Swedes have formed a corporation carrying the name, "Chicago Cemetery Association," and under this name have acquired a stretch of land of 160 acres, and there developed a cemetery which, in regard to beauty, compares favorably with any of the others in the city. The president of the company is the prominent contractor and builder, Mr. E. P. Strandberg, and the secretary is Mr. N. A. Nelson, the able secretary of the building and loan association of the Svea. The directors of the Cemetery Association invited us to visit the new burial place on Memorial day, and we went. The tour took us in southwesterly direction, past St. Maria, Greenwood, Mt. Olivet, <pb facs="5423404_2_1131.jpg" n="2"/>and Mt. Hope graveyards. Scarcely more than a stone's throw from the latter, Oak Hill cemetery is located, the cemetery of the Swedes. The attractive entrance gate is located at the corner of 111 Street and Kedzie Avenue.</p>
   <p>In spite of the cold and rainy weather, a large number of Swedes came to inspect the burial place, and many of them came to select a little green spot on which to rest in peace when death, some day, shall have pressed his icy hand upon their brow. A more beautiful place for the last rest can hardly be imagined. It is not one of those level ground cemeteries where both eye and mind become weary, where nature itself seems to be longing for rest. At Oak Hill, the ground consists of little hills and valleys, a variety in the landscape which lends life to this resting place dedicated to the dead. Sheltered they lie there, the little hills, beneath the spreading branches <pb facs="5423404_2_1132.jpg" n="3"/>of big trees, and they were richly decorated with flowers last Saturday. Attractive grave places appear, final resting places for some one's relatives; and high above all of them rises the monument designating the tomb of Mr. E. P. Strandberg's family..... The remains of some hundred Swedes have already been placed under the green turfs of the cemetery, and several thousand Swedes have secured their burial places there.</p>
   <p>In the near future, a crematory is to be erected at Oak Hill cemetery so that those who desire it may have remains cremated.</p>
   <p>Svenska Nyheter wishes success to those who have started this new undertaking.</p>
