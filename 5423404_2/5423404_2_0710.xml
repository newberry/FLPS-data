   <p>One of the most distinguished doctors of Swedish ancestry in Chicago, Albert Theodore Lundgren, of 5333 North Clark Street, is the subject of this article.</p>
   <p>He was born in Woodhull, Illinois, the son of S. J. Lundgren, on August 5, 1877, and grew up on a farm outside of that town.</p>
   <p>After having gone through the public schools at home he went to Knox College, from which he graduated in 1901 with the bachelor of science degree. He then entered Rush Medical College, and obtained his degree in medicine in 1907. Later on we find him on the staff of Lake View Hospital, and as an instructor in surgical pathology in the Graduate School of Medicine. In recent years he <pb facs="5423404_2_0712.jpg" n="2"/>has been conducting a private practice,sharing offices with Dr. Edward H. Ochsner.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lundgren is a member of several professional organizations, such as the American Medical Association, the Illinois Medical Society, the Chicago Medical Society, and the Phi Rho Sigma Medical Fraternity. He also belongs to the Svithiod and Viking orders, both Swedish organizations, and to the Edgewater Free Mason Lodge. He has been examining physician for the Verdandi Lodge for many years, and worships in the Ebenezer Swedish Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>In 1912 he married Miss Beda Marie Munson of Vadstena, Sweden. <!-- 5423404_2_0711 omitted, duplicate of 5423404_2_0712 --></p>
