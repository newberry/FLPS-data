<title level="a">SWEDISH CHORAL CLUB'S EXCURSION TO SWEDEN</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Swedish Choral Club will leave Chicago on May 10 to begin on its trip to Sweden. They will stop first at Jamestown, New York, where they will give a concert. From there they will go to New York City where arrangements have been made for them to give a concert in Carnegie Hall on May 13. On May 15, they will start their journey across the ocean. The number of concerts in Sweden, and the festivities to be arranged at different places in honor of the Chorus, we shall take up later. For the present we wish but to point out that the great Chicago spring concert of the Chorus is set for March 24, at Orchestra Hall, when the entire musical program will be sung in Swedish. In other words, this means that the public may first hear Edgar A. Nelson's new arrangement of the poem "Helsning Till Sverige" (Greetings to Sweden.) which, when first composed, was published in this as well as in other Swedish-American newspapers, and for which the author of the poem, Ernst Bernstrom (Jack Freelance) of Salt Lake City, received a prize. Following <pb facs="5423404_2_1620.jpg" n="2"/>this will be a group of songs by the chorus in Latin. There will also be offered a group of solos by Gustaf Holmquist, who will be the male soloist during the excursion to Sweden. The fourth section consists of five Swedish compositions which will be presented by the Chorus. Following this, the women in the Chorus will present a group of Scandinavian songs, and the men will do likewise. In addition, the following group of solos will be presented: "The Parting Kiss," Pinsuti; "Round the Good Father's Door," Archanglesky; "Deep River," Burleigh; "You Stole My Love," Mac Farren; "Listen to the Lambs," Neft; "The De'ils Awa'," Delamarter; "Union and Liberty," Horatio Parker.</p>
   <p>It is evident that this program differs significantly from those one has been accustomed to hearing from the Swedish Choral Club in the past.</p>
