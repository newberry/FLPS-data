   <p>The dearly-bought experiences of the war years have brought closer together all those who look upon war as a scourge of humanity, and who have dedicated their best efforts to the cause of peace among nations. Women are taking a very active part in bringing about a friendly understanding among the peoples of the world, and changing hate propaganda into constructive co-operation for mutual benefit. If only a fraction of the sums that are being spent for destructive and death-dealing war equipment could be diverted into channels leading towards universal peace and good will, our dreams of a happier human race and fraternity among men would be much closer to realization. </p>
   <p>The Intermational Women's League for Peace and Freedom will convene in Vienna next July 10-16 for its third World Congress, and this event may well prove a great boost for the cause of peace. In spite of difficult economic conditions, <pb facs="5423404_2_0164.jpg" n="2"/>almost every nation in the world will be represented at this Congress. Vienna was selected as the most desirable place in which to hold it because of the low rate of exchange of Austrian money, which eases the financial strain on delegates from many European countries.</p>
   <p>The famous American peace advocate, Jane Addams, who is president of the League, will preside over the Congress, to which every country is entitled to send twenty delegates.</p>
   <p>The agenda of the Congress has not yet been announced, but it is likely that such questions as education as a means of promoting world peace, women and international problems,The League of Nations, how to counteract war propaganda, and protection of the rights of minorities, will be discussed.</p>
   <p>When the Congress is over, a two weeks' course dealing with international problems will be given. Both men and women are invited to attend. Emphasis will be placed on ways and means of promoting world peace.</p>
