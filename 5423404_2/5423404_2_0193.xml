<title level="a">THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN CAMPAIGN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Swedish Committee for the Fourth Liberty Loan Campaign was organized at a meeting Tuesday, Sept. 24, at the Sherman Hotel. With the exception of two members, the previous committee was re-elected.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry S. Henschen is again chairman of the district. Charles J. Stromberg is again director for Cook County, Pastor Joshua Oden is the new secretary, and Mr. William Larson was elected publicity manager. Mr. Felix J. Streyckmans, Chief of the Foreign Language Division within the district, made a speech and explained in detail the system under which the Liberty Bonds would be sold this time. He also appealed to those present to discuss and agree upon a special campaign among the Swedes in the city, so that due credit will be given the Swedish Division when purchases are made. After considerable deliberation by leaders from the many Swedish societies, it was decided to urge our countrymen who subscribe to mark each subscription blank with the words "Swedish Division", in order that the Swedish purchases can be properly credited and correctly accounted.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0194.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Pastors, representatives of the press and societies present, were appealed to, to give their full support to this campaign. To discuss these ideas further, a meeting was called for Sept. 29, at the Sherman Hotel, to which all members of the Swedish committee would be invited. (This is the largest Swedish Committee that ever existed in Chicago.)</p>
   <p>The meeting Sunday, Sept. 29,was well attended. It was opened by Chas. J. Stromberg, who then requested Mr. Henry S. Henschen, the district chairman, to conduct the meeting. It was begun with the singing of "America." Mr. Henschen spoke at length on the purpose of these meetings, and then called upon several of our best speakers to say a few words about the significance of the Liberty Loans, etc. Mr. Carl R. Chindblom and Mr. George E. Q. Johnson gave excellent talks. These were followed by several shorter speeches by C. S. Peterson. Pastor E. Johnson, Pastor Joshua Oden, Mrs. Othilia Myhrman, Mr. John Sandgren, and others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0195.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A motion was made and passed to organize a giant Swedish demonstration to boost the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive. The chairman Mr. Hensehen immediately set the Machinery in motion. He first announced the surprising news that he had succeeded in securing Mr. Ira Nelson Morris, United States Minister to Sweden as the main speaker. This announcement created much enthusiasm, particularly when he pointed out that Minister Morris had subscribed $300,000. for the Loan. A few committees for the festival were then appointed. The president of the Swedish Singers' League of Chicago, Mr. Hjalmar Lundsuist, was given the honor of securing singers for the evening. Mr. O. Myhrman and Mrs. William Larson were requested to get in touch with all Swedish mothers of soldiers and to have them present at the festival where they would be honored. This festival, which was held at the Municipal Pier last year, with admission free, will be held at Orchestr Hall, Sunday, Oct. 13 at 3 P.M. this year.</p>
   <p>The following proclamation about this affair was sent to our paper by Mrs. O. Myhrman:</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0196.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Under the auspices of the Chicago All-Swedish Church Societies and Organizations, with Henry S. Henschen as chairman and Pastor Joshua Oden as secretary, a grand patriotic festival will be given Sunday, Oct. 13, at 3 P.M., in Orchestra Hall, for the purpose of honoring our young men in the United States' war service, and to express our gratification over the victories already won, and furthermore, to spur on the interest for a stronger support of our government's war program.</p>
   <p>"U.S. Minister to Sweden, Mr. Ira Nelson Morris, will be the main speaker of the evening, and will bring fresh greetings and information, not only from the land of our fathers but also from the war front. The best talent in the fields of song and music will assist. A special invitation is extended to all Swedish women who have relatives in the Army or Navy service, to come and receive reserved seats. Everyone who reads this proclamation and knows that she has a relative in the war service, is requested to send in her name and address by mail or telephone at once, so the committee <pb facs="5423404_2_0197.jpg" n="5"/>will have time to send an honorary badge, which will entitle the holder to a reserved seat.</p>
   <p>"The time is short, so please write or telephone Mrs. O. Myhrman, today, 143 N. Dearborn St., Telephone, Central 2686."</p>
   <p>Further announcements regarding this loyalty demonstration will be found in the next issue of this paper.</p>
