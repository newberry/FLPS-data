   <p>As previously reported, our countryman, Thomas Hall, is among the many Swedish-Americans who are represented at the Chicago artists' annual exhibit at the Art Institute, which opened January 26 and will close March 3.</p>
   <p>Hall's canvas, "The Old Homestead," is one of his best works, and testifies to his progress during the last few years. He has been a consistent exhibitor, and has attracted much attention at the annual art shows in the Swedish Club. A number of his paintings have also been exhibited in Sweden.</p>
