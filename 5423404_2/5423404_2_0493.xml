   <p>According to a dispatch from Washington, there are no less than seventy thousand women on Uncle Sam's pay roll. Many of them are holding positions of high responsibility, and their record is good. During the 1920 campaign, Harding promised that if he were elected his administration would use the services of the nation's women, and the large number of them now employed by the Government shows that the President has kept his word.</p>
   <p>Among the women who hold important offices in the Government service may be mentioned Mrs. Helen H. Gardener, who is Civil Service Commissioner; Grace Abbott, Chief of the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor; Mary Anderson, chief of the Women's Bureau of the same department, and Agnes L. Peterson, her assistant. Mary Anderson came here from Sweden. She started in as a maid, and her career is a striking example of the opportunities <pb facs="5423404_2_0494.jpg" n="2"/>for achievement which this country offers to capable men and women, even though they be of foreign birth.</p>
   <p>As assistant attorney general, charged with supervising the enforcement of the prohibition law, Mrs. Mabel Walker Wildebrandt has as tough a job as any Federal office holder, and she has proved that she is big enough for it. Mrs. Mabel Reinecke is collector of internal revenue in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>During its last session, Congress adopted a law dealing with Government employees which provides that the wage scale shall be based on merit and not on sex. This means that women are given equality with men as far as wages are concerned. And their prospects in the Government service will continue to improve, and their progress will match their growing influence elsewhere in our society.</p>
