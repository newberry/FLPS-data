  <body>
   <p>The annual exhibit by Swedish-American painters and sculptors opened last Saturday in the Swedish Club, 1258 North La Salle Street. In spite of the bad weather, a large number of people were present at the opening, and one got the impression that interest in this event is on the increase among the city's Swedes.</p>
   <p>This year's exhibit is somewhat larger than the exhibits of previous years. There are 111 paintings and 6 sculptures, representing 50 artists. We shall now mention some of them in alphabetical order.</p>
   <p>Gotthilf Ahlman exhibits two canvases. "Beginning of the Day, Glacier Park," and "Vera," a portrait. The landscape is the better of the two, and the motif is well chosen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1420.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Charles J. Bergstrom: "Autumn along Fox River" and "Summer," both of which have artistic merit and show excellent technique.</p>
   <p>Nels Dahlstrom: "The Old Dancing Ground, Halland," which is done in modern style and is not without merit.</p>
   <p>Ernest Fredericks: "Sentinels of the Hills," "Solitude of Winter," and "In the Grip of Winter." The first mentioned is the best.</p>
   <p>Thomas Hall: Two oil paintings and three aquarelles. The former are of the same high quality as Hall's previous work, but the latter are the more remarkable and rank among the outstanding works in the entire exhibit. We predict that this artist will henceforth find his greatest success as an aquarelle painter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1421.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The marine painter Charles E. Hallberg: "The Light Cloud," "From the Deck of the Majestic," "Homeward Bound," "Misty Morning on Lake Michigan," "The Mighty Wave," and "Morning after the Storm". All six of these represent Hallberg at his best. His son, Ben. Hallberg, exhibits a summer landscape, "Early Moonlight".</p>
   <p>"Alfred Jansson: This artist has previously been noted for his winter landscapes, but is now going in for greater variation in motifs. Sometime ago, he visited in Sweden, and his current exhibit consists of motifs from that country. Particularly noteworthy are his "Spring, Sweden," and "Summer, Sweden." In "Autumn, Sweden," he has, we think, permitted the yellow color to become too predominant.</p>
   <p>Axel Linus: Well known for his paintings as well as for his drawings. He is represented by three portraits and one still life, all of which are <pb facs="5423404_2_1422.jpg" n="4"/>very well done. His strength lies in his liking for variation and for surprise.</p>
   <p>Leon Lundmark, another marine painter: Five canvases, four of which are very good; the fifth, "Fog, Cape Elizabeth," is altogether too dark.</p>
   <p>The portrait painter Arvid Nyholm is represented by four canvases: three portraits and a landscape, "The Giant Peppertree," all four of which are typical of this painter's fine artistic sense and excellent technique.</p>
   <p>All the exhibitors mentioned above are Chicagoans, and we shall make brief mention of the others who make their homes in this city.</p>
   <p>Enoch Linden: A landscape with motif from Edgebrook.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1423.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>P. W. Nelson: A still life which is remarkable for its finesse of details and which shows great technical skill.</p>
   <p>Carl N. Runnstrom: "Landscape" and "Character Study". The former is not bad, but the protrait is too strongly drawn.</p>
   <p>Hal. Swanson: A newcomer to this annual exhibit. His two aquarelles, both of them with motifs from Chicago, are held in very dark tones. Nice work.</p>
   <p>Carl E. Wallin: A portrait, "Bernhardina," and two landscapes, "Sunset" and "Evening". The latter is very good.</p>
   <p>Of the four sculptors represented at the exhibit, Agnes V. Fromen and Carl M. Linner are from Chicago. Miss Fromen exhibits a marble bust of <pb facs="5423404_2_1424.jpg" n="6"/>Mrs. Charles S. Peterson, the model for a fountain which is to be placed in front of the Swedish Home for the Aged in Evanston. She also has another piece, which is called "Baby Marie".</p>
   <p>At the opening of the exhibit, the Swedish consul, Carl O. De Dardel, made a brief speech in which he paid tribute to Swedish art, and declared that it is the duty of Swedish-Americans to take an interest in and to encourage the artistic efforts of their countrymen. Charles S. Peterson also addressed the audience, and reviewed the history of this annual event. Sylvia Hallberg-Johnson spoke on the significance of a Swedish-American art exhibit such as this, and urged her audience to give the struggling artists all possible support. The ladies of the Club served coffee later on.</p>
   <p>The selecting jury for this year's exhibit consisted of Rudolph Ingerle, Louis Grell, Charles Schroeder, Alfred Jansson, and Arvid Nyholm. The <pb facs="5423404_2_1425.jpg" n="7"/>first three will also act as the prize jury.</p>
   <p>Among the prizes are: first prize among oil paintings, one hundred dollars, donated by the State Bank of Chicago; second prize, fifty dollars, donated by M. N. Gustafson; for the best sculpture, fifty dollars, donated by the Union Bank of Chicago; for the best aquarelle, twenty-five dollars, donated by H. Hedberg. The names of the prize winners will be announced next Sunday night, which is the closing night.</p>
