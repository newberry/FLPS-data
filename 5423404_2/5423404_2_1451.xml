   <p>The first of the six fresco paintings, which eventually will decorate the Swedish Club's festival hall, and convert this into a "Swedish-American Hall of Fame," is ready and in its place. It represents the "Swedish Building at the World's Fair" in Chicago 1893, and was painted by the artist Hugo von Hofsten. The work is very well executed and a credit to its creator. No doubt the quarters will win renown, when all the paintings are in their respective places. As mentioned before by us, these art works will depict scenes from Swedish-American history and are as follows: "The Swedes Land in Delaware," by Christian von Schneidau; "Gloria Dei Church," (The old Swedish Church in Philadelphia) by Professor Olaf Grafstrom, Rock Island, Ill.; "John Morton Signing the Declaration of Independence," by Arvid Nyholm; "The Bishop Hill Colony Being Founded," by Alfred Jansson; "The Battle <pb facs="5423404_2_1452.jpg" n="2"/>Between the Monitor and the Merrimac," by Henry Reuterdahl. The sixth art work accepted is the one just completed by von Hofsten.</p>
   <p>Thus, the last became the first.</p>
