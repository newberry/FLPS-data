<title level="a">NOTED SWEDISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS MAN AND INVENTOR</title>

   <p>It was announced last Wednesday that the Lindstrom-Smith Company had sold its plant, located at 3212-14 West Lake Street, to the National Stamping and Electric Works for $230,000. The company has enjoyed a fine reputation in industrial circles, chiefly on account of the many important inventions made by one of its owners, our countryman, Carl O. Lindstrom.</p>
   <p>Carl Lindstrom was born in Malmo, Sweden, in 1865, and came to America at the age of sixteen. After working for some time at various jobs, he opened a printing shop and bookstore in 1884.</p>
   <p>From 1888 to 1903 he was engaged in the real-estate business as a broker, and had much to do with the development of the suburb of Berwyn.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0876.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But it is as an inventor and as a manufacturer of electrical instruments that Mr. Lindstrom is best known. Many of the devices which he has invented, such as the White Cross Electric Vibrator, are widely used throughout the country.</p>
