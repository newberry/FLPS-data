   <p>The State Bank of Chicago has sent the following announcement to all its customers:</p>
   <p>"The State Bank of Chicago is known as a Scandinavian bank, and is proud of such a designation. About thirty per cent of our business is done with men and women of Swedish, Norwegian and Danish extraction, and it is especially to these customers and friends that we address this announcement. </p>
   <p>"Our bank was founded about fifty years ago by two Scandinavians, [H. A.] Haugan [Norwegian] and [John R.] Lindgren, and when the merger with the Foreman National Bank goes into effect it will retain its identity, and become an important partner in the union of two institutions both of which can look back on years of sound progress.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0818.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The new and larger bank which will result from this merger will be known as the Foreman-State National Bank. Up-to-date quarters together with the most modern methods of service will ensure continued progress under the leadership of the same men who in the past have been in charge of the activities of the two banks.</p>
   <p>"You will find in the new institution everything that you have appreciated in the past. The same department heads who are serving you now will be at your service in the new bank. They will be just as eager as before to help you solve your financial problems."</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Albert I. Appleton,</p>
