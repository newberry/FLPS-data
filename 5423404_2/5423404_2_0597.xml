   <p>This week the National Farm Land Congress is holding its annual convention in Chicago, and this organization is the most dependable source of information for land seekers who are looking for expert advice regarding opportunities and conditions in the various parts of the country.</p>
   <p>On some truck farms, located near large cities, the value of fruits and vegetables raised, amounts to from five hundred to one thousand dollars per acre. When these farms are taken over by subdividers, the owners move to other localities, but it has been demonstrated that good money may be made even on high-priced land.</p>
   <p>In many of the younger states there are still millions of acres of good <pb facs="5423404_2_0598.jpg" n="2"/>farm land that sells for from ten to forty dollars per acre, and in dry areas, where irrigation guarantees excellent crops, fine land can be had for fifty dollars per acre.</p>
   <p>Independence and even prosperity awaits the man who actually cultivates the land. The person who is chiefly interested in its cash market value is no real farmer. But dependable and impartial information is necessary for the person who is considering buying a farm. The National Farm Land Congress gives it free of charge, and its activities are of great importance to the country.</p>
