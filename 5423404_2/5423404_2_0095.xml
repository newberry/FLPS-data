   <p>When seven councilmen and a couple of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were recently accused of graft of the most revolting kind, the city's Mayor, who is known as a progressive man, friendly to reform, complained that the case was given too much publicity. "The less said about it, the better," he declared; "what is the use of creating a big scandal?"</p>
   <p>This is the same old song that we have heard as long as we can remember. "This is strictly our city's own affair; the rest of the country has nothing to do with it," was the defiant cry heard from St. Louis, when the corruption existing in that city was exposed. In San Francisco, when a number of high city officials were found to be criminals, valuable advertising <pb facs="5423404_2_0096.jpg" n="2"/>was taken from those newspapers which published details of the odorous affair on the grounds that the case was the concern of the courts, not of the public.</p>
   <p>The same attitude was taken in Philadelphia: "We will handle this affair ourselves, the rest of the country had better keep out."</p>
   <p>When the life insurance scandal broke open in New York, the officers of the companies involved insisted that the newspapers play it down. "Unfavorable publicity will cause our stock to tumble," they argued, "and we ourselves will do the house-cleaning within the companies."</p>
   <p>In other words, the guilty ones wanted to be their own judges.</p>
   <p>"It hurts the city's reputation"; it is bad for business"; "It cause unwarranted suspicions." These are among the more common arguments in favor <pb facs="5423404_2_0097.jpg" n="3"/>of secrecy concerning graft and other scandalous behaviour among persons in public office, and in other positions of trust. This may be true enough, but the arguments are, nevertheless, not valid. In many cases they are brought forth by individuals who themselves have plenty to hide, or from their accomplices.</p>
   <p>There is also another side to this situation which has not been sufficiently emphasized. Graft cannot exist in any public department for a long period of time without the knowledge and silent sanction of the public. And a community which permits such a condition to prevail, deserves the unpleasant consequences of publicity, no matter how much it hurts.</p>
   <p>In many instances citizens are more worried about the reputation of their city or community than they are about the fact that graft has become a common practice in their locality. To such people unfavorable publicity is severe punishment. It is, of course, entirely wrong to insist that exposures of this kind do not concern the rest of the country; for a corrupt city is, so to speak, a focus <pb facs="5423404_2_0098.jpg" n="4"/>of infection; a potential danger to the entire nation.</p>
   <p>Whenever a public scandal, of the type discussed, breaks, and one hears, "Let us alone, we will handle this ourselves," one should become suspicious; chances are that a thorough investigation is indicated.</p>
