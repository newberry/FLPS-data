   <p>Today we wish to introduce to our readers a prominent architect, who has made the plans for many fine buildings both inside and outside of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Anders Gustaf Lund was born on the farm Svenserud in Olme parish, Vermland, Sweden, July 20, 1857. His father was a farmer, and his uncle, who later became city engineer for the city of Abo, frequently visited the farm and enjoyed taking a hand in the education of young Anders, who early displayed a talent for drawing, a talent which his uncle, himself an accomplished draftsman, naturally encouraged.</p>
   <p>When the uncle left for Finland, young Lund continued his architectural studies at the Technical Institute of Stockholm, from which he graduated with honors.</p>
   <p>In April 1882 he caught the "America fever" and embarked for the promised land. He made his home in Chicago, and went through his apprenticeship as <pb facs="5423404_2_0776.jpg" n="2"/>a construction carpenter, working for P. A. Westberg of Englewood for three years. Later he worked in various architects' offices, and was for a number of years employed as a foreman in the drafting department of the architectural firm of Jules De Hovarth.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lund made Chicago his permanent home. In 1890 he married Miss Ida Charlotta Lundgren, from Helsingborg, and the union has been blessed with three children--two girls and a boy.</p>
   <p>One year before the opening of the World's Fair, he established his own business as an architect with offices on 63rd Street in Englewood. In his profession he has been both progressive and successful, and has earned fame as well as money. During the winter the family resides at the home located at 6323 Parnell Avenue, but moves to its beautiful villa in Palos Park, some twenty miles from Chicago, for the summer.</p>
   <p>We will not list here all the residences and other buildings for which Mr. Lund has delivered the plans; but here are some of them: The bank building, <pb facs="5423404_2_0777.jpg" n="3"/>owned by Edward H. Ericson &amp; Co., at 6255 Wentworth Avenue; the business and apartment building on the northeast corner of 63rd and Halsted Streets; a similar structure at 59th and Halsted Streets; and a number of apartment buildings and residential hotels scattered all over the South Side.</p>
   <p>In addition he has planned and made the drawings for several churches. The Lutheran Church of Salemsburg, Saline County, Kansas; the Methodist Church at 66th Court and Normal Avenue; the Methodist Church at 22nd Street and Irving Avenue, and the new Lutheran Church in Cheltenham.</p>
   <p>The family attends the Swedish Lutheran Church at 66th and Sangamon Streets and Mr. Lund is a member of the Englewood Commandery of the Knight Templars, the Medinah Shrine, and the Scandinavian Engineering Society.</p>
   <p>Politically he is a "dyed in the wool" Republican, and socially a genuine gentleman with many friends.</p>
