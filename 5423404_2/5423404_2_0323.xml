   <p>When the highest court of the land recently ruled that the law providing for minimum wages for women and minors in the District of Columbia was unconstitutional, it practically blacklisted any further attempts at legislation along this line. The efforts which Congress has made from time to time to regulate the employment of minors in industry have, without exception, met a similar fate. Willingly or unwillingly, the Court has in these cases felt obliged to act as errand boy for the "interests".</p>
   <p>The result of the Supreme Court's latest ruling in regard to minimum wages is likely to be a reduction in the hourly pay of more than a million and a half self-supporting women in the fourteen states that have adopted legislation providing for minimum wages for women workers. Justice Sutherland and his four <pb facs="5423404_2_0324.jpg" n="2"/>colleagues declared in their majority opinion that "in principle, one cannot distinguish between the sale of labor and the sale of merchandise". With these words, the learned jurists reveal their own complete lack of a humanitarian point of view.</p>
   <p>The distinguished lawyer, Clarence Darrow, has declared that this decision of the Supreme Court has stripped the workers of their only weapon other than the strike. Their only salvation now lies in the strength of their organizations. If they cannot obtain their rights through legislation, they will have to take them without legislation.</p>
