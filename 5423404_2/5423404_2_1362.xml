   <p>Several Swedish-American artists took part in the art exhibit which was held by the Chicago Society of Artists, in the Midland Club, April 5-19, and the works of most of them were favorably mentioned by critics.</p>
   <p>Among the sculptors we noted Carl Halsthammar. His works were in the humorous vein, and attracted deserved attention, especially the piece "Deuces Wild". Rudy Renzius exhibited some remarkable pieces in pressed tin. One of them, "Introspection," is, we think, the best we have seen from his hand. His "Judith" is also a fine piece of work.</p>
   <p>Gustaf Dahlstrom's "Snowstorm" stood out among the paintings, as did Thomas Hall's "Old Pier, Provincetown" among the aquarelles. Fred Remahl was represented by one of his funny doll pictures, "Dancing Dolls," which is very good.</p>
