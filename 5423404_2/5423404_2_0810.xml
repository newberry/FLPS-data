<title level="a">BROR DAHLBERG HEADS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST SUGAR MANUFACTURING COMPANY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last week it was reported that the Southern Sugar Company, which maintains headquarters in Chicago, had started production from last year's crop at the firm's large plants in Clewiston, Florida, which now consume 4,000 tons of raw material daily, as compared to 1,500 tons the previous season.The head of the company is our well-known countryman, Bror Dahlberg, who several years ago attracted much attention in industrial circles by his invention of Celotex, a building material, which is produced from corn stalks.</p>
   <p>He organized the Southern Sugar Company in order to extract the sugar from the cornstalks. The Company now owns large areas of land in Florida, and sugar manufacturing plants which already are the largest of their kind in the country, and which will be further expanded. Dahlberg has just <pb facs="5423404_2_0811.jpg" n="2"/>announced that during the next few years his company's sugar production will amount to 450,000 tons annually.</p>
