   <p>At the graphic arts exhibit, which the printing industry recently held in the Coliseum, many very interesting things were to be seen; among them was the folding machine manufactured by the Anderson High Speed Folder Company, of Chicago. This machine has attracted much attention, and has been highly lauded by experts. It was invented by C. F. Anderson, the founder and present head of the firm. We have selected this able Swedish-American inventor and businessman as the subject of this week's foreground article.</p>
   <p>Carl F. Anderson was born in Halmstad, Sweden, January 17, 1866, and his mother and a brother are still living in that city. He came to America <pb facs="5423404_2_0880.jpg" n="2"/>in 1886 and worked for some time in Iowa as a section hand on the Rock Island Railroad. That he was an unusual fellow is shown by the fact that after having worked for this outfit for fifteen months he became an engineer. Even though he was doing well, he quit, and some time later we find him in Des Moines, Iowa, where he obtained employment as a machinist with the Dexter Folder Company. He had learned the trade in Sweden, and within a short time he was made shop foreman. When the firm moved to New York in 1890, Anderson went along, and was appointed production manager. At the same time, he obtained a financial interest in the firm. Nine years later, he resigned his position to establish his own business in Chicago. He had invented a folding machine, and began to manufacture it here, under the name of the Anderson High Speed Folder. The machine found a ready market, and the business has grown from year to year, until it is now well known from coast to coast. It is worth noting that no man has ever been laid off by the firm on account of business being slack. Even in these difficult times production is going on as usual. Last fall, the plant and office were moved to the new building at 3225 Calumet Avenue, <pb facs="5423404_2_0881.jpg" n="3"/>which was constructed at a cost of $35,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson belongs to the People's Liberal Church and is a member of the Order of Odd Fellows, the Knight Templars, and the Mystic Shrine. He is also a 32nd degree Mason. In 1890 he married Carrie Erickson of Madrid, Iowa, and they have three children. The family lives at 6840 Union Avenue.</p>
