<title level="a">THE COURTS VERSUS THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The fight for the eight-hour working day is being waged all over the civilized world with varying degrees of success. In Europe as well as in America the shortsighted employers are against it, while the farsighted, progressive employers are for it. In this country the new system has gained favor among all classes, and in the building industry and a few others the eight-hour working day has been definitely established.</p>
   <p>It has been hoped that the United States would be the first country to make the eight-hour day compulsory through legislation, and it is probably for this reason that some states already have passed legislation in favor of it.</p>
   <p>However, the judges of the country who wield great power are looming as a <pb facs="5423404_2_0412.jpg" n="2"/>serious obstacle to such action, and behind them, according to their own declarations, stands the Constitution of the United States. A few days ago Judge White, of the New York State Supreme Court, stated that it is against the Constitution to limit the working day to eight hours.</p>
   <p>We do not know on which paragraph of the Constitution Judge White bases this opinion, but his ruling is decisive for the State of New York until overruled by the highest tribunal of the country, the United States Supreme Court. The powers vested in the latter are almost unlimited. Just as the Supreme Court of a State may declare void a law passed by the legislature, so the highest court of the land may nullify a decision made by the United States Congress.</p>
   <p>If the Constitution really does contain a paragraph which makes it unlawful to institute the eight-hour working day, then it is high time that it be changed, be it ever so holy, and readjusted to fit the requirements of our times.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0413.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Not only can the judges, by a doubtful interpretation of a constitutional paragraph, prevent a state from enforcing highly desirable laws, but they can also interfere with the individual's right to manage his own affairs. They have the power, or maybe they only assume it, to prevent the worker and the employer from agreeing on an eight-hour working day.</p>
   <p>In Europe, where legislative bodies, whose members are elected by the people and are superior to appointed officials, the state has taken the lead in promoting progressive legislation. Thus the fight for an eight-hour working day has become a political issue of the highest magnitude, affecting as it does both the physical and spiritual well-being of a large part of the population.</p>
   <p>We agree with the great English manufacturer and Socialist, Rober Owen, who about sixty years ago, when asked to give some reasons why an eight-hour working day was so desirable, gave this answer:</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0414.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Because it is the longest time a man can work efficiently, and at the same time maintain his physical and mental health and contentment; that is, if we consider the average, and grant that the weak has as much right as the strong.</p>
   <p>"Because modern chemical and mechanical inventions make a longer working day unnecessary.</p>
   <p>"Because no one has the right to demand more work of another than is necessary for the maintenance of society.</p>
   <p>"Because it is to the best interests of everyone that all men and women be permitted to lead an existence worthy of human beings."</p>
   <p>This declaration is as true today as it was sixty years ago, and it certainly aught to be endoresed by employers of our times who have acquired such a great share of the benefits, which modern science and invention have given to the world.</p>
