   <p>Time and again we hear the complaint that the courts in our country are losing the respect of the people, or in other words, they are losing the confidence of their fellow citizens. Inquiry has been made of the judges as to the cause of this, and the men of the law have placed the blame on the press. Inquiry has been made of the representatives of the press, and they reply unanimously that the fault is with the judges.</p>
   <p>It is true that off and on the press has criticized judges' decisions sharply, and, in doing so, has perhaps imbued the people with the notion that our judges are but men like the rest of us, and that they are no more <pb facs="5423404_2_0123.jpg" n="2"/>the fountains of all wisdom. But when the press has criticized the judges, they have ever supported the criticism with incontrovertible proofs.</p>
   <p>How can anybody expect a man who has been wronged by a judge in his court to retain respect for the decisions delivered by such a judge?</p>
   <p>It is evident that the voters must lose confidence in a court where the judge, at the behest of some money supplied individuals, will issue unreasonable injunctions against workers on strike. Equally evident it is that if a judge leaves his court in order to stump during the heat of political campaigns for some candidate for office, such action will not aid in creating or maintaining respect for such a judge.</p>
   <p>We have seen judges permitting boys seven years old to determine the sentence <pb facs="5423404_2_0124.jpg" n="3"/>of men who had injured them, and the judge has permitted the sentence by the boy to stand.</p>
   <p>We have heard judges emit lines of vituperation against citizens, simply because the latter did not agree with His Honor. We have heard judges pronounce sentences which higher courts have found utterly partisan or indicative of too great incompetence. We have seen judges sentenced for having accepted bribes. We have seen judges favoring the rich and powerful, while sentencing the poor to years in prison for some inconsequential break.</p>
   <p>And in spite of all this, these upholders of the law demand that the people show respect for court and the opinions of the judge! There are judges who dutifully execute their tasks. To them, the people look with confidence; to their decisions, the people willingly bow; they are respected and <pb facs="5423404_2_0125.jpg" n="4"/>honored by the people. But the majority of the judges seem to consider themselves in the role of gods after first having been elevated to the chair of the judge, and these are the ones who are likely to lose the confidence and goodwill of the citizens.</p>
