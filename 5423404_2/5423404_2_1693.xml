   <p>February 22 was celebrated in the St Ansgar (Swedish) church on Sedgwick Street by presenting several of the most talented artists in Chicago's Swedish colony. Gustaf Holmquist, America's greatest Swedish baritone, opened the program with "Kung Heimer och liten Aslog" (King Heimer and little Aslog). The next number was Allitsen's "The Lord is my Light" by Miss Ellyn Swanson, whose presentation pleased the audience as no other singer ever seemed able to do. Following her selection was a beautiful tenor solo by William Dahlen, and an artistic violin solo by H. Perry Johnson.</p>
   <p>The most highly appreciated number of the evening was Chisholm's "Slumber Sea," presented with the greatest appeal, by Miss Swanson, who sang as an encore, Ole Bull's "Saetergjentens Sondag" (The Chalet Girl's Sunday).</p>

   <p>Wennerberg's "Jatten" was exceptionally well performed by Mr. Holmquist, who, to conclude the program, sang a duet "Slottsklockan" (Monastary Bells) with William Dahlen. The duet in our estimation, was the best we have ever had the pleasure of hearing.</p>
   <p>The accompanist during the entire evening was Miss Karin Lindshog, whose rendition was perfect in every way. We consider her the artist of our Swedish colony.</p>
