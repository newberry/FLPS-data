<title level="a">AHLMAN'S SEPARATE EXHIBIT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We mentioned briefly in last week's issue that the Swedish-American painter, Gotthilf Ahlman, had opened a separate exhibit in the Midland Club, 172 West Adams Street.</p>
   <p>The exhibit, Ahlman's first one-man show, includes twenty-two numbers, among which are six portraits. Landscapes are in the majority, and no less than six of them picture the beauties of the Indiana dunes, a district which has lately become much frequented by Chicago's Swedes. But the other landscapes present a variety of motifs, both winter and summer scenes. The canvas "Winter Afternoon, Sweden," is in our opinion a masterpiece. The other painting with a motif from Sweden, "Winter Sunlight, Sweden," is also a very fine piece of work, but we do not like that dilapidated farmhouse in the background. However, those who always enjoy talking about poor Sweden will find it exactly to their taste. The painting "Wisconsin," a lake motif shows that Ahlman also is master of the art of marine painting. The blue lake surrounded by fir trees has a strong appeal.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1326.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The painting ranks among the best in the entire exhibit.</p>
   <p>The portrait of Gustavus Adolphus looks like the pictures of him that we have seen in books, and what more can one ask? The portrait of the round-the-world flyer, Lieutenant Eric Nelson, which was painted several years ago, and which we have mentioned on previous occasions, is also included in this exhibit. There is also a still life, one of the few that Ahlman has painted.</p>
   <p>The exhibit will remain open until the end of this month.</p>
