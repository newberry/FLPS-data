   <p>A short time ago we commented on the fact that Swedish-American artists are attracting more and more attention; they are getting much-needed encouragement and have won a place for themselves in the esteem and good will of the public. They are also faring better financially; in short, they are coming into their own.</p>
   <p>This gratifying change ought to extend also into another sphere. We are thinking of song and music. Swedes love song and music but, in spite of this, we read repeatedly in our press that such and such a concert, even thought a performance of the highest order, was poorly attended. In fact it often seems that the interest evinced by the public declines in proportion as the quality of performances rises.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1646.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When a Swedish chorus or musical organization arranges a concert for the purpose of replenishing its treasury, the public, on which it depends for financial and moral support, is conspicuous by its absence. It has, therefore, become customary to feature dancing after the regular program at concerts,in order to attract an audience, and this state of affairs is regrettable from the point of view of the performers, and for other reasons as well. Most of our singers and musicians are amateurs who perform without pay, and often do much to enliven festive occasions which, without them, would be rather dull and commonplace. They certainly deserve more appreciation and encouragement than they are getting, even though their performances do not always measure up to the highest artistic standards.</p>
   <p>Let us honor our faithful and idealistic chorus leaders and musical directors who, regardless of monetary compensation, do so much to preserve our Swedish traditions in song and music. They are among our cultural standard-bearers.</p>
