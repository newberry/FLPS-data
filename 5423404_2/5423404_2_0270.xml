   <p>It is only natural that America should be a strong supporter of the world peace movement, and this attitude was also evident during the National Peace Congress which was held a few days ago here in Chicago. But it was also demonstrated that even at a peace meeting, opposing opinions may clash and arguments and discussions become quite heated. Some very redical measures, designed to abolish war, were proposed but met vigorous opposition, and there were times when the presiding officer had difficulty in maintaining order.</p>
   <p>The final result of the deliberations was a lengthy resolution, which expressed confidence in the Hague Tribunal, but stated that its scope is too limited, and urged the establishment of a World Peace Court with the authority to make final and irrevocable decisions in disputes between nations, thus outlawing war.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately the Swedish minister to Washington, Lagercrantz, who was invited to attend the Congress, was prevented by sickness from being present, but the occasion was nevertheless one of extraordinary significance to us Swedish-Americans on account of Consul Lindgren's fine contribution to the cause of peace. The donation reflects credit not only on the giver himself but on the entire Swedish-American community, and even on the old country, whose highest representative,Mr. Lindgren, is here in Chicago. His action is another manifestation of a trend to which we previously have called attention, the tendency of the Swedish-American group to make itself and more felt in American affairs.</p>
   <p>The work for world peace is worth all that it costs, and the sacrifices which are being made will benefit not alone our own nation but all humanity.</p>
