   <p>The Swedish Singing Society of Chicago held its meeting of delegates at the Svithiod Singing Club, 624 Wrightwood Avenue last Sunday. The following choruses were represented with the full number of delegates, elected for the present year in the singing society's directorate: Bellmans Koren (Bellman Chorus), Harmoni (Harmony) Iduna, (Iduna); Nordstjernan (North Star); Svenska Gleeklubben (The Swedish Glee Club); Svithiod Sangarklubb (Svithiod Singing Club); and Zephyr.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, a committee was appointed, consisting of four members from each chorus. The committee is to make arrangements for the large spring concert at the Aryan Grotto Temple, 741 Wabash Avenue, Sunday evening, April 27. It was decided at that time to hold the yearly picnic in Riverview Park, June 22, or 29.</p>

   <p>Further, it was decided to appear at the Swedish-American Republican League's John Ericsson festival at the Hotel La Salle, Sunday afternoon, March 9. Practice is held regularly at the Svithiod Singing Club usually attended by from seventy-five to one hundred singers, which indicates that the concert is to be something exceptional in the history of the Swedish Singers of Chicago. New songs are now being practiced, and the song -loving public will be treated with a number of delightful surprises. The singing society, as a whole, will present "Vikingarne," (Vikings) and "Son of the Sea," with accompaniment by a musician from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
