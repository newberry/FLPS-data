   <p>In this country it is taken pretty much for granted that the South American nations have much to learn from us, and it seldom occurs to Americans that perhaps our southern neighbors could teach this great republic a few things. We have in mind a recent dispatch from Rio De Janeiro, in which it is reported that the housing shortage in the Brazilian capital has caused the authorities to revive a long-forgotten law from the days of Don Pedro. This law provides that no tax shall be paid on workers' homes.</p>
   <p>A similar law is badly needed in this country, and if passed would, more than any other single measure, help to stimulate building activities and reduce the housing shortage here. The present taxation system is unjust, because <pb facs="5423404_2_0343.jpg" n="2"/>workers pay proportionally much higher taxes on their modest dwellings than do millionaires on their palaces. No taxes at all should be paid on workers' homes, but the rich and mighty should be required to pay more than they are now paying. From a social point of view, such an arrangement is much to be desired, and even though we may not like to admit it, our Brazilian sister republic is leading the way. We should at least try to catch up with her.</p>
