   <p>Last week the superintendent of the morgue of the Cook County Poor House, our countryman Christianson, was dismissed allegedly because of drunkenness. And thereby hangs a tale.</p>
   <p>A few days prior to this incident Dr. Wimermark, the Superintendent of the institution and also a countryman of ours, left for Minneapolis to attend the United Scandinavian Singers' festival being held there. In his absence the supervisory duties, were left to one Pyne, an engineer at the institution. The next day Mr. Smith the president of the board of trustees, visited the Poor House and left explicit instructions with Pyne that he would have the right to discharge anyone among the personnel, who could be charged with drunkenness. Christianson was singled out and became the victim of this arbitrary ruling which was executed during the absence of the head of the institution.</p>
