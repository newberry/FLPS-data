   <p>At 39 State Street, last Thursday afternoon, the more prominent ladies of the city presented an exhibition under the name of The Housekeepers' Exhibit, in the rooms of the School of Domestic Arts and Science.</p>
   <p>A variety of tasty dishes were exhibited here, and many prizes and honorable mentions were given to the girls who had prepared them. Prior to the distribution of prizes, about twenty of the girls who had served long and faithfully in the respective families were given medals in honor of the service they had rendered.....</p>
   <p>A list of the girls who received medals, prizes, honorable mention, reveal a <pb facs="5423404_2_0516.jpg" n="2"/>large number of Swedish girls. It is not the first time our Swedish girls have given evidence of their superiority in the domestic field. The situation was similar last year, and also two years ago if our memory does not deceive us.</p>
