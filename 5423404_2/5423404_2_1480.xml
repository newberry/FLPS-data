   <p>An outstanding member of our Swedish colony is Charles E. Hallberg. There are exceedingly few "knights of the palette" who devote their time, even in part, to the marine branch of painting.</p>
   <p>Very few have ever pictured the deep sea and its violent waves. Among the few are two American artists, Cleveland Rockwell and Alexander Harrison, whose true-to-nature paintings have brought them fame.</p>
   <p>Charles E. Hallberg is not only the equal of the two most famous painters of this type in America, but in several phases of sea views he unquestionably even surpasses them, and our Swedish colony is justly proud of him.</p>
   <p>Hallberg was born in Goteborg, Sweden in 1855, where, while attending school, <pb facs="5423404_2_1481.jpg" n="2"/>his regular studies were secondary in his desire and ambition. As a boy, during his study periods, textbooks were often left unopened while the pencil was plied with a magic touch.</p>
   <p>Charles Hallberg is known today as one of America's greatest artists, especially in the circle favoring marine pictures. Among his highly esteemed paintings we would mention the realistic "In the Teeth of the Gale", "Returning Fishermen", "Sunrise--Lake Michigan" (which reveals the poetic nature of Mr. H.).</p>
   <p>"Off the Isle of Wight" is painted with the most brutal realism of any painting we have seen. In viewing this painting, no aesthetic sensibility is required to hear the creaking of the straining timbers of the boat, and the savage, voracious sound of the stormy billows. One is carried away inadvertently by the spirit of the picture. All his paintings specify the time of day they represent; "Evening at Sea" and "Morning After the Storm" exemplify the contrast.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1482.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Among our American artists, Mr. Hallberg occupies an independent and individual pedestal, his right to which has been won by his exclusive and energetic application to the art he has loved from childhood until today. Among marine painters he ranks first, a fact which is admitted by the best painters of land or sea.</p>
