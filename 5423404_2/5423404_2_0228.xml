   <p>With these words we began an article last week. Our Constitution gives to citizens certain privileges, and with them of course go certain corresponding duties. The first is not to abuse freedom of speech. Together with this one must consider the welfare of the state, which is far superior to all other things and matters. We must not for a moment forget that we are at war, and that we must bring this war to a victorious close.</p>
   <p>We may say the same with regard to the Liberty Loan drives now in progress. And we also wish to make clear what might occur in the event that our old homeland, Sweden should be drawn into the conflict. In that event our interests are with the United States.</p>
   <p>Such is, in short, our political articles of faith, which we find quite proper and which we, like all other foreign newspapers,in the United States, ought to <pb facs="5423404_2_0229.jpg" n="2"/>scupulously carry out. We must also to the Post Office Department send translated articles of any matter which touches on the war, and its contingent circumstances.</p>
