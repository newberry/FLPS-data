   <p>The new banking institution, the Chicago Bank of Commerce, was formally established last Friday. It is located in the heart of the city, at Dearborn and Madison Streets. The occasion might have passed almost unnoticed, were it not for the strong police guard which had been called to stand watch while the bank's cash funds of $5,100,000 were being counted. News photographers also were present to preserve the event for posterity. They also took pictures of the directors, among whom are Henry S. Henschen, Adolph Lindstrom, former Governor Preuss, of Minnesota, E. P. Strandberg, Sr., and Roy O. Nereim. A representative of the state, from Springfield, counted the money, as required by law; this took considerable time, and when the job finally was finished the board of directors was informed that as far, as the state was concerned the bank was now free to open for business. A certain awe-inspiring atmosphere permeated the offices as these formalities were taking place, and the photographers' lights flashed over the scene.</p>

   <p>When it was all over, bank guards, escorted by police, moved the millions to safety.</p>
   <p>The bank will open for business next Saturday, April 12. [Translator's note: The members of the board of directors are Scandinavians, mostly Swedes; its president, Henry S. Henschen, is a Swede, while ex-Governor Preuss is a Norwegian, and it must be assumed that the bank is predominantly Swedish owned. It seems strange that the paper does not emphasize this fact.]</p>
