   <p>Franz Hedberg's popular historical portrayal of the play "The Wedding in Ulfasa" was given last Saturday at the Studebaker Theatre by the newly formed Swedish Theatre Company.</p>
   <p>The play was given before a packed house, which undoubtedly was due to the splendid performance which had been assured for the opening night. Chicago has long needed a Swedish theatre, and a beginning such as the one we had last Saturday can give rise to the hope that it can be kept in operation in the future.</p>
   <p>The sporadic showing of Vermlanningarne cannot be said to have brought about any degree of permanence in the Swedish theatrical field.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So it is to be hoped that this company will continue its good work and, in case it should cease to function, another may be found to fill its place.</p>
