   <p>The well-known Swedish-American, Dr. O. A. Toffteen, owner and director of the Scandia Academy here, is about to set out for an extended tour of Europe.</p>
   <p>Among the countries he will visit are France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Sweden.</p>
   <p>Before he came to America, Dr. Toffteen served as an assistant pastor in Hafdhem Parish on the island of Gotland, Sweden. After coming to America in 1888 he planned to continue his ministerial work, and studied for some time at Augustana College, whereafter he became a pastor, first in Minneapolis, Minnesota and later in Galesburg, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The study of ancient languages has always been his chief interest, and when he <pb facs="5423404_2_0707.jpg" n="2"/>moved to this city in 1902 he immediately entered the University of Chicago for the purpose of pursuing such studies further. After having received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy he was offered a position as instructor in the University, and also was made director of the courses in Assyriology.</p>
   <p>During later years Dr. Toffteen has attracted much attention among leaders in the linguistic sciences in Chicago, and is recognized as one of the foremost students of oriental history and literature in the country.</p>
