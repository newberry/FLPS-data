   <p>The art exhibit which was held in the building of the Swedish Club last week was very successful, and led the public, especially art lovers, to become better acquainted with, and more interested in, Swedish-Americans. Comments in the daily press have on the whole been very flattering, and art critics have pointed out that these annual events have placed the Swedish group in a leading position among the various nationalities here, and have also had an encouraging effect on struggling artists within other national groups. The Swedes thus have reason to be proud of their part in arousing a more general interest in the fine arts, which bodes well for the future of America.</p>
   <p>The Swedish singers have attracted almost as much flattering attention as <pb facs="5423404_2_1387.jpg" n="2"/>have the artists. As an instance of this, we only have to mention the large number of Swedish soloists who are prominent in singing circles. Many of them rank among the "stars" in their fields. Many Swedish choruses also are highly esteemed among music lovers. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Swedish Choral Club gave its annual spring concert, which was highly praised by the city's music critics.</p>
   <p>There has been a tendency among some people to think of Swedish-Americans chiefly as manual workers, and snobs, both here and in Sweden, are apt to say that our countrymen in America lack culture. We agree that the Swede is by nature a worker, that he will work even if he does not have to, and that most Swedes in this country are engaged in some kind of labor. In common with most Americans, they like work and despise idleness. As for culture, the facts some of which we have mentioned above, speak for themselves. Swedish painters, musicians, singers, and other artists compare favorably with those of other nationalities, even in the judgment <pb facs="5423404_2_1388.jpg" n="3"/>of native Americans. And anybody who will take the trouble to study actual conditions will find that cultural and educational aspirations are just as deep-rooted among Swedish-Americans as among any other national group in this country. But America is still a young nation, and it is not surprising that our vast cultural potentialities are as yet not fully developed. The efforts and accomplishments of Swedish artists in various fields indicate that, as a group, we are on the march, and the time may not be far off when Swedish-American culture will receive recognition even in old Sweden.</p>
