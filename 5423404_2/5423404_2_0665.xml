   <p>One day last week when the temperature was high, two men made statements of significance for the citizens of Chicago. One of these men was Mr. Grady, superintendent of the Bureau of Milk Inspection. The other was Mr. Field, president of the Knickerbocker Ice Company.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grady spoke as follows: "Not more than one fourth of the milk which was consumed in Chicago yesterday was of high quality. Ice must be produced so the general public can be supplied. Ice is more of a necessity now than coal was last winter. Thousands of children will die unless provisions are made to keep the milk fresh."</p>
   <p>At the same time Mr. Field, president of Knickerbocker Ice Company, made the following statement: "I have recommended an increase in the price of <pb facs="5423404_2_0666.jpg" n="2"/>ice. The board of directors of our company demand that the company make better earnings. If I cannot bring about an increase in earnings for the company, the board of directors intends to select someone who can show better progress. The increase in price will be from five to thirty percent."</p>
   <p>Now let us take a look at the situation, and try to discover whether any real need is present for this ruthless increase in prices. The ice company which bears the name of Knickerbocker Ice Company, and which, it may be noted, includes several others, in 1898 decreased the number of its depots from sixty-seven to twenty-two. One can imagine what a saving in cost of production for the company which is yet producing at top speed.</p>
   <p>The company in question claims to have a capital (on paper?) of $9,000,000., and year after year has been able to pay not merely the interest on the capital in question, but in addition, has been paying a six per cent <pb facs="5423404_2_0667.jpg" n="3"/>dividend on the preferred stock, and on the common stock dividend to the amount of $4,000,000. It seems queer to us that a company which is able to pay six per cent dividends to the stockholders should feel obliged to increase the price charged the consumers for ice from five to thirty per cent in these days.</p>
   <p>Mr. Field gives an explanation, however, Wages have increased, he says. But wages were raised last year, yet there was no increase in price. Why? "Yes," Mr. Field says, "competition was too keen last year."</p>
   <p>Notice the explanation. The consumers of ice, especially those less capable of paying are being compelled to pay ten cents instead of five cents for a little piece of ice because the Knickerbocker Ice Company no longer has any competition with which to contend. The company in question is not satisfied with consolidating, concentrating, combining with others, etc., thereby bringing large amounts of money into its treasury. It is <pb facs="5423404_2_0668.jpg" n="4"/>not satisfied with distributing dividends of six per cent upon a some-what misty capital. The company is out for money, even though thousands of children have to die upon the altars of this Moloch. Money controls this corporation as well as other soulless corporations; trusts, as they also are called, and in the cauldrons of these, thousands of lives of little innocent children are being sacrificed every year in spite of exertions by the doctors.</p>
   <p>Milk Inspector Grady is correct in his statement that the milk which is delivered in Chicago isffar from being of the best quality. In the quarters of the poor, this is most sorely realized, especially since the families in those quarters cannot afford to pay the excessive price demanded for the ice which might keep even the adulterated milk fairly fresh. We believe that the cows will continue to do their duty; we believe that the milk dealers are in somewhat intimate connection with the water faucet; but we consider that the ice company ought to take <pb facs="5423404_2_0669.jpg" n="5"/>heed before raising the cost of ice to greater heights, for ice in summer is one of the very necessities of life.</p>
