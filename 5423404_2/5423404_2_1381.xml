   <p>During the week of August 17-24, the Illinois Club arranged a carnival at the "Home Post," located at Michigan and Chicago Avenues. The proceeds of this carnival went into the club's building fund, which is to be used for the erection of a new club building at Ontario and Rush Streets. It will be thirty-one stories high, and part of it will be used as a hotel for women who are employed in the big industries and business houses of the city.</p>
   <p>In connection with the carnival, the Club also arranged an art exhibit comprising 246 numbers, and representing about one hundred artists.</p>
   <p>Among the participating artists we noted a number of Swedish-Americans, namely Gustaf Dahlstrom, Charles E. Hallberg, Fred T. Larson, Frederick Remahl, Fridolf N. Spolander, and Axel Westerling. Two of these are marine painters, and are exhibiting three paintings each. They are Hallberg's "Summer Sea," <pb facs="5423404_2_1382.jpg" n="2"/>"The Coming Thunderstorm," and "The 'Bremen' Eastward Bound". In our opinion, the second mentioned, is the best one, while "The 'Bremen' Eastward Bound" brings us right up to events happening today, even though the artist may never have laid eyes on the "Bremen".</p>
   <p>Spolander exhibited "Midnight Surf," "Twilight," and "Midnight Overture." Remahl was also represented by three pieces, all of which are typical of this able artist. Dahlstrom exhibited "Goose Island" and "Fishermen," and Larson "The Village Church" and "Garden Gate," while Westerling was represented by "Isaac and the Pilgrim," "Taking of Torquilstone," and "Rebecca Nursing Ivanhoe".</p>
   <p>All of the exhibited paintings were offered for sale but we do not know how many of them found buyers.</p>
