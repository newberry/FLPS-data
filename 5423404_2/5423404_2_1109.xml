<title level="a">CHICAGO CEMETERY ASSOCIATION HOLDS ANNUAL MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Cemetery Association, owners of Oak Hill cemetery, held its annual meeting on February 13 at the office of the Association, 159 La Salle Street. The reports of the officers were received with great satisfaction by all, and greatly added to the interest of the members in the undertaking. The following were elected directors: Charles J. Dahlgren, Olof Nelson, August Landeen, O. R. Hillstrom.</p>
   <p>The president's report showed that more than one hundred lots had been sold during the year for a total of $5,946.89, and that a total of one hundred and eight burials have taken place, or one hundred fifty from the time of the opening of the cemetery. Of late, the number of burials have increased, reaching as high as nine per week. Plans for a railroad station have been completed, and contract given for the erection of the same. Street car communications have been offered the Association for $5,000.</p>
   <p>During the year 1,383 shares have been sold at a premium of $3,198.50.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_1110.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The total number of shares sold to date is 7,730, leaving only 2,270 shares yet to be sold, the price being fourteen dollars per share. From a financial point of view, there can be no doubt but the shares constitute number one type of investment, the capital of the Association being $130,000; the debt only $50,000, and the reserve fund being $3,388.72. Considering the brief time of existence of the Association, there is hardly any need of further recommendations.</p>
   <p>The affairs of the Association have been taken care of in the most economical manner. It has not been considered necessary to pay any very large amounts for improvements this year.</p>
   <p>From the secretary's report, it appears that the income during the year was $26,048.83; the expenses $23,161.70. Net income $2,887.13.</p>
