   <p>Capital punishment is a repugnant blot on our civilization, a type of punishment which is more degrading for humanity itself than for the criminal who is subjected to it.</p>
   <p>The fifth commandment says: "Thou Shalt not Kill," and in our opinion this applies to society as well as to the individual. If the latter, on the spur of the moment or after more or less deliberation, takes the life of a human being, he commits murder, and so does society when it puts to death a person who has broken its law, and in that case society's crime is even graver than that of the individual, for while the latter must be supposed to have been in an abnormal state of mind, caused by such mental conditions as greed for other's gold, a breakdown of his better self, hate, caused by real or imaginary injustice, etc., society places itself in the judge's seat and sentences the transgressor to death. With what right? It is doubtful whether society has any right to mete out punishment; its <pb facs="5423404_2_0416.jpg" n="2"/>duty is to educate and promote proper development, and if it has failed in this duty, it should certainly attempt to recondition the individual, when its former negligence has caused him to run afoul of the law.</p>
   <p>Society cannot wake up the dead victim; but in order to avenge his death, it takes another life in a brutal manner. The first murder is supposed to justify another one. As if society had any more right to take a human life than the individual!</p>
   <p>Just as the murderer's knife or bullet not only extinguishes the spark of life in his victim, but also leaves bleeding wounds in the hearts of friends and relatives, so also those that are near to the condemned man suffer untold anguish and grief. The mother cries over her son, and the sister is tormented by her brother's act; but the hope of seeing the son and brother rehabilitated through a just and constructive punishment, gives them some consolation in their misery. Then comes society and says to this pitiful creature who took a human life: "You shall die on the gallows." Then the wounds in the hearts of the mother and sister are reopened, and the darkness of despair takes the place of the ray of hope; <pb facs="5423404_2_0417.jpg" n="3"/>not infrequently the grief-stricken mind plunges into the permanent darkness of insanity.</p>
   <p>Is the punishment complete now? Has the crime been avenged? Not yet. If the criminal were a father, his children will take their goodly share of the punishment. In school his daughter is pointed at with the remark: "Her father was hung," and her playmates will avoid the innocent little girl. On the street the boys are persecuting his son: "What a contemptible death, to die on the gallows." And the boy suffers not only for his father's crime, but also for that of the state. Likewise, if the murderer were a young man, his brothers, sisters, and parents must suffer for two crimes. Therefore we say: Down with capital punishment! Down with legalized murder!</p>
