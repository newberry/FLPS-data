   <p>A couple of days ago our popular compatriot Olof Nelson and his family bade us farewell for a couple of months. Mr. Nelson has made himself very popular with people with whom he associated, and with the Osgood Photo Engraving Company where he worked. While there he brought out many valuable inventions, from which he receives a special income. It is a fact that from his holding with this Company he has drawn a large sum of money for his traveling expenses. But Mr. Nelson has also made himself popular in other ways particularly among the Swedish singers, because he has done a great deal of work and made many contributions toward their work. Not as an active singer bus as an organizer and worker for results at concerts. This he has accomplished in a large way. With a word said about the song, he has shown marked interest in Svithiod Singing Club. He was a member of the club, and was elected president time and again; as well as president of the Swedish Singing Society of America. Mr. Nelson not only has won the singers as his friends and as friends of his family but also has gained the well wishes of a large number of friends of the Society on his long journey. His plans are first to visit <pb facs="5423404_2_0754.jpg" n="2"/>Sweden, then Denmark from which country his wife come. Then he goes to Germany, France and other countries to study new inventions. We say to the Nelson family a hearty farewell and welcome back.</p>
