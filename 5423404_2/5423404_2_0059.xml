   <p>Three of the five Swedish candidates on the Republican ticket received majority votes at the elections held yesterday, namely: Andrew Ringman, as Town Clerk of Hyde Park; C.P. Youngquist, as Supervisor of Jefferson; and John A. Larson, as Alderman of the 23rd Ward. The two other candidates, Edward Peterson and John Thoren, were defeated by their Democratic opponents.</p>
   <p>The elections resulted in a victory for the Republican party. For example, out of the thirty-four city wards, twenty-one of the Aldermen are now Republicans, ten Democrats and three Independent Democrats. In the towns of Lake View, Jefferson, Hyde Park and Cicero the administrative offices are occupied solely by Republicans. North Town is solidly Democratic, whereas South Town, West Town, Lake and Calumet are about half-and-half Republican and Democratic.</p>
