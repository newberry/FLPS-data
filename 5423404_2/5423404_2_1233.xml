   <p>The director for the opera here is thanking his lucky star for helping him finding a new opera star.</p>
   <p>The lucky find is - a Swede. Her name is Lydia Lindgren, daughter of a manufacturer in Pitea. For two years she has been in New York, singing at concerts there, and it was at one of them that Mr. Campanini, the director of Chicago Opera, heard her, and he at once engaged her. He is very proud of his find, and feels certain that the public will share his enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Miss Lindgren has made several concert tours in the European countries. It is said that she knows, besides the Swedish language, also Russian, Italian, Spanish, French, German, and English. In spite of all her qualifications she is very modest and has not tried to use all the well known reclame tricks <pb facs="5423404_2_1234.jpg" n="2"/>which usually are being employed for the purpose of gaining renown. This fact explains why she has remained comparatively unknown in spite of her voice.</p>
   <p>"I am very happy to come to Chicago and to have the opportunity to sing together wich such artists as those engaged for the Chicago season", said Miss Lindgren. When interviewed by the Kuriren, "you ask whether I have temperament! Not except in my singing. I do not get into artistic rage. I do not scold the director, and I have been too busy with my studies during the past eight years to permit myself any personal peculiarities."</p>
   <p>We rely on the authority of the great Campanini for the quality of Miss Lindgren's voice, and we feel sure that all those bound to the new star by ties of nationality will have reason to be proud at the appearance of another great Swede.</p>
