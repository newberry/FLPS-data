  <body>
   <p>Mr. Edward A. Erickson is the president of the newly established Security Bank, on Milwaukee Avenue, on the site formerly occupied by the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, run and ruined by Paul O. Stensland, now No. 9022 in Joliet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Erickson was born in Noble County, Indiana. He received his elementary education in Kendallville, Indiana. In 1882, he was employed by the First National Bank as assistant bookkeeper and by this beginning, starting at the bottom, he has gradually advanced until he has become thoroughly familiar with every department of the bank.</p>
   <p>Now that the new bank has been organized by the most prominent bankers in Chicago these have carefully made their selection of a president and employer. Mr. Erickson is highly esteemed by them all and is a very popular member of Woodlawn Park Club and treasurer of the Auburn Park Club.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0988.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His good nature and a wonderful sense of humor wins him friends wherever he goes; we wish him continued success in banking and in society.</p>
  </body>
