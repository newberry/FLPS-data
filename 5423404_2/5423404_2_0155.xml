   <p>War never has been a paying proposition for the belligerent nations, even though many individuals have managed to profit financially at the expense of their suffering fellow men. In the old days, war could, with some justification, be called a " royal sport," in which the most courageous heroes won honor and fame in conformance with the code of the times. But in our day it is not considered much of an honor to kill a large number of people, even though it be done in war time.</p>
   <p>In a recent article written by a well-known American author, the gains--if they may be called that--and the losses resulting from the World War were simply and clearly demonstrated. According to this article, the Germans and Austrians put 22,850,000 soldiers in the field; the Allies, 42,189,444. The latter <pb facs="5423404_2_0156.jpg" n="2"/>suffered three times as many casualties as the former. The casualty lists have been furnished by the American War Department.</p>
   <p>But those who suffered the greater losses won the war, in spite of the fact that their losses were three times as great as those of their enemies. This certainly is a paradox equal to that of the war itself. It is hard to understand that there still are people who want more war; and that even in our own country there are those who would lead us into another conflict.</p>
