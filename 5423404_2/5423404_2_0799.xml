  <body>
   <p>Our great countryman, Captain John Ericson, has completed a new invention.</p>
   <p>The houses here are now built from eight to nine stories high in order to make expensive sites as profitable as possible. It has been impossible to bring the water up one level to another.</p>
   <p>Captain Ericson has now invented a pumping machine, which will force the water a considerable height. He calls this machine the caloric pump. It drives from 200 to 300 gallons of water an hour up to a height of fifty feet.</p>
   <p>Captain Ericson has obtained a patent on this machine. It is small, being only four feet high, and will be very practical, especially for tall buildings.</p>
   <p>The inventor said that he has not been working very hard on this pumping machine, but has used only his spare time on it. He doesn't think so much of it himself, <pb facs="5423404_2_0800.jpg" n="2"/>but other professional men are of the opinion that it is of great value.</p>
