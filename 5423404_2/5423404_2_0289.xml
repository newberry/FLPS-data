   <p>One may think and say what one will about the soldiers of World War days who are now gathering in Washington and through the effect of their numbers are trying to influence authorities in favor of immediate payment of the soldiers' bonus. They are, after all, American citizens without work and without any means of subsistence, and the payment of the bonus now would mean a much needed temporary relief. As American citizens they have a right to demand respectful treatment and a hearing in Washington even though they are clothed in rags. Yes, even if their plight has created in them a threatening attitude and a certain disregard for the finer formalities and military discipline.</p>
   <p>It is being said that the majority of this marching mass never took any <pb facs="5423404_2_0290.jpg" n="2"/>part in the war, and never belonged to any army. Some newspapers call them "so-called veterans". But we are inclined to believe that if the majority of them were not former defenders of their country the American Legion would have taken action to expose them. They must be accepted as men who once wore their country's uniform and who once were hailed for their readiness to give their lives for America and for democracy. At that time they were acclaimed as heroes and patriots in the most flattering terms, and they were assured that nothing was too good for them. If there is anything wrong about their march on the Capitol and their conduct in general, the responsibility rests on the system which nourishes the war psychosis, and on society which is unable and unwilling to honor its promises.</p>
   <p>The American Government has done more for the war veterans than for any other group of citizens, and if the depression had not set in and brought havoc among them, they would probably have been fairly well satisfied with their lot.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0291.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But unemployment has taken from them their savings, insurance, and other reserves that they may have had, and what they demand now is work and bread or a cash advance on the money which is due them at a later time from the Government. If there had been men among them who could and would champion their cause in Washington, this march would have been unnecessary, but they have no such men. They know that the country is spending enormous sums on the veterans and their families. But they also know that millions are being wasted on people who neither deserve nor need aid, and they cannot help that authorities are unable to distinguish between chiselers and deserving individuals or groups. They also know that the Government seems to have plenty of resources when it comes to dragging big business and industry out of the hole which they have dug for themselves.</p>
   <p>A few years ago the veterans who are now gathered in Washington were called the flower of American manhood. Who is to blame them if now, in their hour <pb facs="5423404_2_0292.jpg" n="4"/>of need, they make their demands known in a rather irregular and conspicuous manner? We dare say that they would gladly recall their demands and hurry home if they were given assurance that when they got there they would find work which would enable them to provide for themselves and their loved ones.</p>
