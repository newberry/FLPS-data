   <p>For a long time the city council has had in mind obtaining a practical machine by means of which the streets near the bridges could be shut off at the time the bridges are opened to let vessels pass by. Several accidents have occurred because of the lack of such arrangements. Many proposals have been offered to the authorities, but have not been of any practical use.</p>
   <p>Our countryman, P.M.Pearson, an engineer employed at the great machine building concern, Fraser &amp; Chalmers, has constructed an automatic machine which seems to solve the problem. At the moment the bridge is opened two arms from two poles erected at each end of the street fall down and shut off all traffic until the bridge is back in its former position, when they again are lifted. These arms work automatically.</p>
   <p>Pearson has obtained a patent for his invention and it is to be hoped that the city council will soon be the owner of this machine.</p>
