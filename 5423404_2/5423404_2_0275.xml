   <p>Mr. Root, our Secretary of War, made a trip to England a little while ago, and during his visit was a guest at the homes of several English statesmen. Nothing prevented him from visiting the emperor of Germany and the president of France in the same peaceful way. He then returned to this country and ordered the building of a large and strong navy. But why? In order to hurt his generous hosts and their countries. Is not this a sign of mental confusion?</p>
   <p>A terrible accident occurs in a country; thousands lose their lives through the accident; tens of thousands are injured. Emperors, kings, presidents, <pb facs="5423404_2_0276.jpg" n="2"/>cabinet ministers, and other statesmen express their regret at the unfortunate incident and seek in every way to lighten the sorrow and alleviate the need of the survivors. But during it all, the work of building battleships, of constructing quick-firing guns and rifles, of inventing smokeless powder, etc. goes steadily on. Then, one day, one of the old battleships is blown up by some wild-brained fellows in some foreign harbor where the ship had reason to be; and an army of young vigorous men, supplied with the most modern weapons, is sent forth to kill their brethren, those same people whom a few months ago they tried to feed, to clothe, to console.</p>
   <p>A great system, is it not?</p>
