   <p>Dr. Alice Stockman, who just has returned from Sweden, where she has specialized in a thorough study of Swedish Sloyd, and the methods of instructions used over there, delivered a lecture the other day on the subject in question before the Industrial Art Association. Meeting in the Women's Hall of the Art Institute, Dr. Stockman spoke in high terms of the advantages and benefits of a child's education. It broadens the visions, and lays foundations for practical development, she said as she strongly advocated the introduction of the system in the Chicago public schools. A special Sloyd work-table, which she brought with her from Sweden was exhibited and demonstrated. A general discussion ensued and resulted in the adoption of a resolution recommending the introduction of the Sloyd System in two of the public schools, the Normal Park and the Armour. More than 150 men and women attended the lecture and several newcomers were enrolled as members of the Association.</p>
