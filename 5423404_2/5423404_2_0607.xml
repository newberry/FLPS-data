   <p>Never before was life in the country as attractive as it is now! Modern agriculture offers a fine livelihood for the man with ambition and brains, as well as for the ordinary toiler. No other vocation gives a man the chance to be as independent as the farmer. He can really live as a man should live. The modern farmer is his own boss, unless one would say that the real boss is nature itself; but at the same time the farmer can make nature his obedient servant.</p>
   <p>In no other line of work does hard work bring such certain rewards and progress. Statistics show that among those that go into business, ninety-five per cent fail. The risk is great, and competition merciless. Among farmers there is no real competition. The world has always needed food, and always will need it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0608.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Scientific treatment of the soil, cheap fertilizer, modern irrigation and drainage methods, prevention of animal and plant diseases, and weather forecasts aid the farmer in making his life pleasant and secure. He is not as isolated as he used to be. Railroads and telephones, schools and post offices are now easily within his reach. He can enjoy all the pleasures of the city, and in addition he has all around him what the city has not: God's free and magnificent nature.</p>
   <p>"Back to the soil" is no longer simply the song of a tempting siren. It is sound advice, which many should follow. Land will never become cheaper than it is now. On the contrary, land values are likely to double within a few years. Nature, science, and national economic forces are uniting to produce this condition.</p>
   <p>Everybody who can possibly manage to own a piece of land should do so. It will bring pleasure and profit.</p>
   <p>Investigate this opportunity: 40,000 acres of fertile land in the famous <pb facs="5423404_2_0609.jpg" n="3"/>Arkansas Valley, Colorado, have now been irrigated and are ready for the settler's plow.</p>
   <p>Join the excursion which leaves Chicago July 20; see this valley with your own eyes, and study its possibilities.</p>
   <p>Call at our office, or write for full details.</p>
