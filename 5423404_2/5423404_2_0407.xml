<title level="a">A FEW MEN ARE RULING THE UNITED STATES</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In spite of our much bragged-of universal suffrage, in spite of our country's excellent constitution in many respects, in spite of our freedom widely sung, there exists in our country an oligarchy, a rulership by a few men who hold sway over the people as if by iron rod, a rulership as objectionable as the autocracy in Russia.</p>
   <p>The real government in the United States is not elected by the people; it is appointed, and it consists of the nine members of our highest court.</p>
   <p>Direct election by the people determines who are to be our Congressmen. Our <pb facs="5423404_2_0408.jpg" n="2"/>Senators are elected as our political fakers decide; the President is elected by Representatives from the States, and the President appoints the members of the court which governs the country. If a good law, of value to the people be passed by the House of Representatives, one may be fairly certain that it will be killed in the Senate. If by chance it should pass the Senate also, the President has the right to veto it. But suppose that the President accepts the decision by Congress, the law does not yet assume final standing as law. Above the President, above the Congress, above the 90,000,000 people, stand our highest court, and by means of the single word, "unconstitutional," this court may overrule the decision and the wishes of the people.</p>
   <p>In no other country on earth is there to be found such a system of dictatorship, not even in the most monarchic countries.</p>
   <p>The power of our highest court was not always as great as it is today; the <pb facs="5423404_2_0409.jpg" n="3"/>power has grown with the years. According to the statement by Frederick Upham Adams, there is no paragraph in the Constitution giving the Supreme Court the right to declare laws unconstitutional. When Justice John Marshall, under President Jefferson's administration attempted to overrule the government's opinion in a certain matter, the President ignored the court.</p>
   <p>When Justice Taney, under President Lincoln's term in office, sought to mix in government affairs, Mr. Lincoln used his power as the nation's President, and the court had to bow down.</p>
   <p>But in 1893 when the law of taxation on the basis of annual income was passed, times had changed. Nothing in the law was contrary to the Constitution, and on the first vote, five of the nine justices were in favor of the law.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0410.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But immediately afterwards, one of the five changed his opinion, for reasons which he best knows, and the law was declared unconstitutional.</p>
   <p>The nine members of the Supreme court are keen and intelligent men, but they are not the possessors of all wisdom. Our country contains thousands of lawyers equally keen as they, as well versed in the law as they. Our country also has millions of keen citizens, all of whom are in favor of the acceptance of such a law, but they must keep silent and suffer, wondering what, after all, is their business as voters, since the voice in the most important questions is never listened to, or taken into consideration.</p>
