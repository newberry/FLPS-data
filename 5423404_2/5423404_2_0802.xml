   <p>The Swedish Home Building Association held its annual meeting a few days ago, and the reports from its finance committee and various officers were accepted.</p>
   <p>Net income for 1931 amounted to $107,755 as compared to $114,712 for the previous year, and the society's assets, as of December 31, were $1,970,336 as compared to $2,033,239 the year before.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held January 11 in the society's offices, 111 West Washington Street, and all its directors and other officers were re-elected.</p>
   <p>In addressing the members the president, August Lindeberg, remarked that the organization had passed through the most difficult year in its history, and had come out of it in good condition. He pointed out that even though the society handles only first mortgages on private homes, and in spite of the upheavels which have taken place in the real-estate market since 1929 it had <pb facs="5423404_2_0803.jpg" n="2"/>undertaken foreclosures and had taken over property involving only $57,000, while its outstanding loans amount to $1,900,000. This indicates that the society's real-estate estimators are competent men and that its loans are placed on a sound basis. Mr. Lindeberg assured the members that as soon as the confusion caused by the closing of neighborhood banks clears up and business returns to more normal conditions the Swedish Home Building Association is prepared for further progress and usefulness.</p>
   <p>The organization is one of the largest and strongest of its kind in the city, and in the state, and is all Swedish. Its officers are: August Lindeberg, president; Ernfrid Johnson, vice-president; John G. Carson, secretary; and Axel E. Hult, treasurer; and these men together with Gustaf A. Anderson, Carl A. Boberg, A. P. Olson, and John A. Sandgren, make up its board of directors. Attorney Alfred A. Norton is its legal advisor.</p>
