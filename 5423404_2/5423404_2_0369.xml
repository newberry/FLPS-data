   <p>The campaign "platforms" of political parties often contain generalities and empty phrases which, on closer examination, are found to mean exactly nothing. However, in the platform recently adopted by the Ohio Republican organization there is a plank of real significance. We refer to the resolution demanding that industrial accidents, in which workers become temporarily or permanently incapacitated and often lose their lives, be charged up to the general industrial overhead as part of production costs.</p>
   <p>This is the correct viewpoint, and differs drastically from the attitude taken by American industry up to the present time. Such a law has not as yet been incorporated in the statutes of any state, but from time to time commissions have been appointed to study and submit recommendations on the question. It must be admitted that in respect to industrial <pb facs="5423404_2_0370.jpg" n="2"/>legislation of this type, the more progressive countries in Europe are much more advanced than we are.</p>
   <p>We are anxious to see which of our states will take the initiative in assuring the worker adequate compensation for injuries suffered while at work. Under existing conditions he has little protection, and in the courts, where he is compelled to go for justice, he is often treated as if he were a criminal.</p>
