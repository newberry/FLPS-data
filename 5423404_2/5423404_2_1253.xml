   <p>Every so often we receive reports from various parts of the country of young Swedish-American ladies who possess unusually promising voices, but comparatively few have the opportunity to get the required training, and many natural talents, therefore, remain undeveloped.</p>
   <p>Song-loving Swedish-Americans will be glad to hear that a countrywoman has just won first prize, a diamond medal, in competition with the entire graduating class of the renowned Chicago Musical College. She is Edna Victoria Swanson, born August 6, 1890, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John A. Swanson of 11015 South Michigan Avenue. She is also an accomplished pianist, having taken a complete course under Professor Knupper. For five years she has studied singing under Professor [John] Ortengren, who discovered her beautiful and rich contralto voice, and holds great hopes for her future as a singer. The young woman is a lovable, unaffected <pb facs="5423404_2_1254.jpg" n="2"/>person, endowed with a very attractive appearance.</p>
   <p>Esther Grimm, a Norwegian girl, was awarded a gold medal.</p>
