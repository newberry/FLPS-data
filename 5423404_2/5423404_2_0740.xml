   <p>Through the Chicago Architectural Club, the Portland Cement Company offered a prize to the architect in Chicago who planned the best $8000 house constructed of cement. The prizes were as follows: First: $200; second: $75; and third: $25. These awards were given out December 21 to the best architects in Chicago. The first prize was awarded to Robert Ostergren, a young man from Stockholm.</p>
   <p>He now lives with his brother-in-law at 2939 Vernon Avenue, and works for Spencer &amp; Powers as an architect. He has only been in this country eight years. Last year, he graduated from Armour Institute with high honors. Young Ostergren is very self-determined. It is said he tried to help someone else to get the second prize, <pb facs="5423404_2_0741.jpg" n="2"/>and would have succeeded, if it had not been noticed that Ostregren's hand had been in on the play. We wish him all the success possible in his work.</p>
