   <p>An English financial expert Sir George Paish, is visiting the United States with the expressed aim of promoting a big loan.</p>
   <p>The amount varies between thirty-five billions and "only" thirteen billions.</p>
   <p>In an interview Sir George said that the requirement is at least thirty-five billions of dollars, and that the United States should loan about one-half of this amount. England, he said, stood prepared to guarantee five billions of dollars, <pb facs="5423404_2_0166.jpg" n="2"/>which he deemed a proper proportion. The quick procurement of the loan is declared to be absolutely necessary for the rebirth of Europe. America, we are told, has both a moral responsibility and an obligation to her own economic interests to assist in this plan. The loan will bear four per cent interest, of which one per cent will go to a sinking fund so that the obligations could be redeemed after the lapse of forty-two years. Tax-exemption in all countries is proposed as one of the terms of the loan.</p>
   <p>This is but one of many plans which have originated in Europe. There are many variations, but all are based on the assumption <pb facs="5423404_2_0167.jpg" n="3"/>that America is to be the lender.</p>
   <p>We believe it is unnecessary to discuss the size of the proposed loan. It is, to all appearances, likely that the huge sums, we mentioned, were proposed so the promoters would have enough latitude for reduction at the final arrangement. But concerning such an arrangement, it seems here to be a case of "reckoning without the host."</p>
   <p>In private life we doubt if anyone will get far by reminding the intended lender about his moral obligation to stand by the borrower. How the same tactics can be used in a great international loan transaction is incomprehensible to us, but it appears that throughout Europe <pb facs="5423404_2_0168.jpg" n="4"/>they have assigned to America a moral responsibility for the after costs of the war.</p>
   <p>We have already pointed out how unreasonable such reasoning is.</p>
   <p>It is held that since America made it possible for the Allies to win the War, it should follow that America should also bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that the peace which followed the War, becomes a prevailing peace.</p>
   <p>That it is to America's Interests, none will deny. But if the American people are willing to take upon themselves new burdens for this end, then the first indispensible condition is that the <pb facs="5423404_2_0169.jpg" n="5"/>peace treaty at Versailles is rewritten to become an actual assurance of world peace, a just peace, even for the vanquished.</p>
   <p>This, as all should remember, was promised when the Armistice was signed. The fourteen Wilsonian points, it was said, were to be the foundation for the final settlement.</p>
   <p>It is not fair to make the assertion now that Germany would have had to beg for peace anyway, and that her resources were so depleted that she could not have continued the War a day longer. Even if this were true, which is doubtful, such a circumstance would still not absolve the Allies from keeping the agreements which were then entered into in good faith.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0170.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The destruction of Germany as a military power is one thing. The impoverishment and enslavement of the German people, is a different matter. As far as we can remember there was none who contradicted President Wilson when he solemnly assured the world that we were not at war against the German people, but against its autocratic administration and the German militarism.</p>
   <p>Proceeding from this point, which we continue to consider to be the only true one for the explanation of America's participation in the war, we cannot understand why Germany should be unfairly dealt with now that the war is over, and the autocratic administration expelled, and Germany crushed as a military power. Therefore, we feel that if the United States is to assist in this <pb facs="5423404_2_0171.jpg" n="7"/>financial scheme to revive work and production, and repair the damages and losses due to the War, all the peoples of the earth should be included in such an arrangement.</p>
   <p>It is true that the peace treaty states Germany must make reparation for the war losses of the conquerors. In this question of "blame for the War" the German people have taken it upon themselves to bear the responsibility. But simple justice prescribes that the reparations liability be defined so that the debtor may determine the extent of the obligation.</p>
   <p>Not since the beginning of the Christian era, has a victorious people made reservations to "play the devil" with the vanquished <pb facs="5423404_2_0172.jpg" n="8"/>all at their own pleasure or as the opportunity and circumstance permits. This is a kind of bondage which should be foreign to our civilization.</p>
   <p>We have seen a financial plan which, while gigantic in its scope has demonstrated that the German war debt should first be determined in its entirety and, thereafter, made the foundation for a consolidation and liquidation of the war loans which the different European countries already have secured in the United States.</p>
   <p>In that manner the plan would put Europe on its feet again and provide the German people a future with hope and faith.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_2_0173.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>It may be true that all people are solidly "with each other." It is at least true to a certain extent. It is undeniable that the United States, by virtue of location, climate, and natural resources, is exceptionally placed and can, more than any other people, be self-sufficient. But if our Allies call on the United States for further assistance, on the grounds that we no longer can isolate ourselves from the rest of the world, then it must follow axiomatically that this common ground in the economic interests and solidarity of "one for all and all for one" also should include all people. It is certain that the so-called world peace is otherwise not worth the paper upon which it is written.</p>
