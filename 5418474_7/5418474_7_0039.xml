   <p>The German Popular Stage Chicago (an association) held an extraordinary general session yesterday evening at the Prudential Hall. The object of the meeting was to give the association greater powers by electing a regular chairman who will supervise the business activities of the combine. As the former president, Leopold Saltiel, declined to be a candidate for re-election because of other interests demanding his attention, Michael Leber was chosen as the new leader. The first, second, and third vice-presidents are Julius Hoch, William Heidtke, and Joseph Wehling respectively. Other officials are Mrs. Julia Gerts, treasurer; Mrs. Minnie Willem, financial secretary; Mrs. Emi Heidtke, secretary, Miss Irma Helmreich, assistant secretary; and K. H. Krueger, publicity secretary.</p>
   <p>The association's by-laws were changed so that the guarantee-fund obtained from the sale of subscriptions may be given to the German theater in order <pb facs="5418474_7_0040.jpg" n="2"/>to inaugurate a better season this year.</p>
   <p>A letter of Angelo Lippich was read to the assembly. He expressed sincere thanks in the name of the German theater for the work performed by the Volksbuehne [Popular stage]. The capital which the Volksbuehne provided for the German stage amounts to four thousand dollars. A control committee, likewise elected yesterday, supervises the fund and the proper expenditures of the money which the Volksbuehne has raised.</p>
