   <p>With great satisfaction the news was received by every one, who understands the endeavors of the Germans in America, that steps have been undertaken to secure the future of the German theater in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The history of the German Theater of Chicago was, until lately, one of the most sorrowful chapters in the history of the German-Americanism of our city. But in the most critical hour a change took place which in the hope of all, will lead to a joyous goal; to preserve in the metropolis of the middle west a dignified institution for the large population of German descent.</p>
   <p>Only because it is so often misunderstood, and not because it is something new, it shall be confirmed once more, that we German-Americans shall not and cannot be influenced by any external events, when it comes to our natural adherence to America, to maintain our cultural connections with every thing that Germans have produced and still shall produce, upon artistic spheres.</p>
   <p>Today we fight as Americans, without regard to the victory over the German Empire.</p>
   <p>Even if the German Empire would cease to exist, the German people never would vanish <pb facs="5418474_7_0085.jpg" n="2"/>from the earth.</p>
   <p>And so in the deepest humiliation of their history, which the Germans have had to endure, all spiritual possessions of the German people were untouched; yes, they even blossomed more beautifully than before. The present war will preserve these spiritual possessions, unclouded, in which we participate and our duty is to introduce them into the spiritual life of our American nation.</p>
   <p>That this duty and this right were not denied to us by the intelligent people of this country and also by the government in Washington, for that the present state of war has furnished the best proof. And therefore, we could witness, that the seriousness and deepening of thought and feeling, which these conditions brought about, is the cause of the new establishment in Chicago of a German Theater. It secured an understanding and steadily growing public of admirers of art and beauty, through its ability to show a sensible selection of performances and tactful consideration of the possible. That should be our aim to preserve.</p>
   <p>The German-Americans, as has been proven, expect something more serious of their theater. This will not vanish without a trace with its director in future brighter times.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0086.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the fulfillment of its great problem in the brighter future, it will be one of those important factors of understanding to those thousands, who are not familiar with the German language, but who acknowledge German dramatic literature in an unenvious manner, and it will help to heal wounds, caused through the war in the relations to other countries.</p>
   <p>Therefore every one who acknowledges the endeavor of German-Americanism, in a proper manner, will not evade their duty to contribute to the maintenance of the German Theater in Chicago.</p>
