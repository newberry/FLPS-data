   <p>An impressive demonstration in favor of the independent-progressive presidential candidate, Senator Robert M. La Follette, was this year's German-day celebration of the German-American citizens' union, when yesterday afternoon, about fifteen thousand men and women of German extraction, assembled at the picnic held in Riverview Park. A vast crowd was in the park by two o'clock.</p>
   <p>By four o'clock the flags and banners of the officially participating societies and organizations were placed on the speaker's platform, and shortly afterwards the honorary president of the citizens' unions, Mr. Louis Link, opened the speech-making program. Singing tendered by the massed choir under the direction of Hans Biedermann filled out the pauses between each speech. With great force were the songs, "This is the Day of the Lord" and "Keep Up Your Hope" and "Harmony", rendered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Link opened the speeches and presented the other speakers. He welcomed the great number of festival guests, explained the aims of the festivity and protested <pb facs="5418474_7_1413.jpg" n="2"/>energetically against the treatment of German-Americans during the war. "Nothing", he said, "lies further from the citizens of German descent than to form a state within a state, but they could demand and with perfect right to be allowed to assemble at a festival like the present one in order to point out the merits, which their forbearers added to the cultural development of the country."</p>
   <p>After him, Paster Alfred E. Meyer, took the word. He dwelt upon the achievements of citizens of German extraction in all sphere of human endeavors, and at the conclusion of his speech praised Robert M. La Follette. "It cannot be too often stated that German blood, German art, and German character have been presented to this country; not often enough can it be pointed out that German efficiency, German industry, German loyalty, German piety, and German ideals have contributed to the up-building of the United States. Without the energetic assistance of the German element, America would not occupy the height of culture on which it stands today. The union of the United States would never have achieved the position of respect it enjoys today; the disgraceful slavery would never have been abolished; the liberty of <pb facs="5418474_7_1414.jpg" n="3"/>the press would not have been maintained, and the far west would not have been opened to culture.</p>
   <p>The speaker gave a summary of German history in America, beginning with Franz Daniel Pastorius, who with a small band of Meunonites from Krefeld, started the first pure German settlement, Germantown. He continued, "If America, through the collaboration of Germans, has achieved its political independence and greatness, then the importance of the Germans in regard to the cultural development of the country, is even more intense and far reaching. They were Germans mostly who cleared the virgin forests and founded villages and cities in the desert. Apart from this, the influence of the Germans upon the intellectual life of the nation is undeniable.</p>
   <p>"With pride can we say; there is no territory of progressive achievements, in which the Germans have not participated. Germans have given this country a great deal, but it has not yet fulfilled its mission. We are facing a crisis, which is more dangerous than those who are always squinting towards the eyes of their masters in <pb facs="5418474_7_1415.jpg" n="4"/>Wall Street, are able to dream of. The people's liberty has been and still is being tramped upon. Instead of the shining torch of the goddess of liberty, the whip became a symbol of this country, especially towards the German-Americans.</p>
   <p>"From the heart of the oppressed masses rings the prayer: 'Lord give us a man, a Washington, a Jefferson, a Lincoln, a man to whose soul the distress of his people will appeal and prompt him to a sacrificing deed'."</p>
   <p>"And the prayer was answered", the speaker said, "We have such a man, and this man is Robert M. La Follette."</p>
