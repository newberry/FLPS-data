   <p>Almost 60,000 men, women and children of German descent filled the vast amphitheater on the shores of Lake Michigan. They had come to prove anew that they had not forgotten their old homeland, and wanted to show their gratitude. More magnificent and impressive than ever before was this German Day.</p>
   <p>More splendid and brilliant than ever before was also the parade, which extended for miles and which opened the celebration. From the first sound of the dashing military band, to the last goal of the football match which concluded the festival - it was a steady series of glorious events and performances.</p>
   <p>Official America was also present at the festival and participated heartily and actively. A United States senator was chosen as the speaker of the day. High officials of this great metropolitan city led by their mayor, occupied the platform. The postmaster was also present as well as other representatives from the state of Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1391.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every participant at yesterday's celebration must have felt that it was a demonstration of which the German element of Chicago might be proud.</p>
