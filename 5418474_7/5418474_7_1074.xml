   <p>The general meeting of the German Day Alliance takes place this evening. At this meeting the executive committee will be elected. As is well known, the last German Day celebration was a great success in every respect. For this success the president of the German Day was chiefly responsible. It is easy to understand why Mr. Gustave A. Brand does not seek re-election to this difficult and responsible position. He certainly has earned the right to rest on his laurels.</p>
   <p>This would not, however, be to the best interest of the German Day Alliance and the entire German community of Chicago. It is easy to understand why there are, at present, many candidates for the president's office. Why not? It is an honor, indeed, to be at the head of this association, and those German-Americans who feel called upon, and qualified, to play a leader's role have a perfect right to be candidates for the position.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This situation, however, hides great dangers. For, where there are many candidates, quite often the candidate whom the majority considers best qualified is not elected, but instead a compromise candidate is chosen after a series of unsuccessful ballots. This compromise candidate, whom nobody really wanted, consequently finds himself in a difficult and embarrassing position right from the start. This danger should be avoided, and it can be avoided if Mr. Brand accepts re-election.</p>
   <p>It is also possible that this year's great success will give rise to all kinds of strange ideas and egotistical projects. This, also, is only human, and the delegates who allow themselves to be influenced by such considerations might have the best intentions in the world. But all the delegates should remember one thing: They are meeting tonight as the official and acknowledged representatives of the German community of Chicago. They are responsible to all the members of their race in Chicago for their decisions and acts.</p>
   <p>The German-American citizens may therefore expect of the delegates that they <pb facs="5418474_7_1076.jpg" n="3"/>fully grasp their duties and the importance of the occasion and, renouncing all egotistic desires and endeavors, act courageously in the general interest. This they owe to their German blood and to their brothers and sisters of German stock.</p>
