   <p>This leaves a surplus of $328.59. Oscar Schmidt made a motion that the sponsors who have not yet called for their money should be requested to see <pb facs="5418474_7_0877.jpg" n="3"/>John Buehler immediately. G. A. Christmann reported that he still has $25 in his treasury. I. C. Meyer made a motion that the sum be given to Christmann as remuneration for his services. Christmann thanked the assembly but declined.</p>
   <p>The music committee reported that the $25 which was to be paid to Miss Butler might be returned [by them] because the lady was indisposed at the time and did not sing. A number of small bills were ordered paid. Twenty-five dollars was allotted to R. Kaiser, one of the singers. He had pledged $100 to the festival fund and later $100 for decorations; he asserted that he had lost $50 in selling bouquets.</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued on what to do with the surplus of $328.59 because I. E. Meyer made a motion that suitable presents should be bought with the money to reward Mr. Amberg, president of the North American Singers' Alliance, and the three secretaries, Oscar Schmidt, William Heinemann, and G. A. Christmann.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0878.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Messrs. Buehler and Maas objected to this disposition of the fund. Madlener wanted the Deutsche Gesellschaft [German Society, a benevolent association] to be the beneficiary, but Christmann was not in favor of it. Finally the matter was postponed, and upon John Hoffmann's motion a committee consisting of Messrs. Meyer, Madlener, and Hettich was appointed to make a report at the next meeting regarding the cost of presents [medals] for the four gentlemen previously mentioned.</p>
   <p>On Buehler's motion it was decided to print five hundred copies of the detailed account of receipts and expenditures and to send them to all the sponsors who had signed the guaranty fund.</p>
