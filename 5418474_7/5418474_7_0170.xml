   <p>Already on March 1, the Pygmies the celebrated German dwarf theatre company will start a short engagement in the Columbia Theatre here in Chicago. They had a sensational success in New York, Philadelphia, and other towns of the East during this season. They will remain here for two weeks as they have been contracted to go from here to St. Louis. Their fame is well founded in all parts of the world and there is no doubt that they will also conquer the favor of the Chicago public. They range in age from 18 to 43 years and are not taller than 21/2 to 3 feet. They are first class actors and singers. The first performance will be "The Magic Apprentice" by Robert Breitenbach; music by Carl Josef. This is decoration scenery of the first rank. The play has 4 acts and 9 living pictures of which one is always more attractive than the previous one. The title role "The Magic Apprentice" a smart Berlin boy type will be played by Miss Selma Goerner the excellent soubrette of the Pygmies Company.</p>
   <p>The party consists of 200 members, actors, singers, and dancers. They are so universal in their play, that they have been called the little Neiningers under which name they are generally known in Germany. This name has been given to them by the Czar of Russia when they were playing at his winter palace Gatchina during a three-month stay in St.Petersburg.</p>
