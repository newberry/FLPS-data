   <p>It is a pleasant task indeed to criticize theatrical performances, when they are on the order of yesterday's presentation at Hooley's Theater. The play was fault-less in every respect, including the minutest detail, and one would have to be an irredeemable grouch and fault-finder if he objected to anything.</p>
   <p>The parts were properly apportioned; the ensemble was good; every member knew his part well; no one appeared or left at inopportune times; elegant, pleasing costumes prevailed throughout; and the only item deserving reproach is attributable to the public, because some vacant seats were noticeable, whereas a sold-out house would have been no more than the performance deserved. Those who might have been present will now greatly regret their absence, when they learn from these columns--or hear from their friends--what an excellent performance they missed.</p>
   <p>The plot of the play proved to be a very auspicious choice. It brings to the fore <pb facs="5418474_7_0312.jpg" n="2"/>those "good friends" who are ever willing to accept favors but are never home when reciprocation is expected; that class which envies and yet, under the cloak of friendship, has the effrontery to resort to insolence; the very crowd to promote a family scandal whenever an opportunity presents itself.....[Translator's note: Here followed the interesting story of duplicity and apparent unfaithfulness of the young wife which is omitted in translation.]....Mr. Meyer, as the staunch friend, father and husband, "Caussade," proved very acceptable, and he gave an excellent impersonation of the Frenchman. Miss Helene Kuhn as "Caussade's" wife showed unusual accomplishments; whoever saw her yesterday must regret that she did not appear in a similarly suitable role at her first performance. She not only presented an imposing and beautiful personality, but her highly effective diction--proof of great culture--as well as her unusual ability to indicate emotions by her facial expressions, captivated the public.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Every member of the cast was enthusiastically acclaimed by the critic. The article covers more than one column.]</p>

   <p>Rarely has a German performance been received with more hearty approbation. Not only between acts, but after the final curtain as well, the actors were recalled, and the consensus of opinion was that yesterday we witnessed the best German performance ever given in Chicago. May we be blessed with similar repetitions!</p>
   <p>City Theater of the West Side</p>
   <p>"The Two Orphans," a play in five acts, is of French origin and proves ineffective as it was poorly translated into English, and then in a similarly mediocre manner, into German; the latter contains an overly large supply of Americanisms. But, in spite of the inferior vehicle, the performance itself was very good and the public appeared to appreciate the presentation very much....</p>
   <p>Future announcements:....The play, "Mein Leopold," was given yesterday evening at the Concordia Theater.....</p>
   <p>The performance was not as well attended as it should have been, considering the efforts incident to its presentation. [The comments about the actors are more or less favorable.]</p>
