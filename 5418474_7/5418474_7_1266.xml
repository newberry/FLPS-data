   <p>Last Tuesday night at the World's Fair many visitors attended the dedication of the German building prepared by German-Americans for visitors of German descent. The building originally was reserved for the Poles, but their plans fell through because of a lack of funds, whereupon the World's Fair administration, at the request of the German-Americans, placed the building at the latter's disposal. The German Reich was not represented at the dedication ceremony. Consul General Dr. Hugo Simon explained his absence by pointing out that only the American Stars and Stripes was flying from the building, that the flag of the German Reich was not displayed.</p>
   <p>This is what happened: The members of the German-American Committee had originally agreed to display the Austrian and the Swiss flags along with the Stars and Stripes, although even then voices were heard demanding that the <pb facs="5418474_7_1267.jpg" n="2"/>American flag alone should fly over the building. Later, groups which were closely associated with the National Socialists demanded that the swastika flag also be displayed. But since no agreement could be reached on this point, it was decided to raise only The Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
   <p>The members of the Committee who objected to displaying the swastika flag obviously thought that this flag might be regarded by the visitors to the building and the exhibition not as part of the emblem of the German Reich, but as a National Socialist Party flag, or even as an anti-Semitic symbol. According to a decree of the German Chancellor, published in this issue of the Abendpost, the swastika flag is in fact a part of the Reich's national emblem. The latter thus consists virtually of two flags--the well-known black, white, and red colors, and the swastika flag. Wherever the German Reich shows its colors, these two flags must be displayed simultaneously.</p>
   <p>Since only the black, white, and red flag was to be displayed on the German-American building, but not the swastika, the Consul General's assertion that he <pb facs="5418474_7_1268.jpg" n="3"/>could not be present unless the swastika was also hoisted can in a sense be justified.</p>
   <p>Of course, the German-American building is not at all an exhibition building of the German Reich. The German Reich officially declined to be represented at the Fair. It was only after the official German representatives had returned to Germany from their visit to the opening ceremonies at the Fair that it was decided in Berlin, rather belatedly, to send a number of items to the exposition, and to use the space which was gladly turned over for this purpose in the building of the German-Americans, The exhibition pieces are still en route from Germany. But even this display will not make any change in the relations of the German-American group and the building. The group is, after all, the landlord, and has the authority to decide which flags shall be displayed over the building.</p>
   <p>The group declined to hoist any flag other than The Star-Spangled Banner when it was learned that the swastika flag had to be displayed together with the black, white, and red flag, because the swastika, as has already been mentioned, is <pb facs="5418474_7_1269.jpg" n="4"/>regarded by most Americans and German-Americans as a party flag and as a symbol of anti-Semitism. German-Americans who are not at all anti-Semitic and who count many German Jews in their ranks, simply would not understand the significance of a swastika flag's being displayed on a building which has been dedicated to them and over which they have charge. No doubt many would refuse to enter the building if they were to see the swastika flag waving over it.</p>
   <p>The attitude of the Consul General and that of the German group can be justified, each on different grounds. For the sake of preserving harmony within the German element here, let us express the hope that some agreement or compromise will soon be reached on the flag question.</p>
