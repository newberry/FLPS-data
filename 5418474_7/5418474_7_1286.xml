   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the executive committee of the German group of the World's Fair was, presided over by Ernst J. Hruetgen, and as usual combined with lunchoon, was well attended.</p>
   <p>Among others, there was present a section of the German Club with their chairman of the World's Fair committee, J. F. Immel. The gentleman stated that it is their special duty to work hand in hand with the executive committee of the German group. They were, of course, received with open arms.</p>
   <p>Beside the usual business transactions, such as reports from the various committees, enrolling of many Ladies and Gentlemen, etc., a quite interesting debate took place dealing with the past activity of the German group.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1287.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Various suggestions were made, such as how to make better propaganda for the good work, and especially how to procure the Funds needed. As reported by Mrs. Jonas, mere than 1600 propaganda buttons are now in circulation. It proapted Mr. Kruetgen to remark that the workers of the group must not rest until at least 10,000 of these buttons have been distribated and paid for. This remark As followed with the earnest appeal to work not only among the members of the German group, but also song all Germans, toward the success of the exposition.</p>
   <p>Secretary Haake announced that next Wednesday there will be an evening of entertainment and propaganda on the part of the German group, to which everybody is cordially invited. Addission price is only twenty-five cents per person.</p>
   <p>A combined committee of the three committees already in existence was entrusted with working out a number of suggestions aiming at propaganda on a larger <pb facs="5418474_7_1288.jpg" n="3"/>scale. Included are the methods to organize the parishes, to solicit the interest of German-American businessmen the country over, to give merit badges and diplomas for those contributing larger sues, and many similar activities.</p>
   <p>Because of the approaching holidays, the next meeting of the executive committee will not convene until January 9.</p>
