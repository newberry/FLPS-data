   <p>The first anniversary of the Germania Ladies Choir took place yesterday at De Berg Garden, corner of Evanston Avenue and Halsted Street and was such a great success, that the young club has every cause to look with confidence to the future. The 35 members with their families, acquaintances and friends were all present and the general humor and spirits was so excelled that all present had a most wonderful time. In the evening, members of other friendly associations appeared, and took part in the gay festival. The arrangement committee consisted of Mrs. Seil, Mrs. Pankonin, Mrs. Fitzpatrick and Miss Kraft and they are to be congratulated about the exceptional way they conducted the affairs of the evening.</p>
   <p>The officers of the club are: Mrs. Schlau, President; Mrs. Spindler, Vice President; Miss King, Secretary; Miss Stettin, Financial Secretary; Miss Wiese, Treasurer, Business manager.</p>
