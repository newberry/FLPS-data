   <p>Today's Charity-Concert at the German Village.</p>
   <p>To-night at 7 P.M., at the Auditorium the farewell party given by "Geheimer Regierung's Rath Wermuth" (Official German Government Representative) will take place. Mr. Wermuth has sent cut 300 invitations to his friends and acquaintances, and by his popularity it is expected that all invited will appear. Next Thursday, he will depart for New York. As we mentioned several times before, there will be held to-night at the German Village, a great Charity Concert by the two German Military Bands. The Concert begins at 3 P.M. and ends after 10 P.M. Music Director Ruscheweyh and bandmaster Herold have arranged a highly interesting program for this day. As is well known a Saturday is the most frequented day of the fair and the number of the visitors will be a large one at any rate. The management of the fair has, following an Appeal of the directors of the German Village, consented not to collect any percentages of the proceeds which go to the families of the injured and dead firemen of the World's Fair fire.- <pb facs="5418474_7_1633.jpg" n="2"/>Yesterday's concert in "Old Vienna" for the same purpose brought an amount of hundreds of dollars.</p>
   <p>Also the German Restaurant of Triacca in the Industrial Palace, gives today and tomorrow a Charity Concert for which no admission will be charged, but only free donations will be collected.</p>
