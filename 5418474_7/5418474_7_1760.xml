   <p>The final accounting of the song festival will probably take more time than expected, and the matter will probably not be closed before next week, even if the finance committee holds its final session this afternoon. This is doubtful, though, since the last reports of the board were not submitted to the comptrollers, and no bills were presented for acceptance, which caused the gentlemen in charge of financial affairs to adjourn their meeting until next week, and at that time a meeting will also be held of the subscribers to the festival, and dividends will be declared.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon three of the lunch-counter owners of the picnic called on the comptrollers and asked for their twenty-five per cent commission, but since the request involved money, and no written statement was presented, the gentlemen were referred to the finance committee.</p>
   <p>The music committee closed its books, and its expenditures were about $400 less than the fund allocated to it.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1761.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The committee on decorations tried yesterday forenoon to auction off the pictures at the Exposition Building. Only one offer was received, $60 for twelve paintings, and so the committee decided to postpone the sale.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind again all interested persons that the last session of the finance committee will be held this afternoon at three o'clock, and all presidents and secretaries of the various festival committees are cordially invited to attend, to submit their reports, and to countersign all belated bills which may yet be received, so that final presentation can be made to the festival committee within the scheduled time.</p>
