   <p>Yesterday's program in the North Side Turner Hall offered compositions, which are not heard very often here. The artistic director, Mr. Joseph Schwickenrath, left it to the audience, to make their selection, and therefore a program was accomplished, which carried the names of such well known composers as Kendelssohn, Berlioz, Massenet, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Franz von Blon and others little-known here.</p>
   <p>As it has ever since the beginning of the season, the Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Richard Czerwonky, played excellently. Each individual number was performed in a technically perfect manner, and created such stores of applause, that repeatedly additional pieces had to be given, which were played just as buoyantly. It would be an idle undertaking, attempting to call special attention to some numbers. Mendelssohn's "The Hebrides", Massenet's graceful "Scenes Pittoresques", Rimsky-Korsakoff's melancholy "Song of India", Berlioz's gay "Hungarian March", I. Roza's pretty waltz "Over the Waves", and Franz von Plon's "World Peace", were all played with musical understanding.</p>

   <p>A comparatively wide space in yesterday's concert was filled by the soloist, Miss Ebba Sundstrom, a young violinist, appearing with several numbers on the program and achieving decisive success. She played with temperament and showed a surprisingly brilliant technique for her age and surprised with the fullness and beauty of her tone. Bruch, Schubert and Brahms were played. Bruch's G Minor Concerto makes great demands on the player, but Miss Sundstrom did full justice to it. Especially successful was she with the Adagio. Maybe even better than Bruch were her renditions of Schubert and Brahms. The "Ave Maria" and "Hungarian Dance" were performances of which the young artist might well be proud.</p>
