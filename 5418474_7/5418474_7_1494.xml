   <p>The Club "Saxonia" celebrated yesterday at the Northside Athletic Hall their great festival in commemoration of its 30 years existence and to dedicate two new flags. Among the large gathering were 250 guests from other cities. Congratulations came from many places, even from Germany and Switzerland, wherever Saxonian Clubs existed. The "presentation of colors" took place in the midst of a excellent concert program. A number of orchestras, song clubs. Men's Choirs, etc. gave splendid performances and after each one a thundering applause greeted them.</p>
   <p>The ceremony itself was intreduced with the song, "This is the day of the Lord." The official speech was rendered by the President of the Club, Mr. H. R. Gentsch, with eloquent words he explained the meaning and importance of this act to the attentive listening crowd. Then he accepted from two young ladies the two beautiful new flags, one a saxonian and the other an American....</p>
   <p>After the ceremony and the concert all enjoyed a very sociable evening and dancing until late into the night.</p>

   <p>The whole affair was well arranged and carried out with Saxonian sociableness.</p>
