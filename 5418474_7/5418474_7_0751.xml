   <p>The regular Sunday afternoon concert at the North Side Turnhall yesterday, appeared to be a particularly animated affair. The patrons came in large numbers and seemed very jovial; after all, we had nice weather again. As usual, all the selections played under the leadership of M. Ballmann were received with great acclaim. The conductor provided exceptional opportunities for the soloists, particularly; the harpist Frank Varallo, the flutist August Winhardt, and the trombonist Jerry Chimera.</p>
   <p>The latter part of the concert aroused the public to enthusiasm,which sentiment prevailed to the end, since the leader was liberal in playing encores. Although little rest was given the members of the orchestra, the musicians seemingly enjoyed it. Miss Amalie J. Schultz proved to be a highly talented singer, endowed with a splendid voice. However, she gave the impression of being entirely too modest, but that, and <pb facs="5418474_7_0752.jpg" n="2"/>likewise her art, brought her prompt recognition.</p>
