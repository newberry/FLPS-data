   <p>Thanksgiving Day is scarcely over, and now plans are being made to demonstrate by deeds the gratitude which is so often expressed in words. The great benefit festival provides Germans with an opportunity to help their less fortunate brothers. The festival is being prepared by all German and German Austro-Hungarian groups of Chicago. It is proposed that all those who can afford to do so should aid those who have neither jobs nor money. Their need is great and winter is at the door. But these unfortunates have many countrymen who are able to assist them, or can at least help by attending the festival along with thousands of others. There should be no empty seats Wednesday night at Medinah Temple. The efforts of all those who helped with the preparations for the festival, and the co-operation of others who promised to contribute should be rewarded by huge crowds of visitors, not because the members of the organization committee or the active participants would like to see "their efforts <pb facs="5418474_7_1304.jpg" n="2"/>rewarded". No, they have in mind only one thing--that as much assistance as is possible should be given to as many persons as are in need. This, to be sure, will amply reward all participants.</p>
   <p>It is urgent that the sale of tickets show a great increase the last few days before the festival. "Buy tickets!" should be the slogan, and still more of them should be sold. This should be the motto of all those who have contributed nothing to the charity festival. Do not wait to see how it is going to turn out but co-operate now that something may come of it. Each person can do some thing to make the festival a success. "Work, do not sit idle!" should be the dictum of all Germans whether from German, German-Austrian, or Hungarian boroughs.</p>
   <p>One can buy tickets everywhere, but the German group is directed to the following places: Lorenz Schlegel, treasurer of the German group, 2825 North Mozart Street; telephone, Belmont 6508 <pb facs="5418474_7_1305.jpg" n="3"/>Theodore Pilgram, 3808 Osgood Street Building of the Gegenseitiger Unter-stuetzungs-Verein (Mutual Aid Society), 2934 West Washington Boulevard; telephone, Nevada 1711</p>

   <p>The German-Austrian and Hungarian groups are directed to the following places:</p>

   <p>John Hess, 1638 North Luna Avenue; telephone, Berkshire 1996</p>

   <p>When the gates of the Medinah Temple, Cass and Ohio Streets, open Wednesday <pb facs="5418474_7_1307.jpg" n="5"/>night for the festival, an extremely interesting program is in store for the visitors. The festival will provide good evidence that many of our German citizens were ready to devote their services to the good cause. Names like Lippich, Holstein, Bratt and others--the program is not yet complete--show that many of our German theater artists are again ready to help. A number of costumed performances, dances, and songs will present the color and harmony of the homeland. The Turners and various other athletes will compete with one another in splendid feats. Johnk's orchestra will play accompaniments to the dances and to the athletic accomplishments--and who will challenge this anticipation? Our singers will perform under the direction of Reinhold Walter's singing, to quote a passage from the "Song of the Nightingale," "old and lovely songs". In addition, a piano artist, Madame Renee Engel-Ridge, will perform.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bernhard de Vry is the manager of the festival, and Mr. Georg Weideling is the promoter.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1308.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>And now, it is up to the festival. It is up to us to help our countrymen. The festival begins Wednesday night at 8 o'clock.</p>
