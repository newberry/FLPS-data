   <p>That as far as German singing and cheerfulness are concerned German women are not inferior to men, was proved by the Concordia Ladies Singing Society at its first family evening and dance last Saturday. The Uhlhorn Hall was not large enough to insure that there was a chair for every friend and acquaintance, but the enjoyment and cheerfulness was all the greater. Here again it was clear that a festively decorated hall contributes a great deal to the pleasant mood of those present. A full house, the excellent and lively music of the well-known conductor, Helmut Steinmetz, kitchen and cellar well supplied--what more could one desire?</p>
   <p>A part of the entertainment was the excellent rendition by the ladies of three songs, which were heartily applauded by the audience. Although the Society was formed only a few months ago, the ladies have made excellent <pb facs="5418474_7_0471.jpg" n="2"/>progress in their singing. Moreover, solos by guests won enthusiastic applause. In pleasant mood, young and old danced late into the night and when they left, took with them the certainty that they had spent a few pleasant hours among the members of the Concordia Ladies Singing Society.</p>
