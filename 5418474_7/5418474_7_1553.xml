   <p>The German Benefit Ball At The Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The Fifth Annual Ball of the German American Benefit Club was held yesterday at the Auditorium. The ambitious efforts of the various committees, who had worked in its interest for many weeks brought a harvest of gold. The committee showed commendable economy and the inevitable result was that the proceeds of the festival amounted to about $13,000, which is to be distributed to various benevolent institutions.</p>
   <p>The doors were opened at 8 o'clock and, as we entered we heard the melodies of De Baugh's Orchestra floating through the gorgeously illuminated hall. The gentlemen of the Reception Committee were all in their respective places and before long, their duties required their full time. The orchestra played Sousa's "Presidential Polonaise" which heralded the ball and our lively youth enjoyed the sixteen following dance numbers, which were hardly sufficient to satisfy them, since alternating numbers of "Promenade music" <pb facs="5418474_7_1554.jpg" n="2"/>were interspersed. Once more we mention the names of those officials and directors of the Club, who, as chairmen of the various committees deserve special credit for their labors. John Koelling, President; E. Lehmann and E. H. Seeman, VicePresidents; etc; Julius Loewenthal, printed matter; Music, Dr. H. F. Sauer; Press, F. W. Blocki.</p>
