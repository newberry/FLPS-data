   <p>Last Saturday evening, the Germania Maennerchor gave its first concert, which was well attended despite the extremely cold weather, which made transportation difficult. The chorus, which numbers forty members, rendered the various songs under the direction of its able conductor, Otto Lob, with precision and good taste, and the audience was very generous with its applause. It was especially delighted with "Fruehling Ohn' Ende," by C. Reinecke, and with the sailors chorus from "Afrikanerin," by G. Meyerbeer. The chorus has very good talent and will fill a long-felt need for music by a good male chorus, providing the members are faithful in attending rehearsals. Otto Lob, who also directs the Fidelia Choral Society, will begrudge neither time nor patience in his endeavor to raise the standard of the chorus so that it will compare favorably with similar organizations in New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. We hope that he will be successful, and we shall follow the progressive development of the Germania Maennerchor with great interest and satisfaction.</p>
