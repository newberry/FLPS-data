   <p>Sunday night the German People's Theater was opened on the North Side. The house, which has a seating capacity of 600 to 800, was filled to the point of overflow, and the public showed itself very appreciative of the energetic endeavors of the woman director, Mrs. Thielemann.</p>
   <p>(The very extensive prologue in verse, reprinted by the Staats Zeitung, was followed by a tableau representing Columbia, Germania, and the Goddess of Liberty, while the music played "Hail Columbia," "Die Wacht am Rhein," and "Heil Dir im Siegeskrant." Then the comedy, "Frederic the Great as Match-maker" was received with much acclaim. For the time being shows will be staged every Sunday. Mrs. Thielmann stands high in the favor of the German public of the North Side, and if she manages to please its taste, one can give the German People's Theater a favorable prognosis.)</p>
