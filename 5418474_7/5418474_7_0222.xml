   <p>The German Theatre in Mueller's Hall was well attended last night, because the public wanted to show its appreciation to the popular actress, Mrs. Johanna Horn, who gave a benefit performance. The audience was very fortunate also in the selection of the play. Although we have seen "Philippine Welser" played somewhat better, nevertheless our claims for a people's Theatre were fulfilled by the performance.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Horn, who played the title role of the piece, deserved praise; Uhlirch was very good as Archduke Ferdinand, Mr. Horn as Emperor; also Mr. Kammer, as "Franz von Thurn", took great pains to play his role well. The married couple Welser was played by Mr. Bonner and Mrs. Hauser, who proved themselves to be excellent actors. Miss Roemer in the role of a page deserves credit and Mr. Bobene as "Bohemian Peasant" helped to make a success of the whole. A large number of bouquets were given to the beneficiary from her many friends. The stage-management of Mr. Bonnet deserves special mention.</p>
