<title level="a">ARION MALE CHORUS GIVES SUCCESSFUL CONCERT</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Arion Male Chorus of the North Side has reason to be satisfied with the success of yesterday's fall concert. An audience in festive mood and eager to applaud filled the great hall of the Lincoln Turnhalle. They enjoyed the presentations offered by their hosts under the qualified leadership of Director H. A. Rehberg, also by several affiliated singing organizations, the tenor Lorenz Boon, and Bernie Hartwig's orchestra.</p>
   <p>The concert was opened with the dignified comic opera overture by Kela Bela, by the orchestra under the personal direction of Herr Hartwig. The further presentations by the orchestra and two songs by Lorenz Boon and his well-trained voice found lively applause as they injected a welcome diversion into the program.</p>
   <p>The main part of the program was of course handled by the host chorus, which acquitted itself as usual, in a laudable manner. As to the number of <pb facs="5418474_7_0465.jpg" n="2"/>active singers, the North Side Arion may not be one of the strongest singing clubs, but its singing material is good, and Director Rehberg managed to get out the best in them. There was continuous contact between director and singers, and thus success was certain. The Ladies' Chorus Lyra, likewise under Rehberg's direction and well known for its achievements, along with the Ambrosius Male Chorus under its vice-director Joseph Keller, and with the Hilarion Male Chorus, young and quite able--singing three songs in the language of the country--all did their best to bring about the success of the concert, and deserve full recognition.</p>
   <p>The festival was well prepared in other ways, too, for which principal thanks are due to the fest committee consisting of the following gentlemen: Ernst Durant, chairman; P. J. Metzen, secretary; August Haag, treasurer; Hettinger, John Mosch, and Emil Metzel. Added to them is--by dint of his office--the president of the organization, George Maier, who took this occasion to thank Director Rehberg, who had served this choir faithfully for thirty-three years, and to present him to the guests of the festival.</p>
