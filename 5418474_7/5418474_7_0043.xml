   <p>A rather large audience greeted Rudy Hille yesterday when he appeared in the role of "Baron Oettinghausen" in the delightful operetta "Love and Hesitation", by Oscar Strauss. It was a benefit performance for Mr. Hille, and to judge from the spontaneous applause which took on the proportions of a demonstration, he has become one of the favorite artists of the German theatre public of Chicago.</p>
   <p>His equally able feminine lead was Helene Holstein, who portrayed the character "Countess Stella." With her extra-ordinaryly lovely voice and her excellent dramatic talents, she held the audience under her spell. Then too, Edna Werner, in her role of the daughter of a coachman, the winner of the first prize in the Grand Lottery, surpassed herself in last night's production. As played by Ernst Robert, the reformed father who would only accept a baron as his son-in-law <pb facs="5418474_7_0044.jpg" n="2"/>kept the audience in a spasm of laughter. Angelo Lippich, in the role of the footman, was simply unsurpassable. Hans Zoder's interpretation of the lovesick reservist, whose chance never came, was quite realistic. Furthermore, the two well-known comedians, Kurt Kupfer and Johanna Eisemann portrayed the older members of the aristocracy most amusingly.</p>
   <p>The interpretation of minor parts was also in good hands, all of whom combined their efforts to make this a memorable performance. The orchestra was under the direction of Waldemar Christoph.</p>
   <p>Many beautiful floral pieces, as well as other gifts, were brought upon the stage and presented to Mr. Hille amidst loud and long applause.</p>
