   <p>At the Northside Turner Hall the annually arranged Schiller celebration took place and the members and their friends of the Schwaben verein came in great numbers in spite of the unfavorable weather. The festival was this time given in the form of a banquet and brought honor to the arrangers. As especially invited quests attended the Gentlemen, Julius Rosenthal, Assistant Librarian E. F. Gauss, Arnold Holinger and the German Consul Dr. Karl Buenz. The latter was introduced to the assembly by the president Wilhelm Schoening as the first festival orator. Dr. Buenz closed his well applauded speech with the warning call of the great poet: "To the beloved fatherland, be united. Hold fast to it with your entire heart. Were are the strong roots of your power; there, in that strange land, you must stand alone." Additional speeches were held by the Messrs. Gauss, Rosenthal and Arnold Holinger. Mr. Rosenthal suggested in his short speech to invite for future Schiller celebrations also the ladies. The Senefelder Lieder Kranz sang several songs in the usual masterly way.</p>
