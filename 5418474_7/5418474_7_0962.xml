   <p>The audience at yesterday afternoon's concert witnessed an unexpected sensation. Mr. Von Bülow revealed not only his art as a pianist, but also his nature as a man, unafraid of being rude and vulgar. Shortly after 2 o'clock he appeared at the piano and asked the audience for permission to make a few remarks. He first thanked the Americans for their wonderful reception, but added that he could not say the same about his compatriots, the "Dutch" (Mr. Bülow's own expression). They had criticized his program because it was too classical and had advised him to play, rather, "Home, Sweet Home", "Last Rose of Summer" or "Yankee Doodle". He thanked them for the suggestions and said that he would comply with it. He thereupon played the Marseillaise with great fury, as if he had been the avenging Gallic nation.</p>
