   <p>Attendance in the Lincoln Turnhalle was very large. The song evening, which was arranged by the United Men's choruses yesterday afternoon in the Lincoln Turnhalle, was a great success. Because it was intended as an introduction to the Golden Jubilee of the United Men's choruses in October, it can be expected that this jubilee of the great singing organizations with their 800 members will receive well deserved honors. Yesterday's concert proved how the great number of singers, "marched separately" to meet the great day of the jubilee.</p>
   <p>Good Organization.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the societies before the beginning of the concert drew the numbers in which order the societies should sing, and on the right side of the stage was displayed in turn the number and the name of the society which had it. Everything was prepared in an exemplary manner and carried through precisely.</p>
   <p>The festival committee was under the direction of Theodore Birkham, and consisted of the following gentlemen: Paul M. Wagner, W. Frankel, J. Ruhl, A. Glanche, ticket treasurer and Messrs. J. Giese, secretary; Schneidewind, <pb facs="5418474_7_0562.jpg" n="2"/>treasurer; Hieb, Beron and Arendt. Mr. C. F. Pegenan was president of the music committee. In his welcoming address, Mr. Birkham expressed his great pleasure over the large attendance, and pointed to the Golden Jubilee on October 25th, which, in consideration of the big crowd to be expected, will be celebrated by a mass concert in the new opera house.</p>
