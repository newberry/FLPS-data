   <p>The members of the Women's Club visited the above mentioned institution yesterday. The large throng enjoyed itself thoroughly. The ideal weather increased the exuberance which soon manifested itself. The dense foliage and the refreshing shade from the Park's stately trees provided a scenic splendor, suitable for a painting. The inmates must indeed be happy to live in this magnificent environment during their declining years.</p>
   <p>It is a locality upon which a prodigal nature bestowed its blessings and where the aged are at the same time the enviable recipients of human love and benevolence. About one-half of the excursionists were children, after all, the outing was primarily arranged for their benefit. Their youthful enthusiasm and animation was indeed contagious and....affected the older ones in due time.</p>
   <p>The foot-races, merry-go-rounds, the swings and the dancing at the pavilion... <pb facs="5418474_7_1625.jpg" n="2"/>above all the usual prizes which were given to the youthful winners helped to increase the festive spirit. A list of the little ones who earned recognition for their Terpsichorean accomplishments follows: Tillie Heissler, Ed. Magerstadt....(eleven altogether). We must also include in our report, that Andreas Thalhofer, a watchmaker of No. 108 Van Buren Street, presented a beautiful clock which will be put in the entrance hall of the hospital annex. Mr. Oscar Schmoll's musical composition "Abendruhe" (Rest at the Evening Hour) which he dedicated to A. C. Hesing....has been published. Five hundred copies are available and he presented the entire edition to the home. The administration intends to have one of the local German music stores manage the sales campaign.</p>
