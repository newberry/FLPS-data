  <body>
   <p>Today, at 4.30 P. M., the Richard Wagner Maennerchor will give a concert in Wicker Park Hall, and it is taking this opportunity to honor its director, Mr. H. A. Rehberg, who has been directing this song-loving chorus for a quarter of a century. This is a second silver anniversary celebration which is being given the respected director by his grateful singers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rehberg is a well-known personage in singers' circles. His never-tiring zeal for German son is well known, and he does not feel at all annoyed at this time, either, at the idea of training his singers for a concert which is to stand out as a milestone in the history of the organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0536.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first part of the program is given over entirely to the art of singing. Friendly organizations, like the Westseite Saengerkranz, directed by Mr. Lohmueller, and the Damenchor Lyra, directed by H. A. Rehberg, kindly consented to participate and will enhance the beauty of the program. The second part of the program will, in addition to singing, be dedicated to the muse of gaiety. Individual artists will give recitations. Anyone who wishes to enjoy himself in these sad times should decide to accept the invitation, which is extended to singers, and to Germans in general, to attend this song festival given in honor of Mr. Rehberg.</p>
   <p>Naturally, there will be dancing after the concert, and good care will be taken to provide this jubilee with gay dance music. In the course of the evening those singers are to be honored who have been members of the Richard Wagner organization for many years. Mr. Rehberg will be glad to <pb facs="5418474_7_0537.jpg" n="3"/>extend his best wishes to his faithful singers who have cultivated German song with him for twenty-five years, and to thank them for working side by side with him and for making the Richard Wagner Maennerchor what it is today, namely, one of the foremost male choruses in the city of Chicago.</p>
