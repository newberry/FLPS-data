   <p>A brilliant performance was given at Hooley's Theater; a splendid entertainment indeed. The play "Quicksilver" proved a fortunate choice for Mr. [Emil] Hoechster. This comedy by Treptow is practically nothing but unadulterated nonsense; but it is of an ingratiating variety and the senseless, humorous situations are so grouped that the public, perforce, enjoys them. Thus, action, logical sequence, in fact, the very unlikeliness of the plot does not become apparent due to the swiftly moving, comic scenes which keep the audience in a constant state of merriment.</p>
   <p>It is a droll play and it was given in that manner. Everyone of the cast appeared to be imbued with the proper spirit and played with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The Chicago public seldom has an opportunity to witness a better performance; we are even inclined to assert--insofar as the selection of artists for the various parts is concerned, and in considering the ensemble playing, proper grouping in the scenes, and the thorough memorization--that this city has never seen anything <pb facs="5418474_7_0315.jpg" n="2"/>to equal it.....</p>
   <p>Miss Lina Wassmann as "Little Eve" was charming and played her naive part--which required considerable experience--with astounding self-assurance and was given generous acclaim. As an actress she possesses that excellent gift: interpretation. We hope that this will not be her only guest appearance.</p>
   <p>Miss Kuhn as "Ella" reached the same pinnacle, playing excellently and displaying great cleverness.</p>
   <p>Among the male parts Mr. Ravene undoubtedly had the most difficult assignment; he was entrusted with the role of the rather eccentric, absent-minded "Bruno Toll," and to say that the actor gave a perfect interpretation of the character is but a feeble recognition for his genuinely brilliant accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The other gentlemen were also very good. Mr. Koch, in his portrayal of the easily excitable professor, was in his element.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyer, who played the aged, reminiscent bonvivant was excellent.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0316.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Schober as the servant, and Mr. Puls, who had the part of the youthful bookworm, were very good. And we must not forget Miss Ahl--a very acceptable servant girl. Mrs. Claussen, elderly equestrian with torrid, undying passions, was brilliant.</p>
   <p>The play showed a profusion of good and bad jokes, and to this must be added that everything functioned admirably; that the intermissions were not overly long; that all participants were fully equal to their tasks; in short, a better performance could not be expected.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoechster deserves congratulations. A few more presentations of similar quality and he can rest assured that our theater patronizing public will give him staunch support.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Other performances given on the same day and appearing in the same column are listed.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0317.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The City Theater of the West Side</p>
   <p>"The Maid of Orleans", a tragedy in five acts by Friedrich von Schiller. The title roll was played by Miss Lina Waldau and she was fairly successful; however, her stoutness detracted somewhat. Public attendance was poor....</p>
   <p>Concordia Theater</p>
   <p>The announcement of a benefit performance for the capable director of the Theater resulted in a sold-out house. He chose the play "Der Freischuetz," an arrangement based on the opera by the same name. This offering as well as the popularity of the beneficiary proved an undeniable attraction. If one considers the difficulties which were encountered in giving the play, then one must admit that it was successful. But in regard to the singing--let us draw the veil of Christian love--we shall speak no evil. However, the costuming and scenery deserve approbation and therein everyone present will agree....Whether his lack of vocal qualities or figure were at fault in reconciling us with the part of "Max" is difficult to define, but something or other robbed us of that illusion, proved a <pb facs="5418474_7_0318.jpg" n="5"/>deterent to our imagination....[Translator's note: The critic shows a more amenable disposition to other members of the cast.] Considered as a whole, the performance was a success.</p>
