   <p>Next Wednesday, October 17th, the Chicago Singverein will open its twenty-fifth season in the hall of St. Paul's Church, corner Orchard Street and Kemper Place. The director, Herr Walter M. Steindel, will submit his plans for the coming year at that time.</p>
   <p>Ladies endowed with voices, also gentlemen who would like to take part in the silver anniversary, are cordially invited to be present that evening, as performance of a great work is contemplated. The club, as is known, can look back with satisfaction to its past, for in the twenty-four years of its existence it has accomplished a great deal. The Singverein has ever been animated by truly artistic aspirations, yet it never has lacked a genuine love for mankind, since almost all of its concerts have been given for the sake of charity.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0473.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the last twenty-four years, the Singverein has spent about twenty-four thousand dollars for charitable purposes. In order to give a conception of its efforts and performances, only the following deeds need be mentioned:</p>
