   <p>The German-Americans of Chicago celebrated "German Day" yesterday. It was an incomparable, marvelous demonstration, but the outward success is of little importance. It is nothing astonishing when a total of 500,000 Germans in Chicago arrange a huge parade and crowd the coliseum, although it may have been an imposing sight to the numerically calculating Americans. However, the inner success can not be too highly appreciated. It can be said that for the first time the Germanic race annopnced openly with a proud self-awareness that they are determined to assert themselves and their rights in this country under all circumstances. All differences in religion, social standing, etc. disappeared. All who speak the German language in Chicago, immigrants or natives, Germans from the Reich, from Austria-Hungaria, from Saxonia, from Switzerland and elsewhere-all united in declaring: We are aware of our worth and merit. We will stand up for our position and our rights, and will defend the same.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1507.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The speaker of the occasion likewise expressed the sentiment, which prevailed among the audience of German-Americans, in a most appropriate and powerful manner.</p>
   <p>Without denying the good qualities of the Anglo-Americans, he gave them plainly to understand that they will not be permitted to force their opinions upon all other parts of the American people. The Germans do not want to organize a State within a State; neither are they willing to be deprived of their outstanding characteristics. They can not be surpassed in their loyality to the democratic form of government, nor in their self-sacrifices toward their new fatherland. They can not recognize it as their duty to throw into the great melting pot their particular mental and emotional dispositions, and to imitate the New-Englanders. The history of the human race is evidence that higher civilizations triumphed over lower ones. If the Germans possessed a lower degree of culture, they would have to finally subordinate to the United States in spite of their own oppositions; but they may boldly assert that their mother-country has reached the first place in <pb facs="5418474_7_1508.jpg" n="3"/>Europeon culture, and can boast of achievements, which have become a pattern for other nations.</p>
   <p>Even the boastful Englishmen, and the vain Frenchmen do not today deny the fact that the Germans have achieved superiority... What the Germans in the United States have to learn from the "Yankees", they grasped quickly and willingly, but they also assert that they can give as much to the descendants of New England, as they can learn from them.</p>
   <p>Never will the Germans permit the very characteristics, which have contributed so much to Germany's rise in culture and civilization to be despised and ridiculed by others. They know how much they have contributed to the development of the United States. They do not make unjust demands, nor do they believe in slavish subserviency to the insolvent presumptions of people, who are in no wise superior to them. The up-todate German culture is indeed not inferior to the New-England culture of the 17th century. These view-points have given birth to the German Day" and in this sense it was celebrated. Indeed, it was a demonstration, where the participants were conscious of its importance; and it may be assumed that it will be considered as such by all.</p>
