   <p>Thousands went to the North Side Turner Hall last night to participate in the foundation festival of the popular Fidelia Choral Society. Included in the festival was the presentation of a beautiful new flag by the women of the club. The very large audience which assembled last night proved that Fidelia is popular and beloved among the Germans here.</p>
   <p>The festivities commenced with a splendid concert directed by von Oppen, who is also one of the founders of Fidelia. After the magnificent orchestra of C. Nitschke rendered the overture, Pique Dame, the active members of Fidelia sang, "Nun Ist Der Lenz Gekommen" (Now Spring Has Arrived) by Sturm... A remarkable success was achieved by Nitschke with the famous violin solo, "Souvenirs de Bellini," by Ardot.</p>
   <p>Fidelia sang the two folk songs, "Gondellied," by Schmelzer, and "Zieh' hinnaus," by Dregert in a most striking manner. Mrs. Augusta Hastreiter, the soprano, fascinated the audience with "Ah Vieni Su L'onda," by R. Sapiro.</p>

   <p>Fidelia was organized on December 4, 1872 with a membership of ten. Louis von Nettelhorst has been its active president for 17 years. The society has 100 members now, of which 38 are active. Of these 20 have belonged to it for 18 years. Fidelia is a family organization, and some of the best Germans are members of it.</p>
