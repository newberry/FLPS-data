   <p>Organ pipes are things to blow with.* This should have been done last night with the organ pipes in McVickers Theater, and we wonder why the otherwise well-versed and understanding management of our German theater has not done such a thing before.</p>
   <p>The excuse that the public demands comedies in order to laugh does not always hold. Such a farce as was shown last night is not demanded by the public.</p>
   <p>Comedies like Treptow's "Organ Pipes," stamp the German theater with a ridiculous burlesque character.</p>
   <p>*Whistle-booing or disapproval of performance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0210.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The directors, Richard, Welb and Wachsner found, as we admit they deserved to, a sympathy and reception on the part of the Chicago public as none others have received before.</p>
   <p>Why, then, do the directors not try to meet the public halfway? Is the German stage only directed to the intelligence of the rabble? Why does not the management at least make an attempt to hold the public by "ambition"?</p>
   <p>The repertory, announced before opening of the season, showed plenty of serious and good pieces.</p>
   <p>Why, then, always this light fare? The auditorium, considering all circumstances, was again very well filled, last night. The cast gave - with a few exceptions - an excellent performance. To describe the content of this piece is impossible as there is none.</p>
