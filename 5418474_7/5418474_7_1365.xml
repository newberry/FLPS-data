  <body>
   <p>At the last meeting of the German group's executive committee of the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, the chairman Ernest J. Kruetgen, stated that the real work could now be started.</p>
   <p>The recruitment of new members was delayed at the beginning of the campaign by the absence, from the city, of many leading German personalities.</p>
   <p>For the same reason the women's branch could not be organized, but this handicap has now been removed. The women's committee of the German group is represented by Mrs. Emil Eitel, Mrs. Rose Austin and Mrs. Emmy Heidtke. Mrs. E. W. Blocki and Mrs. Jose S. Beuhl became permanent members of the executive committee. The soliciting committee of Mr. Albert Breitung was joined by Messrs. Wehrwein, Otto F. Reich, Schlegel, Pegeman, Barth, Briggs and Mayor H. Kaul. (Forest Park.)</p>

   <p>The Suabian society has inauguarated a campaign amongst its members, to join the German group.</p>
   <p>A very important resolution, which affects all the German-Americans of Chicago, was introduced namely that the German groups will elect in the next five years an official German reception committee. The reason for the creation of this new committee are the difficulties encountered in the past in selecting leading German-Americans for receptions.</p>
   <p>To avoid such difficulties in the future, the German group intends to create an official reception committee, which shall consist of the older prominent members and leaders of the German-American public, of our city.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1367.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The executive committee of the German group, will urge the reception committee on to work intensively in the interest of the World's Fair. In the meantime Ernest J. Kruetgen will represent the German group officially.</p>
