   <p>Under the leadership of conductor H. Koruemann, the Blue Island Lieder kranz, the Ladies' choir, and the church choir of the Ravenswood Evangelical Congregation, in Pastor Alfred Meyer's church at Pensecola and Hoyne Avenues, arranged a joint concert which was well attended.</p>
   <p>Conductor H. Koruemann succeeded, although the time was short for the proper rehearsal of the one hundred voices that made up the chorus, in achieving a great success.</p>
   <p>Three times did the united choirs appear, and each time every one of the members showed that the choirs, although separated during their rehearsals, had been prepared by the same maestro.</p>
   <p>The two numbers from "Tannhauser," arranged for mixed choruses, as well as <pb facs="5418474_7_0570.jpg" n="2"/>the sextet from "Lucia," were performed faultlessly. If the request had not been made to omit applause, out of respect for the church, a thunderous ovation would have rewarded the singers and their conductor.</p>
   <p>Each of the choirs, the Blue Island Ladies' choir, the men's choir Liederkranz, and the church choir, gave solo auditions. In these each showed excellent preparation. It was a pity, indeed, that no applause was permitted. Most of the organ accompaniment was played by Mr. Carl Weiss, son of the well-known organist at the St. Paul Church on Fullerton Avenue. Carl is a master of his instrument, which he proved by a solo performance. Cello player Israel Greenfield must also be praised. The way he masters his instrument is a credit to his teacher. An organ and piano duet by Mr. and Mrs. Koruemann was well liked.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0571.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Miss Gertrude Cook, and her sister Martha recited a duet by Bellini. To conclude the musical program, Betty Eck-Stott, soloist of the Ravenswood choir, played with unusual mastery a composition by Lynes. Pastor Meyer thanked the guests and the singers from Blue Island. To the latter he said that it had been kind of them to make a long trip in order to help make a success of the concert.</p>
