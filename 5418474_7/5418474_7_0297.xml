   <p>E. Henle's prize comedy, "Durch Die Intendanz," given by Hoechster's Stock Company at Hooley's Theater, proved a complete success, particularly gratifying because it was achieved by very simple means. The play itself is not fascinating, and does not set the nerves atingle; one knows at the very beginning that the lovers will be united; and the complications of the plot are commonplace, so that simple expedients will solve the difficulties. But therein, to a certain extent, lies the value of the author's creation. The public is not expected to consider an array of improbabilities; the effects are based on natural sequences and, one might say, on situations familiar to the audience. But the problems were presented in a charming and spirited manner, enabling the listener to enjoy the offerings of the moment without overtaxing the imagination.</p>
   <p>The play excels in choice language and animated dialogues. [A discussion of the <pb facs="5418474_7_0298.jpg" n="2"/>plot is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Again, an excellent performance was presented. Miss Wassmann undoubtedly was the outstanding personality. Her characterization of the amorous, vivacious schoolgirl, longing for deliverance from school attendance; was given in a most charming manner.....</p>
   <p>Miss Kuhn, as the older sister, was good, as usual, but it seemed to us that she might have appeared more youthful and shown more restraint.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Horn, as the wife of the councillor, gave an excellent portrayal, and her costuming likewise showed excellent taste.</p>
   <p>The most difficult role in the play fell to Mr. Ravene. It is not a simple matter to depict a jubilant, enthusiastic poet and, in rapid sequence simulate despondency to the point of self-effacement. Nevertheless, Mr. Ravene was undismayed, giving a splendid performance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0299.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Rodenberg, as cavalry captain, was better than ever, showing considerable skill and a bearing becoming an army officer. Mr. Meyer, as councillor, was highly satisfying, as always, and Mr. Schmitz, playing the reporter (a small part) did very well.</p>
   <p>The stage director did his full share in supervising the production and in providing suitable appointments, so that everything combined to justify the hearty acclaim given to the play and players. Mr. Hoechster can register a new artistic triumph, as well as a financial one, since every available seat was sold.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, Mr. Hoechster intends to present "Dr. Klaus," an excellent comedy....</p>
   <p>Concordia Theater</p>
   <p>At the Concordia Theater, a benefit performance was given for the manager, L. W. H. Neebe. Nearly every seat was sold. The play was written by Paul Loebel, <pb facs="5418474_7_0300.jpg" n="4"/>talented director of the group.</p>
   <p>The title, "Jasper Scrimpe, the Miser of Shoreditch," gave indication of a highly seasoned, thrilling drama, and the expectations were justified in every respect. A murderer, driven by remorse and by disdain for humanity in general, becomes a recluse and a merciless extortioner. He, and the three supposedly dead children of the victim, constitute the principal characters. As to the youngsters, let us add that one boy and a girl are being raised by a Gypsy, Sampson Brayling; and Fate decrees that the male survivor should develop into a scoundrel, while the young lady, in maturing, acquires the traits of a sentimental, virtuous tribal maiden, and falls in love with the other brother, a foundling, who has been cared for by a prosperous farmer.</p>
   <p>None of the three is aware of his relationship to the other two. The crook, Oliver Dalton, becomes the rival of his good brother Evlyn, in the pursuit of Constance, concerning whom they have a serious altercation at the beginning of the play.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0301.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Later Oliver attempts to kill the old miser, in order to obtain his wealth--he leaves the apparently lifeless victim, and accuses Evlyn of the deed. The miser, however, was not dead, but had sufficient vitality to appear in the next act--to be robbed and almost murdered again by Dalton; but, prior to that time, the Gypsy chief had compelled the miserly misanthrope to admit his former crime.</p>
   <p>Through the intercession of the Gypsy, Evlyn is enabled to escape from the minions of the law, who pursue him on the strength of Dalton's charge; but, in the end, the fugitive is apprehended and brought before a judge, in whose presence everything is revealed. Evlyn's doom is sealed, but the Gypsy appears and points to Dalton as the guilty one. To verify the charge, he brings in the miser. The latter confesses, and Evlyn finds that his rival is his own brother, Oliver Dalton, who, driven to insane fury, shoots the Gypsy. As so often happens, when not aiming properly in the haste of the moment, the bullet does not reach its mark, and strikes instead the Gypsy maiden, Mabel, as she enters the courtroom to testify against Dalton. The mortally wounded girl dies in the <pb facs="5418474_7_0302.jpg" n="6"/>arms of her brother Evlyn, while blessing his union with Constance. And the miser? He was called to the Great Beyond just a few minutes before--the victim of a broken heart.</p>
   <p>Although the plot is complicated, and the action improbable, the play is very effective, giving definite evidence of the author's great stage experience. There are impressive finales to the various acts, and several fascinating scenes. The tragic tone of the play is relieved ocassionally by humorous episodes....</p>
   <p>Charles Goepfarth of Baltimore wrote the music for several scenes, enhancing thereby the play's effectiveness....The presentation in the main was very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Paul Loebel, the author, played the part of the miser, giving a restrained performance. His declamation was surprisingly good. Mr. Tietz played the Gypsy chief in a very sympathetic manner. Mr. Bobene, as the crook, Oliver, <pb facs="5418474_7_0303.jpg" n="7"/>was skillful, and Mr. Galle, as the fugitive and beloved Evlyn, provided the proper measure of feeling. Miss Waldau was a very charming Gypsy, absorbed and eager in her part. Miss Meyer, as Constance, was satisfying in every respect. Miss Jantzen portrayed the comical episodes of the hungry servant of the grouchy miser in a very acceptable manner, and Mrs. Tietz enacted the lovelorn servant girl in full keeping with the author's intentions. The other members of the cast gave adequate performances.</p>
   <p>The orchestra responded to its cues promptly, if not always harmoniously. Stage settings and properties were excellent. The public showed its interest by most generous applause. The consensus was that an excellent entertainment had been provided.</p>
   <p>Chicago Stadttheater</p>
   <p>A benefit performance was given yesterday for Elise Baureis, character actress. E. A. Zuendl's play, "Das Gebet Der Mutter, oder, Das Eismeer" ("A Mother's <pb facs="5418474_7_0304.jpg" n="8"/>Prayer; or, The Arctic Ocean") was chosen.</p>
   <p>The presentation was good in every respect, and the scenery was particularly suitable.</p>
   <p>The beneficiary played the part of Olgarita very well indeed, and the other members of the cast performed in an appropriate manner.</p>
   <p>Deserving particular mention are: Messrs. Reitmann, Sarner, Lofthar, Kroener, and Baureis; also Mmes. Reitmann, Vieth, and Haeuser.</p>
