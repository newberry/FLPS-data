   <p>Certain parties have proposed that German Day be celebrated a second time this year. The proposal has already taken on a definite form, and the German Day Alliance will soon be asked to give its consent to the plan. The World's Fair management has asked the different nationalities of Chicago to make such arrangements. That such a proposal is seriously considered by German-Americans is surprising.</p>
   <p>October 21 has been selected as the date for the second German Day. The World's Fair depends, in the first place, upon fair weather, and the weather will probably be cold and wet toward the end of October. It is possible of course, that October 21 will be a beautiful day. But that is very unlikely. Furthermore, last year's experiences showed that the greater part of those <pb facs="5418474_7_1113.jpg" n="2"/>who visit the World's Fair on German Day merely inspect the Exposition, and do not intend to participate in the German Day. It seems incomprehensible that this experience has been forgotten so soon. To cover the expenses, which run into thousands of dollars, the management of the Fair is to be asked to turn over a part of the receipts from tickets of admission to the arrangers of the German Day. This is a very naive idea. The managers of the Fair wish to arrange these festivals in order to increase their receipts. If they are to hand over part of the receipts, they might as well save themselves the trouble of arranging the festivals, And another thing: The arrangers of the first German Day were able, this time, by the expenditure of extraordinary effort, to fill the Stadium and induce the German-American public to turn out in great numbers. Does anyone suppose that this is possible twice a year? For the success of such an affair the presence of the public is also necessary. This is just as important as to have people to perform in the festival. The German Day festival was a brilliant success in every respect. Why do they want to spoil the impression of this festival, or at least endanger it, by arranging a second celebration?</p>
