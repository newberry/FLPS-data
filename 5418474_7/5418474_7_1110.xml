   <p>The forty-first celebration of the harvest festival of the South Side Swabian Sick Benefit Society was observed yesterday at the West Englewood Masonic Temple, and was attended by a large number of well-known singing and athletic clubs. The skill of the fest committee and the celebrated hospitality of the South Side Swabians once more contrived to unite the Germans of the North, South, and West sections of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The fruits on display, among which was a giant cluster of grapes weighing a hundred pounds, were admired by all. The "humid corner," supplied with the vintage of many years, the "fragrant kitchen," and the cackle of geese, all gave the festival the autumnal aspect of a Swabian church fair.</p>
   <p>The fest opened with a great costume parade, followed by an opening march by the familiar Philip Moler orchestra. The song "Erneuerung" was met with hearty <pb facs="5418474_7_1111.jpg" n="2"/>applause. The fest reached its climax when the singers of the West Side Saengerkranz came upon the stage with their director, Ludwig Lohmiller. Their operetta, "Tango Prinzessin," was stormily applauded. In the operetta, they were assisted by the ladies of the singing club "Lorelei" and the orchestra. The pleasant hours passed by quite quickly for all guests.</p>
