   <p>It is to be regretted that the performances of Mr. Murster's German Dramatic Company, at the New Chicago Theatre, are no longer patronzied as they were formerly. This falling off in the attendance must not alone be attributed to the withdrawal of Miss Von Stammwitz from the company, for there are numerous other causes which keep the people from patronizing this theater as liberally as they used to, principally among which are the dull times.</p>
   <p>The prices at the German Theatre are high, almost too high for these times; but it must be considered that Mr. Murster's company is an expensive one, and if he reduced prices, he could not possibly meet expenses, especially as the theater is small and performances can be given but once a week. Miss Mary Wolf, while she is not as fine a tragedienne as Miss Von Stamawitz, is yet an actress of no ordinary merit, and in comedies, she is very useful, even more so than her predecessor has been. The cause of her not drawing as good houses as she did last season is principally to be looked for in the fact that the times are much duller and her style of acting is too well known to the patrons of this theater, who continually want to see something new.</p>
