   <p>The wishes of numerous opera visitors, who are of German extraction,-and who from a viewpoint of sentiment as well as of taste, naturally prefer German, opera,-will receive special consideration during the next opera season. A committee consisting of prominent German-Americans, received this assurance from Samuel Insull, president of the Civic Opera Co., and Edward Johnson, manager of the opera, in the course of adiscussion, which was held at the opera house yesterday afternoon and at which the Messrs. Insull and Johnson on one side, and as representatives of the German-American element Messrs. Ernest J. Kruetgen, chairman of the German Group of the World Fair, Attorney Otto F. Reich, C. F. Pegenan, Oscar Stoffels, president of the German Club, and William Rothman, president of the Steuben Club, participated.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson as well as Mr. Insull emphasized that the wishes for the performance <pb facs="5418474_7_0581.jpg" n="2"/>of German opera will be considered because of the lively interest shown by this group for the performances during the last season.</p>
   <p>The coming season will bring an expansion of German repertoires, particularly of Wagnerian operas. Among those which are taken in view will be the "Meistersinger."</p>
   <p>The wishes of the representatives of the German-American element is based upon the effort to reach an equality of the German repertories, with those of Italian and French. The opera management is willing to meet those wishes as much as possible, and will increase its personnel in the near future. That the opera management considers the financial viewpoint of this arrangement, is a matter of course. It will, therefore, largely depend on the lovers of German opera to prove by large attendances of German performances, that their wishes for the repertoires expansion wore complied with.</p>
