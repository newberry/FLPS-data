   <p>The organization-committee, which has set as its aim to hold a commemorative celebration in memory of the 200th birthday of General Von Steuben, held a meeting last night at the Steuben building, in which chairmen for different committee were chosen.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, which was held under the presidency of Leopold Saltiel, chairman of the organization-committee, it was decided to offer the position of chairman of the finance committee to the City Treasurer, Mr. G. K. Schmidt; that of chairman of the arrangement committee to Mr. Reinhold Oeschler; chairman of the press committee to Mr. Paul H. Mueller; and that of the speakers' committee to Dr. Otto L. Schmidt.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by a mixed group of thirty. It was rumored that in German society circles misunderstanding seem to prevail in regards to the proposed celebration.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1333.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The chairman repeatedly declared that the celebration, which will be held in Nov., does not conflict with the arrangements made by some of the Steuben societies, but it will be a celebration of the entire German element of Chicago, by which the importance of Von Steuben's interest to the United States shall be demonstrated to the American public also.</p>
