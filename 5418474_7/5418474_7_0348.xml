   <p>That excellent fairy tale, "Aschenbroedel," was highly successful, although it is no novelty in Chicago, having been given in this theater several years ago, at the Aurora last year, and recently at the Adelphi Theater. The house was sold out and the performance was probably the best of the season.</p>
   <p>The author gave a strong portrayal of the characters; they are exceedingly plausible and the situations are so humorous that they will always appeal to the masses.</p>
   <p>The part of Aschenbroedel gives no difficulty to an artist like Mrs. Methua Scheller, and the problems involved are not productive of headaches in so far as she is concerned; thus she portrayed the part easily and with commendable naivete, as befits the character.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ehlers played the part of Pedro--doing better than some of his predecessors.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0349.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Miss Mollie Thielemann was charming as the fairy queen, but in the part of the grandmother she was more successful.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Engelhardt and Mrs. Nicolas were very good.</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto's Pompolino proved amusing, but, somehow, he gave the role a too farcical aspect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bech's Dandini was pleasing, and the parts of the prince and Alidoro, played by Nessrs. Gebhardt and Paul, were done in a capable manner.</p>
   <p>The hunters' chorus was better than in the Adelphi Theater. Mrs. Kolb's apparel was elegant and in good taste.</p>
   <p>The performance was given unstinted acclaim.</p>
