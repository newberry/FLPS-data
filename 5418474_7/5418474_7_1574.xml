  <body>
   <p>The Annual festival, arranged by the old Settlers, under the auspices of the Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner's Society) which should have been held last Monday, in Ogden's Garden, but has to be postponed on account of inclement weather has now been definitely settled for Monday, August 3rd.</p>
   <p>A big attendance may be expected also on this occasion.</p>
   <p>This festival, repeated every year, is given in honor of our old German pioneers, who in many instances, through their own strength and indefatigable industry, in spite of adverse conditions, have achieved wealth and independence, and also found time, to pay full attention to the influence developed by the Germans...For this reason, the Festival of the Old, is also an important event to the young, and at the same time a reminder, to follow the example of their parents, and to be proud of their German descent.</p>
