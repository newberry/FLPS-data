   <p>The Ferdinand La Salle Ladies' Chorus presented its many friends and patrons with an evening of entertainment at the Lincoln Turnhall, 1005 Diversey Parkway. The main feature of the program was the songs by the La Salle Ladies' Chorus and members of other friendly societies. The Singing Union Freiheit, and the Singing Section of Fortschoitt, both under the direction of Karl Reckzeh; and the Alpine Men's Chorus, directed by Waldemar Christopher, received great applause.</p>
   <p>A sensation was caused by the La Salle Ladies' Chorus, the Singing Section of Fortschoitt, and the Singing Union Freiheit when they combined to sing the beautiful "Blue Danube Waltz." The Alpine Men's Chorus came forward with "Greeting to Bavaria," a selection that was greatly applauded and followed by an encore.</p>
   <p>A pleasant attraction was the performance of the Hull House Junior Trio, composed by L. Adezio, violin; C. Adezio, cello; and M. Murphy, piano.</p>

   <p>Worthy of mention also is the violin solo played by Miss Hilda Feinblatt, who not only showed an excellent technique but also a great personality.</p>
   <p>The final number was a humoristic one-act play, "The Shoemaker's Elizabeth," presented by the following women: E. Friesc, M. Mannue, A. Koestor, Marie Wolter and A. Nilekush. The concert was followed by a dance with music by Beidels' Orchestra.</p>
