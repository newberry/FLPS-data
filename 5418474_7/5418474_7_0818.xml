   <p>The German Manner-Chor began its life as a musical society and social club in Chicago twenty-six years age. Its membership consisted of sixteen persons, and its home was in one of the common-place buildings of that day. Last night in one of the most beautiful club-houses in Chicago, and surrounded with all the beauty that artistic skill commands, the same organization, with a membership of 650, c celebrated the twenty-sixth year of its club existence, and entered upon it's future life with the consciousness that, as an organization devoted to music, and the advancement of social life it is practically without an equal.</p>
   <p>The event was one of the most brilliant that ever took place in the new Germania club-house.</p>
   <p>After an hour of dancing a banquet was served.</p>
   <p>A portrait of Carl Schurz, by Julius Geertz, was presented to the club by Mr. Harry Rubens, the President of the club. Mr. Rubens' generous gift was prompted because of his regard for Carl Schurz. He was Mr. Schurz's private secretary during his career in the United States Senate.</p>
