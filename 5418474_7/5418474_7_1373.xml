   <p>"'He who is not able to love his young bride sincerely, is also unable to keep faithfully his mother's memory. He who does not honor his old homeland, is unworthy of the new.' These were the words spoken by Carl Schurz at the first German day of the World's Fair in 1893. I want to use similar words today when I speak to you in the name of the German committee of the World's Fair of 1933 about the marvel of our times, the radio.</p>
   <p>"It was the German scientist Hertz, who discovered this prodigy, it was the German Count Zeppelin who invented the dirigible, it was the German Professor Junker who constructed Koehl's and Hunefeld's aeroplane. Germans have been at the head of science and of technical arts and have presented wonderful gifts to the world.</p>
   <p>"We want to remember those things, now that we are called upon to emulate the example of our fathers in the year 1893. At the World's Fair in 1893 German intellect and skill revealed their products to an astonished world. At that time the 400th anniversary of America's discovery by Columbus was <pb facs="5418474_7_1374.jpg" n="2"/>the occasion for the World's Fair in 1933.</p>
   <p>"The one-hundredth anniversary of our city of Chicago will be celebrated with a World's Fair. One Hundred years! That means one hundred years of German cooperation, of German industry, of German spirit! For one hundred years the German-Americans of Chicago have contributed their best. As the German-Americans have left their mark in imperishable letters of blood in the history of the United States during the Revolution and the Civil War, so also have the German-Americans contributed towards the development of the city of Chicago."</p>
