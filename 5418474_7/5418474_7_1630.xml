   <p>The "Turner(Gymnastic) Kommittee of the World's Fair Board of Directors" held last Thursday a meeting mainly about the preparations for the "Turner-Ehrentag" (Honor-Day For Gymnastics), for which the 26th of July was officially reserved by the local management. It is expected that at least 3000 active "Turners" from all parts of the country will assemble in Chicago. Magnificent exercises, which will also be demonstrated during the League Turner Festival in Milwaukee are planned. Ofcourse the feeding and lodging of this enormous crowd requires great preparations. Originally, it was intended, to lodge the visiting "Turners" in the different Turner Halls in Chicago, but as several Clubs refused to do this without pay, it was decided to lodge all the guests in hotels near Jackson Park for one night. The "Quarter Committee" also made preparations to feed 2400 men in the Restaurants, "ClarkDale","Garfield" and "Convenience." The active"Turners" shall be transported in 4 special trains of the Chicago-Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, while the passive members will have to use the regular trains. Heading the principal festivities in the fair grounds, a parade through the city is planned and same shall be led by the "Turner John Koelling" as "Marshal of Honor." At the present time already the <pb facs="5418474_7_1631.jpg" n="2"/>gymnastic teachers H. Hartung and H. Kindervater are busily engaged in putting the arena in the right condition. Should it prove that there is not enough space, arrangements shall be made for additional fields near the administration palace.</p>
   <p>To the performances, invitations will be sent to all administrations of the World's fair, to the City Administration, to the School Board members and to the Representatives of the press. The next meeting of the Committee will be held on July 17th in Jung's Hall.</p>
