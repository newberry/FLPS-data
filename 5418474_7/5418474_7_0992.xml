   <p>Before a large audience in a South Side ballroom, the social committee of the Deutsche Vereinigungen produced the operetta "Winzerliesel". The actors are members of the German Literary and Dramatic Club of Gary, Indiana. Dr. E. Kamm is chairman. The orchestra was that of Reinhard Elster of Hammond, Indiana.</p>
   <p>As the last strains of the prelude died away the curtain rose, and the visitors were amazed at the transformation of the stage which was filled with performers of both sexes dressed in the costume of vintagers and capering about in a gay dance. Standing on a chair in the center of the stage was John Stang, who enacted the role of Nepomak Liebespinsel. He played his part excellently, to the amusement of the audience. The character of Father Werner, a pleasant old vintager, was well portrayed by Ernst Weinert. It was the clear bell-like voice of Friedel Kuhr which interrupted the gayety of the vintagers. The Countess von Stein was charmingly presented by Helen Spath. Her son, Count Walter, as portrayed by Dr. E. Kamm, pleased the audience very much. In the second act, <pb facs="5418474_7_0993.jpg" n="2"/>after Nepomnk Liebespinsel had become engaged to the chamber maid, Enphrosine Bluetenschnee, played by Else Friedrich, it seemed that the applause would never cease. The players responded to several encores with repetitions of the scene.</p>
   <p>Henriette von Raden, the niece of the Countess von Stein, was played by Maria Huegel. Robert Schnck gave a capable performance as secretary to the Count and John Dreiser's characterization of Mike, the vintager, must also be commended. The audience remained several hours after the end of the performance to enjoy the dancing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Richard Nacke was manager of the operetta. The Deutsche Vereinigungen will continue its attempts to provide more such evenings for the Germans of the South Side.</p>
