   <p>The Chicago section of the Deutsch-Amerikanische Buergerbund (German-American Citizen's Association) held its annual picnic yesterday. The ideal summer weather brought out a gratifyingly large crowd. Activities began early in the afternoon in Harms Park, the site of the picnic, but the high point of the affair was reached toward evening.</p>
   <p>The picnic committee did everything in its power to make things pleasant for those who attended. All kinds of amusements were provided for young and old, and the refreshments, also, left nothing to be desired. In the pavilion gay music was played for dancing; and a five-man orchestra marched tirelessly through the park as it played its tunes. The children were not forgotten, either. In short, this was a typical German family picnic, which should long remain a pleasant memory for those who were present.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1129.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Reverend Dr. [George L.] Scherger, of St. Paul's [Evangelical Lutheran] Church was the speaker of the day. In the course of his very interesting talk, frequently interspersed with lively illustrations, he emphasized the fact that Germany--like any other nation--has a perfect right to manage its own affairs as it sees fit; that, in spite of all its enemies, the German spirit will find a way to reach its goal. He expressed the hope that Americans--especially those of German stock--would help the German people in their hard economic struggle. He concluded with an earnest appeal to German-Americans to maintain their unity; for only if they are proud of their German origin and stick together can they exercise an influence in keeping with their strength.</p>
   <p>The speeches of John E. Traeger, chairman of the reception committee, and of Fred Rixman, president of the Buergerbund, were well received, as were the remarks of several of the guests present. Among the latter were County Clerk Robert M. Sweitzer, County Judge Edmund Jarecki, Judge Joseph Burke, Recorder Clayton F. Smith, Fred Brummel, of the Board of Tax Appeals, Alderman John <pb facs="5418474_7_1130.jpg" n="3"/>Toman, Fire Chief Arthur Seyferlich, and many others in public life. The president of the German Day association, Mr. Gustav Brand, was also present. He earnestly appealed to all present to visit the festival next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Societies closely associated with the Buergerbund were strongly represented, and later in the evening many singers came who had taken part in the picnic of the Vereinigten Maennerchoere (United Men's Choruses) in Morton Grove. Yet even in the afternoon one might enjoy hearing German songs, for at about four o'clock the lively Baeckermeister Gesangverein (Master Bakers'Singing Society) marched in, led by its fife and drum corps. The Rheinische Gesangverein and the Schiller Liedertafel also sang.</p>
   <p>When at last the time came to go home, everyone, upon leaving, thanked those who had arranged this splendid festival.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Buergerbund, whose hard work was largely responsible for making the festival a success, are Messrs. Fred Rixman, president; William <pb facs="5418474_7_1131.jpg" n="4"/>Joern and Gus Scheel, vice-presidents; Christ Clausen, secretary; Ernst Brosius, financial secretary; and John Cremer, treasurer.</p>
