   <p>As fast as possible, gymnastic classes for children were organized, also a sick benevolent fund, a drum corps, a section for dramatics, and a library.</p>
   <p>Shortly after, the rented hall became too small, and on March <gap unit="chars" extent="2" reason="illegible"/>th, 1838, the <pb facs="5418474_7_1455.jpg" n="2"/><gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> so of the property at <gap unit="words" extent="9" reason="illegible"/>, and the deal was closed. <gap unit="words" extent="7" reason="illegible"/> December 25th, <gap unit="words" extent="12" reason="illegible"/> most convenient of its kind in the city.</p>

   <p>Convinced that a women's auxiliary would be of incalculable gain, such a circle was organized with eighteen members. Since these times, the auxiliary has co-operated in a true manner always to the benefit of the Verein, and the endeavors have been indeed, the best achievement the Turnverein has gained.</p>
   <p>The Verein in its fifty years of existence has won numerous prizes and honor diplomas, which are decorating the walls of the club rooms, and the place is not sufficiently large to have even the best diplomas framed. Numerous laurels of high value are well taken care of, and only are to be exhibited on festive occasions.</p>
   <p>The present hall of the Turnverein was erected in the year 1896.</p>
   <p>In regard to intellectual activity the society has accomplished much, yet never has it forgotten the social life.</p>
