   <p>An evening in Old Heidelberg Inn at the World's Fair will convince even the most astute opponent of earthly debaucheries that harmless gaiety has made its entry into the hostelries of the country along with the disappearance of the Volstead era.</p>
   <p>The enjoyment in forbidden fruits, secretly indulged in for years, weaned the present generation away from that moist gaiety which, during the years of prohibition, prevailed among the lovers of a good drink. It necessitates the cultivation of a new good taste to win the public back to this novel means of diverting oneself without sinking back into the mistakes which resulted in the laws of prohibition, so much maligned. Just as the baby is to be conditioned to its bottle, so is the innkeeper of today, who must with great patience introduce his patrons into the enjoyment of the noble <pb facs="5418474_7_1180.jpg" n="2"/>juice of the grape. The hours of recreation are thus bound to become hours of festivity.</p>
   <p>From far and wide the stream of people flows into the World's Fair. Means of transportation of all possible descriptions unload their contents like derricks before the entrance gates. Entire families flow with the stream--grandfather, grandmother, mother and child. Very much of the child..... Full of anticipation, they enter the premises and, hours later, one sees them as tired wanderers seeking a little spot where they could taste, to the full, the remaining hours of the day and the evening.</p>
   <p>In need of peace and recreation one likes to stray, as this reporter did, into a place like the Old Heidelberg Inn which, this year as before, enjoys a matchless reputation with the guests of the Fair. One can on a hot day, enjoy thoroughly a cool drink in the shady garden of the restaurant and quietly watch the stream of humanity flow by, a stream that liesurely rolls <pb facs="5418474_7_1181.jpg" n="3"/>along the street. Inside, the evening hours are very gay. German drinking songs and folk songs are revived by the Old Meidelberg orchestra, under Director Hentwig. Greeted by loud applause the Old Heidelberg Octet ascends the stage. A multicolored wreath of German and English songs was offered by them in chorus or solo performance. Who could not doubly enjoy the refreshing drink and the excellent food offered in this restaurant when, sung in a deep basso, he hears the encouraging song, "Im tiefen Heller sitz ich hier".</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the gay crowd of singing waitresses and waiters is transported into the realm of music and under concertmaster Lajos Barsong, long a member of the Budapest Opera, the blossoms of German and English folk songs are recited. Here Hans Kelter's Hungarian orchestra holds sway. Its pianist, Arthur Koch, because of his skilled playing attracts the special attention of the public. Bajos Barsong and Countess Boriske, likewise an <pb facs="5418474_7_1182.jpg" n="4"/>erstwhile member of the Hungarian Opera, are rivals for the laurels in singing. The other members of his group succeed one another in showing their skill in song. Among them are Irma Kostian, Grete Taborsky, Ernst Cormielsen, Bill Charles, Herbert Hardt, and Clemens Braun.</p>
   <p>In quiet enjoyment the guest retreats into the solitude of the garden restaurant which has been widened this year, and there occupies the entire shore of the lake (sic).</p>
   <p>Whether they are early or late, the guests of Old Heidelberg Inn, go home satisfied that they have given a worthy finale to their visit to the World's Fair.</p>
