   <p>This the title of the well-known, classic play, given at the German Theater last night. Mr. Franz Kauer himself chose this play for the evening, which was dedicated to him as an honorary performance. Unfortunately, there were not as many visitors as could have been expected for the occasion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kauer filled the main cast, representing Schiller in his young passionate days as poet and idealist. Mr. Kauer played his part well and deserved the applause of the audience at several occasions.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Werbke, Weld and Cotta were at their best and cooperated nicely to make the evening a success. Also the achievements of the ladies, Miss Ernau, Miss Milasson and Mrs. Markham were satisfactory.</p>
