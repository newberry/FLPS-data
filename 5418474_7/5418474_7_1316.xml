   <p>The management of the Centennial Exhibition of Progress gave a luncheon yesterday, at the Administration Building on the Fair grounds on Lake Michigan's shore, in honor of the chairmen of different racial and national groups, as well as for the foreign language press, for the purpose of requesting them to commence seriously their work in the 1933 World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Major Felix Strykman, who for three years had been manager of the racial groups, and who made a speech in that capacity, pointed out that up to the present time the different racial groups have accomplished the most valuable results by soliciting for the exhibition, the proof of which being that 76% of the population are represented by them.</p>
   <p>These groups have held more than five hundred meetings, the German group ranking <pb facs="5418474_7_1317.jpg" n="2"/>first in the number of meetings.</p>
   <p>Careful Management</p>
   <p>Upon request from the ranks of about one hundred people who were assembled, Major Strykman declared that the $600,000 collected by the various racial groups, through the sale of membership and admission cards is deposited in banks and will not be touched until the doors of the World's Fair are opened next year.</p>
   <p>German Constitution Day</p>
   <p>The president of the German group, Ernest J. Kruetgen, and Miss Marie Becker decided that the German Constitution Day will be celebrated either Friday August 11, 1933, or on the following Monday. At any rate these days will be reserved for that purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1318.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Italians decided upon Columbus Day, October 12, the day of the discovery of America. It was expressly emphasized by Major Streykman, that the management of the World's Fair, in order to obtain a strictly disciplined organization, will negotiate only with the chairmen of the different racial groups and that consequently all people having any suggestions whatsoever to make, must first turn to them.</p>
