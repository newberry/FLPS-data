   <p>The Erection of an Institute for Housing of Immigrants Projected.</p>
   <p>The World's Fair Committee of Ways and Means, received a request, to permit the erection of an Institute for Immigrants in the Fair Grounds. The object of the Institute is, to give shelter to the Immigrants, till they either find work or are sufficiently acquainted with the local conditions. The supporters of this plan are of the opinion, that Immigrants, even if they posses money very frequently become embarrassed, because nobody helps them with advice. At the head of the project of erecting such an Institute(which should be used not only during the Fair, but ever afterwards) stands a journalist, by the name of Rosa Sonnenschein, who at present lives at 3756 Ellis Avenue. The Exposition pieces are arriving from Germany in quick succession, and Mr. Wermuth the Imperial Commissioner has his hands full. During the last 10 days, 32 carloads have been received. Yesterday, the first shipment of war material from Krupp's in Esseb arrived. They consisted of 21 carloads. Same contained six large cannons with accessories, weighing altogether <pb facs="5418474_7_1671.jpg" n="2"/>400 tons, and representing a value of $132,000. The Giant Cannon, destined for the Fair, will arrive later. Same requires a special foundation which is being erected in the Krupp Building on the Fair Grounds.</p>
