   <p>Undoubtedly the two most successful German writers of modern comedies are G. Von Moser and Julius Rosen. Both of them have written a number of plays during the last few years, and all of them have been well received wherever produced, and some of them have created quite a furore, as, for example "Ultimer" by the former and"Lemons" by the latter. All it needed to draw good houses in any of the principal German theatres was the announcement that a new play by either of these was to be brought out. A few weeks ago, when then the new play by Mr. Rosen, entitled the"Confusionsrath", was brought out at the New Chicago, it filled the house, and it proved to be a clever production. When the "Hypochonder," by Moser, was produced at this house two weeks ago, it proved such a success that it was repeated at the North Side Turner Hall.---</p>
