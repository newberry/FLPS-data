   <p>p. 2.. Long live the farce with its inane foolishness! Formerly it was relegated to the carnival and its environs; the authors and their friends, the managers, however, saw to it that it spread from its confines. But why should one be so overzealous? The public wants to laugh, thoroughly, exhaustingly, regardless if at last it feels provoked at the incipient cause.</p>
   <p>New, good comedies are as rare as white ravens; the old subjects are now "threadbare," (verbatim: threshed out) so bring on the modern junk. What the public demands it will have! From the standpoint of the theater's business-manager, the logic is justified. What then should be the critic's attitude, since, after all, it is his mission to create an understanding of art, to promote the sublime, and develop a taste for things artistic amongst his readers?</p>
   <p>Under the given circumstances, his best policy is to be noncommittal. The public is sufficiently enlightened to see through the faded meshes of old and new jokes, the time worn mistaken identities and laboriously compounded circumstantial environment of yesterday's production. But it laughs, laughs <pb facs="5418474_7_0132.jpg" n="2"/>raucously over the boisterous fun which engulfs the tolerant listener with crackling firecracker-like rapidity, and wholly accepts the presumpitious which the author has welded together; but pity the unfortunate actors with their lamentable problem, for much was required of them.</p>
   <p>To imbue the spirit of life into such umbrageous figures as Ignatz Doell, Leopold Schimmel, Dr. Puschel, Gustav Wenglein and ditto for the wife, daughter and niece of Doell. That is labor in the true sense of the word..... Verily, the actors deserve unstinted recognition!</p>
   <p>It is regrettable that they had to waste their strength to save such trash (verbatim: hold such useless stuff above the water.).... The cast in its cooperation functioned admiringly. Sold-out house.</p>
