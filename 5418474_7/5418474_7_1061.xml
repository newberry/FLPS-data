<title level="a">BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION BY THE SAXON CLUB</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Christmas festival of the Saxon Club was celebrated Saturday, in the great hall of the Lincoln Turner Hall, in a truly homelike atmosphere.</p>
   <p>On the stage, a picture was unrolled which demonstrated the life and doings of St. Nicholas in his workshop. There were the twenty-four dwarfs who, while still working, found time to sing German Christmas carols, and to recite German Christmas poems. Then came the seven little dolls, presenting a most lovely aspect in their neat dresses. St. Nicholas, portrayed by Kurt Matthesius, was busy everywhere bringing joy to all the children (more than 200) by giving them fine gifts. One could see distinctly in the children's faces that they were joyful and contented over the gifts received.</p>
   <p>An easygoing Christmas mood prevailed until the early hours of the morning. This was true especially of those who wanted to dance, for they could do so <pb facs="5418474_7_1062.jpg" n="2"/>to their hearts' content.</p>
   <p>The committee consisted of President Albert Reiter, Secretary Rudolph Klemm, Secretary-treasurer Georg Kranz, Jr.; Treasurer Oswald Doehler, Kurt Matthesius, Frank Schubert, Kurt Wollner, and Joseph Schmidt. Frau Anna Matthesius made the beautiful dresses for the dolls and the suits for the dwarfs.</p>
