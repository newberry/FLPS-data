   <p>The German people of Chicago point with pride to the success of the technique of German flying in the past years. With pride we have welcomed in our city the three musketeers of the air, Koehl, Hunefeld, Fitzmaurice, and also Dr. Hugo Eckener, and never have we neglected to prove our respect wholeheartedly and undividedly to the heroes and pioneers of German aeronautics, who have led the way of the entire world in more than one respect.</p>
   <p>Come then, Germans of Chicago! Visit the National Air Derby, to be held at the Curtiss-Wright-Reynold's Airport, near Glenview, from August 23 to September 1. In addition to the most prominent flyers of America and foreign countries, the foremost German flyers will also participate, among whom will be the well-known Fritz Lohse with a Junker airplane. To honor those German flyers who have come across the Atlantic to compete in the Derby, and to honor and <pb facs="5418474_7_1335.jpg" n="2"/>acknowledge that which Germany has bestowed upon the world in the field of aeronautics, we should participate as one man on German Day, Monday, August 25. On this day, German flyers will demonstrate Germany's feats in the air.</p>
   <p>Let us prove to our German flyers and to the world how heartily we respond to everything our country sends us. The tribunes reserved for us are decorated with German national flags.Therefore, come in masses.</p>
   <p>Join in the parade to be held August 22, and welcome the German flyers, who will occupy automobiles decorated with German flags.</p>
   <p>An opportunity to meet our flyers personally will be offered on August 26 in the Steuben Club, where a sociable evening has been arranged by the reception committee of the German Club. Once again we urge you to appear in large numbers, and prove to our fellow countrymen, how proud we are of them.</p>

Siehel, secretary of the German group of the World's Fair; Reinhold Oeschler, president of the protective union of German sport-societies; Leopold Saltiel, first speaker of the Illinois Turner District; Albert Wehrwein, president of the United Singers; William Sack, president of the Low-German Grand Lodge; Oscar Stoffels, chairman of the German Club; J.W.
