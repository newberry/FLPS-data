   <p>We received the following letter.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The citizens from Milwaukee Avenue look with pride upon their Aurora Turnhalle. It is without doubt the most beautiful and the most elegant theater in Chicago. Also is the company of players a good one.</p>
   <p>Our German newspapers have given the German dramatic art little encouragement. We notice with pleasure that during the last week the Staats Zeitung has consecrated several columns to the discussion of the English theater and this gives us the hope that the German theater will receive the same consideration.</p>
   <p>Respectfully, Wurster &amp; Methua.</p>
   <p>We hope it to be true what the gentlemen Wurster and Methua have to say about the <pb facs="5418474_7_0353.jpg" n="2"/>city theater of the west side. Concerning the silence of the German newspapers in the past about the German theater not much need to be said. The most flattering one can say about it, is nothing. Often the German newspapers have started to support the German theater and, every time had to give up the attempt. So nothing remained but to announce the representations before hand and then keep silent. How can anything be accomplished when the talents are so dispersed, when as on the north side there are three theaters within the confines of a little space. In a short while we will visit each of our German theaters.</p>
