   <p>The singing section of the German Aid Bund, Chicago District, yesterday had its great Spring concert in both halls of the Lincoln Turnerhall, followed by a ball. The extraordinarily large attendance showed how universal is the interest, in German circles, in an affair of this kind, which provides an evening of rare musical enjoyment. The expectations of the audience were fully realized; soloists and groups of singers did their best, and all performances won great applause. Particular recognition was given the mass chorus composed of Concordia Liedertafel, Swiss Men's Chorus, and the singing section of the D.U.B. They gave, under the direction of E. Tamm, "Sternennacht" by Schulken in a most masterly fashion.</p>
   <p>All other performances could be put on a basis of equality with the above. The orchestra was delightful with its pleasing melodies from operas, as was <pb facs="5418474_7_0632.jpg" n="2"/>the wonderful tenor solo of Mr. Fritz Glassneck--"An Deinem Herzen lass michtraenmen". Herr Rudolph Reiners proved himself to be master of his instrument in the violin solo, "Ballet Scene". The yodling quartet of the Swiss Men's Chorus gave, in a most accomplished manner, several delightful Swiss yodlings.</p>
   <p>The Excelsior men's choir sang the "Rose" by Nast; the chorus of the organization which gave the festival sang Pache's "Saengermarsch", Kayser's "O Griuesst sie mir" and Richter's "Serenade". Following this, hearty applause was given the singers and their directors.</p>
   <p>An extraordinarily good-natured dance, which lasted until morning, concluded the festival, which was completely successful. The long preparations of the festival committee bore fruit. Under the direction of the president, Joseph M. Schoen, the great success of the evening was the best reward for the pains and efforts expended. The following gentlemen were members of the committee: B. Egger, E. Roggwiller, Otto Schlang, and Carl Schulz.</p>

   <p>Likewise, as a sign of Spring, stood the festival of section 80, Almrausch of the Bavarian National Organization of North America, given at the Mozart Hall, and the concert (followed by a ball) of the Edelweiss Ladies' Choir of the South Side. The Immergrun Lodge No. 14 of the Order of Hermann's Sisters celebrated its Silver Jubilee at Wicker Park Hall. The South Side Saenger Bund held its eighth anniversary festival in St. George's School Hall; it was successful in every way. The same is true of the bunco games, followed up by a dance, held by the Goethe Male Chorus and the Fidelio Aid Society No 1, at Fleiner's Hall.</p>
   <p>Concerts were also given by the Douglas mutual Aid Society of Chicago, in Sieben's Hall, and by the Eintracht Women's Club, in the Wicker Park Hall.</p>
