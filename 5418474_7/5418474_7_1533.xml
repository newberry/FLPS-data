   <p>Friedrich Schiller, poet and dramatist, who died May 9, 1805, lived again last night in the minds and hearts of 2,000 German-Americans who gathered in the Auditorium Theater to pay homage to his genius and work. The Theodore Thomas Orchestra, the Apollo Club, and several distinguished soloists participated in a concert which had Schiller for its inspiration.</p>
   <p>Edmund J. James, president of the University of Illinois, was to have made an address in German, but at the last moment he found he would have to remain in Springfield to attend to legislative matters, and wired his regrets. Otto C. Schneider, president of the general committee on management, was his eleventh hour substitute. Mr. Schneider confined himself to a brief address in which he commented on the significance of the celebration.</p>
   <p>Schiller's Bust Draped.</p>
   <p>The hundreds of Chicagoans who entered the great theater lobby were reminded <pb facs="5418474_7_1534.jpg" n="2"/>of the nature of the affair by a huge bust of the distinguished German which faced the main entrance of the playhouse. This bust stood on a high pedestal of imitation marble. About it were potted plants - ferns, palms and creeping vines - and at either side, hanging just below the face of the master, were wreaths of laurel tied with ribbons.</p>
   <p>Within the theater the significance of the festival was elaborated further. Beneath the two tiers of boxes were intertwined the German and American colors, pinned with shields and festooned in graceful folds half the length of the hall. The programmes were in German and bore as a frontispiece a half-tone of the poet. There were included in the last pages and original ode and a letter concerning the celebration, issued by the committee in charge. Upon the stage were ninety members of the Theodore Thomas Orchestra - led by Frederick A. Stock and 150 members of the Apollo Club.</p>
   <p>Second In Series.</p>
   <p>The entertainment in reality was the second feature of a five day festival. What was designated as a preceding or opening performance was given on Friday night, April 14, in the Auditorium Theater, when Beon Wachiner's German troupe <pb facs="5418474_7_1535.jpg" n="3"/>of artists rendered Schiller's "William Tell". The other entertainments were arranged to be held on or about the time of the anniversary of the great man's death.</p>
   <p>The musical programme last night consisted of orchestra numbers of the purely overture class and a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. This last work was composed by Beethoven through the inspiration he received from one of Schiller's famous works. Mr. Stock directed. Previous to the symphony, which occupied the entire second part of the programme there were an overture from the "Bride of Messina", by Schumann, and the "Wallenstein Trilogy'' after Schiller, by D'Indy.</p>
   <p>One of the prominent guests who was the target of not a few lorgnettes was the special representative of the King of Wurtemberg. This dignified stranger was Major General Dr. Albert von Pfister, the accredited envoy of his majesty to the festival at Chicago. The monarch himself is one of the patrons of the festival, and, being unable to attend in person, sent General von Pfister to take his place. The German general is as well known as an historian and writer as he is in military circles. He wrote an account of the American revolution, and since arriving in Chicago has delighted his new friends with his familiarity with American institutions and customs. He is the guest of Mr. Schneider <pb facs="5418474_7_1536.jpg" n="4"/>and was with the Schneider box party last night.</p>
   <p>Programme For Today.</p>
   <p>The Schiller memorial is to be continued today, tomorrow and Tuesday. At 3 o'clock this afternoon in the Auditorium there will be popular musical and literary entertainment. A male chorus, the Verelnigti Maennerchor of 900 voices, will sing in German and there is to be an English oration by professor Calvin Thomas of Columbia University.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow there is to be an academic conference of professors, who will discuss German language and literature. These pundits will be gathered from various universities of the United States. This conference will take place at the Art Institute. On Tuesday, the anniversary day, at 1:30 o'clock there are to be commemorative exercises at the Schiller monument in Lincoln Park. At 8 o'clock Tuesday night in the Auditorium Major General von Pfister will deliver an oration. The commemoration prize prologue will also be recited, and there will be a performance of "The Lay of the Bell", living pictures and Music composed by Lindpainter.</p>
