   <p>The Schwaben Club and the gymnastic club "Vorwaerts" celebrated day before yesterday, the birthday of this great German poet. The Schwaben arranged a spiritual, enjoyable evening. The attendance of the "Vorwaerts" was an enormous one, and all guests amused themselves very much. Mr. Huhn of Milwaukee gave an excellent speech on the theme "Schiller and his period. His speech was very interesting and educational. Mr. Pfeifer the chairman of the spiritual committee also made a short, speech and the song section performed several good songs. Also a living picture of William Tell was represented. Miss Minnie Gloy a daughter of the previous gymnastic teacher John Gloy, gave a piano solo with such ability, that she had to give an encore. After the end of the program an enjoyable dance entertainment was arranged. Also the Schwaben celebrated their famed compatriot in love and honor. They laid flowers and wreaths at the foot of the Schiller statue in Lincoln Park and later they had a meeting in Peter Mehrs place. They celebrated the great poet in an enthusiastic and patriotic manner, and many glasses were emptied to the progress of German poetry and art.</p>
