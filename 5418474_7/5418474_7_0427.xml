   <p>For the celebration of its thirty-sixth anniversary festival, the well-known and popular Swabian Ladies' Club held a concert yesterday afternoon and evening, followed by a ball, at which humor came into its own, and every one of the participants had a few pleasant hours.</p>
   <p>Clad in the becoming costumes of their Swabian homeland, the ladies of the administrative board, led by their president Frau Lina Renner, welcomed the guests and took care that the affair was a success.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with the "Raymond Overture", by Thomas, played by Bernie Hartwig's orchestra. Afterwards, Frau Lina Renner, the president, spoke a few words of welcome and thanked the participating organizations for their numerous attendance. The youthful dancer, Ellen Schmidt, displayed a dance fantasy to the melody of a Strauss valse,which was greatly appreciated by the audience, <pb facs="5418474_7_0428.jpg" n="2"/>which presented the artist with a beautiful wreath of flowers. She was followed by the tenor, Emil Baun, who sang " Mein Schwabenland" and "Mein Vaterland."</p>
   <p>After two more orchestral selections, the well-known Swabian Saengerbund came upon the stage and, under the direction of H. A. Rehberg, sung "Die Kapelle", "Dorfreigen", and, as an encore, "Eislein von Caub".</p>
   <p>The ladies' chorus, conducted by Herr Rehberg, sang gracefully "Schoen Elschen" and "Der Kuckuck". Later in the program, Ruth and Elfriede Schlehauf delighted the audience with the charming vaudeville sketch "Heidenroeslein", and won hearty applause. The program was closed with well-known comic act "Kaltgestellt" (put on ice), staged by Frau Erna Beierwalter and her daughter Agnes. The ball that followed was enjoyed by the guests for a long time.</p>
   <p>The management of the successful affair in the hands of the president, Frau <pb facs="5418474_7_0429.jpg" n="3"/>Lina Renner; the honorary president, Frau Frieda Zuegel; the vice-president, Frau Louise Berner; the secretaries, Bertha Wagner and Anna Schwindemann; the treasurer, Minnie Moore and the other officers Cary Horn, Marie Stallmeister, Caroline Fischer, Ellen Schmidt, Josephine Hartmann and Minnie Pfaff.
