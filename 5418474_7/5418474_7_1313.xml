   <p>The Swiss Liederkranz yesterday had a good time together with friends and sympathizers at the Swiss Clubhouse, 635 Webster Avenue. It was a vintage festival which was a success in spite of the untoward weather conditions which interfered with the arrival of visitors. The hall was decorated in keeping with the fall season and with the festive occasion. Of course, there were grapes which, wrapped in neat parcels, were a welcome gift to many a fortunate visitor, who will take them home to remind him of the pleasant hours spent among gay people at the Swiss Clubhouse.</p>
   <p>The festival was opened with an entertaining program consisting of music by Fenner's orchestra and a few numbers by the Swiss Liederkranz, which <pb facs="5418474_7_1314.jpg" n="2"/>won for the singers, as well as their director, J. N. Moos, enthusiastic applause. The "Vagantenlied" by Julius Wengert was followed by the "Donau-Wellen Walzer" by J. Ivanovici; the latter was a masterpiece by the men's choir, cultivating joy and love for German songs. Thanks to careful training they mastered the problem in a manner deserving great credit.</p>
   <p>The greatest success, however, was attained by the singers with the "Laendliche Konzertprobe" (concert rehearsal in a country place) as arranged by Ernst Simon. It afforded them an opportunity to go to the limit with their humor, and to keep the laughter of the audience at high pitch. The funny rendition found such enthusiastic acceptance that it had to be repeated, at least in part, before the program could be continued as scheduled. As director of this "rehearsal", Albert Langenegger presided with skill and with "swing". The director of the Liederkranz, J. H. Moos, accompanied on the piano.</p>
   <p>As soloists, E. Moldenhauer and A. Friedmann contributed to the enjoyment of the entertainment. The former entertained with a few humorous songs, <pb facs="5418474_7_1315.jpg" n="3"/>while Mr. Friedmann gave two pleasing tunes from Vienna. The audience thanked both singers with flattering applause, which they deserved.</p>
   <p>The evening wound up with dances, which kept the visitors happy for a few hours, especially because care was taken that no one go without food or drink.</p>
   <p>The preparations for the vintage festival were made in an elaborate manner by a committee composed of the following members: Alois Ruckstuhl, chairman; Frank Hauser (kitchen chef), Hans Huber, Alfred Bamert, and August Ruedi.</p>
   <p>The officers pro tem of the club are: David Zweifel, president; Alois Ruckstuhl, vice-president; Fritz Schneider, secretary-treasurer; Frank Hauser, secretary pro tem; George Schnetzer, treasurer; E. Zubser, bummel treasurer, and Hans Huber, keeper of archives.</p>
