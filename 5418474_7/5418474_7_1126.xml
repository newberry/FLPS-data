   <p>The Chicago Germans celebrate German Day every year. It is dedicated to the commemoration of the great achievements of the citizens of German descent in their new home, and of their services in the formation and development of the United States; and this celebration should remind the present generation to preserve their German inheritance and to cling to good German habits, to the old meaningful customs, and to the German language.</p>
   <p>The American of German extraction should be proud of his German descent. He should revere both his adopted country, chosen by himself or by his parents, and his native land. He should not allow the emotional ties with his native land to break, but should cultivate them zealously, in order continually to draw new strength from German culture for the new responsibility which Fate placed upon him when she brought him to the New World. This new responsibility <pb facs="5418474_7_1127.jpg" n="2"/>consists in supplying the American nation, which is still in its period of development, with all the best characteristics of German culture, and thus to give the influence of German ways and customs on American life the importance it should have.</p>
   <p>The German character leads to the division of the German people. Hundreds of German societies, with just as many different aims and purposes, are the best proof of this, as far as Chicago is concerned. Once a year, however, on German Day, all those of German extraction, whether they are citizens of this country or of the Reich, and even if they are usually bitter enemies, should forget their differences and think of themselves only as members of the great German race. The German Day celebration is to be held today at the Stadium on Madison Street. Those in whose veins German blood flows belong beside the other Germans assembled there.</p>
