   <p>The first concert by the Seipp Singing Fraternity was given at the South Side Turner Hall yesterday. This young society founded only three months ago, scored a thorough success with its vocal offerings. Employees of the Conrad Seipp brewery comprise the society, of which Mr. C. Barginde is director. The singers, undoubtedly, won many friends at their first public appearance yesterday, which was expressed by an almost unequaled enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The Seipp Singing Fraternity is composed of excellently trained voices. They selected as their first offering the song, "Father Rhein", by Naegely, followed by "Salute to the Homeland", by Kramer. The Woman's choir was heard then in the "Boatmen's Song "by Abt. The 'Mozart male choir" gave a lovely performance of "O, Delightful Springtime," while the children's choir presented "Gently down the Stream of Time" by Borton. The humoristic song sketch "More Work for the Undertaker", by <pb facs="5418474_7_0766.jpg" n="2"/>Leigh, delivered by Adam Schneider, as well as the two humorous sketches presented by Hugo Henschel, added greatly to the success of the evening. Mmes. Lucie Graf, and Edna Waters, rendered piano solos, and Willie Haenel, a student, played a violin solo.</p>
