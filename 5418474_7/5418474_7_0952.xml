<title level="a">THE BENEFIT CONCERT FOR THE DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT</title></bibl>

   <p>"Benevolence has rewards of its own!" That became apparent to more than a thousand persons who visited McVicker's Theater yesterday to help bolster the funds of the Deutsche Gesellschaft (German Society) so that its charitable work may continue uninterruptedly, and, incidentally, to enjoy a musical treat.</p>
   <p>The benefit concert of the Deutsche Gesellschaft proved to be a carefully arranged affair; it was a credit to all concerned and gave concrete evidence that the German philanthropical trait is still strong. A well-filled house, with only the uppermost gallery being sparsely occupied, indicated that the receipts are destined to add considerably to the coffers of the Society.</p>
   <p>The concert in itself was a highly satisfactory presentation.</p>
   <p>To be technically critical concerning the attainments of the various performers <pb facs="5418474_7_0953.jpg" n="2"/>would be unfair. The entertainment was given in the name of benevolence and the audience patronized it in the same spirit. However, if any of the collaborators are entitled to especial mention, then this honor deservedly belongs to Mrs. Clara Hauk, as her charming renditions made us wish to hear her often. This ingratiating singer should heed the admonition of the Sermon on the Mount: "Hide not thy light under a bushel," and benefit a music-loving world accordingly. Neither must we forget Mrs. Koelling; she sang splendidly and shared the triumphs of the evening with Mrs. Hauk.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kellner and Mr. Koss likewise evoked prolonged applause, and the offerings of the Germania Male Chorus left little to be desired.</p>
   <p>A "Romance," composed by Mr. Kellner, was a very difficult number; being written for a quarted, with organ and piano accompaniment. The selection called forth genuine applause.</p>
   <p>After the concert Gumbeat's delightful musical comedy "The Love Potion" was <pb facs="5418474_7_0954.jpg" n="3"/>presented and therein Messrs. Geo. Schleiffarth, Jonas, Mrs. Schleiffarth, Miss Herder, and Miss Rosenthal vied with each other in regaling the audience.</p>
   <p>Carl Koelling, who performed the difficult task of rehearsing the musical portion of the program, and Mr. Schleiffarth, who functioned as stage director, are deserving of particular recognition for their endeavors. The success of the entertainment constitutes, in itself, their adequate reward.</p>
