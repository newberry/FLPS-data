   <p>The German Theater opened this year's season with the operetta, "I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg."</p>
   <p>As might be expected, the operetta, a work in three acts, resulted in two full houses, practically sold out. The work of the German Popular Stage of Chicago, (an association) whereby the German theater was enabled to obtain funds at the beginning of the season, proved its merit.</p>
   <p>Being familiar with the German theatrical public, it was highly gratifying to note the many new faces among the audience yesterday. One may infer there-from that the patronage extends to an ever increasing territory. This argues well and is highly desirable in assuring the continuance of the German theater.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1000.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The German General consulate appeared in corpore, fully represented. Further interest in the theater was manifested by the presence of Mrs. Bertha Baur, Mrs. Hamilton Lewis, and City Treasurer Peterson, and others.</p>
   <p>Let it be recorded here, the public did not come merely to parade the latest fashions, but followed the performance with visible interest. Again and again, spontaneous manifestations of acclaim gave evidence that the German theater knows its public, and chose wisely in selecting this operetta.</p>
   <p>Students in their modish attire, engulfed by towering debts, irascible, tempestuous creditors, sordid nightmares of debtor cells, genuine students fidelities derived from beer, veritable bacchanalias producing acuminated conical elevations of our cuticle or, if you prefer, goose pimples, among this or that straggling Latin beholder. But, nevertheless, true German love for music, folklore songs, and student melodies, more or less stale scholarly magic, who would not revert to his own unforgettable years, the wisdom procuring period, that irretrievable time!</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1001.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A shot of sentimentality was also there, and thus all could be appeased. The entertainment was splendid, when one considers a lovelorn princess showing profound affections for a debt ridden student, an ever intriguing proposition, even if nothing comes of it.</p>
   <p>Since new scenery was also available, well painted, and in good taste, one gained the impression that the German theater's opening performance heralds a better theatrical season.</p>
   <p>The artists worked uniformly for the success of the play. The roster: Hans Muenz, Hela Lindelof .... and others.</p>
   <p>The newly engaged singer, Miss Lindelof, in her portrayal of the princess, was given little opportunity to display her vocal gifts and we must therefor refrain from definite comment. She, as well as Hans Muenz, are recent acquisitions, both are pleasing personalities, and of good stage appearance, their future achievements presenting an interesting chapter.</p>

   <p>The orchestra, under the oft' tried leadership of Woldemar, probably Waldemar, and Christoph, was excellent as always.</p>
