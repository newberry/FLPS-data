   <p>The farce, "Runaway Women" by Berla was played yesterday before a full house. the principal actress was, without doubt the excellent "Viennese Soubrette, Miss Pagay, who at her first appearance has gained the favor of the public. In yesterday's performance she showed her supremacy as a Soubrette of first rank. Attractive comic songs, a beautiful voice, splendid acting, ability, highly seasoned but not excessive, had their deserved effect. She was well supported by all the other actors and actresses. The harmony and ensemble was a rarely achieved result, but local artists did not take a back seat when playing with such a great star as Miss Pagay. They seemed to be incited to a superb performance.</p>
   <p>The production was in every sense a master piece.</p>
