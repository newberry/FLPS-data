   <p>The well-known German theatrical manager, died in his villa at Waukegan. At five in the early morning, he closed his eyes for the eternal slumber, the result of a stroke he suffered on November 20th. Through his demise America has lost one of the best known, most capable and ambitious managers of the German stage. In Chicago, St. Louis, and Philadelphia, he was especially active in his chosen vocation. At the old Vorwaerts-Turnhalle, 12th Street near Halsted Street, he appeared in heroic parts during the early seventies. His Wilhelm Tell was considered an unexcelled accomplishment at that time.</p>
   <p>In 1875, he founded a German theatre at Turner Hall which brought new glory and distinguished recognition. Later, he managed the New Chicago Theater on his responsibility. It was located at the present site of the Olympic Theater. He gave exemplary productions of German plays, also geniume classical performances, and was able to procure renowned artists for his programs. We need only mention the unforgettable Methua Schoeller. At that time his many friends and admires gave him the name of "Alexander the Great." At Philadelphia , where he managed the German Theater, last winter, he held a golden anniversary <pb facs="5418474_7_0113.jpg" n="2"/>having functioned as theatrical director for fifty years. His name is an inspiration in the history of German theaters in America.</p>
