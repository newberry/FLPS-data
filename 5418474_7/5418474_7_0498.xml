   <p>In pleasant surroundings, the picnic of the Vereinigte Damenchoere (United Ladies' Choruses) of Chicago was held yesterday in Maple Grove.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon, visitors were numerous, and all had a really good time. The lady singers could naturally not resist giving pleasure with a few songs, directed by their leader, H. E. Rehberg; the rest of the day was given over to sociability and to all kinds of entertainment including dancing. The bodily needs (sic) of the guests were well taken care of so that all were given what they came for (sic).</p>
   <p>Besides a number of other friends and patrons of the Vereinigte Damenchoere, the guests included the president of the Saengerbund of the Northwest and of the United Singers of Chicago, A. C. Wehrwein, and the president of the German Day Organization, Gustave A. Brand, who could not resist visiting the fine party of the ladies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0499.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among many others, the following ladies contributed especially to the success of the fest: Ida Huch, president; Mathilda Hagen, first vice-president; Terese Mattis, second vice-president; Cecilie Bade, secretary; Auguste Triphahn, treasurer, also Amalie Ohlmann, Emma Schmidt, Clara Lindskog, Marie Schulze, Barbara Parisone, and Anna Moriarity from Hammond.</p>
