   <p>Yesterday evening, there was held in the Schiller Building the quarterly meeting of delegates, under the presidency of Judge Max Eberhardt, of the Chicago branch of the German-American union, The board of directors recommended previously to the general meeting, to celebrate the German day as a national festival in the open, and the recommendation was accepted, further action was left in the hands of the directors. They reported yesterday, that a suitable park could not be had, and also that other obstacles have been found, so that it became impossible to carry out the original plan, therefore it was considered more advisable, to rent the auditorium for the purpose, but make the festival more popular than it was last year. The celebration, which should take place Sunday, October 4, will join the meeting of the Illinois State National Union's yearly convention of the German-American union. Performances by the Thomas Orchestra, of Men's Choruses and of Soloists, living pictures and only one speech are in view.</p>
