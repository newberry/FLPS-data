   <p>Dear Sir: Having chosen the columns of the Abendpost to voice your opinion of the local German Theater, please permit me to use the same means to reply to you.</p>
   <p>You recommend that I fully utilize the works of Germany's most prominent poets, such as Gustave von Moser, Ludwig Fulda, and Otto Ernst, when I select plays for performance. Since your knowledge of German literature is so limited, it is not difficult to explain why you chose the evening when the play entitled "When the Bomb Explodes" was presented at your first visit to the theater. Well, Mr. Elsner, I do not wish to undermine your faith in Moser, Fulda, and Ernst as the greatest German poets. But I would, advise that you make frequent retreats into the inner sanctums of your library. Perhaps you would then learn from these poets that it is wrong to accuse anybody unjustly. And that is what you have done, Mr. Elsner. If you had given merely occasional attention to my schedule of plays, you would have <pb facs="5418474_7_0064.jpg" n="2"/>known that in the past short season more than a hundred plays selected from the works of the following poets were performed: Goethe, Schiller, Grillparzer, Ganghofer, Engel, Heyjermans, Ibsen, Hauptmann, Sudermann, Kleist, Dreyer, Thoma, Bahr, Schoenherr, Shakespeare. But the list of prominent poets who compare favorably with the ones you mentioned contains many more names....</p>
   <p>Furthermore, you stated: "I would gladly speak a good word in behalf of the German Theater if at least one unobjectionable play were produced every week." Well, Mr. Elsner, I can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that plays by "prominent" poets were staged three times every week. Local Germans and the press may be the judge of your unjustified attack. As far as I am concerned, you have forfeited the right to be taken seriously.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Conrad Seidemann,</p>
   <p>Director of the German Theater</p>
