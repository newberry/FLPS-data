   <p>After witnessing the first three performances of the season, we came to the conclusion, that Mr. Hochster's wish is, to have society get used to flighty engagements and mass-marriages. Although, we live in an era of steam and electricity, those patentquick love stories, are somewhat too progressive, and are not a good example for our youth.</p>
   <p>It is very true, that this kind of entertainment satisfies, but society should not allow itself, to cultivate a taste for such frivolousness. It seems that society wishes to live entirely on affection, if the statement made by the director," that society prefers plays of that nature", is true.- There was a large audience present. As for the company itself, the old members are good but many new members are not as good as old ones. We will refrain from a synopsis of the play, as more room would be required which is not worth while. The title of last night's performance was "Mercury." Mr. Heinemann played the part of a professor of chemistry, whose temperament through profound <pb facs="5418474_7_0272.jpg" n="2"/>study of quick silver, became almost what the name implies. He played the part well, except for some exaggeration. Mrs. Scholz-Rademacher, played the part of the professor's wife, a walking rental library. She acted excellently, but as for looks, she did not fit the part. Miss Wassmann as "Evchen" the couple's daughter was exquisite. Mr. Radenbach tried his best to impersonate the spoiled and repulsive child of his mother "Josef". Mr. Meier as "Dr. Knops" was excellent and proved again, what a capable character impersonator he is. Mr. Ravene who played the part of "Bruno Joller", a conglomoration of a madcap and philospher was very good. Mr. Leuschner and Mrs. Meyer did well, as the servants in love with each other. Miss Thyssen was not equal to the part of the love lorn equestriane, and Miss Reinhardt, although an exquisite actress, has not learned the art of make-up. The ensemble was good, although at times extremely mechanical. Splendid scenery satisfied the eyes of the audience.</p>
   <p>There is only one German Theatre in the city now, therefore, we hope, that Mr. Hochster will make a real "art Institute" of it, and not miss this opportunity.</p>
