   <p>The benefit concert for Mr. Dietz was a real success.</p>
   <p>With due credit to Mr. Dietz, German song as well as German custom has found an excellent and ardent promoter. Out of deep gratitude for his efforts, a benefit concert for the beloved artist was held at the North Side Turn Hall last night, at which time his numerous friends presented him with a wreath of laurels. The address which was planned by Mr. Oscar Bremer and which was supposed to accompany the presentation of the high honor, was cleverly prevented by the humble and unassuming Mr. Dietz. Nevertheless, knowing the persistent nature of Mr. Bremer, the speech was delayed rather than desisted from. Those of us who came to honor the beloved singer last night were numerous indeed, since he has an extremely engaging personality and is a prominent figure in the world of music, Besides, he gives so freely of his great art whenever any charitable institution arranges a musical fete. Mr. Dietz himself <pb facs="5418474_7_0771.jpg" n="2"/>participated in the presentation of last night's program, thus adding to the attractiveness which assured success. Renowned singing societies as the Senefelder-Liederkranz, the Schiller-Liedertafel, the Harugari-Liedertafel, and the Turner Hale Choir also participated, as did the prominent soloists Miss Eva Wycoff, Mr. Franz Wagner, and Mr. Bruno Kuehn, In charge of the concert was Professor F. A. Kern, which fact alone promised a brilliant musical treat.......</p>
   <p>Loud and lasting acclaim was tendered Miss Wycoff, upon her magnificent presentation of "Elizabeth's Prayer," from the opera "Tannhauser." Mr. Kuehn, the eminent violinist, then gave a superb performance of the "Legend," by Bohm, and the "Prize Song" from "Die Meistersinger," for which he was adequately rewarded by the attentive audience. An ovation of rare intensity was accorded Mr. Dietz when he appeared on the stage. He gave an exhibition of his beautiful baritone voice in the performance <pb facs="5418474_7_0772.jpg" n="3"/>of the popular "Rheinwine Song," electrifying the already animated listeners. The singing societies joined then in the presentation of "Thoughts of Spring" by Tschirch. The applause was so tremendous they were complelled to give an encore. The combined singing societies with Mr. Dietz as soloist rendered then the "Pastoral Song" by Grieg. This was followed by Mr. Bruno Kuehn presenting the "Romance" by Ries, and the "Hungarian Rhapsody" by Hauser. Miss Wycoff was then heard in "Gretchen's Spinning Song" by Schubert, and "I Love You" by Foerster, with a bell-like sweetness and clarity of voice, upon which occasion she was presented with a huge bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>The final numbers on the program brought to the stage the celebrated cellist Mr. Franz Wagner, and again Mr. Dietz who sang the "Romance" from "Fra Diavolo" by Auber. A ball followed the concert.</p>
