   <p>Those who came to the Lincoln Turner Hall Saturday evening noticed at once that something special was going on. Even before eight o'clock the great hall was beginning to fill up, and at nine o'clock, when Master of Ceremonies Menzinger appeared before the curtain, every seat was taken. The curtains parted, and the performance began. The singers, all dressed alike (with white trousers, dark coats and brown ties), were seated in a beautifully decorated garden scene, under trees and Chinese lanterns.</p>
   <p>Under the title, "Ein Gemuetlicher Saengerbummel in Der Alten Heimat" (A Pleasant Singing Stroll in the Old Country), Conductor Ludwig Lohmiller of the Westseite Saengerkranz (West Side Singing Society) prepared a program in which male choruses, mixed choruses, solo performances, and dances portrayed a piece of the old country. The performance opened with the "RRRauss Polka," a choral song with orchestral accompaniment. Then came the comedian Michael Faust, a graceful dancing couple, a medley of <pb facs="5418474_7_0494.jpg" n="2"/>drinking songs for the male chorus, and general singing with the orchestra. A mixed chorus, composed of the Damenchor (Women's Chorus) Lorelei and the Westseite Saengerkranz, concluded the program by singing a special arrangement by Director Lohmiller of the "Glueckswalzer" from the "Tango Prinzessin". All performances received hearty but well-deserved applause, which was meant both for the singers and the director.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The article concludes with the statement that there was dancing; and a list of members of the committee in charge of the affair.]</p>
