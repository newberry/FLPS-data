   <p>"The Germania" of the New Parliament Building. The beautiful Statue of the "Germania" which is destined to ornament the front of the new Parliament Building in Berlin, is going to be exhibited at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>It is to reward the efforts of Mr. Wermuth, that the German Emperor has given his approval. The Statue will be placed in the Manufacturer's Building and is considered one of the most beautiful pieces exhibited by the German Section. A gala-Sleigh and Coach of State of the pomp-loving King Ludwig II of Bavaria will create the greatest admiration of all visitors in the palace of Transportation. Both are in fact artistic works of Wonder and, are unique. In Oakwood's Cemetery, the assistant foreman Wilhelm Klinke, who lost his life by falling from the scaffold a few days ago, was Buried yesterday. A large crowd, among them the representative of the German Government and his staff, attended the last ceremonies for the deceased. Klinke left a widow and several orphans in Berlin.</p>
