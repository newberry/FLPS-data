<title level="a">UNITED MEN'S CHORUSES OFFER CHICAGO SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>At the Lincoln Turner Hall the United Men's Choruses of Chicago, offered last night something entirely new to music-loving Chicagoans, who enjoyed an evening of songs during which twenty-one Men's Choruses, made into twelve groups, sang under the baton of a temperary conductor. This event can be looked upon as an example of this year's great National Singers Festival.</p>
   <p>It should be stated in advance that the halls usually at the disposal of our Men's choruses are not sufficiently large for such occasions as last night's. The Lincoln Turner Hall was overcrowded to such an extent that a person could be thankful of being able to find standing place. Nevertheless <pb facs="5418474_7_0578.jpg" n="2"/>the performance was beautiful; the United Men's Choruses, through their splendid singing at last night's "Evening of Songs," have achieved great success.</p>
   <p>Appreciative singing is not unknown in Germany. Yesterday's evening, reminding us of this German love for singing, brought forth the wish to introduce similar arrangements here in America, especially in Chicago with its fifty Men's choruses, as Mr. C. F. Pegenan mentioned in his welcome address. Being the chairman of the music committee of the United Men's choruses and yesterday's "Evening of Songs," Mr. Pegenan was requested to welcome the great audience in the name of the immense union of twenty-three men's choruses of 1200 voices. With enthusiastic words, he praised <pb facs="5418474_7_0579.jpg" n="3"/>the high ideal which influences the German singers in their doings, Cultivation of the German song, this incomparable treasure of the German to cultivate the German language, habits, and customs. He mentioned the Chicago Singers Festival of 1924 and the unforgettable days of 1928 in Vienna. "Who listened to the songs of 40,000 singers there," he declared, "will also foster here in America the German song. And next year we celebrate our Golden Jubilee."</p>
