   <p>[A lengthy account published on Oct. 9, contained the following figures: one-half million people visited Chicago.... 300,000 persons came to see the World's Fair during the last forty-eight hours..... More than 400 railroad trains of double capacity were pressed into service..... A computation of the total number of tickets sold cannot be made at this late hour..... An item to appear on Oct. 11, says there was an unprecedented attendance of 718,526 for the World's Fair on Chicago Day..... A list of large figures and dates is to be appended for comparison...... The next largest attendance ever had was for the "Revue of the Union Armies," in 1865, estimated at 500,000. Transl.]</p>
   <p>The first float of the German group represented Germany; its art, <pb facs="5418474_7_1592.jpg" n="2"/>science, and industry. Both floats used the pyramidal arrangement to display the various figures. They were designed by Louis Kindt and Louis Kurz. The actual reproduction was entrusted to Mr. Adolph Steidle, who created a dramatic and effective ensemble with pleasing color combinations. The apex of the pyramidal display was formed by the living figure of Germania standing atop the triumphal arch; apparel, arms, and position reminiscent of the Niederwald monument. Underneath this arch, or rather in the pergola formed by its four square pillars, stands "J. Gutenberg," inventor of the printing process and his compatriot "Johann Fust." "Gutenberg" is shown reading the first proof which "Fust" had just taken from the press. To one side of this archway stands "John Kepler," discoverer of the cosmic laws that rule our planetary system. He is shown viewing the heavens through a telescope. The following <pb facs="5418474_7_1593.jpg" n="3"/>great men, who brought fame to Germany were also represented: Sebastian Bach, the master of music; Immanuel Kant, Germany's greatest philosopher; Justus Liebig, the chemist; Alexander von Humbolt, the naturalist; as well as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller, the poets.</p>
   <p>A good contrast was formed by the powerful blacksmith standing next to his forge, symbolical of Germany's industry that supplies world markets. All the models, by their costumes and general appearance were so authentic and so effectively presented that the subjects personified, such as Bachus and the wine industry, became immediately apparent.</p>
   <p>Education was represented by Miss Lina Schaible, drama by Mrs. W. Fabian, natural history by Miss M. Schuhmann, music by Miss A. Fabian, domestic arts by Miss F. Mueller. Miss Bertha Fabian played the part of "Electra," <pb facs="5418474_7_1594.jpg" n="4"/>the goddess of electricity, a science which plays a prominent part in the technical sciences of Germany at the present time. Indicative of the future development and importance of electricity, the winged figure stood on an elevation. The task of the Chicago Turngemeinde was to procure actors for the German floats, and one of their officials, A. G. Hambrock, superintendent of gymnastics, complied in a splendid manner.....</p>
   <p>The second float was provided through the contributions of the German residents. It showed how our German-born American citizens helped create and defend freedom. Under the protection of the "Goddess of Liberty," leaning against a shield and upholding the American flag in her right hand, stand the German generals Steuben, Muehlenberg, De Kalb, von Herkheiner, Siegel, the heroes of Valley Forge in 1776 and the Civil war, <pb facs="5418474_7_1595.jpg" n="5"/>with their Pennsylvanian - German soldiers who fought on American soil, and the Chicago Turner regiments. Needless to say, historically accurate costumes and uniforms were used. In the center of this group was a large, open book with the years 1776 and 1861 printed on its pages; the eventful years of glory so significant in our German-American history. Surmounting this book, one perceives the American eagle hemmed in by a huge forest of flags. Near the "Goddess of Liberty" is "Abraham Lincoln," calling the people to arms. The friends of free institutions gather for the defence, the German Turners in the vanguard.</p>
   <p>The "Goddess of Liberty" was enacted by Miss Ella Schultz.....</p>
