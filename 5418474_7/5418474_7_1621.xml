   <p>p. 5 - The Chicago lodges of the German Order of the Harugari held their picnic and summer night festival at Ogden's Grove. A parade during the forenoon was one of its successful features. The Northwestern lodges met on the corner of Wood Street and Milwaukee Avenue and the lodges from other districts converged on Market Place, which was the center for the huge gathering. At least 1,000 people participated. Mr. Karl Ziegenhagen was the marshal and under his leadership the throng marched towards the festival grounds. The festively decorated wagons and the magnificent floats were much admired. One of the most beautiful displays was the allegorical picture of Chicago, presented by the Carl Marx Lodge.</p>

   <p>It portrayed Columbia, surrounded by the States, presenting a laurel wreath to Chicago. On the float Germania, patterned after the famous "Wacht Am Rhein," with the symbolic figures of the German provinces. The Wilhelm Tell Lodge chose to present the personification of its heroic namesake, Tell, shown with his son in the scene of the sharp shooter's contest.</p>
   <p>The "Future of the Harugari" was shown on another float, on which children, dressed in the regalia of the order, enacted the ceremonials of a man's and woman's lodge. It was the contribution of the Northwestern Lodge. The Harugari Singers converted their wagon into a sylvan landscape. There were many other picturesque creations.... It was the largest festival held at the Grove this summer and one of the most frolicsome.</p>

   <p>The various song divisions did their bit for the enjoyment of all. There was a highly diversified program featuring the speech by Ex-O. G. B., Philip Koehler, and an address by Mayor Harrison.</p>
   <p>The young people enjoyed themselves and the dance floor was overcrowded. The refreshment stands, wheels of fortune, targets, merry-go-rounds, strength-testers and other divertisements were popular. The favorable cool weather brought increased patronage in the evening. Fireworks closed the glorious festival, which was a great credit to the committee members....</p>
