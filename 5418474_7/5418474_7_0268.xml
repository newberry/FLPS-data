   <p>Last night's performance at Mc Vickers', "Nervus Verum" was not as well attended as this comedy deserved. The performers were at their best, which added to the success of the evening. "Nervus Verum" is an entertaining comedy, a mirror of modern society, intermingles with serious thoughts.</p>
   <p>A young and rich lawyer, Dr. Schwarzan, whose client, the widow Goldbeck, is money mad, is also the friend of banker Ehrenthal, of Jewish ancestry. As the lawyer of Mrs. Goldbeck,(who is a worshipper not of her money only, but also of a poodle) Mr. Schwarzan, in behalf of his client, has a case against Colonel Lindenheim, whose only thought is his bull-dog, Sulta, and his daughter, Regina. The lawyer won the case against the Colonel, thereby incurring the hatred of both, father and daughter, and in spite of such adverse conditions, he fell deeply in love with the young lady. To him came Assessor Kruger, who has fallen in love with a niece of Mrs. Goldbeck, but being poor, had no chance at all, for the aunt would not consent to such a marriage. At the same time banker Ehrenthal's son-inlaw, calls on him, to confide to him, that his beloved wife, bothers him with the suspicion he has married her only for her money.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0269.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There also appears a Dr. Mann and his wife, as contrasting characters to the others, and partly, to entangle the plot still further. The author attempts next to bring Schwarzan and Regina together and to reconcile Kuno von Burger, the son-inlaw of Ehrenthal, with his wife. During all of this, the most piquant entanglements are encountered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ravene, who played the part of Dr. Schwarzan, was at his best; the same can be said of Mr. Meyer, who took the part of the Jewish banker. Miss Kuhn was very pleasing as the loving wife, and just as much can be said for Miss Wassermann as Regina, who was simply charming.</p>
   <p>The rest of the case was good, except for Miss Rheinhardt and Mr. Luhr, who could not get into the spirit of their parts.</p>
