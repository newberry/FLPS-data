<title level="a">GERMAN FESTIVAL CELEBRATED IN NORTHERN INDIANA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The German Day celebration was held yesterday at the Lake County fairgrounds in the northern part of Indiana. Of course it is difficult to judge the effect of this national celebration upon the political unification of the German-Americans; but one thing is certain: the inspiring influence of the festival program fell upon fertile soil. It is not loud applause, which follows the strong points of a speech on a special presentation, but calm contemplation and deep insight that provides the roots for the growth of a movement. Whereas on other festive occasions speeches are not always received enthusiastically, but are accepted by many as a necessary evil, the speech delivered on German Day in Crown Point will remain in our memory for a long time.</p>
   <p>The program committee was careful to eliminate politics from the day's celebration. This does not mean that no mention was made of politics; for the program contained a number of pictures of candidates for the coming elections. However, although a large number of these gentlemen appeared at the festival, no one was <pb facs="5418474_7_1161.jpg" n="2"/>presented, and no one made a speech. The program, with some few exceptions, was followed throughout. Only the veteran of the Indiana German-American movement, Herr F. C. Miller, and the president of the German Day of Chicago were given an opportunity to say a few words to the gathering.</p>
   <p>The fairgrounds are quite suitable for such affairs. The weather was beautiful, although slightly windy and unpleasantly dusty. The crowd was elated, and with-in two hours after the business of the celebration had been transacted the place was alive with a hustle and buzzing as though an enormously large family had made this its meeting place.</p>
   <p>The crowds scrambled to the many booths. In spite of great supplies, the ice cream was sold out before 5 o'clock in the afternoon. A small army was busy dispensing beer and satisfying all who were thirsty. The club women who were busy in their booth selling foodstuffs did their best to satisfy the wishes of the participants. In this tent were the busiest workers of the day.</p>
   <p>Business was also good for the ladies who sold corn flower badges for the German <pb facs="5418474_7_1162.jpg" n="3"/>Day celebration which is to be held in Chicago. No less successful were members of the American Legion, with the sale of their red, white, and blue cocards (ribbons), and the young girls who sold these decorations to men, women, and children. In short, the celebration was successful and the day was spent in complete harmony, and those responsible for it may be proud of their accomplishment.</p>
   <p>Preceding the festivities was a parade of automobiles which presented a beautiful sight. About one hundred and fifty Lake County cars participated. The participants from Hammond gathered at the Hammond Club House. This group then rode to Gary and there they met the Gary group at the Transylvanian Sachsenhalle (Hall of Saxons). They then continued their ride to the fairgrounds, and the procession became larger as cars from other places joined it. After going once around the fairgrounds the cars dispersed again.</p>
   <p>According to the program the festival was to start at exactly 2 P.M. Everything was ready, but the vast fairgrounds made it necessary for the orchestra to <pb facs="5418474_7_1163.jpg" n="4"/>play louder than they ordinarily would have. At approximately 3 P.M. , when about four thousand people had gathered, the celebration was officially begun with the raising of the American and German flags.</p>
   <p>In his short address, the president of the fest, Walter Landien, referred to the motto printed on the program: "Proud of the deeds of our forefathers, we neither ascribe to self-aggrandizement nor to being pushed aside; our purpose is co-operation with the aims of this country and allegiance to it; but we also hold fast to the old cultural treasures, the German language and the German customs."</p>
   <p>Then followed the numbers of the program. True enough, Director Reinhold Walter had no mass choir at his disposal, but the songs of the United Singers from Calumet City, Gary, Hammond, and Blue Island were very inspiring, and this is also true of the songs of the Hammond Ladies' Choir. The men's choir sang the songs "Das ist der Tag des Herrn," "Horch, die alten Eichen rauschen," and "Wie's daheim war"; the ladies' choir sang "Heideroeslein" and "Fruehlingsgruss" by <pb facs="5418474_7_1164.jpg" n="5"/>Schumann.</p>
   <p>The orchestra, under the direction of Henry Roediger, played in addition to the national hymns, the march from Tannhauser; the overture to the operetta, "Poet and Peasant"; the march, "Alte Kameraden"; and finally, "My Country 'Tis of Thee".</p>
   <p>To relate a small episode: The musician who was to summon the singers with his bugle chose as his signal the introduction to the wonderful song "How Dry I Am," which caused a ripple of merriment throughout the fairgrounds. However, the singers gave no evidence of dry tendencies in their songs, nor did they maintain a dry attitude toward their flag.</p>
   <p>Storms of applause were accorded the Schuhplattler Verein organization Gamsgebirg, which demonstrated that the German folk dances are more pleasing to the eye than the more uniform dances of other countries. Toward the end two Buam (lads) performed a Hakeln (contortion dance). The Swiss Hans Steck, whose <pb facs="5418474_7_1165.jpg" n="6"/>yodeling met with general applause, presented the last number on the musical program.</p>
   <p>Fred Robenhorst, chairman of the German-American Republican Club of Hammond, then stepped over to the microphong and read the day's resolution which included the request for stronger union among the Germans and for their co-operation to meet forcefully the renewed propaganda of hatred. The assembly pledged allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the support of American ideals. With this the official part of the fest came to a close.</p>
   <p>Professor Dr. George L. Scherger, pastor of the St. Paul Church of Chicago, gave the invocation.</p>
   <p>He spoke to his closer countrymen as a native of Indiana; he spoke of great things of the past which he had experienced personally. Then he proceeded with his speech, the like of which, in the power of its effect, has seldom been made on similar occasions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1166.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>He went back a great distance in the history of the world to show that the German race had been an instrument of power at a time when absolutely nothing was known of many countries and peoples who are gloating because of their power today. He went so far as to assert that many of these peoples would not even exist today if the had not been made into nations by the Germanic race which at that time stood at the pinnacle of culture.</p>
   <p>By the use of many examples to illustrate his points, he proved his ability to defend his assertions, especially against the attitudes of those Americans who seem to believe that the German is only (a product) of yesterday, thereby consciously or unconsciously overlooking the fact that a fifth of this country's inhabitants are of German descent and that, in the so-called original history of this land, the German tribes played an imposing part, not to mention General von Steuben, Carl Schurz, and the many others who achieved great success in all fields of commerce, industry, science, music, arts, religion and education.</p>
   <p>Through the German turners, gymnastic exercises were introduced into the schools; <pb facs="5418474_7_1167.jpg" n="8"/>German singers are alleged to have given incentives to many English singing societies; a German musician, Theodore Thomas, taught the Chicagoans to appreciate heroes like Beethoven, Bach, and Schubert. This list could be continued indefinitely. If you look beyond the surface you will encounter Germans everywhere. It is an historical fact that the Revolutionary War would hardly have been won without a von Steuben, try as one might to cover up that fact. What is more, the Northern States would scarcely have been victorious in the Civil War had it not been for the German-American regiments mainly composed of turners.</p>
   <p>It was the German race which prevented the world from becoming latinized, once through Herrmann of the Cherusci, a second time through Luther. It (the German race) often went its own way, and this certainly did not please the others. For that matter no one should accept erroneous ideas about his homeland.</p>
   <p>More than any other group in this country the Germans strive for personal freedom and individuality. However, no one is so unfortunate as to forget his native <pb facs="5418474_7_1168.jpg" n="9"/>land, his origin, or his ancestors' contributions to his adopted country. Still, many have even gone so far as to be actually ashamed of their origin, whenever displeasure has been expressed toward Germans by some racial group or grouplet.</p>
   <p>This must be different! Attitudes must change, and then the Germanic peoples will realize how soon they will rise to the importance of a power. One may bear in mind that only that person attains success in all fields who remains faithful to himself.</p>
   <p>Not until the curfew, if one may say so, did the beautiful park begin to empty itself. In a beautiful, cool, room within an exhibition hall, the dancers enjoyed themselves. The festival grounds were teeming with people who sought their own particular form of the entertainments offered by the festival. When they departed they expressed the wish that they would enjoy as successful a festival next year. The children, who received many gifts, repeatedly expressed this wish.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1169.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>The following organizations from Hammond participated in the preparations for the German Day: the Hammond Ladies' Choir; the German Aid Society, District 529; the German Frauenverein; the Mutual Aid Society, Section 30; the German-American Republican Club; the Hammond Singing Bund, "Fidelia"; and the Steuben Society of Indiana; from Gary, the German Lutheran Huterns Parish; the German Aid Society, District 421; the first Transylvanian Saxon, K.U.V 26 (Royal-Hungarian Club No. 26); the Gary Liederkranz; the German Sport Club; the Literary Dramatic Club; and the Transylvanian Saxon Sport Club.</p>
   <p>From among the members of all these organizations the numerous committees were chosen, and the success of the German Day festival is the result of their labor.</p>
   <p>The festive committee was composed of the following gentlemen: Walter Landien, president; Lewis Wieser, first vice-president; Hans Friedrich, second vice-president; Richard Nacke, secretary; Karl Isenbarth, assistant secretary; Karl Grieseler, treasurer; and Hans Hugel, assistant treasurer. The trustees were: Andy Markel, M. Henning, Ernest Fischer, and George Gumbel.</p>
