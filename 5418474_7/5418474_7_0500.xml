   <p>No one can doubt that the German singing societies have been given a death blow, especially when he makes the observation that in quite a large number of concerts given by a singing society a real public usually shines by its absence, that the audience consists almost exclusively of other invited societies, which of course constitutes no permanent financial gain for the promoting society, and that even this "public" would not come if all these other societies were not permitted to render some of their own songs. This is the reason why, for some time now, even if a singing festival has been most magnificently arranged, the hall remains empty when all the singers are on the stage.</p>
   <p>This yawning void is the jaw which is going to swallow the quaking German-American singing societies if our concerts are not made much more interesting, <pb facs="5418474_7_0501.jpg" n="2"/>if beer and dancing do not cease to be the chief attraction. In former days it used to be quite sufficient if a director did his best to select a good song and rehearse it well, but our times demand much more than that.</p>
   <p>My friend Giegold and I have often discussed this point, and we arrived at the conclusion that most songs are in need of dramatic, pictorial, or rhetorical illustration to make the impression which they deserve in our concerts. Naturally, in some of our concerts we brought this idea into action and each time so successfully that we believe that we have caused the immortal German song to rise like Phoenix from its own ashes and to be initiated into a new and glorious life.</p>
   <p>To help it in its efforts, the director has but to use his imagination. Then, out of an unassuming little folk song he can produce a performance, a tableau, or a recitation which may often put into the shade many a costly opera. Only in this fashion can Chicago's German singing organizations be saved and elevated to new and more beautiful flowering and fruition.</p>
