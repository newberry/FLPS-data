   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Philharmonic Orchestra in the North Side Turner Hall was worthy of previous offering. The orchestra under the leadership of Mr. Richard Czerwonky, and the soloist, Miss Helen Engelke, showed their perfect skill, which was enthusiastically acknowledged by the large audience.</p>
   <p>Schubert's spirited "Military March" opened the musical performance. The overture from the opera "Ruy Blas" by Mendelssohn, and the great phantasia of Leoncavallos' "Pagliacci" were reproduced in a brilliant manner. Miss Engelke, the young soprano, delighted the audience with the "Flower Song" from "Faust." The young artist possesses an excellently trained voice and conquered the hearts of her listeners at her first appearance.</p>
   <p>In the second part of the program she presented several songs, including the "Last Hour" by Kramer, sung with orchestral accompaniment. Applause and gifts of flowers induced Miss Engelke to give as encores, the old folk song "Oh! How Is It Possible?", which had a great effect upon the audience. After this song, the young artist was rewarded with overwhelming applause. She certainly can be satisfied with her success.</p>

   <p>The "Menuett Celebre" by Bocherini, the "Malaguina" by Moszkowski, and the "Festival Dance" and "Valse" from the Ballet "Coppelia" by Delibes, were masterfully performed in the second part of the program by the orchestra, which proved their artistic knowledge. The light tunes of the "Merry Widow" waltzes by Lehar, and spirited marches, formed the finale of a concert which offered real artistic enjoyment to the audience for several hours.</p>
