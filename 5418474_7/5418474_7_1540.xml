<title level="a">GOLDEN JUBILEE CHICAGO TURNGEMEINDE HONORED IN SPEECH AND SONG</title></bibl>

   <p>Black, white, red, also black, red, gold the color of the revolutionists of 1848, in harmony with the Stars and Stripes of the new homeland, the whole standing out against the dark green oak leaf garlands- this was the decoration of the grand Ballroom of the Northside Turner Hall at which last night the first part of the golden jubilee celebration of the Chicago Turngemeinde took place....In these becoming surroundings one of the most beautiful Turner and Singer fraternization festivities that Chicago ever has seen was celebrated. The next speaker was the old Turner and fighter of 1848, Heinrich Huhn from Milwaukee who is the editor of the "Nordamerikanische Turnerzeitung" and he was followed by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, who said in his address:</p>
   <p>"The Turners fought and bled for liberty and right on German battle fields <pb facs="5418474_7_1541.jpg" n="2"/>and then came to America to march anew under the flag of their new homeland into the battle for the freedom of mankind. They knew that only on the grave of slavery could the desired freedom flourish. Before the first cannon shot was fired by the enemy at Fort Sumter, they prepared for the defense of the Stars and stripes. German Turners were the first ones who followed the call of Lincoln. Many of the Chicago Turngemeinde marched into the Civil War, not a small number spilled their blood at the battlefields of Perryville and Gettysburg for the maintenance of the rights of the Black race and died a heroic death. The silent but so eloquent language that speaks from the list of the fallen comrades at the glory-plate of the Turngemeinde, reminds us, to strive after the ideals of the liberty and the love for liberal institutions whose maintenance drew in 1861 also the Turners into the battle. Very well, the slavery of the Black race was abolished at that time, but this country is in danger of a new slavery, the slavery brought on by the money-bag. When the German now wants to prove his love for his adopted fatherland, he must step in for human rights and the dignity of man without considering the size of bank accounts. In Europe there is an aristocracy of birth. The majority <pb facs="5418474_7_1542.jpg" n="3"/>of its members are drones, who suckle the marrow out of the bones of the people. We have an aristocracy not by the grace of God but the Almighty Dollar. Its members-the coal barons and trust magnates- trample upon the rights of the people and oppress and enslave the inhabitants without mercy, as if all are not entitled to breathe the fresh air.</p>
