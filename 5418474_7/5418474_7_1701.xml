   <p>The annual festival of the "National-Gymnastic Club" took place yesterday. With utmost care and consideration all preparations had been completed and the whole program went off with clock work precision. The active members of the club demonstrated their gymnastic skill with grace, elegance, and exactitude. Most deeply amused were the on lookers when the little ones played their games so charmingly. The real festival spirit, however, made itself fully known, when it was getting cooler. Singing, dancing, and all kinds of amusements and entertainments were in order and all partook of the same to the full extent. When the happy crowd was reminded of the departure of the last train, everyone regretted to leave.</p>
