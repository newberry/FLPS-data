Alderman Herr, Chairman of the World's Exposition Committee on city matters gave a short resume of the approaching festivities and remarked that a few allegorical displays or floats illustrating some historical event would be needed. The treasurer, Mr. Hahne therefore appointed a Finance Committee of nine members to raise the required funds. To all the members who were not at the session yesterday, Mr. Hahne mailed a request, asking them to appear at to-day's meeting. It was decided that the three floats which the German population will supply, shall not exceed 1500 and the execution of the plans was entrusted to yesterday's newly formed organization.</p>
