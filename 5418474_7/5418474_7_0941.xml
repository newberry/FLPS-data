   <p>The public is always expecting something new which should not cost much; therefore the manager of the German Theatre welcomed the voluntary offer of Hans Balatka, director of the "Lieder Kranz Singing Society" to bring to the stage a musical performance. "Die Regiment stochter" (The Daughter of the Regiment) was the play on this occasion. The result was, that the house was almost sold out, and the audience was pleased with the production as well as to listen to Donizetti's beautiful melodies. The story is simple. A small child has been found among the corpses on a battlefield and adopted as "Marie, the daughter of the Regiment." The "old Sergant Fulprice" was especially interested in her whom he rears in a military manner and later installed as a camp-worker at the moment when the young tenant-farmer Antione Vallee attracted to her, and in love with her, gave his allegiance to the flag, thereby hoping to win her hand. The news spreads that Marie is the niece of the Marchesa Helene Maggiovoglio. She is obliged to go to her aunt's castle, while the 2nd regiment with the disconsolate Antione left for the battlefield.</p>
   <p>Marie, is just about to marry an uninteresting count( for she has been told <pb facs="5418474_7_0942.jpg" n="2"/>that Antione has lost his life on the battle field) when the 2nd regiment with Antione (promoted for his courage to the rank of an officer) appeared, and into whose arms the child of the regiment" flew.</p>
   <p>Touchingly, the Marchesa Maggiovoglio gave her consent and blessings. The heroes of the evening were Miss Wassermann and Mr. Heinemann. Mr. Rodenberg did rather well, as the peasant lover, Antione Vallee, but in contract to that, we have to mention Mr. Scherer's exquisite acting, as Fulprice. Mrs. Scholz-Rademacher acted the part of the Marchesa.</p>
