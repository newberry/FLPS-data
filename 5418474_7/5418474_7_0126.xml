   <p>Last night's farewell performance of those two beloved artists, Mr. and Mrs. Ferdinand Welb, was attended by an audience, which valued the high art of Mr. and Mrs. Welb's interpretation of comic characters. The title role of "Doctor Klaus" was represented by Mr. Welb and the "Housekeeper Marianne" by Mrs. Welb. The ovation which greeted the artists at their first appearance on the stage, continued throughout the evening. Only with much regret, do our audiences part with Mr. and Mrs. Welb, and it was evident that it was the secret wish of every one, not to bid these artists adieu, but to say, "Auf Wiedersehen!"</p>
   <p>The characters of "Doctor Klaus" and the "Housekeeper Marianne" as interpreted by Mr. and Mrs. Welb, will not soon be forgotten. They were honored with many beautiful gifts, among which were two laurel wreaths for Mr. Welb.</p>
   <p>The ovation at the end of the performance was so overwhelming, that at the final curtain call, Mrs. Welb, deeply touched at this exhibition of loyalty, embraced her husband, which caused the already sentimental audience to produce handkerchiefs, and wipe away the tears.</p>
