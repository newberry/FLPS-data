   <p>The different Hessian clubs of Chicago held their annual national festival yesterday at the Excelsior Park. Not only was there bowling for prizes, dancing, games for children, and other general entertainments, but there was also a Hessian sausage-kitchen in operation, and Hessian wine from vines grown on the hills of Hessia, could be obtained.</p>
   <p>Toward evening an address was given by the president of the committee. Mr. M.Kehl. His speech was well received. He praised the unity of the Hessians, implored mother to cultivate in the children the love for the German language and customs. He stated that the Hessian clubs are endeavoring to assist their members in sickness and need, and to take care of widows and orphans.</p>
   <p>Several men's choirs were present to contribute to the enjoyment of the day by their beautiful songs. It was a festival to everybody's liking.</p>
