<title level="a">DEDICATION OF THE NEW HALL OF THE SENEFELDER LIEDERKRANZ</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The dedicatory ceremonies incident to the opening of the Senefelder Liederkranz's new hall were held yesterday evening. The former quarters were destroyed by the Chicago fire. The club secured the two upper floors of Wm. Christ's brick building, 565 North Wells Street.....The singers met at this same location before the great fire.</p>
   <p>A select number of ladies and gentlemen appeared at yesterday's festivities. The hall was gayly bedecked with garlands, mottoes decorated the white walls and a large picture of the members was mounted opposite the picture of Sennefeld (sic) [Translator's note: The subsequent text leads one to believe that Aloys Senefelder is meant, inventor of the lithographic printing process, since the article says that the club was founded by lithographers. In that case the spelling would not be correct]. A small stage with an artistically designed curtain forms the background of the hall.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0968.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For the dedicatory part the "Weihelied" by Schneider was chosen, and it was sung in an imposing manner by the club under the leadership of Emil Rein.</p>
   <p>Then followed a concert selection, played by Messrs. Obermann and DeClerque. Then Jacob Becker, president of the club, appeared on the stage and addressed the assembly as follows:</p>
   <p>"Members of the Senefelder Liederkranz; My Friends: I cannot refrain, on this evening, from expressing my good wishes for this occasion--the dedication of our new hall. This very place, gentlemen, is associated with dear memories. Here our club was founded by a few lithographers and lithographic printers, seven years ago, (today only two of the members of that period are still with us), and our association expanded rapidly. Here also the club lost its possessions in the all-consuming fire of 1871. The members dispersed to all parts of the city--but that did not discourage us--we worked with renewed vigor; our musical performances proved highly successful, and today, gentlemen, our club meets again....greater than ever.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0969.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have forty active, and an equal number of nonactive members. Unity and love for the cause let us reach the goal and, by practicing economy, we were able to furnish this hall in an appropriate manner. Although all have done their share, we are particularly indebted to our director, Emil Rein, whose ceaseless efforts have been devoted to the club for the last six years. And though we have achieved much, we cannot remain inactive now. Let us, therefore, resolve on this evening to work with renewed energy in the interests of music and strive toward perfection. Let us all be staunch; let this new singers' hall, also, be a focal point for our families where the bond of brotherhood will be strengthened....so that German concord and affection....may develop into a fitting memorial in the future!"</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the speech, Director Rein called for three cheers for Mr. Becker, which the members of the audience were unanimous in giving.</p>
   <p>Thereupon a double chorus sang "Trinksprueche" by Rochlitz; a solo quartet from the "Nibelungen" by Dorn followed, and the entire club sang "Wacht Auf, Ihr Lieder" by Zwingli and others.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0970.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Dancing started at ten o'clock and lasted until midnight. It was a very pleasant affair....in every respect.....</p>
