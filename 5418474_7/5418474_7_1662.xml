   <p>Since all the German Men's Choirs of Chicago will participate in the celebration of German Day on June 15th, the committee in charge of choirs which are going to sing on July 17th and 18th, is already very active. It is expected that the total number of trained voices singing at this mass-concert will be from 1500 to 2000.</p>
   <p>The committee is well aware of the fact that many splendid singers do not belong to any choir at the present, therefore, it is important that all talented singers join any one of the choirs, which have promised their co-operation. A list of these choirs and the place where they practise follows:</p>
