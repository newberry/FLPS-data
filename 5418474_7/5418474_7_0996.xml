   <p>The editor of the Sonntagpost received the following announcement from Mr. R. G. Scheunemann:</p>
   <p>The German Artists Theatre Corporation of America will erect theaters in all cities with a large German colony. The first of these theatres will be opened September, 1930 in Chicago. At this theatre daily performances of German operettas, dramas, comedies, and imported German talkies will be shown. Prominent German actors will be engaged and there will be given also guest performances of celebrities such as Alexander Moissi.</p>
   <p>The latest talkie of the well known U F A German Film-Corporation, and Tobiss and Klang films will be shown at the premiere of this theatre. The public will be informed of the different performances by means of modern theatrical advertisements.</p>
   <p>The German Artists Theatre Corporation of America will be incorporated to <pb facs="5418474_7_0997.jpg" n="2"/>place German theatres upon an American business basis, which has been tried and found successful everywhere. The capital will be $100,000, divided in 10,000 original shares of $10 each. These shares are offered at present to the German-Americans in Chicago. After $50,000 of the shares are signed, a petition to form a corporation will be submitted, and when the corporation is in force under the laws of the State of Illinois, the subscribers will be notified by mail so that they may take over their number of shares and deposit the amount due for them. After the deposits are received a general meeting will be called at which the shareholders will elect the board of directors of the corporation. The legal matters of the corporation will be taken care of by the well known attorneys Walter W. L. Meyer and Otto C. Reutner.</p>
   <p>To prevent mistakes it is herewith specially emphasized that the German Artists Theatre Corporation of America does not intend to create a competing enterprise against the present German theatre of Chicago; on the contrary, <pb facs="5418474_7_0998.jpg" n="3"/>the successful artist and director of this theatre, Mr. Angelo Lippich, is considered for the position of director of the German Artists Theatre Corporation of America.</p>
