   <p>The premiere of "The Liebertine," a comedy in four acts, by G. von Moser was presented. This play shows that the author has aged considerably. As much as Moser has written in the theatrical field, he has not yet exhausted himself entirely, but it appears that he labors with difficulty when he tries to be humorous and also original. Nevertheless, the public was pleased. There was much laughter and applause. Thereby the critic should be disarmed. One should not belittle the public's enjoyment, but I will do so anyway. He works in the same fashion as of yore and vainly strives for new forms, different characters.....The patterns, the situations, are all cast in the old, standard mold..... The attempts to simulate the piquant <pb facs="5418474_7_0138.jpg" n="2"/>French predicaments, produce only German gruffness.....But there was efficient, spontaneous acting, the public could not think nor analyze, and therefore did not notice the short comings. The play became a huge success through the performance of the actors......The house was sold out.....</p>
