   <p>The committees of the song festival have come somewhat nearer to winding up their still unfinished business. It was to be expected. The press committee has held its last session. Since there was a discrepancy between the figures of the committee and the books of the financial secretary, amounting to $10.73, the chairman was requested to compare the items. Max Stern, treasurer of the committee, submitted his final report, according to which he still had $18.45. He was advised to give this sum to the treasurer. In regard to the sale of programs, 7,994 books were sold, amounting to $1,598.24. The chairman thanked the members of the committee for their activities and support and at the suggestion of Messrs. H. H. Lieb and Max Stern the committee gave a rising vote of thanks to Mr. Mannhart, the chairman, for his impartiality and his fulfillment of his obligations, and to William L. Schmidt, the conscientious secretary. The committee was then dissolved.</p>

   <p>The finance committee held a long session. It settled the bills of the lunch-counter owners at the picnic by allowing them a ten-per-cent rebate of the rental which they had paid and increased by $1,300 the fund allocated to the music committee. The latter was done to increase Mr. Balatka's share, who had asked only $2,000 to conduct the orchestra at a time when no one knew what dimensions the festival would assume. Through this action he will receive $4,000 instead, little enough when one considers that orchestra leaders for similar services have received $7,000 and even $10,000.</p>
   <p>Various bills were ordered paid, and a committee was appointed, consisting of Messrs. H. H. Buehler, Heinemann, and Vocke, to collaborate with a similar committee of the board of control, of which Mr. Amberg was the chairman, for the purpose of settling bills still outstanding and making the final report.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schneider thanked the committee for the support given to him and <pb facs="5418474_7_1759.jpg" n="3"/>expressed the opinion that if Chicago's Germans were confronted in the future with a similar problem of equal magnitude, then the same financial plan should undoubtedly be adopted, since it had proved very efficacious.</p>
   <p>Upon Mr. Vocke's motion (supported by a lengthy speech by Mr. Amberg, in which he remarked that he felt proud of having been so fortunate in the choice of his committee members), thanks were expressed to Chairman Schneider, Adolph Schoeninger, vice-president; and the two secretaries, Messrs. H. H. Fuerstenberg and Heinemann, whereupon the chairman asked for an adjournment.</p>
