   <p>The postponement of this celebration, which has been scheduled for last Saturday evening, and the departure of the German delegates Fritzsche and Viereck, gave vise to doubt, as to the success of the celebration; but we can state with great satisfaction, that our fears were groundless. Endless groups of people, filled the North side Turnhalle, partly to celebrate the memory of the fallen fighters for freedom, and partly to show their determination to continue this fight, for the human race. The entertainment commenced, with the playing of the festive march"La Commune," by the Germania Orchestra, under the leadership of the excellent musician Mr. Meinken. The next number on the program was a play liked by everybody: "Ins Vorzimmer Seiner Excellenz"(In The Ante-room of his Excellency). Next was the song number, "Wacht auf, ihr volker all" ( Awake, you nations) by the Liederfafel Vorwarts. Great enthusiasm took place in the audience, at the showing of a shadow picture, entitled: "An election battle" or, the election cheating of the 14th ward.</p>

   <p>An exquisite painting, fifteen feet high, by the well known artist Joseph Gabler, was presented by him, to the Society, during the commune celebration, representing the "Goddess of Freedom, who conquered monopoly( the dragon in the painting) with her foot on his neck, unfolding the flag of humanity</p>
   <p>The festive address was delivered by Mr. Vater; Mr. Grottkau said also a few words.</p>
