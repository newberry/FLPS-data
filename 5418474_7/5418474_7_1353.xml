   <p>The Chicago World's exposition in 1933, will be an event which has already aroused the interest of business people of Chicago, especially since the necessary preparations and arrangements are already under way to make the exposition, with all the details, the success it is expected to be.</p>
   <p>The new manager of Brentano's Inc., Mr. Hartog, looks upon the coming World's Fair from the point of view of a book seller. Mr. Hartog expresses the conviction, that the exposition offers to the German book trade and publishers tremendous opportunity for world propaganda, which should under all circumstances be utilized on a grand scale.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_1354.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Before everything else, an extensive book show should be held in connection with the world's fair, which would give an account, in a commanding way, of the science and art books of German origin; because on this terrain expecially Germany is regarded as unsurpassed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hartog, who was transferred from Brentano's New York branch, to become manager of the Chicago branch, looks back upon many years experience in publishing. He received his education in Germany, and in New York was the director of the Columbia University book store, and the Columbia University press.</p>
   <p>The German Club of the Columbia University accepted him first as an "outsider" - Mr. Hartog did not study at Columbia, but later he was appointed as an honorary member, for his outstanding achievements as director of the University press.</p>
