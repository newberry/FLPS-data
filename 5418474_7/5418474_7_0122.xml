   <p>p. 2 - Last night's play, "Three Pairs of Shoes," a musical play by Goerlitz, was written many years ago. Nevertheless, it still electrifies the audiences.... Many of us surely remember those two great soubrettes, Marie Geistinger and Alvine Heynold. The last mentioned was veritable devil. She was celebrated and of course spoiled by her public. She was one of the brightest stars on the theatrical firmament. One day she vanished and was never heard of again. Then in tribute to her the world said: "Regardless of everything, Albina was loved by everybody. In her portrayal of 'Leni' in 'Three Pairs of Shoes,' she was simply incomparable."... What a different person was "Leni," characterized by Marie Geistinger. Both were great artists, and yet so different.... la</p>
   <p>Last night's performance of "Three Pairs of Shoes" was given before a sold out house. Many persons had to stand. Thus the play composed by Goerlitz, almost a generation ago, still has drawing power in the early days of the 20th century.</p>
   <p>And now a word about our new soubrette, Elise Kramm. She came, sang and conquered, not instantly, but step by step. As a matter of fact Miss Kramm's interpretation of her part deserves high praise. She has courage and self confidence. Her voice is not voluminous, but it is supple, well controlled.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0123.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Her lively acting is refreshing. The appreciative audience applauded her heartily. She had an excellent partner in Gustav Hartzhelm, who with his lovely music-hall songs aided in the modernization of the play.</p>
