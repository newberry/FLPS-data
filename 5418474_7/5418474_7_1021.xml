   <p>Last night's brilliant performance brought the present theatre season to a close. "Boss in his Home",comes from the pen of that brilliant writer Paul Lindau to whom we are indebted for a most pleasant evening. It was also a benefit performance, honoring Mr. Julius Donat stage director of the company. In that capacity no special distinction was bestowed upon him, although he has repeatedly demonstrated his great skill, but, Donat the artist, was tendered a well-deserved reception.</p>
   <p>It was a very pleasant evening. In contrast to the atmospheric conditions of a November evening outdoors, one was carried away by the spring-like freshness of thought and action in this sacred hall of art. Lindau has still a great drawing power, here as well as in Europe. In Germany, Lindau has won for himself a place in the heart of the public second to none among dramatists of the present day. Any work coming from the pen of this beloved writer is enthusiastically received by that class of the public whose literary preferences are of <pb facs="5418474_7_1022.jpg" n="2"/>a higher type. Last night's performance of the comedy "Boss in his Home", was very well received by our audience. And justly so! The dialogue sparkled with brilliancy, was full of unmatched piquantcies, and many other clever points of interest for which Lindau could hardly be rivaled.</p>
   <p>The artists who participated in last night's presentation of this enchanting comedy, are indeed actors of high caliber. It appeared, as if they were engaged in a race to outdo each other.</p>
   <p>Mr. Donat, for whom the benefit this evening was given, chose the demure role of "Hettstaedt," who as "Juliana's" husband exhibits real friendship for the friend of the family. The role of this character does not give the actor a chance to develop into a prominent figure during the first three acts, but in act four, "Hettstaedt" brings forth such quality and quantity of tender feelings as to win for him the sympathy and the hearts of the audience. Mr. Donat, demonstrated in the part of "Ernst" again, that the reputation he enjoys as an actor is more than <pb facs="5418474_7_1023.jpg" n="3"/>justified. Miss Wirth was adorable as "Juliana". Portraying this part she gave again an exhibition of her great talent. Other actresses playing this particular role would do well to pattern after Miss Wirth. She was at her best last night. Miss Trude Lobe, who is invaluable in the creation of certain characters, was miscast in the part of "Sophie," in last night's presentation. Anna Gerlach's "Claudia" was highly commendable. Mr. Ludwig Lindikoff's impersonation of "Ernst", was an accomplishment which calls for plaudits. This exceedingly difficult part exacts extraordinary requirements even of a seasoned actor. Heinz Gordon's portrayal of the character of "Riesel" was exact in every phase.</p>
   <p>The applause was generous and the curtain calls numerous.</p>
