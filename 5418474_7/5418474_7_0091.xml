   <p>Mrs. Emilie Schoenfeld's benefit performance was dominated by hilarity and the more frivolous moods. Delightful Greek maids in flowing classical gowns, gamboled under an imaginary bright sky; after all it was Offenbach's beautiful Helen, fulminating sparkling with humor, vitality and impishness in text and music. One jovial scene was superceded by another and the sense of risibility never was satiated, if the behavior of the audience is any criterion. The parodistic events which so aptly and ludicrously portrayed the saga of Helen's abduction, prolonged laughter to the lachrymal point. Particularly comical was the convocation of the Greek aristocracy. Ajax rides on a hobby horse, followed by the irascible Achilles and the old, doddering Menelaus, who introduces himself as the good "Louse" and husband of Helena. The repartee of the leaders, enhanced by a few highly opportune <pb facs="5418474_7_0092.jpg" n="2"/>jokes on local conditions, evoked renewed outbursts of enthusiasm, real rib-splitting convulsions. The music written in the same vein, is quite well known, as "Beautiful Helen" was an epochal success years ago.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance, in the main, expressed the fluent humor which permeates the play in an adequate manner, although the ensemble effects were considerably curtailed, since several of the artists were not sufficiently versed in their parts, neither orally or vocally. A dove, goat, and lamb, which appeared on the stage, showed very good manners; evidently quite at home in their new world. The lamb, particularly, proved its undeniable predilection and appreciation for the actor's art by emitting a succession of constant, unperturbed bleats. The title role was played by the beneficiary, Mrs. Emilie Schoenfeld. Figure, acting and singing, all of it admirable and excellent. The highly popular artist also excelled in her song to Aphrodite and in the duets with Paris (Mr. Paul Nelva), where her declamation proved very ingratiating. At the end of the second act she was rewarded with <pb facs="5418474_7_0093.jpg" n="3"/>well-deserved acclaim, many bouquets and gifts; veritable indications that she maintained her popularity in the German niche, also in the present season.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nelva tried his best to master the difficult vocal part of Paris. Certain hesitations manifested themselves, but at the next performance they will be eliminated undoubtedly. The jokes of Mr. Loewenfeld, who characterized Menelaus in a saxonian dialect fell on fructiferous ground. Miss Frieda Stevens, as Orestes, sang temperamentally, and Miss Francis Wagner, attired in a bathing suit and straw hat, symbolizing Pylades, created justified astonishment. The other parts were well taken care of. Herr Hausen deserves special mention for his personification of the choleric Achilles; splendid, indeed.</p>
   <p>The chorus was somewhat weak, in several instances substituting a time of its own; greatly at variance with the orchestra. If Mrs. Schoenfeld, with her powerful voice, had not come to the rescue occasionally, it might have ceased altogether.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0094.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The effect of the play depends on a lively tempo and upon repetition of the operetta; it will surely be forthcoming but the indestructible humor of the work will not fail to serve as a magnet, in as far as our Chicago public is concerned.</p>
   <p>We must not fail to express proper commendation for the magnificent scenery in the first and last act, emblematical and easily recognizable as the result of Haupt's stage management.</p>
