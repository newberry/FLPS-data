  <body>
   <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Detmer, nee Mayer, well known in singing circles in Chicago, has passed away.</p>
   <p>The deceased is the daughter of parents who immigrated from Trier. Her whole heart was bound up in singing. She was a member of the Chicago Singverein (Singing Society) for many years, and wherever there was something that could be done for singers Mrs. Detmer was always right there. She took an active part in several large singing festivals. The widower is the piano manufacturer, Henry Detmer, also well known in German-American circles. In his younger years he was a conductor of several singing societies, and was a member of the Orpheus Maennerchor (Male Chorus) and the Liedertafel Vorwaerts (Forward Singing Society), and was later made an honorary member of several other societies. Detmer won the gold medal for his products at the World's Fair in St. Louis, and later operated a branch in St. Louis until he retired from business.</p>
