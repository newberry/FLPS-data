   <p>A concert in Orchestra Hall, with the participation of a part of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, always offers artistic enjoyment. This was proven anew by the concert which the Singer Association Freiheit, arranged last Sunday, under the leadership of Conductor Karl Reckzeh.</p>
   <p>That the Singer Association Freiheit cultivates German songs, having this in common with our many men's choruses, is beyond question; that at its last concert it was striving for higher aims, with great success, does credit to this association.</p>
   <p>What the chorus, in conjunction with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, offered in its program numbers, does credit to it and also to its conductor. The A Capella Ossian chorus made a brilliant impression; the careful rehearsal was easily discernible, and the audience expressed its admiration with loud applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0554.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Othegraven's "Knight advises his Shield Bearer" was the climax of the concert. This symphony, makes great claims upon the members of the chorus as well as the conductor, who acquitted themselves of this task in an excellent way. The three verses were beautifully performed.</p>
   <p>The soloist was in no way inferior to the chorus. Lucia Altoonjian possesses a harmonious voice; its beauty was enchanced by the orchestra accompaniment. Alfred Miltenberg proved himself a highly gifted piano virtuoso, who possesses a brilliant technique. In the evening a merry entertainment followed in Mozart Hall.</p>
