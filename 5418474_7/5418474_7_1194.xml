   <p>A masked ball arranged by the membership committee of the Plattdeutsche Grot-Gilde was given Saturday at the Swiss Club. The efforts of the arrangements committee to acquaint the public with the nature and aims of the organization were not in vain, although attendance by members could have been better.</p>
   <p>The Al Brenier Orchestra furnished the music for dancing in the large ballroom. In an adjoining room refreshing drinks were offered and a trio that also furnished music for dancing later, gave a concert in the small ballroom on the lower floor.</p>
   <p>Before the prizes for masks were awarded, Mr. Gustav Brand the chairman of the German Day Festival, made a brief address in which he asked all Germans and Americans of German descent to attend the German Day Festival. Then he, Fred Lindner, and Mr. H. Nordegg awarded the prizes, to the satisfaction of all guests. A confetti battle added much to the prevailing gaiety.....</p>

   <p>The Plattdeutsche Gilden make up a sick and death benefit association and one of the strongest organizations of its kind in the Middle West. Every young German or American of German descent should join. Many Germans have received sick or death benefits from the Gilden.</p>
