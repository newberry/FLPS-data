   <p>A number of well known personalities of the political and public spheres of Chicago, including A. J. Cermak, president of the County Commissioners, Judge John Lowery, County Treasurer, P. J. Carr, Mrs. C. E. Bemis, Democratic candidate for County Commissioner, John Trager, former County Sheriff, Judge Henry Horner, and Harry Kohl, Democratic candidate for Comptroller of Taxes, were among the guests. A great number of German societies participated at the folk festival. Among others, the Teutonic-Americans, distinguished by their black-white-and-red arm bands, were present in large numbers. Various choral societies were also present and under the leadership of conductor H. A. Rehberg sang several songs. The Turners were not missing on this occasion, and it was a pleasure to witness the dashing performances of the vigorous and well developed men.</p>

   <p>The model section of the Illinois Turner district was present under the leadership of the district superintendent of gymnastics exercises, E. Klaffs, and the fencing section under the fencing instructor, Henry Kraft.</p>
   <p>This great folk festival of the German-American Citizens Union proved its strength through the impressive parade in the forenoon, and it proved in the evening that in its ranks still blossoms the old German good fellowship, and that the German element of Chicago answers its call enthusiastically...</p>
