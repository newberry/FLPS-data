  <body>
   <p>As the Germans in Chicago have for many years looked forward to the time when they would have their own building in the center of the city to house the German Theater, and as there is an opportunity now, to purchase a piece of ground, which is most ideally located in every respect, namely on Randolph Street, between Clark and Dearborn Streets, therefore several German citizens have taken an option on this piece of property. Now it depends entirely upon the German population of Chicago, if their desire shall be realized or not, because all can contribute to the required amount according to their ability, but this must be done at once, because the option is good for a short time only.</p>
   <p>This particular property is 80' by 180'. According to agreements made it can be leased for 88 years for the sum of $17,500.00 annually. A 13 story modern office building is to be erected in front, and the theater will occupy the rear end with the required exits leading towards the alley.</p>
   <p>A sum of $500,000.00 must be raised to cover the cost of construction. At least one half of this sum must be signed, the other half can be obtained by issuing bonds. It will depend upon the amount signed during the next few days, whether this <pb facs="5418474_7_0195.jpg" n="2"/>property can be secured for the German theater definitely. The payments can be made as follows: one fourth of the amount signed, on May 1st, and the balance in 6, 18, and 24 months respectively. As soon as sufficient capital is signed the Board of Directors will be elected.</p>
