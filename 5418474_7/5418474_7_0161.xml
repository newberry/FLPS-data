   <p>The popular piece, "Hasemann's Daughters" by L' Aronges, was performed last night before a well-attended house in the Apollo Theatre, corner of Blue Island Avenue and 12th Street. The performance was played so well that the actors had an immense and well-deserved applause. Director Hepner represented the gardener Hasemann, who always is busy with travel plans but in domestic affairs is ruled by his wife. This play was excellent and he was well supported by Mrs. Lina Schmidt playing the role of Mrs. Hasemann. Miss Emma Mayer (Rosa) also played well but not quite naturally enough. All others did their very best and the general ensemble had the right effect.</p>
