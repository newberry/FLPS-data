   <p>Although many celebrities have appeared at Hooley's Theater [where plays in German are produced by Emil Hoechster], it is improbable that any performance has been attended by a more enthusiastic audience than the one present yesterday, and we declare unhesitatingly that in the field of comedies no more successful offering was ever given on this stage. The performance was an outstanding success, which is particularly gratifying since it represents progress in the company's achievements.</p>
   <p>The lion's share in this accomplishment undoubtedly belongs to Miss Lina Wassman. Although she had previously given us a sample of her abilities in the play "Quicksilver," her astounding versatility and admirable forcefulness were unexpected. Miss Wassmann is an artist of first rank, a highly gifted actress who, besides possessing great stage experience, is endowed with genuine talent, powers of interpretation, and an excellent voice.</p>
   <p>Her "Richelieu" was flawless. We give a resume of the plot to make the action understandable to those who missed the performance. [Outline of plot is <pb facs="5418474_7_0309.jpg" n="2"/>omitted in translation].</p>
   <p>Miss Wassmann played the part of....the young duke, darling of the ladies,....excellently. Every phase of youthful, variable emotion was splendidly portrayed. The actress was by turns saucy, boisterous, timid, bashful, indifferent, melancholy--in conformity with the rapidly changing emotions of a young man of seventeen years. Her rendition created the impression that the part was written for her particular personality. The applause accorded her at the end of each act was exceptionally cordial and could hardly be silenced.</p>
   <p>She was splendidly supported by the other members of the cast.....</p>
   <p>The stage management was perfect, and the costuming excellent, even if a few of the creations were based on imagination rather than historical accuracy, and thus proved unsuited to the period. The only thing which occasionally jarred one's sensibilities was the faulty pronunciation of French words by a few members of the cast; this was obviously due to lack of familiarity with that tongue.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_7_0310.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The consensus of the audience on yesterday's performance can best be expressed, by an exclamation our reporter overheard in leaving: "Thank the Lord, we have a German theater again!"</p>
