  <body>
   <p>A life devoted to music, with special emphasis on the cultivation of the German song, ended yesterday when Henry von Oppen, a highly esteemed citizen of Chicago and for many years a leading choirmaster, paid the ultimate debt to life at the age of eighty-three.</p>
   <p>Henry von Oppen was endowed with excellent musical talent; his fame as an artist was not limited to Chicago alone. Many singing societies are indebted to this master for their excellent achievements, obtainable only when enthusiasm and devotion are united in the singing.</p>
   <p>He was a native of Berlin, but immigrated to the United States in 1866, immediately selecting Chicago as his domicile. He was soon in demand as one of the outstanding violin and piano teachers in the city, and under <pb facs="5418474_7_0539.jpg" n="2"/>his capable direction many a musician has been developed. Various singing societies also availed themselves of the opportunity to acquire the services of this recognized instructor, and thus to retain the age-old German customs, so dear to every one whose cradle was rocked in the German Reich. His splendid services, of which he gave so abundantly, have been recorded in the annals of the Fidelia, the Swiss Male Choir, the Harugari, and the Harmony singing societies, which rose to prominence under his leadership. His was the rare distinction of having been Fidelia's choirmaster for a period of fifty-four years, of having served the Swiss Male Choir in the same capacity for a period of thirty-five years, the Harmony Singing Society for twenty-eight years, and the Harugari Singing Society for twenty years.</p>
   <p>Henry von Oppen reached the pinnacle of his career four years ago when Providence granted him his wish to celebrate his golden jubilee as music leader of the Fidelia Singing Society . . . . .</p>

   <p>His death is mourned by numerous friends in both private and music circles.</p>
