   <p>Yesterday afternoon Handel's oratorio "Samson" was sung by the Lutheran Teachers' Chorus in Orchestra Hall. Handel's incomparable music came to a performance, which would have brought him new friends, if this were necessary. It should be pointed out, that it is a pleasure to report this concert. William Lester was appointed organist, and in this position he had the opportunity to prove his mastery of the instrument. The same can be said of his colleague on the piano, Archer Farrell. The orchestra was composed of thirty members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, who did full credit to the difficult music of Handel.</p>
   <p>The Chorus</p>
   <p>The Lutheran Teachers' Chorus is too well-known, to cause surprise at its excellent performance. Their well-trained voices and expert reading of the score, as it is expected of teachers, their readiness in following the <pb facs="5418474_7_0564.jpg" n="2"/>conductor, all contributed prominently to their excellent expression.</p>
   <p>Edith Trewartha sang the soprano-solo parts. Walter Tenny sang "Samson." His voice was tender and soft and at the same time quite powerful. Esther Muenstermann sang the alto-solos. She was loudly acclaimed. Raymund Koch sang the bass roles. A man with such a voice is not found every day on the concert stage.</p>
   <p>The Conductor</p>
   <p>Geo. L. Tenny is the conductor of the Teachers' Chorus, which gave such enjoyment to the listeners. He must be complimented for having achieved great success with this work.</p>
