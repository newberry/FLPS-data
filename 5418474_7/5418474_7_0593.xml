  <body>
   <p>The 60th anniversary of the Orpheus Male Chorus, a festival in which the merry-making spirit of German minstrels prevails, was celebrated Saturday evening at the Social Turner Hall. A great number of friends of the Association came to hear the jubilee program, which consisted of a concert fashioned after the traditions of this Club in bygone years. The concert was followed by a ball.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously with the Club's sixtieth anniversary, one of its singers, George Hellmann, a Chicago-born German, celebrated his fiftieth year as a member of the Club. He was honored by a speech eulogizing his staunch adherence and collaboration, and presented with fifty dollars in gold.</p>
   <p>The popularity which the Club enjoys, particularly among singers, was amply shown at yesterday's festivities. Not only a great number of friends came, but even many singing societies participated, among them the Arion, <pb facs="5418474_7_0594.jpg" n="2"/>the Liedertafel Vorwaerts, Senefelder Liederkranz, and Harmony. Other organizations sent congratulatory telegrams, one arriving even from the North American Singers Alliance of St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
   <p>After the Club's welcoming address by its president W. Frankel, the concert was announced. Karl Reckzeh functioned as the leader. The chorus, consisting of forty members, sang with precision. Great expressiveness proved to be one of its foremost qualifications, giving ample evidence that the Orpheus regards German melodies with veneration and that it enjoyed proper schooling under the tutelage of its director. The applause was therefore well earned in every respect.</p>
   <p>The main feature of the festivity was the solo numbers by Nesta Smith, violin, and Emma Freericks, soprano. Their performance earned them prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Throughout the festivities, the true singers' sentiment, the symbolical spirit of sincere comradeship, prevailed, in conformity with the Club's past. This <pb facs="5418474_7_0595.jpg" n="3"/>friendly spirit has done a great deal in keeping the Club alive. Worthy of praise for the success of the festival are the officials of the Orpheus, who worked untiringly and to whom we are indebted for the very existence of the Club.</p>
