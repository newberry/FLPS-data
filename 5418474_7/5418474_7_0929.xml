   <p>The Finance Committee gathered at the Singers Club rooms at 9 Quincy Avenue. Not much of interest nor importance is to be reported except the statement which came directly from the Finance Committee that Mr. George Schneider suggested to have a few Americans on the Finance Committee and sure enough Mr. John B. Le Moyne and Mr. Jesse J. Spaulding were elected. The Press Committee sent in their regrets and sympathy for the late Mr. Hans Hastings.</p>
   <p>Two new members were elected in Mr. Hastings place: Mr. Louis W. W. Neebe( of the stage) and Johannes Hausen of the (Journal of Freedom and Right). That same evening a performance was given by the Chorus which was well attended. In spite of Mr. Bolatka's serious outlook upon life in general, yet, he too smiled with satisfaction. The Chorus is studying "Orphan of the Underworld", which is to be followed by a Guest Play; name of the Play to be announced later.</p>
   <p>Those who attended the rehearsal of the Company must have had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that when the company is their studying that is will <pb facs="5418474_7_0930.jpg" n="2"/>give an outstanding performance on the evening of the festival.</p>
   <p>Mr. Balatka requested us to announce that any one deserving to join the Chorus for small parts to report not later than next week for auditions since on February 1st, the list will be positively closed to everyone.</p>
   <p>Auditions for women will be given Tuesday afternoon; and Tuesday evenings auditions will be held for men.</p>
   <p>Due to the many and special auditions and meetings we will dispense with the usual Sunday morning auditions. Mixed Chorus Audition will be this week on Friday evening.</p>
