   <p>On last Sunday, July 24, all the representatives and many other members of Ahepa convened at the Board of Trade in Joliet after a mass conducted by Bishop Kallistos.</p>
   <p>In the evening a banquet was held at which about seven hundred people were present and heard various speakers explaining the needs and the progress of the organization. The banquet lasted into the morning hours.</p>
   <p>On Monday the district governor, Mr. George Kyriakopoulos, who is an assistant State's attorney called the convention to order, and various subjects were introduced for discussion by the representatives.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1662.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among the subjects discussed was the election of a new district governor. The election ensued, and the result favored Mr. Arthur Peponis, a wellknown Greek businessman and manager of a large cleaning establishment in Chicago, the Plaza Cleaners.</p>
