   <p>Since announcement was first made of the fact that the students of the Greek School of St. George's Parish were to perform "Cassiani," the play has been impatiently awaited. The merit of the play and the good purpose for which it was being given drew an immense crowd to the Eighth Street Theater last Sunday night.</p>
   <p>The play is a drama dealing with St. Cassiani, who was a sinful woman until she accepted Christ. It was directed by Father Galemis and the school teacher .....The students dramatized the moving story of this saint with ability and understanding beyond their years.....</p>
   <p>One attending this performance could easily discern that many of our younger generation are animated by much of their Grecian heritage and spirit. Even children in Greece could not have spoken more fluently the Greek language or better enacted a Greek play than did these children of St. George's Parish.</p>

   <p>Miss Panagakos could be seen holding the open book, ready to prompt a forgetful actor; but, we are happy to say, she was not given one opportunity to do so during the entire performance. Seventeen children took part in the play. Space does not permit their personal mention.</p>
   <p>Again we say that utmost credit belongs to the boys and girls who took part in this performance.</p>
