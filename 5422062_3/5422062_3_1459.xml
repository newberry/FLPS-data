<title level="a">THE DELPHIC RITES AND MRS. EVA SIKELIANOS'S WORK</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>p. 1- The Greeks of Chicago have become well acquainted with Mrs. Eva Sikelianos in her frequent visits.</p>
   <p>Those who attended the lecture sponsored by the Greek Professional Men's Club remember the patriotic feeling and enthusiasm which she imparted to her audience for the revival of the Delphic rites.</p>
   <p>However, Mrs. Sikelianos does more than give lectures on ancient and modern Greece. The purpose of her coming to America is to impart to Americans the Greek spirit and to explain to them the great purpose of the revival of the Delphic rites, through which she aspires to make Greece the spiritual center of the world.</p>
   <p>It is almost a year now since this indefatigable hierophant of the ancient Greek spirit began to preach the gospel of Greek civilization to Americans, wearing the ancient Greek attire to emphasize her noble message.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1460.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But great ideas require great sacrifices and Mrs. Sikelianos has paid the expense of work done at Delphi out of her own funds, expenditures amounting to $100,000 a sum which she would gladly pay again for the rites to follow if her financial means permitted.</p>
   <p>Her appeal, however, has found response in American circles, and American intellectuals were prompt in supporting the noble efforts of Mrs. Sikelianos. To this end a large committee of honor has been formed by prominent Americans, whose executive council consists of Mr. Henry Morgenthau, Mrs. I. W. Alexander, Mrs. F. W. Longfellow, Mrs. Alma Read, and Mrs. Eva Sikelianos.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Sikelianos has sent us a letter from Detroit, which we consider it our duty to publish because although it is addressed to the manager of the Greek Daily, it plainly appeals to the Greeks of Chicago for support.</p>
