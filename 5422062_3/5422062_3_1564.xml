   <p>Owing to the peculiar hold of Jim Londos' aeroplane spin with which he swings his opponent above his head, and brings home the bacon, this publication, for the enlightenment of its readers refers to historical events, regarding the peculiar methods of the ancient Greek wrestlers.</p>
   <p>Plutarchos and Pausanias tell us about Greek wrestling, that the combatants were big fellows and very powerful. Heracles defeated the invincible Antaeus. During this wrestling, the demi-god Heracles noticed that Antaeus the son of Gaea, while touching the ground, had untold strength, so Hercules lifted him above his head swung him around threw him on the ground and crushed him. May be Jim Londos got his aeroplane spin inspiration from Hercules.</p>
   <p>The ancient Greeks, who were the originators of wrestling, have had two kinds of wrestling. One, standing up and the other, as it is today. In the first kind, the battle ended when one of the two wrestlers fell to the floor.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1565.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the second kind the match was over when one of the two admitted defeat by raising his hand, signifying the superiority of his adversary. In many instances, according to the prearranged understanding, the victor must have gained three falls. The rules and regulations of wrestling were many and peculiar. The combatants were first smeared with olive oil and then peppered with sand or ashes. Paradoxically, cunning deceit and other foul tricks were permissable in the wrestling of both kinds. Each wrestler, although powerfully strong, attempted to outwit the other in the only way to gain a victory was through tricks. No wonder the Greeks are very tricky. The ancients were distinguished for using their brains. When mere physical strength brought no victory the sagacity of the Greeks was employed to effect their purpose. The poor Trojans resisted the severity of the Greek attacks for a long time, but when they tore down a part of the protecting wall to receive the wooden horse, well you know the rest of the story.</p>

   <p>Paradoxically again they did not permit boxing in the wrestling game. The tricks of the game were many and various, and each wrestler was known for the kind of trick he was famous (notorious in our days) as for instance, Kleitos from Rohdos, was known for his throat hold. Aristodemos the victor of the 98th Olympiad was also well known. Noted among the ancient wrestlers were many, but we will mention a few of them: Hipposthenes the Lacedaemon, who won six victories at the Olympic games, and his son. Etemocles, five victories. Tetormos the Aetolian, Melon the Crotonian, these two, according to historian, Julius, the African, were wrestling bulls. Their physical strength was unbelievable. Others noteworthy and also bull wrestlers were Amesynas and Keras.</p>
   <p>The famous hold of Jim Londos is as we see a counterpart of the Heraclean technique, so it is not new to the wrestling game.</p>
