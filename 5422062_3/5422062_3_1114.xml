   <p>Saloniki has unfurled the flag of truth and justice in order to save the Greeks in America from the claws of pseudo-journalists, pseudo-bankers, and exploiters of the common people. This is a unique step in the journalistic history of Greek-Americans.</p>
   <p>When $300,000 were taken from poor Greek laborers of Chicago by the pseudo-bankers, Saloniki was the only newspaper that revealed the true facts. Of course, insults and threats were heaped on it for daring to tell the truth. That does not matter. At least we succeeded in stigmatizing the thieves, and in throwing light upon the dirty facts.</p>
   <p>Saloniki does not expect any recognition for doing this good deed. It was the only honorable course open to a so-called respectable newspaper. If we had done otherwise, we would have no right to expect the respect and support of Greeks in America. Published regularly for the last two years, Saloniki <pb facs="5422062_3_1115.jpg" n="2"/>has achieved many social successes. It is recognized to be an organ of truth, justice and sincere patriotism.....</p>
   <p>Now Saloniki turns its attention to another great social problem. A problem that eats away the insides of our community like a cankerous sore. Such a problem must be solved by drastic measures. And our foes this time are the pseudo-journalists.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America have suffered innumerable wrongs at the hands of these charlatans who are self-taught and self-styled journalists. Unable to earn their living because of their inherent laziness, they decided to publish a "rag" which would solve their economic problem; for they cater to every evil or misleading influence.</p>
   <p>These hangers-on have aroused dissension and hostility between individuals, organizations and groups, because it was to their advantage to do so. They have broken up homes and caused suicides by printing imaginary scandals.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1116.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>They have defended thieving bankers, and have covered up exploiters who prey upon every community.</p>
   <p>It is the sacred duty of a journalist to print only the truth, to enlighten the group he serves, and to endeavor to unite the group. A journalist must defend his native land and his adopted land; and he must make every effort to aid assimilation and harmony between his national group and the other groups.</p>
   <p>These troublemakers have caused chaos and unhappiness in every Greek parish and church.....We are not free of them here in Chicago. In Kansas City they are even more numerous, and Salt Lake City teems with them. For some reason the western cities are cursed with the plague of exploitation, such as the exploitation of the laborer and of the newspaper reading public. It seems that every unsuccessful banana peddler in the West has turned his talents toward being a journalist.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1117.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Saloniki goes to all cities of the United States and we wish to warn their their inhabitants of the presence of these vultures. We also send warnings to the liars, cheats, quacks and imposters that they are marked and will be our targets. So far, our aim has been good.</p>
   <p>Saloniki will pitilessly crush all who stand in the path of truth. Our fight will be a long and hard one, but we are sure that we will be victorious. We do not publish the names of these scoundrels because it would lower the dignity of our paper. They know who they are, and so does every one else.</p>
   <p>Do not give heed to the protests of the charlatans who feel the ground being cut from under them. Saloniki is ready to prove all of its accusations.</p>
