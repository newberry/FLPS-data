   <p>p. 3- It has been brought to our attention that the Chicago chapter of the Gerinia Fraternity has been neglected for some unknown reason, and, accordingly it has been revived on a firmer basis, with a new program and a new staff of officers.</p>
   <p>The officers and the advisors are as follows: Nick Vampirogiannis, president; Constantine G. Pantelis, vice-president; Aristomenes Papohristofilou, treasurer; Dionysios Andritsis, secretary, and Christ Halazonitis, Dionysios Logiotatos, and Spiros P. Kastritsis, advisors.</p>
   <p>This staff of officers, composed of highly-educated and well-known people, addresses its fellow-countrymen and entreats them all without exception to take an interest in the success of our Fraternity. Your moral and material assistance will serve to uplift not only the name of your mother country but also the name of your race. Our chapters, besides striving to realize our ideals and our aims, serve as a connecting link between Mother Greece and her widely-scattered children.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1771.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We hope that all our fellow-countrymen will heed this appeal of our officers and enroll if they are not members. And we hope that all members will support the Fraternity with all their power.</p>
   <p>Convinced that our voice will be heard, we are fraternally yours,</p>
   <p>Nick Vampirogiannis, president.</p>
   <p>Dionysios Andritsis, secretary.</p>
