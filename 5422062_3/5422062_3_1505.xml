   <p>p. 1.-The widely advertised lecture of Dr. George Koromelas, a specialist in tuberculosis who came to the United States to represent the Greek Government in the Medical Convention which convened in St. Louis, was delivered last Sunday to a packed audience in the hall of the National Defense Society. The theme of the lecture was "The Ravages of Tuberculosis." The audience was spell-bound by the eminent physician's elucidation of his subject. Dr. John Volicos, prominent member of the Greek community here, thanked the distinguished visitor, expressing the community's gratitude and appreciation.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Messrs.P. Shoris, N. Stathacos, and that eloquent and learned member of our community, Dr. Geo. Papageorge.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken for national defense, and in forty-five minutes the sum of $850 was gathered.</p>

   <p>Editor's note.</p>
   <p>The collection of this sum for the national defense of Greece from our fellow-Greeks in Chicago reveals once more the inherent instinct of patriotism in the breasts of the sons of Greece. The Chicago community will undoubtedly top the list of contributions for the defense of Mother-Greece. Our adopted country, America, whose principles of liberty and justice approach divinity, is proud and honored to have within its borders citizens of this kind.</p>
