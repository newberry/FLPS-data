   <p>p. 5.- The old gag "when Greek meets Greek they open a restaurant" doesn't hold true in baseball.</p>
   <p>The St. Louis, Missouri Sons of Pericles, a junior chapter of the Ahepa, (American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association), dispatched its topnotchers in baseball to invade Chicago, burn it up, and snatch a victory from Chicago's Sons of Pericles. Can you imagine that! The audacity of those St. Louis boys, to entertain the idea of beating the Chicago Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Sons of Pericles of Chicago, being true natives of the city, smiled when informed of the preposterous idea of those St. Louis Greeks, who prophesied that before they got through with Chicago all its fences would be torn down.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1541.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Chicago boys, still smiling after the game, said, "It was just like taking candy from a bady". Because those outsiders are Greeks, we do not let the world know the score. Really it is a pity for those boys from St. Louis. They are true Sons of Pericles, but they know nothing, as yet, of baseball.</p>
   <p>The hospitality and entertainment extended to the St. Louis visiting boys surpassed any given to other visiting groups, and it will always be remembered. The young Chicago Greeks, true to the tradition of extending their hand to defeated opponents, showed their good-fellowship by entertaining the visitors.</p>
   <p>Although no fences were torn down and no restaurants sprang up after the meeting of the two Greek groups, the baseball grounds bore marks of a Greek battle reminiscent of ancient Marathon and Thermopylae.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1542.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When the visitors bade the victors farewell, being true Greeks in mind and manner, they said, "We will never rest until we defeat Chicago." To that, the Chicago boys, still smiling, answered, "If and when you return, we will gladly give you the same entertainment."</p>
