   <p>Miss Jane Addams, that famous humanitarian and one of the best friends of the Greek people of Chicago, has given our community permission to use several class rooms at Hull House where a new Greek Evening School has opened its doors to the public.</p>
   <p>This school will serve a great national cause in the future for there is no other cause more patriotic and praiseworthy than to educate and impart useful knowledge which will assist people in leading a successful and happy life. There are more than twelve thousand Greeks in this city, very few of whom had the good fortune to attend any kind of school in their youth. The majority of our people, either because they did not have the means or because of a lack of schools, have remained almost entirely illiterate, possessing not even the rudiments of an education or the necessary knowledge to improve <pb facs="5422062_3_1322.jpg" n="2"/>and advance themselves rapidly in practical life.</p>
   <p>Temporarily, the school will provide evening classes twice a week. There will be a two-hour class in the afternoon on Sundays and another two-hour session at 8:00 P. M. on Wednesdays. As time goes on there will be a gradual increase in the number of hours and days for the instruction of the great numbers of students who are expected to register as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>At the present time instruction will be offered in the following subjects: Religious History, History of the Greek Revolution of 1821, Hygiene, Greek Language and Literature, Elementary and Advanced English, Civics or The Duties of the Citizen, and commercial courses. At some future date additional subjects will be offered, such as, mathematics, music, geography, physics, astronomy, first aid, ancient and medieval Greek history, and political economy.</p>
   <p>So, fellow countrymen, we must support this splendid new endeavor with all <pb facs="5422062_3_1323.jpg" n="3"/>the means at our command. Let us all contribute to the progress and success of this people's school. We can easily do this through co-operation and common effort. This school is dedicated and intended to benefit all the people of the Greek community. There is no doubt that the masses of our people will appreciate and hear of the new school with great joy. Justly so, because the school is the people's second mother that will give them mental and intellectual nourishment. This systematic and proper development of the mind will strengthen our people and equip them with the indispensable means with which they will be able to become more prosperous and happier in this world.</p>
   <p>By expressing our sincerest wishes for this noble cause, it is our duty to observe that this thriving Greek community of ours with its more than twelve thousand organized Greeks can claim no credit for the establishment of our new evening school at Hull House.</p>
   <p>Our ambitious but impractical leaders and educators have not realized one of the main objectives upon which we had decided since we first arrived in Chicago, <pb facs="5422062_3_1324.jpg" n="4"/>and that is the building and maintenance of a real Greek school. By this time Chicago should have been in a position to boast of the greatest and best Greek school in America.</p>
   <p>We must admit that though we recognize the limited value and usefulness of an evening school, a substantial and permanent service is rendered the people of this city. Until now, we have offered our youth negligible educational opportunities in the form of occasional evening lectures. This method of enlightening the people is far from adequate and sufficient, for what is needed primarily is elementary and basic instruction and guidance of our youth in the Greek language. Many amongst us are really tired of listening to dry, formal, and stereotyped lectures. Why should our youth be forced to listen to unintelligble lectures when what is really sorely needed is a good grade and high school?</p>
   <p>If we are to go forward in the educational field as we have done in the business world, we must not fail to provide our youth with proper schools. An evening <pb facs="5422062_3_1325.jpg" n="5"/>school may be satisfactory as a temporary measure but we should not forget the old Greek "saw" which says, "do this but do not neglect to do the most essential thing also."</p>
   <p>The wise and valuable suggestions offered by The Star in connection with the school problem are still fresh in the memory of our countrymen. All we can do at present is to express the wish that our suggestion will be heeded and put into practice.</p>
   <p>In passing, may we be permitted to mention that considerable confusion arose last Sunday because of the time at which the evening classes were scheduled to meet. On that same day the newly established, patriotic Macedonian Society had announced two weeks before that its members were to hold a general open meeting last Sunday afternoon. By same strange coincidence, however, the classes of the evening school met at the same time, so many adult and young <pb facs="5422062_3_1326.jpg" n="6"/>students were prevented from attending the important Macedonian Society's meeting.</p>
   <p>There is no good reason why the principal of the Greek Evening School, the Reverend Pygeas, should have the classes meet at the same time that this meeting was to take place. There is no excuse for changing the evening school to an afternoon school thereby interfering with the business and activities of a patriotic meeting.</p>
   <p>Because of such irregularities and misunderstandings, there has been a serious split among the members of our societies and our clergy which is manifestly detrimental to the best interests of our community and to our unity. Let us hope that for the sake of our common interest no similar incidents will arise in the future. May we remark that if the mistake of Reverend Pygeas was due to carelessness or forgetfulness, he might be excused; if he did it intentionally, however, or under the pretext that the school takes precedence over any other <pb facs="5422062_3_1327.jpg" n="7"/>affair even though the date of the latter was properly announced, we are really shocked and feel sorry for this priest who is fomenting trouble and sowing the seeds of dissension in this community.</p>
   <p>The Reverend and his assistants have enough work and responsibilities to spend their energy on without stirring up trouble.</p>
