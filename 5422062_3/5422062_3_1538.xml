   <p>p. 1.- The Greek Olympic Athletic Club has been in existence for over twenty years. Raw material entering its portals in a short time emerged as champions. During all these years, the Greek Olympic has served the Greek public faithfully and conscientiously, unlike other clubs and societies which have in the course of years deviated from their purpose.</p>
   <p>Yet, despite its faithful and constructive work in the Greek community the club has not received the deserved wholehearted support of the Greeks of Chicago. In a recent meeting of the club this subject was discussed intensively and steps taken to remedy the faults, and instill a greater interest for the club, in the Greek public. The dues which formerly were $10 and $15 for boys under 16 years of age were lowered to $6 and $3 respectively, payable at the rate of fifty cents a month.</p>

   <p>Moreover, new teams are to be formed including swimming, track, checker and basketball. Every Sunday at 9 A.M. the members of the track and swimming team will practice at Douglas Park.</p>
   <p>Educational trips will also be sponsored by the club, for the children as well as the grownups, to various places of interest as, for example, the Field Museum, Art Institute, etc. The Greeks are urged to join this club and also send their children to be taught the rudiments of athletics.</p>
   <p>Remember that our forefathers believed that "a sound mind inhabits a sound body."</p>
