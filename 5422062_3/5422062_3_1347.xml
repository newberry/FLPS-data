<title level="a">TRIPOLITANS HEAR LECTURE</title></bibl>

   <p>The much publicized lecture sponsored by the Tripolitan Lodge Theodore Kolokotronis was given last Sunday afternoon at the Gapan Hall, corner of Halsted and Harrison Streets. It attracted a very large crowd. The speaker was Mr. Andrew Vlachos, who was introduced by....the president of the Club. The program commenced, however, with the singing of the doxology by the children of the Socretes Greek School.</p>
   <p>The speaker devoted two and one-half hours to consideration of the history of the Kolokotronis family. Half of that time was spent reviewing the life and deeds of Theodore Kolokotronis, the great leader of the Greek revolt. One might think that such a lecture would be tiresome; and perhaps this would have been,had anyone else been the speaker. Mr. Vlachos is a speaker who never seems to tire his audience but manages to hold its undivided attention throughout.....</p>

   <p>Following his enlightening lecture, a little boy, dressed in the inspiring "Foustanella," recited a patriotic poem. Then the president called upon the editor of this paper to come to the platform and speak. He did so, and in a few short paragraphs spoke about the contributions of the topical clubs in America, emphasizing their value.....The children again sang, this time, the Greek and American national anthems.</p>
   <p>The Tripolitans had no intention of leaving the impression that they were inhospitable; so their guests found roast lamb, olives, wine,and everything else which graces a Greek table, ready for their enjoyment. Two Greek orchestras provided music for the lovely Tripolitan songs and dances.</p>
