   <p>Our communities and clubs have been very successful with their picnics this year. Every single Sunday, and even some week days, a picnic was in progress somewhere and not a cloud marred the perfect picnic weather during the whole season.</p>
   <p>This same weather continued when the Stereoladitans gave their picnic last Sunday. The Indian Summer weather came as a relief after those hot July and August days.</p>
   <p>The Stereoladitan picnic was the last of the season and the most brilliant. Years ago this custom was started and it is now an accepted fact that the Stereoladitan picnic automatically closes the season</p>
   <p>The picnic was organized in the true Hellenic way. At the gates of the park is the receiving committee, men and women, dressed in Greek Foustaneles, ready to adorn you with a rose. For a time you forget you are in Chicago. Greek costumes are discerned through the crowds, music with Greek <pb facs="5422062_3_0843.jpg" n="2"/>rhythm comes from the distant pavilon where Greek dances are in progress. Friendliness and hospitality are the Greek keynotes of the Stereoladitans. The Greek spirit prevailed everywhere.</p>
   <p>At a huge feast given by the president of the organization, Stauros Kantos and the vice-president, John Gekas, both in Greek costume, there were present such notables as: Dr. George Gavares, Dr. Sarantos Loumos, Dr. &amp; Mrs. Spiros Sotiropoulos, Dr. &amp; Mrs. K. Theodorou, editor Paul Javaras, lawyer John Gavares, Mr. A. Kapsopoulos who is Supreme Governor of Gapa, Dr. &amp; Mrs. Theodore Dimitrakopoulos, Dr. Thomas, Messers. A. Alexapoulos, A. Pantos, K. Argo, E. Despotis, and others.</p>
   <p>The success of the occasion was due to Mr. Mantsios, Mr. Gekas, Dr. Diamesis, A. Patrinos, and Mr. Kimonos Skoutela.</p>
