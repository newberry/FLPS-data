   <p>p. 2.- Pride and editorial enthusiasm characterize the fourth Greek newspaper in Chicago, the Loxias, which was launched today. In its application to Paul Hall, superintendent of the second class mail department in the post-office, for the privileges of second-class rates, the paper submitted translations of the substance of each printed article, required by the rules, as follows:</p>
   <p>Page First</p>
   <p>First and Second Columns.- Some of our men of bad reputation must be caught. One such man injures all of us among the American people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1171.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Third Column.- The picture of William H. Taft, who will surely be president of the United States in the coming election. Some false dispatches must be discredited. Our Greek ambassador, when in St. Louis, never spoke in favor of Bryan. What we surely know is, the reporter's interview is a strong one.</p>
   <p>Page Second</p>
   <p>First Column.- The power of the Greek restaurants is in the union. An interview between Loxias and restaurant men brings out the fact that the latter must be united for their benefit.</p>
   <p>Third Column.- Interruption of relations between the Greek newspapers, Simaia of New York and Athena of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Fourth Column.- The different news.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1172.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Page Third</p>
   <p>Column Second.- The latest telegrams. A Greek-German dialogue on the West Side. A satyrical piece, "How to Accomplish Marriage in this Country."</p>
   <p>Column Fourth.- Some verses of Psorocollas and Antartis, both of them advising their countrymen how to take steps to be free and civilized.</p>
   <p>Page Fourth</p>
   <p>Including forty business advertisements. Greek newspaper published at 231 E. Ontario St., D. S. Eutaxius, proprietor and editor.</p>
   <p>The birth of the Loxias gives Chicago more foreign newspapers than any other city in this country. The paper will be issued weekly.</p>
   <p>Chicago Journal, August 14, 1908</p>
