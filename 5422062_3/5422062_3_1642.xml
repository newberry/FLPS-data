   <p>Neither the theatrical performance of "The Lions of Chicago," written by Mr. Elias Janettis, nor the many other social affairs given last Sunday prevented the Phi Sigma Epsilon Dance from being a great success. Many well-known members of the community were present, although the great majority of the guests were of the younger generation. The good purpose for which the dance was given, and the artistic program provided, were the principal factors which caused this benefit affair to be so well attended.</p>
   <p>The musical program was presented by some of the finest young Greek artists of Chicago. Such a group had never before been enjoyed by our community. Mr. Peter Vournas, famous mandolinist, exhibited his great skill by playing.....He is one of the most well-known musicians of America. Two songs by Miss Vania gave promise of future success in the singing world.</p>
   <p>Miss Ismene Papageorge, as usual, played her difficult piano selections with <pb facs="5422062_3_1643.jpg" n="2"/>great artistry and skill.....</p>
   <p>At the close of the musical dancing began to the music of Eddie Varzos' orchestra. He was forced by popular demand to remain until 1:30 A.M.</p>
   <p>The dance committee and the entire Phi Sigma Epsilon Fraternity worked very hard to make this scholarship dance a success and their efforts were amply repaid.</p>
