   <p>Do not think from the above title that our beloved and much-needed John Adinamis, who runs the well-known advertisement in our paper: "Nothing is more certain than death", has died.</p>
   <p>No, he lives; and so must he continue to perform the task which, although unpleasant, is a very necessary one. [Editor's note--He was an undertaker.] He merely wishes to make it known that he has moved his offices to 177-179 North Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adinamis also wishes to make the following announcement: "Well, folks, I am tired of running to serve you in your grief and unhappiness, and so I have decided also to serve you in a more congenial capacity. Therefore, I put at your disposal automobiles for weddings and baptisms; and for a small fee, I will arrange for the rental of the hall, tables, etc. Without any <pb facs="5422062_3_0081.jpg" n="2"/>trouble on your part, all arrangements for celebrations can be made through me."</p>
   <p>Our beloved John, we are sure, will fulfill all his promises. Let us try to make him happy, so that he will not take his revenge upon us when we finally come into his hands. We, John, wish to be on good terms with you; and so, if we get fooled and get married, we will surely ask for your services.</p>
