   <p>Up to now, Greek theatricals in Chicago have in most cases been "causes" for Churches, Schools and other whims of local Hellenes.</p>
   <p>At their best these efforts or ventures were pretty bad. They were not theatrical in any sense and as for entertainment there was nothing of the kind.</p>
   <p>It was left to Miss Penelope Haloulos, graduate of the Drama School of Mundelein College in Chicago, bravely to offer to Chicago audiences of Greek extraction, a dramatic presentation that it is to be judged solely on its artistic merits.</p>
   <p>"O Kokinos Vrahos" ("The Red Rock") by the leading dramatist of modern Greece, Gregory Xenopoulos, will be staged on the boards of the Chicago Women's Club Theater, Sunday, May 6, 1934, at 8:15 P.M. The play has been directed and it is being staged by Miss Haloulos assisted by Miss Ourania and Nelly Hrounta and Christine Georgoulaki.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0589.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is the duty of every Chicago Greek to support such a venture for it is the first time within the living tissues of Greek local organism that a person has been brave enough to start out and say to the Greek public:-</p>
   <p>"I do not offer you worn out patriotism. I have a show that is worth every bit of the admission price. Come and see it. If you like it applaud it. If you don't, knock it." That is more than fair.</p>
