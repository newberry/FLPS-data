   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, as had been announced in the columns of the Greek Press, the gifted Argiris sisters presented three classical dances before the International Day audience at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Thousands of people of all nationalities thronged the amphitheater of the Court of States to watch and applaud the various artistic contributions of the European races. The Poles, Italians,....were represented by large choral groups and individual artists. The only two numbers that received great and persistent applause were the performance of the tenor who represented Lithuania, and that of our own Greek dancers, Demetra and Aigli Argiris. They held the audience rapt while performing the dance of "The Satyr and the Nymph" and.... The background was an ornamental setting produced by the arrangement of Greek girls attired in classical garb. Despite the fact that the girls posed <pb facs="5422062_3_0738.jpg" n="2"/>awkwardly, the general effect was good.</p>
   <p>The Argiris sisters were invited to represent Greece by Rufus Dawes, who had been impressed by their recent performance on Greek Day.</p>
