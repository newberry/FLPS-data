   <p>p. 3---Like the famous old navigator Shavah the theatrical troupe of Mrs. Vrysoula Pantopoulos may be proud of its distinction in undertaking a trip around the world, without adequate funds or credit, having as its only resources its wits and the ability to satisfy the people with its performances.</p>
   <p>The troupe left Piraeus about three years ago and visited Alexandria, Cairo, and Port Said in Egypt, Johannesburg and Beira in South Africa, and Sidney, Melbourne, and Brisbane in Australia, travelling thence to San Francisco. In San Francisco they played with great success in the Greek colony.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0455.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The leader of the troupe is that veteran of the Greek theater, Theodore Pofantes, a descendant of the old Ulysses. He is confident that the Greeks of Chicago will be very well pleased with the plays and will give the troupe sufficient support so that it may continue its trip.</p>
   <p>The company has a number of good plays, among them some new translations of classical drams, which it will present in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Greek colony here will doubtless take advantage of this opportunity to have an Athenian theatrical troupe here this winter and will be well entertained by the performances of this adventurous group of actors.</p>
