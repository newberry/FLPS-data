   <p>"In unity there is strength." This should be the motto of all Greeks if they wish to become successful. Unification and co-operation are an integral part of American life and thought. American people work as partners and as groups--not as individuals. This does not mean that individuality is discouraged; it simply means that two people working together can accomplish more than one working alone. Therefore, if fifty or a hundred individuals co-operate, the results will be multiplied proportionately. As a result, when one person is forced to compete with a corporation or a partnership, that person is nearly always the loser.</p>
   <p>Many Greek merchants are industrious and progressive, yet they do not become successful. They are licked by the immense and wide-spread American firms and corporations. To overcome this condition, the Greeks must, in turn, organize their own companies. We do not refer to clubs, but to commercial partnerships <pb facs="5422062_3_0109.jpg" n="2"/>or corporations.</p>
   <p>A good example of what we mean by unification is the Greek Fruit Company of Chicago. Fifty fruit dealers got together and raised a capital of $2,500. With this money they purchase fruit in greater quantities and at the same time pay lower prices. By working together as a single unit they save money on their purchases, as they get lower prices by buying as a corporation than they would get as fifty separate fruit buyers.</p>
   <p>We have always preached unification and its blessings, and that is why we feel so happy about the action of the fruit buyers. We urge the other Greek businessmen to organize also, because by doing so they are benefiting themselves and the rest of the Greek community.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Greek Fruit Company the following gentlemen were elected to office: president, J. Vasilopoulos; vice-president, E. Souliotis; secretary, C. Kostulas; treasurer, V. Eliopoulos; and....</p>
