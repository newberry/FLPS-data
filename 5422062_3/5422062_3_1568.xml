   <p>p. 6 In a spirited game of baseball, between the Lord Byron and the Ypsilanti Chapters of the Sons of Pericles, which lasted two and half innings, the South Side boys were pronounced victors by Umpire Keating, when the North Siders did not choose to play any further.</p>
   <p>The game was arousing much enthusiasm among the seven hundred fifty spectators, who had come there to witness the staunch young Greeks of both teams at play. Everything was going along nicely, until the last of the third inning when the Ypsilanti team decided to recall Bill Marcutsas and put in his place, Nicholas Manousos. At this instant Iris, goddess of discord, threw her apple in to the diamond and coach John Brown, ordered the North Side boys to play "quits", the contention being that Manousos was a professional player.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1569.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among the spectators present were the esteemed Supreme Vice-President P. G. Sikokis, of the Order of Ahepa; A. H. Peponis of Woodlawn chapter, and lest we forget, women, many women good looking too, among them being Mrs. Nicoleta Courias, proud mother of handsome Charlie (one of the boys playing). Mrs. Peter Sikokis, Mrs. Peponis, and others. But the real noise makers were the two Past Archon Megistans, Nicholas Booloukas of Bryon chapter and William Belroy Ypsilanti. Tsoulos did his share of the shouting and more everytime Peter Simadis sent to bat. "You swing like a barn door" he once said to Simadis in a friendly spirit.</p>
   <p>But all this cheerful fun-making was too good to last. The boys and the spectators were enjoying the game when the uncompromising Mr. Brown decreed a stop should be put to it. Nicholas Manousos was disqualified. We regret, that he was not given a chance to play. that the people who came to see the game might see what he could do.</p>
   <p>Arguments were heard. Nicholas Economos, Chairman of the Ypsilanti said, "My chief desire is to see the maintenance of peace and the promotion of good will in the ranks of the Sons of Pericles.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1570.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Not to discriminate against any of them, but to extend support and cooperation, so that every one is enabled to get his share of the benefits which this fraternity has to offer by sports and in spiritual gain. Mr. Brown has taken it upon himself to disqualify one of the Sons, from particiapting in this baseball game between the rival teams because he chooses to call Mr. Manousos a professional. O, how I wish that this were true, for I would like to see all the Sons of Pericles become professionals if possible. Further the Ypsilanti boys are real Greek gentlemen; once, in the past, or played the Byrons, without any objection, knowing that amongst them, a son of Pericles, was a professional. It did not matter, let them all be professionals, we'll beat them just the same."</p>
   <p>Some of the North Side boys said," we are fully aware, that one of our boys has played for money in the past, but as long as the South Siders did not protest it was their own hard luck.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1571.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Coach Gus Spirakes of the Ypsilanti team, has issued a challenge that his team is ready to meet in friendly baseball any team in the United States consisting of Greek boys under twenty one years of age, who are members of the Sons of Pericles, and without discrimination.</p>
   <p>Young Spirakes said, "Every boy under twenty one, of Greek parentage or descent, and a member of the Sons of Pericles, may play against us and the question of amateur or professional will not matter.</p>
   <p>Among the spectators were many Americans who came to witness the game of Greek fighting Greek. The battle was very heated, but it did not last long.</p>
