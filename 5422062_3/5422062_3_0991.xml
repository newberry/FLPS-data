   <p>From the front page title it is obvious to our readers that Saloniki and the Greek Press have combined. The management of the Press suggested the combined title because it believed that the name of a newspaper which had influenced and led the Greek group for twenty years should remain in view of the Greek reading public of America. It is very fitting that its name should be linked to a Chicago paper. Therefore, the name of our paper is now the Saloniki-Greek Press.</p>
   <p>The Greek-Press takes this opportunity to express certain of its opinions to its readers. First, we feel that it is our moral duty to say that we are deeply obligated to our colleague, and to the rest of the Salopoulos family--owners of the Saloniki. During the entire existence of the Press, <pb facs="5422062_3_0992.jpg" n="2"/>they have never, by word or action, done anything to slight or belittle the paper or its staff. In fact, they have been sources of encouragement and inspiration. The respect has been mutual...The policies and principles of the Saloniki have so paralleled our own that it will be easy for the Greek Press to carry on the same journalistic struggles and hopes as did the Saloniki.</p>
   <p>The assumption of this new responsibility to the Greeks of Chicago and America, gives rise within us to a new attitude toward the journalistic profession. This we shall try to cultivate within ourselves, in order that we may fight for our hopes, our ambitions, and our race, more valiantly. We think that the road we have been faithfully following during the last five years has been along the line of progress, and we intend to stay upon it. Of course, past events will help us plan future campaigns which will be successful; for past experiences have shown us our mistakes. Everything that is printed in this paper is intended to be of value and of service to <pb facs="5422062_3_0993.jpg" n="3"/>the Greeks of this country.</p>
   <p>The former period of life for the Greeks in America was very weak and unstable. Their future depends upon the wholesome foundation we build during this period. One of the most important pillars of strength is the Greek newspaper. It governs, through its molding power, the destiny of our race. All thinking people recognize this fact--but all too few of them do anything to help or defend our newspapers. It is time that proper credit and acknowledgment be accorded to our patriotic heroes who have had courage enough to found a newspaper, and who often have to pay its printing expenses out of their own meager funds. They have believed that it was their duty to help their own race; but, unfortunately, many of their race have not had the ability to understand the greatness of the service done by men such as Salopoulos, and many others. The Greek papers are fulfilling their obligations to the community. However, the Greek communities have not as yet repaid their debts to the papers which have so faithfully served them.</p>
