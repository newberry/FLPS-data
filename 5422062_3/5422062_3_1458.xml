   <p>P. 1. A most interesting debate will take place at a meeting of the 46th Chapter of Ahepa (American Hellenic Educational Association) in Washington Hall, State-Lake Building, tomorrow evening at nine o'clock. The subject will be: "Have the Greeks of America progressed?" The speakers will be G. Spannon, lawyer, and M. Meletiadis, manager of the Greek-American Review, for the affirmative;G. Papanikolaou, professor of pedagogy; and D. Tselos, student of the history of fine arts, for the negative.</p>
   <p>This subject is open to debate, because there are many who think that the Greeks in America have made great progress, if one considers the short time of their residence here and their lack of previous education; while others maintain that their progress in comparison to that of other races is insignificant, and that the occupations in which they are engaged are petty and unimportant, very few Greeks having achieved commercial success.</p>
   <p>The speakers because of their positions, have studied Hellenism and know it well, and the arguments advanced on both sides will be very interesting.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting will be D. Parry, lawyer, and president of the 46th Chapter of Ahepa.</p>
