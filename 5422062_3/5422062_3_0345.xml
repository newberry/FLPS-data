   <p>In the previous issue of the Greek Press our readers were apprised of the fact that a convention of the American Guild Organization of Banjoists, Mandolinists, and Guitarists was being held in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Each year the finest stringed-instrument artists gather from all over America to compete for the first prize. This year the convention and contest were held in the La Salle Hotel. Over fifteen string ensembles were represented. Aside from the various programs presented during the convention, the most important was the recital given Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>The finest mandolin ensembles of the country took part in the recital. Certain required numbers were played by each orchestra in order that the committee of judges might select a winner. It finally awarded the first prize <pb facs="5422062_3_0346.jpg" n="2"/>to the Greek Mandolin Orchestra under the direction of Mr. Peter Vournas.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vournas was enthusiastically applauded for his rendition of two solo numbers during which he exhibited his talent and artistry. The recognition given to this Greek musician is a laurel wreath for the Greek name.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press feels sure it expresses the sentiments of the entire Greek community in congratulating Mr. Vournas and his mandolin orchestra.</p>
