   <p>This paper takes great pleasure in announcing that our prominent Chicago attorney, Mr. Paul Demos, has consented to become a member of our staff and one of our greatest supporters. He will be the sounding board of the Greek members of the professions especially. We are glad to have Mr. Demos collaborate with us. His wisdom, high professional and social standing, and inexhaustible energy will give us all the support which we need to make this a great newspaper.</p>
   <p>The following article of Mr. Demos' explains what his views and purposes are on becoming a member of our staff:</p>
   <p>"I wish to thank my friends and all those who have supported me so willingly in my efforts to increase the prestige and the scope of Saloniki.</p>
   <p>"On entering the journalistic field, I promise the Greek people of Chicago <pb facs="5422062_3_1128.jpg" n="2"/>that I shall do everything in my power to uphold the ideals and rights of the Greek people everywhere. The interests of our people will be upheld and protected by our co-operation with the American press.</p>
   <p>"Very soon Saloniki promises through the untiring efforts of its owners and publishers to have an eight page weekly issue. The time is not far off when Saloniki will be issued daily.</p>
   <p>"I wish also to thank all my friends and those who have sent me letters of thanks and who have congratulated me for my article in Milwaukees' great newspaper, The Milwaukee Sentinel. In this article, I had the opportunity to defend our national rights and aspirations.</p>
   <p>"Saloniki thanks the editor of the Milwaukee Sentinel for accepting and publishing my article, which was very favorably received by the American public. The people of this country must be further enlightened in connection with the actions and accusations of the Bulgarians against our country.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1129.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"It is true, my dear fellow countrymen, that we must be vitally interested in the Greek national affairs and developments. Our faith in our nation's greatness must be kept alive. We must be even ready to defend our rights and just historic demands. We must remember, however, that our faith, our patriotism, our interest and enthusiasm must be proved in action. A passive contemplation and discussion of our difficulties and problems will not help our national cause. If we want to see Greece become a great and respected country we will be forced to do things, to act, to contribute money, to support our leaders.</p>
   <p>"In critical times like these, when our people, especially in the fatherland, are consolidating their territorial gains and are putting their national house in order, we are confronted with our old perfidious enemies, the Bulgarians, again.</p>
   <p>"These despicable Tartars, these barbarous descendants of the cruel Krumus, these cowardly and double-dealing neighbors of ours are still giving evidence <pb facs="5422062_3_1130.jpg" n="4"/>of their savage nature even now, in the twentieth century.</p>
   <p>"With the wicked organs of propaganda and with the support of the cheap Hearst press, the Bulgarians are attempting to attach stigma to our good name. They are hoping to blacken the pages of our glorious history which are full of heroic and well fought battles against the tyrants, the oppressors of humanity.</p>
   <p>"Professor Hollom of Oxford University, who is a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin, felt the necessity of writing an article concerning the present incident in which the Greek people are involved. In addition, he gave a lecture before the Greek Women's Club of Chicago. Our people were greatly pleased to hear Professor Hollom speak about our country, its glorious history, and its future status as a Balkan power.</p>
   <p>"He said that we in America must study the religion and civilization of ancient Hellas if we are to appreciate the achievements and importance of our modern Western civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1131.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"He said that our present advanced society and its many accomplishments are the products and an elaboration of the civilization which Greece bequeathed to us. 'Our greatest spiritual, intellectual, moral, and artistic values and ideals are traceable to Greece,' said he.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Hollom said, in conclusion, that the accusations and the propaganda which are being circulated throughout the world and which are directed by Bulgaria against the Greeks are entirely false and unfounded."</p>
