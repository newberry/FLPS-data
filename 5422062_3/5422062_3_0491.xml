   <p>p. 3. On the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of this month, Vassos and Tanagra Kanellos, with a company of fifty artists, under the auspices of the Chicago Art Institute, will give a reproduction of classic dances and drama. The Phil-Hellenic Committee, which is composed of distinguished Americans of the City of Chicago, will supervise the classical reproduction.</p>
   <p>The two Greek artists are famous all over the country. Their performance at the Greek Theatre of the University of California was crowned with success. The American press devoting whole columns to the artistic and perfect reproductions of the Greek couple.</p>
   <p>Vassos and Tanagra Kanellos, with the rest of their company attired in ancient Greek costumes, presented a sumptuous and splendid aspect.</p>
   <p>The reproduction of the Greek drama and dances, was performed recently by a group of Russians, without success. Their failure was attributed to their determined efforts to "Slavicize" the whole thing, instead of. "Hellenizing" it.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0492.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Greek artists, with their euphonious and fluent Greek accent, succeed in deifying the ancient drama, dances and Byzantine music. Greeks of Chicago do not fail to see the three performances.</p>
   <p>The dances, the singing and the drama are performed and done by devotees of the classics who spent years and years in perfecting the reproductions.</p>
