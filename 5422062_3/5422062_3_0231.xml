   <p>The New Greek Restaurant Association of Chicago has been named "Hermes." This organization has a very good purpose behind it and we sincerely hope it will succeed. The greatest danger lies in the animosity that can be found between the Spartans and the Tripolitans. If they can get along successfully, we have no fear of the Corinthians, Messinians, Trifilians, Stereoladitans, Nisiotans, Thrankans, and Macedonians. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could see the Spartans cooperate and live harmoniously with the other Greeks? Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could see them helping and taking a friendly interest in one another?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0232.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Spartans and the Tripolitans are the most numerous and the most powerful restauranteurs of our association. Success rests largely on their shoulders. The Hermes association is not going to be a battleground for private quarrels. It is going to be a progressive, commercial organization.</p>
   <p>It is not going to break up and die within the next year or two. It mustn't because the Greeks must be organized to figure the other nationalities who are trying to wipe out the Greek restauranteurs of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0233.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During the last three years our restaurant positions have been greatly periled by this antagonizing force. Much of the profit is being taken away from the Greek restaurant owners and some on Clark Street have been forced to close. Loxias has seen this condition and written about it for some time, but our advice was not heeded. The Greeks are beginning to wake up at last and try to prevent the catastrophe which is becoming so eminent.</p>
   <p>If the Greeks will look upon their countrymen as brothers and friends, instead of enemies, nobody will be able to harm any of us because together we will be able to fight.back. Our restaurants are safe as long as we stay together and cooperate. United, we are too powerful to be afraid of opposition from other nationalities in the restaurant business.</p>
