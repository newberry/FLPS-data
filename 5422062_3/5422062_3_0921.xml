  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday night, July 12, the University of Chicago gave an International Evening. Ten nationalities were represented, among them the Greeks. We were represented by girls and boys from the Socrates School on the West Side.</p>
   <p>Under the direction of Mrs. C. Kantzou they gave a performance of the "Dance of Zallogou," which had pleased us at a previous time.</p>
   <p>It is impossible for us to describe the enthusiasm of the professors and students in this American audience when they saw this picturesque and heroic dance.</p>
   <p>The applause was terrific every time the Foustanella twirled and led the dance. It was the first time that the University had the privilege of <pb facs="5422062_3_0922.jpg" n="2"/>seeing such a spectacle. The people also enjoyed the sweet strains of the violin played by Mr. G. Kambas in accompaniment to the dance.</p>
   <p>All who were unable to attend this affair expressed their regret at having missed the Greek dancing. The Greeks have again been asked to honor the University and their country by appearing in the November International Evening. The dancers and their teacher deserve hearty congratulations.</p>
