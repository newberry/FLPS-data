   <p>The record of the first meeting, of the newly organized club of Greek salesmen of Chicago will go down in the annals of our race, here in America, as a long step taken toward a brighter and more brilliant future.</p>
   <p>These young men met at 748 Blue Island Avenue, in the hall next door to the offices of the Saloniki. They drew up the by-laws for the organization, and elected a temporary committee which will be in charge of the proceedings of the first general meeting, to be held next Thursday, October 21, in the hall at 217 North Dearborn Street.</p>
   <p>This first meeting received the blessing of the Reverend Leon Pygeas, who made a speech that was an inspiration to his listeners. He emphasized the need for co-operation between the various types of organizations in the Greek <pb facs="5422062_3_0128.jpg" n="2"/>community of Chicago. After his speech, this progressive and popular priest received many words of congratulation.</p>
   <p>Various comments were made and ideas exchanged by the members. These ideas were concerned mainly with the problem of educating and enlightening Greek businessmen.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee are as follows: George Bambakaris, D. Spirakis, Constantine Gianias, P. Damascis, C. Agrios, and James Sarantakis.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki, wishes the club much success.</p>
