   <p>Novel, but exemplary, is the decision reached by the Greek Mothers' Society St. Barbara and the Greek Olympic Athletic Club, that, for the benefit of the two respective treasuries, in conjuction they present upon the stage, "The Sweetheart of the Shepherd Girl," a popular national tragedy. The performance will take place on Sunday, April 14th, at the Eight Street Theater at 8:15 P.M.</p>
   <p>The presentation of the tragedy with the object of strengthening the funds of their treasuries, is aknowledged and appreciated by all as a noble deed.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0646.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Mothers' society, besides its many philanthropic activities is determined to raise funds and build an orphanage for Greek children in Chicago. The young Greek boys of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club, are striving to enlarge their scope of operations in enlisting all the Greek boys in Chicago. They believe that a good strong and healthy body in conjunction with mental development, is a great necessity in our present mechanical age.</p>
   <p>Fifteen hundred tickets have been sold already. Everybody is invited to spend his time and money in something useful and beneficial. Hon. G. Depastas will honor the performance with his presence.</p>
   <p>The Mothers and the young Greeks ask you to attend the performance.</p>
