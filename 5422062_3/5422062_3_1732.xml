   <p>p. 5.- Everyone present at the Falanthos dinner-dance last Sunday had a wonderful time. The fun began at six o'clock and lasted till morning. Guests were dancing an hour before dinner was served. They were greeted as they came in by Mr. Augerinos, president, Mr. Kosmopoulos, vice-president; Mr. Kezios, secretary and Mr. Psiharis, treasurer. A true Greek dinner, which everyone enjoyed immensely was served. When all had dined, there were speeches and songs followed by dancing. Everyone took part in the dancing and went home well satisfied.</p>
   <p>This was truly a Greek gathering. We congratulate the Falanthos Brotherhood for the success of it.</p>
