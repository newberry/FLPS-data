<title level="a">CANDY COMPANY OF GALANIS BROTHERS SENDS LETTER TO SALONIKI</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Due to all sorts of rumors and stories that have been circulating about the candy company of the Galanis Brothers, we thought it best to ask the president of the company whether or not these rumors were true. This chocolate manufacturing company is without question the largest and finest of its kind in the Untied States.</p>
   <p>The letter which answers our question is printed below and denies the truth of the rumor.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir: For some time now, it has been rumored that the personnel of our company has been changed. It is said by some that a large manufacturing company has purchased our business; others say that we have been forced to close because of lack of business. "The above accusations are entirely false, and were made by rival concerns who tried to rob us of our customers by these false statements. And so, we answer your letter by saying that the company has <pb facs="5422062_3_0058.jpg" n="2"/>not changed hands nor will it do so. The entire stock of the company belongs to us and to no one else.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Galanis Brothers,</p>
   <p>D. Galanis, President</p>
