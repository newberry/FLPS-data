   <p>p. 4.- That Hellene of rare artistic ability, Constantine Pougialis, has been the recipient of a prize, his third, since 1925.</p>
   <p>This time he had chosen as his subject a painting titled "Two Girls" which represents two female figures, their backs to the observer, comprised of classical lineaments. It is indeed, a work of perfect symmetry, line and color! This meted him the Henry A. Frank award for 1933 at the exhibition of the All-Chicago artists held Thursday, Jan. 12th, at the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>It is noteworthy that Pougialis has been twice recognized as an artist of outstanding talent at two Chicago artists exhibits, and once highly commended as a dexterous wielder of brush and pallette at the All-American showing.</p>

   <p>In 1924 at the Chicago artists display, his painting titled, "Plaster Head" won for him the Marshall Fuller Holmes award and six years later, at the American Academy artists showing, Pougalis and a bit of "Still Life" met on canvas, and the William Randolph Hearst prize fell to him.</p>
   <p>To the Young Ladies Philomusical goes the especial honor of affording this ingenius man his debut in Chicago-Greek circles thru the medium of two receptions. The young ladies of the above society again extend their heartiest congratulations to Mr. Pougialis and wish him, "May his star of Destiny continue to soar!"</p>
