   <p>Several hundred people had a very enjoyable evening last Thursday. It was the evening Mrs. Ifis Tanagra Kopadi gave her lecture. A very select audience of Chicago Greeks were present at the Sherman Hotel to hear the lecture. It showed that the Greek people are partial to things intellectual which are not always a part of their daily life.</p>
   <p>The audience was composed mostly of women. The speaker was introduced by our well-known dentist, Dr. P. Chronopoulos. Mrs. Tanagra spoke on the position of Greek women in the history of civilization. Her talk, which lasted over an hour, took us thru Ancient Greece, Modern Greece and America. She related many anecdotes about Cretan, Spartan, and Athenian women. She ended her talk by praising the Greek women of America for upholding our native traditions and ideals. At the end of her speech everyone hastened to congratulate Mrs. Tanagra on her wonderfully instructive lecture and to invite her to come again.</p>
