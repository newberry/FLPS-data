   <p>p. 4.- Throughout last week, Miss Diplarakou, with her mother now visiting in Chicago, was the cause of many private and public gatherings and receptions. One of the best receptions was the one given by Dr. S. Soter at his home, last Thursday evening. Before the actual reception, dinner was served to more than ten guests.</p>
   <p>After the dinner the guests were transferred to the reception room where Dr. Soter presented Miss Diplarakou to everyone. The guests were personal friends of Dr. Soter. They were lawyers, doctors, artists, excutives of various companies and prominent members of Chicago's Greeks.</p>
   <p>To make the reception more colorful, Dr. Soter prepared an artistic program which was started by the Mrs. George Tzivia, American, who in faultless Greek, sang and played several popular Greek songs. Accompanied by Mr. Lyvedoti, violinist, she also played several classical pieces. Mrs. A. Zaf, wife of Dr. Zaf and an American, gave piano selections.</p>
