   <p>p. 1.- Time is growing near for the Chicago Jubilee that the Association of Commerce in Chicago is sponsoring. It is a form of celebration whereby the people of Chicago will tell the world that they have faith in the younger largest city of the world. And the Greeks are not excluded. A large float depicting the "Golden Age" of Byzantium is being arranged by Greeks.</p>
   <p>The money is being raised by popular subscription. The churches, the lodges, the various societies, are undertaking to raise some by selling tags in the form of a mosaic medallion. Others are contributing sums from $25 to $5. Do your bit.</p>
   <p>Aside from the float, the Greeks will participate in the Byzantine choir. And in case you are interested to hear some of their singing pay close attention to the announcements here. They are going on the air again.</p>

   <p>Geiger of the Chicago Evening American says: "Londos bids to indorse various products." Quoting Promoter Doc Krone, "Londos could make $50,000 on the side each year if he would allow the association of his name with advertising." Such is fame! But should Londos worry. Very soon he will be wrestling at Soldiers Field. And to think that he brought the game from an attendance of five hundred up to five figures and now six look plausible.</p>
   <p>Constantine Pougialis, the Greek artist from Chicago, is going to have an exhibition at the Art Institute very soon. Do not forget to attend the opening, providing you get an invitation. You know that such affairs are for the "elite."</p>
   <p>"The Greeks Had A Word For It," is in Chicago. A clever title to say the least. Anything Greek nowadays has good sales value. Look what happened with "Lysistrata" again, "On the Spot" Edgar Wallace's play about Chicago's gangdom is here offering good competition to all good shows. You see Wallace is the type of a person who visits Chicago, takes a fifteen minute taxi ride through Michigan Avenue, and then writes a <pb facs="5422062_3_0792.jpg" n="3"/>play about Capone and other prominent local figures. And believe me that is the way that "On the Spot" was written. And while we are talking about plays, etc., here is a bit of good news. Mr. Nick Economos, artist, scholar, and somewhat eccentric, has designed a set for "Theodora", Michalaro's play, that is simply a knockout.</p>
