   <p>Today, June 16, Loxias is starting its second year as a newspaper. We are telling the truth when we say that no other newspaper was as warmly received as Loxias. We have never written anything just to please rich and influential people. We have told the unbiased truth for rich and poor alike. Nobody has succeeded in leading us. We go our own way.</p>
   <p>We have tried our best to help the poor people, but to no avail; when you try to cover their feet from the cold, they grab the whole blanket. Neither are we women, to try to gain our aims with trickery and wiles. We are straight-forward and honest, and try to do our best, always writing against the bad and evil. We have tried not to make enemies, but we have plenty of them.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1166.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These enemies are men whose crooked schemes we have exposed to the public. These enemies make us feel that we are men and proud of it.</p>
   <p>All we ask is continued cooperation in the coming years and all will end well.</p>
