   <p>The activities of the "Ahepa" are very well known to the Greeks in America. The Chicago Greeks know the great assistance that orphans, needy families, and schools have received from the Ahepa, which will continue to assist the community in every possible way.</p>
   <p>It is also known that Ahepa has chapters of the Sons of Pericles, composed of Greek youths who were born here, and that Ahepa guides and conducts these chapters, promoting the perpetuation of our race, religion, and language.</p>
   <p>And in order to verify the progress of our guidance, these youths will play next Sunday a Greek operetta, the immortal "Skapanakia". This play was very successful and well appreciated in Greece.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0594.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is a play taken from Greek life, and written in the language of the masses. The performance of this play will undoubtedly convince the most skeptical ones that these boys, although born and raised here; nevertheless are scions of the immortal Greek race.</p>
   <p>The chapter Lord Byron will play this operetta at the Eighth Street Theatre, next Sunday, at 2:15 P. M.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Greek to witness this play for two reasons: first, to assist and encourage the new generative; second, to see for himself that the new generation in Chicago is just as much Greek as it is American.</p>
   <p>Geo. Kyriakopoulus</p>
   <p>Circuit Commander.</p>
