   <p>p.1.--The Rizioton Association held its annual picnic last Sunday in the forest preserve on Desplaines River.</p>
   <p>The crowd began to pour out there early in the morning, and it is estimated that more than fifteen hundred people enjoyed this pleasant outing, which was made more delightful by the excellent weather.</p>
   <p>The committee did not forget the little ones. Plenty of toys were bought for the youngsters, who really had a grand time at this picnic.</p>
   <p>The committee had provided a fine orchestra; so the guests danced until late at night, when they began to leave with very pleasant memories of the outing.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1668.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We should like to report the names of those present, but they were so numerous that we shall omit names and mention only that among the crowd were the Reverend Erenaeos Tsurunakis and Mr. Steve Saridakis, the president of the Cretans, and all the members of the Cretan board.</p>
   <p>The crowd was very much pleased with the service and conduct of the affair and thanked the officers, especially the president, E. Karayannes and the Marlas brothers and all the members of the Rizioton Association.</p>
