   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have finally realized that their greatest enemy is within their own midst. He is nothing more than an ignorant, uneducated, unenlightened publisher, a publisher who robs the pockets of the readers and contributes nothing educational or cultural. Many of the editors are using us as toys to gain their own aims and we willingly oblige.</p>
   <p>All editors are not like that. Eutaxias has been in the journalistic business in America for many years. Not once has he tried to harm Greek interests. He is always striving to do the best possible thing, even though it may mean a financial loss to him. He prints what is true and people should know, not what he believes will sell for him the most copies.</p>
   <p>We must get after these other editors who are causing so much havoc among us. They are ruining the chances of the Greek people to promote themselves commercially, educationally and culturally.</p>
