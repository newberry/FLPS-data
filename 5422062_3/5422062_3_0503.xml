   <p>One of the many dreams of the Greek people of Pullman was to build a church in this community. This dream began to become a reality late in 1928 when the building of St. Spyridon Church was begun. It was finished in the latter part of 1929. As there were many details to be taken care of in the completion of the church the idea of forming a church choir was not even thought of until the summer of 1931.</p>
   <p>In July 1931 the church choir was organized under the leadership of Mr. George Gretsis, a noted violinist. The choir consisted of twenty six members, eight men and eighteen girls. Miss Olga Massias was elected as organist for the choir. The members of the choir were divided into four groups, soprano, alto, bass and tenor, according to the range of their voices. Practice was held once a week. The choir made its first public appearance on St. Spyridon's Day, December 13, 1931, and since then has sung at practically all church services.</p>

   <p>Since its inception the choir has sponsored two dances, the proceeds of which were turned entirely over to the church, except for the amount used to pay for the organ which was bought by the choir and turned over to the church.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Gretsis, our director, left in the spring of 1932 and after a few more changes in the personnel, at present the choir is under the leadership of Mr. Andrew Petropulos.</p>
