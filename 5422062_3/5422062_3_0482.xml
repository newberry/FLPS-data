   <p>Greece, that cradle of civilization which has wielded a greater influence over the course of history than any other nation, found all her glory and her greatness echoed last night at the Aragon Ballroom. There Chicago's Greek-Americans gathered for their charity ball in the "Carnival of Nations". And it was a ball to be remembered.</p>
   <p>Greeks were the first to show the world what real civilization was; and civilization in its most comprehensive meaning flowered at this festival. Beautiful girls, beautiful music, beautiful entertainment, a beautiful setting--and with this, all the charm, grace, and culture of a people who have understood all there has been to understand about art, science, literature, and politics for three thousand years.</p>
   <p>Four thousand is a figure which does not begin to record the number of those who attended this Greek charity dance. More than that number had arrived by midnight, and they were still coming. Everyone enjoyed the occasion, even <pb facs="5422062_3_0483.jpg" n="2"/>Paul Demos, the chairman.</p>
   <p>The Greek and American national anthems introduced the entertainment program at eleven o'clock, and Mr. Demos greeted the Greek committee's guests. Then Nicholas A. Christy took over the job of master of ceremonies, and what he said was heartily applauded by the audience.....</p>
   <p>The first stars introduced were Mario and Floria, the handsome young dance team from the Chez Paree. Mario, an Athenian, was received with great applause, and he and his lovely partner responded with two enchanting and spectacular dances.</p>
   <p>Bertha Floros then sang two well-known Greek songs and received a well-deserved ovation. Then Elias Nicholas and Athens Boussios led a group in the Greek national dance. Young Mr. Nichols in his Greek costume had all the assurance of a seasoned professional. A high spot of the evening came with the dances <pb facs="5422062_3_0484.jpg" n="3"/>of Miss Demetra Argyris and her sister, Agle. Before a semicircle of maidens in Greek costumes, the former interpreted "Anoixis" (spring); and the latter, "Theros" (fall). Mark Mamalakis led a Cretan dance of men and maids from Crete. It was both amusing and delightful.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demos had scores of beautiful young women working hard to put the Greek ball over in a big way, and they worked right up until the last patron entered: the ballroom. One could not get by them without buying a flower. In this and in many other ways a large sum was made available for Greek charity. Each one of those girls deserves a column of credit; but they will receive the only credit which really counts--the gratitude of the unfortunates of their own nationality whom their efforts will aid during the winter.</p>
