  <body>
   <p>The memory of yesterday, the actuality of today, and the promise of tomorrow, will elbow each other with rivaling brilliance and interest on today's programs at A Century of Progress.</p>
   <p>The present provides a double-barreled volley of attractions - Perry's Victory Memorial day and Greek day - with the past being recalled by the former.</p>
   <p>Displays at the fair, of course, provides a glimpse of what may be expected in the future.</p>
   <p>Charalambos Simopoulos, Greek minister to the United States, who will be guest of honor on the Greek program visited the fair yesterday.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0745.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Greek day, today, one of the most important of the many foreign days at the exposition, will be celebrated at the court of the Hall of Science with a program beginning at 2:30 P.M., starting with the playing of "The Star Spangled Banner," by an orchestra directed by Gulielmos Sommas.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos, chairman of the Greek section of the world's fair committee on nationalities will deliver the introductory address. The chief speech will be made by Minister Simopoulos, while prayers will be offered by Most Rev. Callistos, bishop of the Greek Orthodox church of North and South America, who will be assisted by fifteen local priests.</p>
   <p>Vocal music will be furnished by the Greek Choral Society of Chicago, which - after eight months of practise for this occasion, three times a week - will make its first outdoor public appearance.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0746.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The 100 harmonious voices of the choral group will render the Greek national anthem and other songs including "Lord, Save Your People," a Byzantine hymn composed in 628 A.D. on the occasion of the recovery of the cross from the Persians by Emperor Heracleus of Constantinople; "Ti Ypermaho Starigo," another early Byzantine religious hymn, and "The Wreck of the Hesperus," Longfellow's poem translated into Greek by Demos and Maestro Sommas and set to music by Hanish Mac Cunn.</p>
   <p>Twenty-four dancers, all of them originally from the Isle of Crete, but here from their adopted homes in different parts of the United States, will perform classical Greek dances among which will be the Dance of the Zalogons performed by the women of Souli, Greece, who climaxed it with jumping into the river rather than be hostages to the Turks during the Greek struggle for freedom.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0747.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Gov. Horner is also scheduled to speak. The program will be pervaded by a devoutly religious atmosphere, and this feeling will be enhanced by the solemn strains of vocal and instrumental music, and the presence of the bishop, who will conduct the first public mass of the Greek Orthodox church in this country. Mr. Demos has estimated that 100,000 Greek-Americans from all parts of the United States will attend the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Minister Simopoulos' arrival yesterday was the occasion for official pomp and welcome. When he entered the Court of Honor gates at 14th St., he was greeted by a military detachment from Camp Whistler and a military salute of fifteen guns. After being received by Rufus C. Dawes of the fair, he was escorted about the grounds, and later in the afternoon he was tendered a reception at the Illinois Host House.</p>
