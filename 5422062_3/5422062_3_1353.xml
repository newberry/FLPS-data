   <p>Due to the untiring zeal and efforts of the chairman of the Educational Committee of Ahepa, Doctor Minas Ioannides of Chapter 46, a series of sociological educational lectures are being given. They will take place at 32 West Randolph Street. The most capable speakers have been called upon to tell those interested in social service what they know about the subject. What it means, how it functions, and what facilities are used or needed in its prosecution--these are some of the points which will be discussed.</p>
   <p>The first lecture was given last Tuesday, February 6. It was well attended by both Greeks and Americans. The speakers were Miss Elizabeth Webster, director of the Council of Social Agencies of Chicago; and James Nicholson, director of the Chicago Red Cross Chapter. "Pooling together for Social Service," and "Helping People out of Trouble," were the subjects discussed.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1354.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The next lecture on the topic, "Public Relief in Cook County," to be given by Mrs. Clara Ruth Paige, will take place on February 20, at the same place.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the Greek community of Chicago will not overlook the importance of this series of lectures.</p>
