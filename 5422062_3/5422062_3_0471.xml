   <p>No doubt those who attended the performance of "Richelieu" given at the Auditorium Theater by the Young Men's Christian Association, 153 La Salle Street, last Saturday, must have gotten a real treat. The Greek Community of Chicago had the rare opportunity of seeing and hearing one of the most famous contemporary European stage actors in one of his most dynamic performances. In the role of "Richelieu," France's famous Cardinal and statesman of the sixteenth century, Mr. Lekatsas revived a great historical figure with a showing of unequaled dramatic power. He was ably assisted by the talented Greek actresses, the Misses Palamaris, and several young men of our Community.</p>
   <p>The Chicago debut of Mr. Lekatsas was a real treat for Greek lovers of the theater and of the arts. All of us are indeed proud of this son of Hellas who has been acclaimed both in the capitals of Europe and in the major cities of the United States as a first-rate actor.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0472.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We hope that his appearance in Chicago has stimulated our youth to organize drama classes and participate in dramas, plays, operettas, etc., for their own benefit and for that of the appreciative Greek Community of Chicago.</p>
