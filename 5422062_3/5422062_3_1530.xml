   <p>The games began at 10 A. M. The championship game, which was played in the evening, attracted a large number of sport fans and people, who came to admire and encourage the Greek youths. Among the players who distinguished themselves were Christ Varellas of the Centaurs, Sam Sotos of Ipsilanti, E. Elliot of St. Andrew, N. Danakas of Crane, and....</p>
   <p>The Centaurs and Ipsilanti were the contenders in the championship game. After a valiant struggle, the Centaurs won by a score of 21 to 16.</p>
   <p>The cups were awarded to an accompaniment of vigorous applause. The trophy <pb facs="5422062_3_1531.jpg" n="2"/>given to the winning Centaurs was presented by Londos [the famous westler]. The Chicago Pie Company donated the second trophy, which was awarded to the Ipsilanti team and the St. Andrews Church team received the third-place trophy, which was contributed by the Deligiannis concern.</p>
