   <p>The formation of a Greek business organization has been discussed many many times. I am very disappointed to see that no definite steps have been taken in this direction, as yet. Neither the journalists nor the businessmen have interested themselves in this matter, despite the fact that it is of tremendous social importance. At least, the cultured and the educated Greeks of America should recognize the value of such an organization.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the Greeks in America labor under the delusion that they know everything that there is to know. I realize I have overstepped my proper place by writing this article. The only reason for my action is that I am trying to compensate for the indifference of individuals who are supposed to be interested in the social and economic progress of our race in this fine country.</p>
   <p>I will make no attempt to explain financial methods since I am not a businessman. This is only an attempt to point out the countless gains to be derived <pb facs="5422062_3_0190.jpg" n="2"/>from unification and co-operation.</p>
   <p>Many people have the impression that the Greek businessmen in America are successful and are progressing. But, how can a group progress when it ignores the very weapons that are essential to progress and security? It would be the same as if a charlatan, who poses as a medical man, were to have hopes of becoming internationally famous as a doctor. And, yet, Greek people blindly follow the leadership of even such quacks, and become like them in thoughts and actions. This is an unfortunate reflection on the Greek mind, but it is a true one.</p>
   <p>Again I say, the American Greek has not prospered in business. He refuses to acknowledge the very rudiments of good business. He does not co-operate and he is not systematic. His capital is small and he has no power. If you tell the Greeks to form a chamber of commerce or a corporation, they question the benefit of such an organization. In this article I hope to clarify some of the benefits to be derived by co-operation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0191.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In order to form such an organization all members must contribute or invest a set amount of money; in order that there be a large working capital.</p>
   <p>An American does not enter any business that he is unfamiliar with. On the other hand, the Greek, who has sold fruit all his life, thinks nothing of opening a restaurant or a laundry. The American opens a small store and awaits to see if it is successful before making any effort to enlarge it. The Greek spends every cent he has saved and borrowed, so that he can start out with a big bang. Usually, he works like a slave the rest of his life to pay for that mistake.</p>
   <p>The American has a systematic routine, he has regular store hours, and he conserves his financial resources; while the Greek stays open night and day and ends up in a sanitarium.</p>
   <p>The employees of Greek stores have no regular hours and no holidays like the employees of other stores. American men form companies for protection and <pb facs="5422062_3_0192.jpg" n="4"/>for power. Very few Greek partnerships are successful or permanent. Americans pay their bills by checks, and thereby save a great deal of time and effort; while the Greek leaves his store and runs from place to place to pay debts.</p>
   <p>Now! are the Greeks still under the impression that they are successful? Well, all, as yet, is not hopeless. A business organization will educate and guide the Greek businessmen. It will teach them efficiency and correct business methods. It will keep them informed of commercial trends and mechanical progress that could affect the success of their businesses. And the most important part is that such a union would awaken the interest of our young men. We need organization if we want future recognition.</p>
   <p>Such an organization can also be known as a gesture of patriotism. For, if we are successful, the American people will have more esteem for the Greek people and the Greek race. Such a step will more firmly entrench us in this,our adopted land. Our children and wives will benefit and our labors will not be in vain.</p>
