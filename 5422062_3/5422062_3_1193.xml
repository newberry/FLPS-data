   <p>We wish to call the attention of our readers to the howlings and hateful remarks which are being made by the despicable characters on the staff of a so-called newspaper by the name of Hellas. These people shamelessly continue to bark and to make themselves ridiculous without achieving any important result.</p>
   <p>All those connected with The Star will continue to despise and ignore these ridiculous individuals. We cannot help doing so as long as they continue in the mire of pettiness and crudeness. Who can fail to see that the publishers and editors of our unworthy colleague, Hellas, are afflicted with many ills? Their physical, spiritual, and social degradation is evident to all.</p>
   <p>Our best answer to their violent campaign of accusations against us is the enlargement of The Star to a ten-page weekly issue. This proves that the public, the Greek people of Chicago, have favored and supported us to the limit, whereas they have condemned Hellas as a backward, insignificant, and trashy newspaper.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1194.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That sheets smells so much that no one can doubt that it has its origin in the stable where the editors write their diatribes.</p>
   <p>Any further comment is useless, for he who has ears can hear and he who has eyes can see.</p>
