   <p>p. 1-Thus ended another dramatic triumph for the Chicago Greeks. Nick Monemuasites (Manos) ran off with all the honors from "Esme". This proves, after all, that whenever anybody acts natural he is always good. Nick was natural in spite of many disadvantages that confronted him.</p>
   <p>The Eighth Street Theater was packed. When these Ahepans from the North Shore get it in their heads to put an affair over big, then watch their dust. Five months' preparation for one evening! That is ambition, believe it or not!</p>
   <p>At the "Miss Europe Ball" everything went well until a certain Greek lady, whose name escapes my mind at present, started to "spill the beans", as the American would say, "I have heard bad speakers, but ---".</p>

   <p>Editor Kotakis does not have to do anything more for the rest of his life. Whenever the Walking Academy meets he has all the right in the world to insist that he be chairman. Reason: He escorted Miss Diplarakou around the ballroom last Monday.</p>
   <p>Jim Londos, the Greek wrestling champion of the world, is going to meet Antonio Romano next Monday night at the Broadway Armory. Hope there are no necks broken. "When Italians and Greeks get together it is not always fair weather," states an old Greek proverb.</p>
   <p>The ladies from St. Andrews tried to give Miss Diplarakou a run for her money. Yet that silver cloth chiton dominated the whole ballroom, in spite of the expensive gowns worn by our North Shore aristocracy.</p>
   <p>The West Side Girls are giving their annual dance at the Crystal Ballroom of the Blackstone.</p>
