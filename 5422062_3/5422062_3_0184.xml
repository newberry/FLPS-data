   <p>On the fourth page of Saloniki there appears a full page advertisement of the firm owned by Mr. Savas Bouris. It is the finist Greek firm of its kind in America. It manufactures all types of restaurant and confectionary fixtures and supplies. A full line of wedding and baptismal paraphernalia is also carried.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bouris has been engaged in this business for the past twenty-five years. Previously, for twelve years he had a well-established business in Egypt. He came to America because the opportunities for success were greater. Now he is the proud owner of a fine and modern manufacturing plant. He is aided in its management by his capable wife.</p>
   <p>All the machinery is run by electricity, and the work is done systematically and carefully, so as to insure perfection in the finished article.</p>

   <p>Saloniki is very proud of the progress made by Mr. Bouris.</p>
