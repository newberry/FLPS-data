   <p>Saloniki desires to devote this space to a review of its relationship to the progress and success of the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Saloniki is duty bound to print its opinions of the duties and rights of Greek communities in America. We feel this duty because, as the leading Greek weekly newspaper in America, we have done much to influence Greek-Americans. A sincere effort has been made to keep Saloniki as bright and as inspiring to the Greeks in America as Thessaloniki is to the rest of Greece.</p>
   <p>Saloniki has preserved its dignity in order to be worthy of the name it bears. For that reason, we have not printed slanderous or malicious articles against any individual or group. Whenever a personal or individual problem has arisen, it has been dealt with tactfully but effectively. We have not and do not resort to cheap and degrading levels of journalism in order to attain our goal.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1123.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Saloniki belongs to its readers: to Greeks all over America who are far from their homeland, and who await the arrival of the paper so that they may read about their country and the activities of other Greeks in America. They do not care to read about scandals or rivalries that only serve to keep the Greeks disunited.</p>
   <p>This paper recognizes its duties, and by doing so has earned the trust and respect of Greek-Americans. Chicago Greeks especially appreciate our efforts to live up to our glorious namesake.</p>
   <p>We strive to help our homeland by supporting every patriotic program and by devoting our editorial space to its defense. We appeal for the understanding of the American people through the English articles of our well-known contributor, Mr. Thomas Hutchison. He exposes the treacherous intentions of the Bulgarians and fights their propaganda.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago recommend Saloniki to all American business concerns, which, <pb facs="5422062_3_1124.jpg" n="3"/>as a result, use Saloniki as an advertising medium in preference to any other Greek paper.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago support Saloniki.... it is their duty, and it is to their advantage, to do so.....</p>
   <p>The editors of this paper thank the supporters of Saloniki, and promise to continue the fight for the progress and success of Greek-Americans.</p>
