   <p>The Byzantine Ensemble augmented double in size will provide the principal singing. Marion Schroeder Booras said:</p>
   <p>"Greek Day, depicting 'A Day in Athens---the Paris of the Balkans,' will remain in the memory of the local Greeks and Americans for it will reveal the beauty of ancient, Byzantine and Modern Greece."</p>
   <p>Songs from all the three periods will be heard and sung with exceptional charm and beauty. The singers will be costumed in the traditional costumes of the ancient Greeks Byzantines and modern foustanella.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tsoukalas is arranging a special number for the evening consisting of fifty beautiful Classic dancers. Aside from that there will be solo renditions of dances of all nations depicted accurately and showing the evolution of dance from Classical days to the present.</p>

   <p>According to Nick Matsoukas there will be two big surprises in store for every one attending the Greek Day at the Horticultural building. But what they are is not revealed as yet. But one thing he wishes to stress is that on Wednesday night June 28th. Greeks of Chicago will be taken back to Athens for the evening.</p>
   <p>Amidst the beauty of five acres of beautiful gardens a fresh lake breeze and the beauty of the entertainment all of the Hellenes will feel that they are spending their day at Faliron.</p>
