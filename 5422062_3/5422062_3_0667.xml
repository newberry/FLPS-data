   <p>At last our community has been blessed by the presence of a really competent dramatic group. A truly artistic performance was given last Sunday by artists who are worthy of the name. All who saw the performance of "Genovefa" were filled with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The acting was excellent throughout the entire play. The actors....made their parts live. Mrs. A. Stamatogianis as "Genovefa," we dare say, surpassed everyone's expectations. She played the other two female roles as well as that of the heroine, and each role was a fine example of artistry.</p>
   <p>We are prepared to accept this dramatic group and support it, since it has proven itself to be the finest of our community. The Greeks of Chicago number 40,000, and they must acquire a permanent dramatic group....</p>

   <p>We give special congratulations to the producer, Mr. Metropoulos, because he is the first to put on a truly fine work, and have that work interpreted correctly. Mr. G. Kambas and his wife added much to everyone's pleasure with their fine music.</p>
