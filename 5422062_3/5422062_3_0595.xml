   <p>p. 2- For the second time the members of Lord Byron lodge of The Sons of Pericles, children of Greek parents born in America, will appear at the Eighth Street Theater, trying to prove to the Greek Thomases that by systematic effort this new generation of ours will succeed in preserving and loving the immortal Greek language and every Greek ideal.</p>
   <p>Members of the dramatic group of Lord Byron lodge, having been trained for seven months with the noble cooperation of three members of their brother lodge Pindar and also that of Misses Helen Koumounge, B. Roinioti, and Maria Rapti will present on the stage the military farce "Athanata Skapanakia" with ten selected songs. They will hand you hearty laughs for two hours and a half, and there not only will you see your children handle the Greek language efficiently, but you will also see them transformed into first class Zacynthians and Athenians.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0596.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The play will be presented at 2:30 P.M. In the evening of the same day, in the hall of Solon School of St. James Church, a dance will be held in honor of the young men and women taking part in the play. Admission is free for those having tickets to the theater.</p>
   <p>It is the imperative duty of all, and especially of the Ahepans, to be present at this affair to give material and moral support to our new generation of the Sons of Pericles, and to encourage them in their efforts to learn the Greek language.</p>
