   <p>p. 1.- The Professional Men's Club has arranged for a lecture to be given by Mrs. Sikelianos on December 27th at the Hotel Sherman.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Sikelianos, who is an American by birth, has spent the last 20 years in Greece, with her poet husband, studying ancient tragedies, and she presented, last summer (in Delphi, Greece), Prometheus Baund. Mrs. Sikelianos told the editor of the Democrat that she is preparing, with her husband, another great tragedy to be given at the same place during the summer of 1929.</p>
   <p>At this lecture she will exhibit costumes that were worn by the actors and actresses who took part in the presentation of Prometheus. She will also exhibit various articles of Greek handicraft, work of Greek women. She wishes to introduce the American people in the ideas and civilization of Greece. It will be of interest to all those who are lovers of art to attend her lecture.</p>
