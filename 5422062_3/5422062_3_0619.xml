   <p>We have greeted the arrival of the distinguished Greek artist, Mrs. Marika Kotopouli, in America, and we characterized it as an event of the greatest significance for the Greek Theater because in the person of Marika Kotopouli and in her troupe we show what is best and most perfect on the Greek stage. But besides the artistic side of it, Marika Kotopouli has come to America to present, not only to our fellow-countrymen but also to the American public, the Greek Theater. And when we say "Greek Theater" we do not mean simply a Greek troupe, no matter how great its leading lady may be, and how well the members play their parts - what we mean is primarily Greek repertoire, the Greek plays that will be presented on the stage.</p>
   <p>We surely do not mean by this that the prominent artist should not produce foreign plays and should not exhibit her art in foreign rules, nor do we imagine that she should limit herself to the Greek repertoire, for we know that it is not sufficient either in quantity or in quality. It is indisputable, however, that we have a number of Greek plays which are considered select productions, and which have been played successfully in a long series of presentations.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0620.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We cannot, therefore, understand how it is possible for a great Greek actress, coming to America with her troupe with the exclusive purpose in view of demonstrating to the Greek and the American public the Greek Theater, to begin with the play "Shadow" of Nickodemy.</p>
   <p>But even if we supposed for a moment that there is no Greek play through which Mrs. Kotopouli could demonstrate her art so much as in "Shadow," could not she resort, at least, to the ancient tragedy, the more so since she is known as a great Greek tragedienne and was advertised as such to the American public? All the more so since it was originally decided to begin with the "Oresteia," which was postponed by a later decision for technical reasons.</p>
   <p>We do not know what these technical obstacles are, but in any case we consider the idea of beginning Mrs. Kotopouli's presentation with a foreign play as very unfortunate, and we consider it our duty to remind Mrs. Kotopouli's troupe that their arrival in America means a demonstration of the Greek Theater as much to the Greeks as to the Americans, and also that we consider the coming to America of our great artist with her troupe as a national mission.</p>
