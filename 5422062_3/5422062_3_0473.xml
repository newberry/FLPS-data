   <p>How can we maintain the Greek spirit and also become true Americans? Is Americanism a foe of Hellenism and vice versa? These are questions of paramount importance.</p>
   <p>Is it possible and feasible for a Greek to be a one-hundred-per-cent American while he has Hellenic tendencies and inclinations? To those who possess intelligence and are free from fanaticism the answer is clear as crystal, and the answer is affirmative. Yes! It is possible and feasible. Since brevity is the soul of wit, I shall be brief in my statement, which is addressed to intelligent people, and with Laconic boldness of utterance I affirm that Americanism includes all that is good and just. And if Hellenism is what the philosophers, the poets, and all the civilized world declare it to be, then Hellenism is included and embodied in the <pb facs="5422062_3_0474.jpg" n="2"/>lofty spirit of Americanism.</p>
   <p>The founders of this nation, which has no equal in greatness, were men of many nationalities, but their spirit and their hearts were the best in the world. They were the far-advanced minds of humankind, who shed their blood to establish a new nation--something which the world had never seen, a nation founded in liberty, justice, and equality. Is there anything greater in the world than these three divine principles? Athens, in its day the greatest community in all the world, planted the seeds of liberty, justice, and equality which to-day have matured as fruitful trees, deeply rooted in this grand domain of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Americanism and its divine destiny are misunderstood by many who still wear the colored glasses of narrow nationalism and pseudo-civilization. Among these are included not only people of the new stock but unfortunately many of the older stock who have not digested the real essence of these <pb facs="5422062_3_0475.jpg" n="3"/>three divine principles--liberty, justice, and equality.</p>
   <p>Many people confuse Americanism with the domain of the American state. The latter is bounded and finite, but Americanism is infinite and embraces all the goodness and the justice in the world. And precisely in this inclusiveness Americanism is supreme, for it takes in even the so-called barbarians who were excluded by the ancient Greek axiom, "He who is not a Greek is a barbarian."</p>
   <p>Greeks and barbarians, Christians and infidels, all that exists in all the world, good or evil, when it is permeated by true Americanism, is absorbed as liquid is absorbed by a sponge; strange elements are drawn into one indivisible body; there are many orifices which represent their numerous nationalities and traditions, but they are all nevertheless nourished by the same substance and invested in it.</p>
   <p>A Greek can become American and still maintain his Hellenism. By becoming <pb facs="5422062_3_0476.jpg" n="4"/>American I do not mean merely acquiring the right to vote in American elections. To become American is to absorb as the substance of one's being the lofty spirit of true Americanism. If and when this is done, the Greek's adherence to Hellenism will not conflict with his Americanism.</p>
   <p>Freedom of religion and of speech, political and intellectual liberty, individual initiative, and mutual tolerance, which are the spiritual products of whole epochs of man's upward struggle, are found embodied in Americanism.</p>
   <p>History, the guiding mirror of the future, tells us that the Greek heart and soul are thoroughly imbued with patriotism, which is the foundation and the strength of a nation. Possessing patriotism, the Greek is better equipped to become truly American than some of his fellows. Undoubtedly, as we have stated, the Greek, fortified with patriotism excelled by none, will become one of the best elements of American citizenry, if not the <pb facs="5422062_3_0477.jpg" n="5"/>very best. Yet the object of this article is not to prove this but to show how we may maintain our Hellenism and our individual Greek spirit which age after age has continued its upward climb toward perfection.</p>
   <p>The Greek religion, the Greek language and Greek traditions have in the past saved our race from extinction. These three bulwarks are what may save the Greek of America from losing his identity in this fast-absorbing environment. But Greek traditions in this country are gradually diminishing in force, and a new factor must be found to collaborate with the Greek church and the Greek school in order to keep the national fire burning for our new generation. This new factor is the Greek theater in America. That is, the Greek church, the Greek school, and the Greek theater must exist in every Greek colony in America.</p>
   <p>The Greek theater in America must at once come to life and have flesh and blood and bones as the church and the school have. The scenes enacted on <pb facs="5422062_3_0478.jpg" n="6"/>the Greek stage will stimulate the pride of our young Greeks and make them hold their heads high as sons of that Greece whose heroes are glorified by the whole world.</p>
   <p>The dramatic representation of heroic deeds has a psychological effect. Human beings love and admire greatness. The more you see and possess of greatness, the more you desire to have of it. And our American-born youths in their plastic age will absorb more greatness when they see their progenitors glorified on the Greek stage. Genealogy and ethnology are potent factors in man's evolution; therefore the Greek theater will have a plastic influence and impress the mold of greatness upon our youths. Human nature is not like one of the perfect and unequalled statues of the Greek masters, which require no oil or fire to maintain their power of beauty; on the contrary, the fire of the human spirit must be continually replenished with fuel if it is to be maintained against the force of adverse currents.</p>
   <p>The Greek church, the Greek school, and the Greek theater in America must <pb facs="5422062_3_0479.jpg" n="7"/>unite to form a triarchy which shall mold and govern, within the American system, the new Greece of America.</p>
   <p>In order to accomplish the union of this triad and to achieve the object desired, the administrators and the ministers of these institutions must be chosen not from the old world but from the Greeks of America, and if they cannot be found here now we must patiently and tenderly cultivate them among us. These three institutions must be served by American Greeks who know instinctively the needs of their fellows and the proper procedure to follow in order to satisfy those needs. They know what American ideals are, and what America really stands for; thus they are better qualified to serve us than our fellow Greeks from the old country, who may be good, honest and sincere in the performance of their duties, but who still are strangers to American psychology.</p>
   <p>The Greek theater in America will play an important role in instilling the Greek spirit in the souls and the minds of our youths who are born in <pb facs="5422062_3_0480.jpg" n="8"/>America, and it is the duty of the church to provide for the establishment of a theater as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>In our analysis we have conclusively proved that Hellenism does not conflict with Americanism; therefore a Greek in becoming a true American can still retain the priceless treasure of the Greek spirit, which has lighted the world in centuries past. Liberal-minded people--scientists, psychologists, and true Christians--know that whatever we have today of goodness and justice is the crystallized essence of the Greek spirit, which here in America, where the human mind is more highly developed and has a broader horizon than elsewhere, has found a fertile field in which to propagate its glorious fruit. This great and fertile field of the United States is not homogeneous but heterogeneous as the cosmos is.</p>
   <p>So, in conclusion, Americanism today is the blazing sun of the firmament, irradiating and nourishing mankind in its struggle upward. In years to come, in another era, Americanism will take on a crystallized form, as <pb facs="5422062_3_0481.jpg" n="9"/>Hellenism has done, and upon that crystallized Americanism the hmanity of that period will build something higher to serve it in its upward climb.</p>
   <p>People who love and esteem the good and the just will do a service to mankind and to themselves if they permit Americanism to be their guide. Greeks and others who become true Americans render a great service to an ignorant world.</p>
