   <p>The Greek champion, Jim Londos, has been training in Chicago for the last few days in preparation for his match with Jim McMillen, former Illinois football star, to be held at Soldiers' Field on Labor Day.</p>
   <p>According to Ed White, his manager, Londos has been perfecting his new lock, the sensational hold that has wrestlers in a turmoil. It is an adaptation of the "strangle hold," but Londos claims that it violates no wrestling rules and he is willing to demonstrate the famous hold before members of the Illinois Athletic Commission.</p>
   <p>McMillen, who has also been training in Chicago, is confident that at last he will catch up with his nemesis. He believes that his superior strength will carry him to victory by two out of three falls.</p>
   <p>Included in the supporting matches will be once between George Calza, Italian, and John Maxos, Greek.</p>
