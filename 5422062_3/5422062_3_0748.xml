<title level="a">CONFERENCE IN PREPARATION FOR GREEK DAY AT THE WORLD'S FAIR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Mr. Apostolos Demos, alias Paul Demos, lawyer and chairman of the committee for the celebration of Greek Day at the World's Fair, sent invitations to all Greek organizations in Chicago to appoint representatives to attend last week's conference in the Sherman Hotel for the purpose of planning the best possible celebration of Greek Day at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Although seventy-five invitations or more were sent to the parishes, clubs, and other Greek organizations in Chicago, only eight were represented.</p>
   <p>Among those in attendance were Mrs. Virginia P. Latsis, Mrs. Geo. Dedakis, John Agriostathes, George Grechis, Dem. Nikolopoulos, Markos Mamalakis, James Poulakis, and Dr. Theodore.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0749.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After waiting more than an hour to open the meeting, a regular Greek custom, the chairman tired the small audience by a long talk explaining the services rendered by the committee in the preparation of the program, and announcing its decision to go through with its plans whether the Greek organizations assist it or not. To the question of whether the Greek organizations had been consulted in the preparation of the program, the chairman answered in the negative and went on to express his confidence that the affair would be a success whether the Greek organizations supported it or not because more than a hundred thousand people visit the Fair every day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Poulakis took the floor and expressed his surprise to see so few representatives of organizations present. He made a motion to hold a second conference to which representatives should be invited by all the officials and <pb facs="5422062_3_0750.jpg" n="3"/>not by a personal communication from Mr. Demos, concerning whom a rumor has been circulated that he is exploiting the affair.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos paid no attention to these remarks, apparently accustomed to such comments, and gave the floor to Dr. Theodore, who in a torrent of verbiage, a speech full of defiance and self-adulation, insulted those who asked explanations and called them unreasonable to question the committee's integrity when they had not contributed a penny. He referred to the usual list of contributors who are always taxed for such purposes and are always ready and willing to make sacrifices, while the others (he threw this in the faces of those present) have the impudence to question their knowledge, their interest, their authority, and their intentions! And the raving doctor continued (for he also is a member of the committee) in self praise and boasting of the achievements of this committee which ignorant people have the audacity to criticize!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0751.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Poulakis protested against the doctor's attacks, but the infuriated physician went on raving in his foolish egotism, recounting the virtues of the committee and the achievements of Mr. Demos, whom people dared to accuse of being an exploiter!</p>
   <p>Mr. Mamalakis made some remarks against persons who have circulated rumors about the intentions of Mr. Demos and said that this affair is of interest to the whole Greek community, which must present something of interest on Greek Day at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Somebody else took the floor and said that he was astonished that certain criticisms offered with good intentions had been misinterpreted by the members of the committee as personal attacks, and that this had given rise to misunderstandings. He also expressed his opinion that the chairman and <pb facs="5422062_3_0752.jpg" n="5"/>his committee have no pre-eminence in wisdom and no monopoly in patriotism in matters concerning the whole Greek community and Greeks in general, and he called attention to the fact that to instruct those who are to render the Greek music at this affair, a person who is not a Greek had been appointed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demos replied that they had done what Greece has done in organizing various departments of its government, that is, they had hired a foreigner, and that they had done so because there were no Greeks well equipped for the position.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Grechis, a Greek musician very well known for his ability, remarked that Greece had hired German and French organizers in its army as instructors in modern methods of warfare and other technical points, but that the subject of Greek music is different. People are mistaken, said he, if they think that</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0753.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>There are no suitable Greek musicians available, and he referred to the choir directed by Mr. Athanassopoulos and himself, which can represent genuine Greek songs and aesthetic Greek dances as good as those taught by foreigners or better.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. John Agriostathes arose and after joking about the profits which Mr. Paul Demos will derive from the affair and about his troubles made a motion to hold a new conference and to send new invitations to all Greek organizations, explaining to them in a convincing manner that it is the duty of Hellenism to work for the success of this affair, the Greek Day, as other nationalities have done.</p>
   <p>This motion was adopted, and the day set was next Wednesday, August 9.</p>
