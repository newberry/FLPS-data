<title level="a">THE LECTURE OF PROFESSOR SEBASTIA N. KALISPERIS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>As was announced last week, a lecture was given by Miss Sebastia N. Kalisperis at Hull House under the auspices of the Greek Women's Club. The subject of the lecture was "The Greek Mother and Greece". More than a thousand Greeks, most of whom were mothers, attended this very interesting and brilliant lecture. Miss Kalisperis is Superintendent of Secondary Schools for Girls in Athens. She is highly educated, and is an outstanding authority on Greek education and pedagogical problems.</p>
   <p>We are sorry that lack of space prevents us from publishing the complete text of her very instructing and very useful lecture. However, we are happy to learn that her motherly advice and remarks have found a ready response in the hearts of the audience, from whose mouths her message will be carried to our entire community.</p>
   <p>Looking at the speech of our young educator from a general standpoint, we <pb facs="5422062_3_1493.jpg" n="2"/>find that hers was an original lecture for two reasons: first, because she was the first Greek woman to deliver a lecture in Chicago before a huge Greek audience; second, because she displayed great ability and brilliance in her treatment of the subject in all its phases. She outlined the true state of affairs in the field of education in its relation to the child and the Greek home.</p>
   <p>This worthy servant of the Greek state and outstanding representative of Greek womanhood eloquently declared, from the flag-draped speaker's stand at Hull House, that our future greatness lies in our own hands; that our progress and national development depend on the work which is done by Greek motherhood and womanhood, these foundation stones of our national existence.</p>
   <p>"Our women and mothers," she said, "must purify the soul of our young ones; they must expel all evil, and instill the sentiment and ideal of love for God and for all men. This is the beginning and the foundation upon which the highest qualities of virtue and duty rest."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1494.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Then she examined the various educational systems in Greece, remarking, to everyone's great sorrow, that there is an acute shortage of teachers, that we lack suitable school buildings, sufficient equipment, and able teachers thoroughly and scientifically trained to mould the mind and character of the young. Because of these deficiencies, our Greek clergy and the members and leaders of our judiciary, our military, and our professional class do not possess high qualities and virtues. Furthermore, she observed that, worst of all, no effort has been made to provide suitable girls' schools in which young Greek women can be properly trained. Is it not through our Greek women that strong, and upright citizens will emerge with all the high moral and intellectual qualities necessary to serve society and the state in the best manner? Such men, she said, when provided with the proper Greek education,will assure the nation's future, and they will become the army and navy of the nation. But first and foremost, the education and training of the citizen must begin at home, in the family. The home will be a hindrance and a liability to the state if the child does not receive the proper guidance, and if the parents are so poorly equipped intellectually <pb facs="5422062_3_1495.jpg" n="4"/>and morally they are unable to train and bring up their children and prepare them for a useful and happy life.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, this distinguished Greek woman addressed an appeal to the Greek women of Chicago. She reminded them of their duty to their children, and urged them and their husbands to establish, a well-organized and fully-equipped Greek school, where the Greek boys and girls will be taught the beautiful Greek language and the precepts of our Orthodox religion. Only thus will hatred and evil vanish; only thus will the Greek child receive the moral training necessary for the perpetuation and strengthening of our racial and national ideals.</p>
   <p>The appearance of Professor Kalisperis in Chicago and the success of the purpose for which she was called here by the Greek women of Chicago, demonstrate the influence and the power of our ambitious women. Such social and intellectual activities will benefit our community immeasurably and will encourage the Greek women to organize a club to promote the best interests of our people in the future. All of us would like to see this done, for we know that our <pb facs="5422062_3_1496.jpg" n="5"/>community life will be greatly enriched and improved by the co-operation and contribution of our women and mothers. Many undertakings cannot be realized because of the continual friction, hatred, distrust, and jealousy among our men.</p>
   <p>May the Greek Community of Chicago take this opportunity to pay tribute and honor to Greek womanhood, from whom we may expect so much!</p>
   <p>In passing, may we inform the readers of The Star that Miss Kalisperis has a Ph. D. degree in education and literature, besides occupying the position of Superintendent of Secondary Girls' Schools at Athens. She came to America as the official representative of the Greek Government to the International Women's Conference which was held in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
   <p>At the opening and close of the lecture the lovely young artists, the Misses Poulis, delighted the gathering by their rendition of several beautiful songs. The Greek Philharmonic Orchestra, composed of young Greeks, played several <pb facs="5422062_3_1497.jpg" n="6"/>selections, including marches.</p>
   <p>Let us have some more of these fine lectures in the future.</p>
