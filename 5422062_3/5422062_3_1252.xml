   <p>p. 3. The above titled book is published by a distinguished member of our community, Mr. G. Lazaropoulas, attorney at law, and it is through his courtesy that we publish a few extracts for our enlightenment.</p>
   <p>Aristipos said, "It is better to sleep upon a mattress of straw, than to sink into the cares of wealth!"</p>
   <p>Basilios the Great said, "The more wealth we get, the more care it requires."</p>
   <p>Diogenes, the Cynic was asked to define wealth. He said, "Be contented."</p>
   <p>When Demosthenes was sarcastically asked what he had gained from philosophy, he answered, "To really become rich, even though I haven't a penny."</p>
   <p>Democritos said, "Glory and wealth, without prudence and wisdom, are not safe possessions."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1253.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hypocrates said to his parents, "It is a thousand times better to leave glory to your children, than to leave wealth. Wealth dies, glory is immortal."</p>
   <p>Plato, when asked by a gross materialist, "How much wealth should one possess?" answered, "So much, that one neither thinks evil, nor is ever in a predicament."</p>
   <p>Simonides was asked, "Which is the better to possess wealth, or wisdom?" He replied that he did not know and added, "I see the wise ones frequently at the doors of the rich."</p>
   <p>Socrates said, "It is worthy to be rich, but better to be happy."</p>
   <p>Philston said, "Poverty, in itself, by itself, is a monstrous disease, and if love is added then the patient suffers from two diseases."</p>
   <p>Horikios defining gold said, "Oh, gold! Thou art the chief of all evils. The one who possesses gold fears that he may lose it, the one who hasn't it sighs to get it."</p>
