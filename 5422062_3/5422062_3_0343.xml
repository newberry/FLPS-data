   <p>Last Thursday evening a dinner was given in the hall of the St. George Church in honor of P. Vournas and his prize-winning mandolin ensemble. This Greek orchestra was chosen as the best of its kind during the convention held in the La Salle Hotel last month.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vournas and his musicians are very happy and proud because they have succeeded in bringing honor to the Greek name. Mr. Vournas has worked hard to prove to the American people not only that the Greek people are lovers of fine music, but that they are also capable of interpreting it better than most national groups.</p>
   <p>After the dinner, Mr. Vournas outlined the future activities of the orchestra. He also thanked the guests for the honor they had conferred upon him and his musicians. Then the assembled guests had the pleasure <pb facs="5422062_3_0344.jpg" n="2"/>of listening to the music of the mandolinists until long after midnight. There were many Americans present at this dinner, and they were completely enthralled by the renditions of the prize-winning mandolin orchestra.</p>
