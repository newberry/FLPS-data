   <p>For over a year we have been writing of the many benefits to be gained by the Greeks if they unite and cooperate with one another. We have been the only Greek newspaper in the city of Chicago to propagate this idea. The other newspapers would rather print articles that will bring in the nickels than those that enlighten our countrymen. Thousands of Greek business establishments are being periled because there is no strength or power among the Greek people. The other newspapers have been asleep while Loxias has been pleading for unification.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are glad to see that slowly but surely the restauranteurs are waking up. We hope the new Greek Restaurant Association Hermes will fulfill its duty in the right way. Here is an example of how unification works.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are 12 Greek bakeries which make bread for 22,000 Greek people. These bakeries are continually on the verge of bankruptcy. Although everybody works hard and faithfully. Why? Because overhead expenses are very great, and because these concerns, are continually trying to out-do one another. The 900 restaurants are in the same predicament but they at last are beginning an organization which, it is hoped, will better conditions. The bakeries would do well to follow the example of the restaurants. Here is how we figure out the savings if 12 bakeries unite into one big bakery.</p>
