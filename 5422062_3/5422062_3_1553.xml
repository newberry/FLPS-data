   <p>In addition to the progress made in other fields by Greeks of our community there is the progress made in Athletics. The fact alone that seven Greek teams have already been organized in the basketball field is sufficient to show that our youth is active in every phase of Athletics.</p>
   <p>These various Greek teams, thanks to the kind assistance of many philanthropists of our community, are to contest the prizes offered by the latter, next Sunday, April 19. The teams that have declared their participation so far are:</p>
   <p>The Omega and Alpha club, Milwaukee; the Lodge Sophocles of the sons of Pericles, Gary; the Lodge Ypsilantis, with S. Sotos leading, and the team Lane Indians, Chicago, considered to be the strongest; the Greek Center, a team organized, lately by the Sons of Pericles of the West Side, with Louis Stergis and B. Mavromatis as leaders; the Delta Lamda Club, which won many games and which consists of young men from the military school of Chow and the Centaurs, of the Hull House, with Varellas, Galanopoulos, and D. Christopoulos, as leaders.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1554.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This contest between the Greek teams, undoubtedly, will provoke the interest of our nationals, especially when it is to encourage our youth who are engaged in Athletics and who are showing to Americans that Greeks are not lagging behind in various athletic games.</p>
   <p>The games of next Sunday have been placed under the supervision of Mr. John Raklios who donated the first prize. The second prize was donated by Deligiannis Bros, and the third by the Chicago Pie Company. Mr. John Askounis also donated a prize, which will be given to the team that will show the best record in the competitive sports regardless of its athletic ability.</p>
   <p>We congratulate especially, those who took the initiative in organizing this meet, and the donators of prizes. We do not doubt that the Greeks of Chicago will rush to be present in the games which are to take place in the gymnasium of De Paul University, Webster and Sheffield Avenues, Sunday, April 19, 9 P.M.</p>
