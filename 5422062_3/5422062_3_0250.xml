   <p>p. 1.- System is a most desirous thing among the Greek people. Without it, there can be no progress. A ship couldn't possibly cross the ocean without system. In the same way, a business establishment must have it in order to succeed.</p>
   <p>A few Greeks think that the only thing necessary to open a store is $50, $100, or $200 borrowed from Paul or Gus. After borrowing the money and opening a store, they sit back to watch the profits roll in. This is a wonderful system - but it never works.</p>
   <p>The brilliancy of a Greek trying to borrow money is lost after he has opened his place of business. We don't possibly mean all the Greek storekeepers, just most of them. We aren't writing these things to show our superiority. We want to help these amateur business men, because as countrymen, we want to see you progress, instead of staying on the bottom of the ladder of the commercial world. No one will accuse us of not telling the truth.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0251.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Here is a true example of Greek business principles. I entered a Greek confectionery one day and found six of my countrymen, seated around a table, playing Skambili (a Greek card game). Imagine what business the proprietor must be doing! What would the customers think upon entering a store and finding card-players taking up all the room? A thousand dollar soda fountain, fixtures, etc., sacrificed to card-players.</p>
   <p>Another time I saw two of my fellow-countrymen standing outside of their store in a lackadaisical way. Every woman that went by was loudly criticized in the way she walked, the way she dressed, the color of her hair, etc. After such humiliation, is it any wonder the woman does not patronize this store?</p>
   <p>The Greeks must learn, first of all, courtesy. They must learn kindness, promptness, cheerfulness, and cleanliness. Dirty hands and a dirty apron make customers go elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Keep these words in mind and profit by them.</p>
