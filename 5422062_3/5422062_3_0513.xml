<title level="a">THE CONCERT OF THE BYZANTINE CHORUS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The much-heralded and long-awaited concert of the Byzantine Choral Society took place last Tuesday evening. Over five hundred people, representative of the finest Greeks of Chicago, composed the rapt audience.</p>
   <p>The Greek consul, accompanied by his family and members of his staff, was present. Greek scholars, professional men, and many other representative individuals were in attendance, as were three hundred American music critics and music lovers.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, all who should have been present were not. Where were the numerous members of the Greek clergy of Chicago? And what happened to all our cantors, who set themselves up as exponents of Byzantine church music? Why were our hoarse-voiced patriots--who run around making speeches for the survival of our language and customs--absent from such an affair?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0514.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Here was a good chance for our cantors to hear how Byzantine church music should really sound. Perhaps they had a touch of professional jealously.</p>
   <p>The program was brilliant. Mrs. Marion Booras sang fragments from four periods of Greek music. The chorus, composed of seven male and three female voices, was accompanied by the famous cymbalist, Spyros Stamos, whose music is full of rhythm and grace.</p>
   <p>The first part of the program consisted of three rare examples of pre-Christian Greek music. They were beautifully excuted by the entire chorus. The second part was made up of the "crown jewels" of our ecclesiastical music. All true lovers of our music felt that they were in the Patriarchy of Constantinople, or in one of our great cathedrals, as they listened to the Hymn of Resurrection or to the Cherubic Hymn--so faithful were the renditions.</p>
   <p>Native and popular songs formed the last part of this fine program......</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0515.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Nick Matsukas, the organizer of this group, is worthy of the highest praise. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Minas Booras are responsible for the excellence of the program and the musical training of the chorus.</p>
   <p>Perhaps this concert did not net a large profit, but it has contributed immensely to our cultural achievements.</p>
