   <p>The Arcadians of Chicago and its suburbs are invited to come to a meeting of the first branch of the Pan-Arcadian Union on Monday, August 7, at 7 P.M. in the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the reception of representatives of all branches of the Union, who will come to Chicago in September to its general convention.</p>
   <p>At this meeting on August 7, the new administrative council of Arcadia, the first branch of the Union, will be elected.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, ask all Arcadians of Chicago and its suburbs, the presidents and the councils of all Arcadian organizations, and the whole Arcadian population of this vicinity, particularly the members of the Arcadia branch of the Union, to be present at the meeting on August 7, which is very <pb facs="5422062_3_1658.jpg" n="2"/>important, since it will discuss the convention.</p>
   <p>The Arcadia branch of the Union hopes that it may have the support and assistance of all other branches and of all Arcadians, and that they will join the reorganized branch in receiving the guests who will honor us with their presence at the convention of the Pan-Arcadian Union in September to discuss matters important to all Arcadian immigrants.</p>
   <p>From the offices of Arcadia, first branch of the</p>
   <p>Pan-Arcadian Union.</p>
