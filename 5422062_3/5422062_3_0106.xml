   <p>The fight that has been waged by the Saloniki for the last eight and one-half months in behalf of the shoe-shine boys is finally getting results.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting a board of directors was elected, and Mr. N. Nomicus, well-known Chicagoan, was elected president. Certain rules and regulations were formulated and they were as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To fight for and protect the interest of the Greek owners of shoe-shine parlors in Chicago, and to uphold them before the American community so as to keep their respect.</p>
   <p>2. To see that the entire group abides by the decisions of the majority.</p>
   <p>3. To allow the members the freedom of regulating the wages and hours of their employees.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0107.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>4. To prevent any one from interfering with any boy that wants to work, and is satisfied with the conditions of that work. [This meeting seems to be mainly for the protection of the employers--not the employees.]</p>
   <p>5. To keep harmony between the employees and the employers. To see that justice is administered and the labor laws of the United States are not broken.</p>
   <p>The charter of the organization was drawn up by the Greek lawyer Mr. J. Dritsas, who also outlined the purposes and program of the Club. He was appointed counselor of the organization.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held in the German Hall, and at least 150 people were present. The members of the board are as follows: N. Nomicus, P. Poumas, P. Dagelis, J. Haralambopoulos, ....</p>
