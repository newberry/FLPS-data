   <p>Pride has two manifestations. The first is a refined feeling born in a human being from a feeling of worthiness and dignity. It comes when a duty is conscientiously performed, from patriotism, from love for our fellow-man and from a striving towards all that is good.</p>
   <p>The second kind of pride springs from ignorance, egoism, disregard of others and boldness, sources all of the wrong kind of pride. The first pride is a virtue, the second a vice. National or patriotic pride is what we call that feeling which a good person has in his heart when he sees the progress of his country or hears the praises bestowed on the sages of his country.</p>
   <p>This feeling of pride is aroused in the breast of every Greek when he <pb facs="5422062_3_0406.jpg" n="2"/>visits the Illysium, where there is an exhibition of art, sculpture, and painting. There--among the great creations, such as "The Reapers," the painting by Henri Marten, and "A Doctor in the Medical Academy," by Wiseman--we find the works of Greek artists.</p>
   <p>The Greek creations are so good that they had to be accepted by the super-critical Committee of Selection of the Exhibition.</p>
   <p>Four works of Mr. Emanuel Kavarou, who studied in America where he won a prize and then continued his studies in Paris, were accepted by the Committee.</p>
   <p>Another reason for national pride comes from the words heard at the meeting of a club which is being formed to encourage the study of Greek in France. Some of the philhellenes (Friends of the Greeks) in this <pb facs="5422062_3_0407.jpg" n="3"/>organization are Paul Girard, Mason, Pone, Fouzer, and Bourge.....</p>
   <p>They said that Greece achieved her unity through the efforts of Venizelos, and that thanks to him she is now ready to welcome the inquiring spades of the archeologists.</p>
   <p>The work of Venizelos at the Spa Conference, concerning the matter of Ipiros, will be another justification for our national pride.</p>
