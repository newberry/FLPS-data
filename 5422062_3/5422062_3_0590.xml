   <p>The prophetic statements of the Greek Press were amply justified last night by the wonderful presentation of "Black and White," the play which was presented by the members of the Greek Workers Educational League of Chicago. The theater was filled with people (over five hundred attended) and all were enthusiastic about the ability and good direction of the players.</p>
   <p>All the players knew their roles, and that in itself is unusual in the Greek theater, where too often the voice of the prompter is audible to everyone. Each actor played his part as if he were living it. Of course the good acting was due in some measure to the genius of the author of "Black and White," Spero Mellas, the famous Greek playwright.</p>
   <p>The acting of Theano Papazoglou was of the finest, as was that of her husband, Bobby Margaris. They capably presented the social significance of the play by emphasizing the spirit of the play rather than the characters themselves.</p>

   <p>The dignity and power of this play, which reveals the power of money, will not be forgotten soon.</p>
   <p>Between the acts the League's mandolin orchestra entertained the audience.</p>
