   <p>Mr. Vlahos lectured last Monday night to a large but select group of Greek people who had gathered in a room of the Sherman Hotel by invitation of the Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The president, Mr. George Porikos, well-known lawyer, introduced Mr. John Gekas, also a lawyer, to the audience. He spoke for only five minutes, during which he asked all voters present to vote for the judicial candidates who had been recommended by the Chicago Bar Association. The election date is June 5, and the Greek people ought to take the advice of Mr. Gekas.</p>
   <p>Mr. Porikos then presented the principal speaker, who was enthusiastically applauded. Before beginning to speak on his theme--his impressions and reactions after his recent trip to Greece--Mr. Vlahos discussed the flight of Insull to Greece and the subsequent events. He stated that Greek courts of justice were of very high caliber, and that there was no case on record <pb facs="5422062_3_1360.jpg" n="2"/>in which a decision had been bought or a judge bribed. Without expressing disagreement with the accusations made by American papers, he nevertheless made it clear that not the slightest doubt of the honesty of the Greek courts existed in his mind.</p>
   <p>In perfect, eloquent speech, he expressed his opinions and described his travels. Mr. Vlahos held his audience spellbound for an hour. He took his audience to the Parthenon, to Salamis, to Marathona, to the Mikinas, and, finally, to Tripoli, his birthplace. He read two beautiful poems which helped to express his emotions upon seeing his aged mother and renewing acquaintances in the little village.</p>
   <p>At the close of the lecture, tea was served. The entire audience crowded around the speaker to congratulate him and to thank him for returning them, even though in imagination, to their homeland.</p>
