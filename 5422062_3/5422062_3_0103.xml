   <p>When the World War ends, we will see a Europe that is wrecked and despoiled. In order to rebuild and to replenish their resources, the countries of Europe will need immense amounts of money, machinery, and--what is most important of all--food.</p>
   <p>From what source will they get these necessities? The logical answer is: From the United States. When this time comes--and it is rapidly approaching--only those who are prepared will benefit from this demand for our machinery and our foodstuffs.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America have progressed by leaps and bounds in the confectionery, restaurant, and fruit businesses. They hold the reins of these businesses in their hands. There are over sixty thousand of these Greek places of business in America at the present time.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0104.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the moment, it is a question of supplying nearly half the world with food. Just as the first Greek immigrants became restaurateurs and candy makers, we of the second generation must avail ourselves of this opportunity to become rich and powerful. We must form some sort of a commercial organization--perhaps one that will resemble a partnership, or better yet, a corporation.</p>
   <p>Why should Greek confectioners remain insignificant and powerless, when they can become manufacturers and so make the very things that they are now forced to buy at high prices. If they will unite and manufacture their own goods, they will be in a position to export commodities for which Europe will pay high prices.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, there will be some who will scoff at this article. Let them heed the fact that thousands of businessmen, who were alert enough to sense this opportunity have become millionaires over night. They were prepared, and we must follow their example.</p>
   <p>The potentially rich and large number of small business units that are controlled <pb facs="5422062_3_0105.jpg" n="3"/>by Greeks, such as restaurants and candy stores, can easily be transformed into colossal organizations manufacturing their own supplies--if the Greeks have sense enough to unite and co-operate.</p>
   <p>So far, every other type of organization has been formed. Men have fought bitterly over the empty glories of ephemeral offices. Let us now fight for a good cause--a business organization and commercial progress in America!</p>
   <p>Think about this matter, and forget ancient feuds and foolish ideas that serve only to keep us forever at swords' points with one another.</p>
   <p>We desire to hear now from the businessmen themselves who, after all, are the most vitally interested group. We want to find out whether or not they agree with us on this subject.</p>
   <p>Let us keep step with the rest of America!</p>
