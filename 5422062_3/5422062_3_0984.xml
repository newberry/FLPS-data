   <p>Just as all the celestial bodies proceed in certain definite orbits around the sun, so does the earthly Greek Press. This issue opens the seventh year of its publication.</p>
   <p>Recalling that day when a four-page Greek Press first saw the light of day, it seems to us that the birth took place upon another planet, or as if it were a creation of ourselves in another guise. One year, we thought, would be sufficient to establish its place in the community, and another year would see it acquire economic security. The years passed....but besides managing to be published every week, the Greek Press has not had a successful existence. It has wrought no marked beneficial changes in the community, nor has it acquired any great economic stability. The pursuit of these two primary objectives, we thought, would make a newspaper successful.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0985.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now, after six years, we have discovered that newspapers are ruled by the same fate as other things in life. They too, are victims of the laws of nature--sur-vival of the fittest....Not only must a paper struggle for its existence, but its must maintain as well its ideals, aims, and program of activity throughout that struggle. So hard have we fought for survival that we on the staff have become slaves to the Press. We serve ceaselessly its never-ending demands.</p>
   <p>We do not imagine that the past six years have taught us many things. Men learn very slowly, and, after certain ages, hardly at all. The imagined experience which life gives is comparatively worthless since every situation is made different by many unforeseen circumstances. Too often we are incapable of perceiving which path will lead to ruin and which to success. Of course, as good journalistic soldiers, we did learn from bitter experiences many things of value and interost. Perhaps we were not capable, and so missed the heights of fame and glory; but we have succeeded in at least acquiring possession of the territory we have fought for. It was bought with six years of religious zeal and sacrifice to our journalistic duty.</p>

   <p>It is said that each stone has its own history. The story of a newspaper can not be compared with that of any other of mans' creations An editor can set himself to solving a situation, exposing a crime, or educating his readers along certain lines. It is not easy to replace him because serving has made him capable of service. Six years have given us enough courage to continue to fight for the growth of a paper which will be Pan-Hellenically known and will have thousands of readers and friends.</p>
   <p>At times, our enthusiasm is hard to suppress for, at the beginning, it was difficult as all beginnings are; but now it is far easier. Our readers--many of whom have read every issue--are assured that this paper will continue to maintain its standards, policies, and programs of procedure in the future. Above all, it will serve the community more in the future than it has in the past.</p>
