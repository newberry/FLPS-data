   <p>He who would write about the Greek section of the Chicago Fair would be confronted with the puzzle: What did Greece want in this Exposition? For, not all the nations were represented, nor was Greece represented at the start. It would have been a million times better not to have had Greece represented at all.....</p>
   <p>The Greek section from the first, even in the conception of the idea itself, was a failure, and in the execution could not have been anything but a losing game....</p>
   <p>After all, that which concerns us and concerns every Greek is: In what manner was Greece represented, and what impressions are to be carried away by any one who had visited the so called Greek Pavilion.</p>
   <p>This Greek Pavilion was supposed to be taken care of by the Greek government which was to have it decorated with objects suitable to show up the progress that Greece has made in the last century.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0708.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But what did the Greek government send us---listen?---A cast of Hermes of Praxitelis, and an Aeropolis, of Athens, an made in a most amateurish way! In addition there were a few handicraft articles priced so high as to be un-approachable and lo! there we had Greece and its progress!</p>
   <p>Fortunately, Mr. John Boumvakis, who went to Greece personally,...and also the substitute Greek Consul, Mr. John Dritsas,...have made up some-what for the negligence shown by the Greek government, and we could see that there are some things, at least, produced in Greece and that it is not a country deserted and unpopulated, with nothing left but archeologic ruins and remnants of ancient glory and grandeur.</p>
   <p>In the first place, were there, at least, not any photographs to depict the various landscapes of Greece? In what manner was the Greece of the tourist represented? The nation has been paying thousands of dollars, for years, to a Jew in America to advertize Greece for the tourist trade and now when the Greeks have the opportunity to show to millions of Americans the landscape of Greece, they let it go by!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0709.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We should have to write and fill up whole columns enumerating objects that they could have brought here to represent the Greek nation, as it is, but unfortunately.</p>
