   <p>The Committee for a National Monument to Bishop Chrysostomos of Smyrna has arranged for memorial services to be held November 24 and at the same time calls upon all Greeks, those residing in Greece as well as all others the world over, to contribute as a unit, with one impulse and one feeling of admiration and reverence for the national hero who by his tragic martyrdom illumined the night of August 29 of the frightful year 1922.</p>
   <p>The Committee in appealing for a Pan-Hellenic fund toward the erection of a national monument in honor of Bishop Chrysostomos of Smyrna expects the same contribution from the well-to-do, from the poor, and from the workers - a single drachma of the soldiers' coins and also of the pupils', for the struggled for all and became a martyr.</p>
   <p>The Committee hopes that there is not a Greek who will not express his feeling for the hierarch who voluntarily stepped up to the altar of Calvary and went through horrible martyrdom, renewing after a century the sacrifice of Patriarch Gregory V. and spilling his blood for his country.</p>
