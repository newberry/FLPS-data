   <p>The Grecian Exhibit at the Fair is Nov Open to the General Public and Greeks in Particular</p>
   <p>p. 1. The Hellenes of Chicago gathered last Sunday afternoon in the large space in front of the Court of States, at the Century of Progress Exposition, to attend the official dedication of the Greek Pavilion, which is housed in the quarters used last year by the State of New York.</p>
   <p>The celebration was honored by the presence of the minister of Greece in Washington, the Honorable Haralambos Simopoulos, the president of the Fair, Mr. Rufus Dawes, official representatives of the city, Prof. Murley of Northwestern University and last but not least by the famous Chicagoan and one of the great sculptors of the country, Mr. Lorado Taft.</p>
   <p>Thirteen thousand people sat in the spacious quarters, attentively <pb facs="5422062_3_0970.jpg" n="2"/>following the whole proceedings, which besides the speeches of his excellency the ambassador, Mr. Dawes, Mr. Taft, Michael Rosinia, representing the mayor of Chicago and others, consisted of representations of the life of Greece, in the form of folk songs, dances and other Greek numbers, that attracted the attention not only of those that sat there for two hours and one-half closely following the proceedings and fully appreciating the whole program, but also of many others who stood around the court and enjoyed the well arranged program.</p>
   <p>Those present at the ceremony expressed their admiration for the beautiful ornamentation of the Greek building and the majesty of the Greek exhibits, which is but a fraction of what there is displayed there this week and what is to be seen when all of them have arrived from Greece. What attracted the attention of the throngs of people that were present at the ceremony was the magnificent restaurant and the fantasmagoric garden both of which are known by the name of Ionian Gardens. Those who took their dinner at the restaurant have had every reason to thank their stars for such a consummation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0971.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The musical and entertainment program was one of such character that will long linger in the memories of those present. We know quite a number of Americans who habitually read these lines, a considerable number of compatriots and a much large number of American-born Greek youth, who are not conversant with written Greek.</p>
   <p>To all those, who for reasons beyond their control could not be present on any of the three days--Saturday, Sunday and Monday--when the big doings took place, to make their business to go to the World's Fair and pay their respects to Grecian ingenuity and at the same time to marvel at some of the Greek exhibits, representing that glorious epoch of ancient Greek civilization and the progress of modern Greece.</p>
   <p>What we have to show may not be sumptuous and awe-inspiring but it is something that no other race has; and as such should be exhalted and made a capital of for the glory that was and is Greece's.</p>
