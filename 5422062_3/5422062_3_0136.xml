   <p>There are, at present, at least fifty Greek representatives of American business, banking, and manufacturing concerns, who by their personal endeavor have created a harmonious and beneficial co-operation between the American concerns and their Greek customers.</p>
   <p>These fifty Greek men are all well educated and proficient in both Greek and English, and are entirely familiar with all precepts of business and commerce. They dignify the Greek name and uphold the national reputation; because, after all, a group is judged more by its accomplishments in the business world than by anything else.</p>
   <p>The fact that large American business concerns see fit to hire Greek salesmen indicates that they respect the various Greek enterprises. Further proof of <pb facs="5422062_3_0137.jpg" n="2"/>their respect for Greek integrity is the fact that they extend credit to these salesmen, having only their written promise as security.</p>
   <p>The Greek salesman, having complete knowledge of both Greek and English, can explain all financial and commercial relationships, in detail, to his Greek customers. Therefore, he serves the community in an educational sense as well as in a material way. The services afforded the Greek community by these enterprising young businessmen must be recognized and appreciated. Not only must we appreciate what they have already done, but we must make it possible for them to achieve even greater success. We can, if we wish, have a Greek representative in every large concern that trades with the Greek people.</p>
   <p>Saloniki desires to see these men progress. It recommends, as a step up the ladder of success, the formation of an organization or club to be composed of Greek-American representatives. These representatives are the only ones capable of forming such a club, having for its purpose the raising of the business <pb facs="5422062_3_0138.jpg" n="3"/>standards of Greek enterprises, and creating a more harmonious spirit between them and the purchasing public.</p>
   <p>The patriotism and ability of these men will undoubtedly have a great bearing upon the status of the Greeks in the future.</p>
   <p>Saloniki, in future articles, will make the Greeks of Chicago familiar with the careers of these progressive salesmen.</p>
