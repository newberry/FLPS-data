   <p>p. 5.- Our community will once more have the good fortune of attending a dance to be given by our attractive and progressive young ladies of the North Side. In the olden days, the only successful dances in Chicago were given by the women; now it is again the young ladies who lead the show.</p>
   <p>The first young ladies' club was started ten years ago. There has been a great change since that time. They have learned to give the most brilliant and successful affairs of the times, no matter what the nature of the entertainment may be.</p>
   <p>Their dances were first given in halls rented for the purpose; then restaurants were used; now they take place in the aristocratic night-clubs and hotels of Chicago. The St. Clair Hotel, 162 E. Ohio street is to be <pb facs="5422062_3_0824.jpg" n="2"/>the scene of the dance the young Ladies' North Side club is giving Sunday, June 29. Judging from past performances of the club, we are sure that this will be another unforgettable night on the calendar of Greek affairs.</p>
