   <p>The Greek exhibit made possible by the untiring efforts of Mr. John Mantas, was dedicated in a colorful ceremony in the Court of States, Sunday, June 24th. Approximately fifty thousand Greeks attended the Fair on this occasion.</p>
   <p>His Excellency the Minister of Greece, Mr. Haralambos Simopoulos spoke on behalf of the Greeks of this Nation, pledging their support for the success of the Grecian exhibits. The representative of the president of "A Century of Progress," Rufus C. Dawes, spoke congratulating the Greek public for its participation in "A Century of Progress."</p>
   <p>Music was furnished by Greches and his band and Mr. Nicholas Tsoukalas, a well-known Greek artist of the dance performed. A feature of the program was a Cretan dance by several young men and women.</p>
   <p>Following the close of the dedication, the assembled crowds wandered through the exhibits. The main exhibits are the Statue of Hermes by Praxiteles, and the original sword of Lord Byron.</p>
