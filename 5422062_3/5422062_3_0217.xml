   <p>The Greek restaurant keepers, due to the fact that they are the best in the city and that no one can compete with them, instead of going forward in perfecting their business, stand still, satisfied with what they make and eventually will become so careless, that business will slip away through their fingers.</p>
   <p>As a Greek and an editor it is my duty to bring out our shortcomings before it is too late. I'm going to give Ceasar that which belongs to Caesar and no hard feelings.</p>
   <p>The greatest majority of the restaurant keepers are not what we called qualified merchants. They learned the fundamentals of their business through industriousness and flourish better than any other nationality in that business.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0218.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They make a good living, save some money for rainy day and that is about all. Soup, roast beef, roast pork day in and day out, oh I beg pardon, chicken for Sunday. A qualified merchant is the one who never stays put, but always strives to better his business. Do we do that? No!</p>
   <p>It is necessary that every day we should educate ourselves and our help to do better and bigger things than we did yesterday. How many of our restaurant keepers know and realize this principle? We have to do better if we want to stay in business and prosper.</p>
   <p>The business methods of days gone are not applicable today. New era, new methods. Go forward, don't stay put.</p>
