   <p>Hellenism of Chicago, with the addition of the Greek Press, is acquiring one more fortification against the manifold dangers which threaten its existence in America.</p>
   <p>The addition of the Greek Press to the long list of other Greek newspapers in America is contributing to the maintenance of the Greek spirit, a thing which, we believe, no Greek looks upon with other than interest and gladness.</p>
   <p>It is natural for us to want our children and those about us to remain as close as possible to the ideals our race, even while we are among different people during the various stages of Man's history.</p>
   <p>Although we follow the customs and laws of America, we try to retain our own racial characteristics. That is why, from the very first year of our arrival in this country, we have created community organizations, we have built churches and schools, and we have promoted an interest in clubs and lodges of various sorts.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1051.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Yet with all of these, our habits are ever changing from generation to generation. This force is counter-balanced by one equally as great which tends to keep our nation united.</p>
   <p>This strength, this great power which, like Mount Everest, overshadows all others, is the Greek press in America. The press, the one we now have, serves, and is destined to serve for years to come, the Greeks in America. Not only will it serve Greeks born in their native land but also those born here.</p>
   <p>The Greek boy or girl born in America is no different than the one that is here as an immigrant. Naturally we all are and will continue to be true Americans, but the American nation is still in the making, with the same spirit, anthropologists tell us, that Greece, France, or any other nation with peculiar racial characteristics has.</p>
   <p>The different immigrant races here have brought with them their racial traditions, their manners and customs, which will some day be blended together to form a true America, is known without a doubt.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1052.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We must remember that the creation of a new race of people is not a simple question of a generation or two. In previous times this took many, many generations. Today, however, with the marvelous change in our mode of living and the simplified means of communication, America is performing the astonishing miracle, according to anthropologists, of creating a new nation in a short interval of time.</p>
   <p>With true logic, because we foresee the continuation of Greek culture in America, for many years to come, we, the Greek Press, are contributing to the maintenance of the Greek language and customs as well as to the creation of a good American press in the future.</p>
   <p>With these strong convictions and having within us the torch of the Greek soul, we introduce to the reading public, the Greek Press in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have decided to use this paper as a means of building up in a practical way, Greek Unity, by publishing articles, opinions, and news that spring from Greek life and are of concern to all.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1053.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In our career it is only natural that we shall come across ideas that do not coincide, with certain movements that are not sympathized with by the general Greek public, and with forces individual and collective which we will not recommend.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, in such crisis, will express itself with the freedom which is every man's birthright and which was established after many thousands of years of struggle by humankind. In our opinion, spiritual integrity will be preserved as long as we can depend on the government for our freedom of speech.</p>
   <p>In a clear, concise way, the Greek Press is going to observe in an unbiased way, proceedings which are accepted and followed by the larger and more complicated newspapers of America and Europe. That is, publishing true facts which will help to unite people the world over as one nation.</p>
   <p>With this program planned from the start, with faith in the native-born Greeks and their descendants in America, and with one inspiration only, the success of the Greek people in America, we ask of you only three things, your cooperation, your confidence and your subscription.</p>
