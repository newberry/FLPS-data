   <p>Honors at the Fair yesterday were shared by "Greek Day" and the historical pageantry commemorating the 120th anniversary of Capt. Oliver Hazard Perry's naval victory on Lake Erie in the War of 1812. The historical ceremonies, with Admiral Wat T. Cluverius as speaker of the day, were held in the Court of States. The high lights of the ceremonies was the unfurling of Capt. Perry's battle flag bearing the dying words of Capt. Lawrence, "Don't give up the ship."</p>
   <p>Between 15,000 and 20,000 Americans of Greek descent assembled in the Court of the Hall of Science to take part in the colorful ceremonies of "Greek Day". The two major events of the ceremonies were the singing of the Greek chorus of Chicago under the direction of Maestro G. Sommas and a mass of the Greek Orthodox church.</p>
   <p>Fifteen priests, headed by bishop Callistos, conducted the mass.</p>
   <p>A five hour program of music, speeches and religious ceremonials was given under the supervision of Paul Demos, chairman of the day. Addresses were made by Charalambos Simopoulos, minister from Greece to the United States, and Pres. Dawes of the Fair.</p>
