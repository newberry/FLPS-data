  <body>
   <p>Thirteen whole months have gone by since the much--talked-about Greek-American Bank closed its doors because of bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>During these thirteen months, not one of the other Greek or American newspapers, that always loudly proclaim their interest in the welfare of the workers and small businessmen, saw fit to print a single word concerning this bankruptcy. The Saloniki was the only one to enter the arena, and to have the courage to remove the dusty coverings protecting these pretentious and impressive bankers. The $215,000, which these bankers stole and then spent on luxuries, represent the sweat and toil of eight hundred Greek men. These men probably earned this money by working as laborers on a railroad gang, and saved it by stinting themselves to the bare necessities of life; in order that they might have some sort of financial security in the future years.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0140.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On August 8, 1914, while hundreds who lost their savings stood outside, large printed posters were nailed upon the bank's doors, saying: "Due to the war in Europe it becomes necessary for the bank to close its doors". This crowd standing outside was made up of aged couples, poor families, members of the Greek Women's Club, and great numbers of laborers who had entrusted their savings to the care of these so-called bankers; and the bankruptcy caused a great commotion in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the midst of this pitiful situation, the bought-out press stepped in and printed articles by which they hoped to appease the wrath of the people. Article after article appeared reassuring the poor and ignorant people that they would get their savings back, dollar for dollar. Lying articles stated that the bankers had plantations in Vlahia [town in Greece where nothing grows because of the rocky soil] and mines in Canada; and that they would give their very shirts to repay their investors. Naturally, they accomplished their purpose, for the innocent and trusting investors signed all kinds of statements and releases, which later could be used against their interests.</p>
   <p>The situation was left in the hands of God and the four bankers. Last May the <pb facs="5422062_3_0141.jpg" n="3"/>investors again demanded their money, and were told that they could not even get two cents on a dollar.</p>
   <p>The various newspapers which defended the bankers and called the editor of the Saloniki, Mr. C. Damascus, names, and, also, the committee defending the bankers, we ask: "Was or was not the Saloniki right?" We want them to acknowledge that the position of the Saloniki was the only honorable one; and we are happy to know that the Greeks of Chicago are aware of and approve of the attitude of this paper.</p>
   <p>Do not think that the Saloniki is asking for praise; not at all. The Saloniki, has been condemned by the bankers for its attitude, and will be condemned further by them; but this paper prefers that it be condemned by such people. Their approval carries a stigma that the Saloniki does not care to have any part of.</p>
   <p>Now the Saloniki is warning the unfortunate investors that the time for justice has come!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0142.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>On October 4 the final judgement will be rendered in the matter; and if the people do not arouse themselves the bankers will be the victors, and the money will be gone forever. But, if the depositors will unite, and hire a good lawyer to represent them; perhaps this can be avoided. It is a shame if the depositors' money is lost due to any apathetic attitude on their part.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki is ready and anxious to serve these eight hundred exploited Greeks, despite the condemnation and sneers of the other Greek papers.</p>
   <p>Justice must win!</p>
