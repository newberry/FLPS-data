   <p>It is now an accepted fact that a union composed of shoe-blacks is being organized. The progressive and fine men, who are owners of shoe-shine establishments, have taken the initial steps toward forming such a protective union.</p>
   <p>We are publishing the names of these men below. They decided that the shops should be open from seven o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night. They also decided to pay the boys ten cents (instead of the usual five cents) for each shine on Saturday and Sunday. The boys shall also be given a few hours off on Sunday afternoons.</p>
   <p>What more can the little shoe-blacks want. The bosses will now have to treat them like human beings who have certain rights and privileges. The men who formulated these rules are to be praised and supported. Not only are they forming a protective association for the benefit of these small boys, but they are also going to provide sick-benefits and free hospitalization <pb facs="5422062_3_0111.jpg" n="2"/>for those who need it. They will also make it possible for the boys to attend evening schools.</p>
   <p>The committee who drew up these regulations was composed of the following well-known businessmen of Chicago: Mihalopoulos Brothers, Briska Brothers Andriopoulos and Sias, G. Katsis, Pavlatos Brothers, Chekouris and Tsimis, Akouris and Rigas, Nikitas Nomikos, Liakoutsos, and many others.</p>
   <p>The above gentlemen invite all the owners of shoe-shine and hat-cleaning parlors to attend the next meeting which will be held at 748 Blue Island avenue above the drug store of Mr. C. Salopoulos.</p>
   <p>We add our entreaties to those of the above men, and ask that the meeting be attended overwhelmingly.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0112.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us learn the value of unity and co-operation; it will be our salvation.</p>
