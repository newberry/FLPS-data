   <p>John Raklios, who owns fourteen restaurants and is one of the richest citizens of Chicago Greek parentage, yesterday married Marie Zyeal, who began to work for him as cook when he opened his first little lunch-room eight years ago and still remained his cook when he has amassed about $250,000.</p>
   <p>Raklios was at first drawn to Marie because of her faithfulness and efficiency. This led him to study her more closely. He noted that when the heavy cores of the day were over, and Marie put on her finery, she was good to look upon. Marie is of Austrian descent.</p>
   <p>Raklios's wealth grew, and with the increase of his business and his fortune, Marie grew more and more valuable and finally indispensable. It was she who superintended the preparation of the delicacies that won him patrons. It was she who economized so that the business was profitable.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0145.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Finally Raklios made up his mind. He not only wanted Marie, he not only was grateful, but he needed her.</p>
   <p>He told his friend Louis Cheromokos of his thoughts of Marie. Louis said that Marie was a fine woman, but that she was not a communicant of the Greek Church.</p>
   <p>Raklios proposed, anyway, and Marie fell into the arms of her employer and friend. Last Thursday she completed the ceremonies which made her a communicant of the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
   <p>Yesterday in the church at 1017 North La Salle Street Raklios and Marie were married, and Cheromokos rubbed his hands as best man.</p>
   <p>There was a wedding banquet later at the Hotel Sherman in which many prominent persons participated.</p>
