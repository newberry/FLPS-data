   <p>[A one-column-wide cut, with the caption "Charles George, President of the Manufacturers' Equipment Company," appears in the Greek original.]</p>
   <p>On a beautiful site in Chicago, near Oak Park, there is a huge factory built in the most modern and healthful manner. It sparkles with cleanliness and has a pleasant external appearance. Sunshine and fresh air are abundant in this plant, which is run by electricity, thus being free of smoke and unhealthy fumes.</p>
   <p>This factory is valued at over half a million dollars and employs over two hundred people. From the standpoint of modernism and sanitation, it is undoubtedly the finest Greek factory in the world and the only one of its size in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0077.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This plant manufactures parts for electrical machines and some automobile parts are also made.</p>
   <p>Mr. Constantine Georgopoulos (Charles George) is the owner of this plant. He came to this country twenty years ago. Having a strong creative desire and being mechanically inclined, he began this business venture with practically nothing and succeeded in making it what it is today.</p>
   <p>The quality of his products brought him a Government contract for a great number of parts to be used in bombs.</p>
   <p>Everyone who has visited this factory has found it difficult to believe that it is a product of the Greek enterprising spirit.</p>
   <p>The plant has also a fine market for its products in England.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0078.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are not writing to eulogize Mr. George or to flatter him. We are trying to give the Greeks of Chicago something to aim for, and something to be proud of.</p>
