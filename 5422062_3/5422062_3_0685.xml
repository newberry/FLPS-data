   <p>Our schools and churches will more than fulfill their mission in the various communities in which they are situated, if more of the good citizens of the community devote a little more time, and grasp the opportunity whenever presented to them to take the initiative and direct some of the various social activities that our Churches and Schools have to offer for the betterment of the community.</p>
   <p>Among the many citizens of the Greek Community of Chicago is also Mr. Emmanuel Mandakas, Proprietor of the E. M. Jewelry Store at 535 S. Halsted Street, who for the past three months has been devoting his time and talent to teach a group of young ladies of our parish the beautiful dances of our forefathers, and who will on Wednesday evening, October 28 at the Trianon Ballroom, present a very elaborate and beautiful dance program and entertainment for the enjoyment of Mr. and Mrs. Public.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0686.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Executive committee takes this opportunity to express to Mr. Mandakas its deep gratitude for the beautiful work he is doing for the Pullman Community.</p>
