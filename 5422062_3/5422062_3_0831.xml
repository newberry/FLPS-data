   <p>p. 5.- Last Sunday over 3,000 Greeks were present at St. Basil's Mardi Gras. From three o'clock in the afternoon members of the Board of Directors and the social committee were at the hotel making decorations and arranging things in general. The first floor was the reception room where guests were greeted. This room as well as the two ballrooms and an adjoining ante room were filled with people. The bad weather did not deter a single person from being present. The climax was at 1:00 A.M. when the winner of the contest was announced. She is Miss A. Kaloida, teacher of Korais school, who received an automobile. First Prize also went to Sophie Georgias, another automobile; second, a diamond ring of $500 value to Irene Collias and third, a radio, $300, to Anna Demos; fourth, a watch to Miss Hatzopoulos; fifth, a ring to Miss Houseos; sixth, a ring to G. Lapas; and seventh a ring to B. Vanias.</p>
