   <p>So many successful picnics have been given in this last month that it doesn't seem possible for another to be added to the list. Yet the same must be said of the picnic given at Schiller's Park last Sunday by the Chapter 46 of Ahepa. Many come in order to compete for the prizes awarded to the best dancers. The winners were Michael Michalopoulos, first prize, and Mr. Barellas, second.</p>
   <p>The women were not to be outdone. Miss Helen Lambros won first prize, Alice Notis, second, dancing the Tsamiko and Mrs. Elliopoulos, third. One young lady, Helen Basdekas, danced with grace and charm, the Zembe-kiko.</p>
   <p>The judges of the contest were T. Karagiannis, T. Spirrison and G. Lem-pesis. They deserve much praise for the competent way in which they organized the program. Mr. J. Petropoulos (Parry), lawyer, also helped greatly to make the event a success.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0864.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our younger generation deserves our heartiest congratulations for the way it took part in the Greek dancing. We should also mention in this connection, George Porikos, lawyer, president of Chapter 46, S.P. Spirrison, vice-president, and C.A. Serriades, secretary.</p>
   <p>We were honored with the presence of Mrs. George Mylonas. She is the wife of George Mylonas, Professor of Archeology and at present teaching at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We saw in the crowds Mrs. Marantis, Mrs. Pofantis, Mrs. Martha Rosis, Mrs. Dimitriadis, Mrs. Morrison, Mrs. Beligratis (formerly Vardaloukas) Mrs. Bournazos, Mrs. Porikos, Mrs. Boutipitsa, Mrs. Roustemis, and the Misses Lempesis.</p>
   <p>At the magnificent picnic, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sotirakos gave a huge banquet in honor of Prof. &amp; Mrs. Mylonas. Among their guests were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Mylonas, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Chronopoulos, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Porikos, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Dimitriados, Dr. &amp; Mrs. Zaph, Constantine Argo (Argoropoulos) and many others.</p>
