   <p>P.2--The much-heralded wrestling match between the two Greek wrestlers, Demetrelis and Massias, took place the other night, and it was anything but wrestling. The efforts of the two Greeks reached an impasse; no fall had been gained by either wrestler. At last wrestling rules and certain understandings prevalent in the art were disregarded by the infuriated Greeks, and blows began to fly right and left, accompanied by the breaking of chairs upon the heads of the two antagonists. Partisans of the match who had ring-side seats joined in the melee, and a free-for-all fight ensued. So the proverbial "when Greek meets Greek" was once more proved to be true. It seems that it does not pay for two Greeks to meet, especially two bulls. Anyhow the audience, which was divided into two camps, got its money's worth of amusement.</p>
