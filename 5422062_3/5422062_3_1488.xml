   <p>p. 1.- The Greek-American mass meeting took place at Orchestra Hall last Tuesday. All the Greek societies and organizations of Chicago were represented. 2,500 people were present to see and hear Raymond Duncan. There were consuls, business men, priests, professors, students, lawyers, doctors, peddlers, etc. All classes of people turned out for Raymond Duncan.</p>
   <p>At 8 o'clock sharo Miss Jane Addams mounted the platform and spoke to the throng. She was received with a tremendous ovation. Our great orator. Andrew Vlachos, was the next speaker. Miss Addams then introduced Raymond Duncan, the Philhellene. The building shook from the applause rendered him. His speech was constantly interrupted by bursts of applause. When he finally finished, the audience demanded more and more.</p>
   <p>It was a very successful and patriotic gathering, one that will be long remembered by those who attended.</p>
