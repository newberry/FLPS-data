   <p>Last Sunday the annual picnic of our fellow countrymen from Rizas county, state of Tegeas, took place at the Desplaines River Resort.</p>
   <p>The Riziotians, without exception, in a family groups, filled the park. The tables, which were all occupied with Greek parties, presented an example of the way a Greek likes to enjoy an outdoor gathering of this sort.</p>
   <p>Everyone present was in good humor. The f<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>un lasted all day and continued far into the night. The more than ample provisions of food and drink were exhausted by 7 P.M.</p>
   <p>The gay crowd surrounding the dance was comparable to those at the brilliant festivals of Greece. Every Riziotian with his wife, children, and friends took part in the Greek dancing. The Greek music was so inviting that it not only drew the older men and women to the dance, but also the boys and girls of the younger generation who have never been on the Greek soil.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0875.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Riziotians are to be congratulated on the great success of this outing. Every member worked extra hard to make their guests feel at home and to show them a good time.</p>
   <p>The president, Dimosthenes Peligratis, surpassed all others in his hospitality. Those directly responsible for this wonderful picnic are: the president, D. Peligratis; Paul Koutsiouris, vice-president; Harry A. Boznos, secretary; Basil L. Karras, assistant secretary; S. Moizanes, treasurer, and I. Marlas, J. Dabrantzis, E. Karagiannis, J. Tsiakoulas, K. Koutsioukis, M. Kolaras, A. Belisaris, A. Tsiankoulas, advisors. The trustees are G. Mbouris, G. Aggelopoulos and N. Rantis.</p>
