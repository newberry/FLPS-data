   <p>The important question of whether the Greek businessmen of Chicago are exploiting young Greek boys is again in the limelight in connection with a recent court case in which a Greek youth stole $206 from a Greek business establishment.</p>
   <p>When this young man was arrested and questioned by the police, he justified his stealing with the remark that his employer did not pay him any wages. The boy made the same accusation and used the same justification in court. Immediately afterwards, the American press of Chicago took up this case and gave considerable prominence to the alleged and not generally justified fact that Greek businessmen are sweating their hired labor and, still worse, are exploiting and underpaying their hard-working laborers. The press directed its attack especially against the Greek shoe shine parlor operators and hatters. Whole <pb facs="5422062_3_0273.jpg" n="2"/>stories have been conceived and written by the American press of Chicago saying that new epidemics of labor abuses have appeared in the Greek Community. The police and other responsible city authorities are being urged to put a stop to these evils which threaten to disrupt the normal and friendly relationship between employee and employer classes.</p>
   <p>The extremely critical reportorial staff of the American press is using the same tactics of violent but unfounded accusations as were used in the Syrian murder case. These same men do not hesitate to put all Greek businessmen who own and operate shoe shine and hat cleaning shops on the spot. Certainly, only a few Greek businessmen are to blame. It is generally conceded that only a very small number of Greek employers abuse labor and exploit Greek youths who are employed by them.</p>
   <p>The press has a noble mission. Its main efforts should be directed toward the enlightenment of the public which expects to be thoroughly but honestly and completely informed on the news of the day. So, since the purpose of the <pb facs="5422062_3_0274.jpg" n="3"/>newspaper is to discover and tell the truth, it must direct all its accusations and attacks against those individuals only who have been proven wrong or in violation of the law.</p>
   <p>The press should not exercise any censorship over the conduct and acts of any citizen unless it possesses all the facts. Attacks which are made against any class of people, any profession, or any nationality because of the errors of a few individuals within those groups are entirely unjustified.</p>
