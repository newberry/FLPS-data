   <p>Last Monday took place the dance of the "Carnival of Nations", previously announced, at Aragon, the arrangement of which was undertaken by Mr. Paul Demos with a committee of Greek ladies.</p>
   <p>More than 4,000 people attended this splendid entertainment, the program of which was performed with great success, with Mr. Marios Papadopoulos, artist of the dance, contributing his talent, and the Misses Demetra and Argli, daughters of the well known business man of our community, Mr. Vasileiou, and Mrs. Pandora Argyri, who danced with much grace and charm. They were applauded enthusiastically. In addition, a group of Greek young ladies dressed in national colors danced our national dances.</p>
   <p>Miss Bertha Florou sang various Greek songs charmingly, and the whole affair was a great success. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Paul Demos and the Committee of Ladies.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this entertainment will go to a benefit fund for Greek families in need.</p>
