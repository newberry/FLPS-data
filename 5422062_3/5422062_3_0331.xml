   <p>p. 5.- The Hellenic Club of Professional Men of Chicago presented Tito Xyreli, baritone and composer, at Kimball hall last night in joint recital with his wife and pupil, Ismene Xyreli, contralto. Edgar Nelson played the accompaniments superbly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Xyreli's voice is of magnificent color and good texture. He uses it sympathetically, with a wealth of feeling and incoordinate power. In general I prefer that style of delivery which suggests a plenteous reserve behind actual decree of performance; when Mr. Xyreli patiently gave all that he had last evening, however, I could not but feel a sympathetic response for an artist of eminent attainments, who was doing his utmost for fellow-countrymen in a new land.</p>

   <p>"Tito Xyreli, baritone and composer, and his wife and pupil, Ismene Xyreli, contralto, have unusually fine voices and are evidently experienced and routine artists. An audience entirely taxing the capacity of the hall was in evidence and feted enthusiastically the recitalists, who were assisted by no less a personage than the pianistorganist, Edgar Nelson."</p>
