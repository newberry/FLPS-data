   <p>The Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago is sponsoring a lecture to be given by a fine scholar, who is also one of the first Greeks to take up residence in Chicago. He is the rector of McCormik School of Theology, Mr. Andrew Xenos.</p>
   <p>He was born August 13, 1855, in Constantinople. He studied in....school and then attended the National University.</p>
   <p>In 1877 he emigrated to America and studied at Princeton Theological Seminary, and in 1881 was ordained a Presbyterian minister.</p>
   <p>He came to this city in 1883 and obtained a position as instructor of Greek in Lake Forest College, where he remained until 1888. Since 1894 he has been on the teaching staff of McCormick Theological Seminary. In 1920 he became <pb facs="5422062_3_1334.jpg" n="2"/>the Rector of Biblical Theology. He has written many important books. The first one....was published in 1894.</p>
   <p>Ten years ago, he returned to Greece, after an absence of fifty years. Next Friday, he will tell us his impressions of that trip, his ideas about the changes since that time, and his opinion of the future of Greece.</p>
   <p>We are positive that the Greek people of Chicago will be eager to hear this unusual man, who has brought dignity and honor to them through his ability and brilliance. His relationship with our community has not been very close, but we hope to show Mr. Xenos that he is appreciated, by attending his lecture.</p>
