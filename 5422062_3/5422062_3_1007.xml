   <p>p. 2-Rich in material and artistic in appearance, a new Greek newspaper, Neon Bema, (the New Tribune) began its career in New York City on July 3rd.</p>
   <p>The publisher and editor of this paper is Adamantios Polyzoides, a very well-known veteran journalist, who for twenty-five years was the editor-in-chief of Atlantis and is such an authority in his field that any kind of recommendation seems superfluous.</p>
   <p>Neon Bema sets out in a new spirit of reconciliation. Its program is to develop good-fellowship among Greeks, and its policy is to be independent and unbiased, for it aims at a systematic and creative reorganization of Grecian resources and influence in this country. No doubt, with this in view and with will to serve, the New Tribune will produce results of incalculable value to Hellenism, especially under the leadership of Mr. Polyzoides.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_1008.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This policy of progress and innovation, combined with conservatism in adherence to Greek ideals, and confirmed by its published statement that it will support every effort for better organization of Hellenism in this country, must have and will have the undivided support and the absolute confidence of the Greeks in America, who are in such need of journalism of this kind. And furthermore, the name of Mr. Adamantios Polyzoides, who is particularly well equipped for this task, and whose ability and character are known to all, guarantees the success and the popularity of the New Tribune among Greek-Americans, who will accept it as their beloved newspaper, the friendly journalistic organ of Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>We greet our new-born sister journal with sincere affection and approval, and we wish for Neon Bema, (the New Tribune) the best of luck in its future career.</p>
   <p>Proodos.</p>
