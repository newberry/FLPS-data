   <p>This article is a severe denunciation of a certain Greek newspaper that has begun to print articles written in the coarse dialect of the Greek peasants.</p>
   <p>This dialect is very common among the peasants and the more or less uneducated classes. It is abhorred by all writers, whether scholars or journalists, and is never used by them in their writings.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki contends that many professors and American students of the Greek language read the Greek newspapers in order to retain or achieve familiarity with the language. If they discover Greek papers written in this dialect, which not only is coarse, but is also full of Slavic words, they will be sure to think that the Greeks are a spurious race, as some people have <pb facs="5422062_3_1103.jpg" n="2"/>dared to contend.</p>
   <p>It would be a sad day for Greek philosophy and philology if this language of the shepherds were to become universal among the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Show your disapproval of the offending newspapers by scorning to read the "rags" printed in this dialect. Only by doing so, can we preserve our beautiful language.</p>
