   <p>One day last July I went to visit the great Greek chemist and inventor, Themios Tripolitis. Mr. Tripolitis was born in Stemnitsis, Gorinias, but went to school at Athens. He is now thirty-five years old, medium height and is a true Greek in appearance and behavior.</p>
   <p>Unlike 95% of the Greeks who came to America, Mr. Tripolitis was not chasing the almighty dollar. He came here because it offered better opportunities for experiments and inventions. He has achieved his aim for his inventions now total eighteen in all.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tripolitis has studied in Canada, Athens, England, and the United States. His two greatest inventions are the "Automatic Butter Cutter" and the "Automatic Food Dispensing Machine." Both are used by restaurants.</p>
   <p>In order to give credit for this invention to the Greeks, a $300,000 syndicate is being formed in Missouri. Themios Tripolitis will be <pb facs="5422062_3_0049.jpg" n="2"/>president, C. T. Kopsidas, secretary, and P. Tripolitis, brother of the inventor will be treasurer. Central offices will be located in St. Louis and in Chicago. The offices in Chicago are in The Temple Bldg., 108 S. La Salle St., Room 714.</p>
