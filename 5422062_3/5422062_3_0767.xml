   <p>p. 3.- Zeus, the chief god of the ancient Greeks, has not as yet relinquished his power, and from the following incident, he still maintains his paternity over the modern Greeks, (or at least over some of them, as the case is here), in spite of their Christian belief.</p>
   <p>The Greeks, as Christians, as well as the rest of the Christians of today, are all sons of God, according to the Bible. However, some Greeks claim classical inheritance, as their ancients did, and still defend their prerogative as sons of Zeus, to sit on the steps of the Field Museum and hold their debate upon the success, or otherwise, of the Chicago Jubilee.</p>
   <p>On this particular day, the Greek communities of Chicago, were holding a national celebration for the Chicago Jubilee. Four of those Greeks, whomaintain that everything good in America and the rest of the world is Greek, owing to their inability to procure seats in the Stadium to participate in the celebration, drifted up to the Museum. Observing the resemblance <pb facs="5422062_3_0768.jpg" n="2"/>to the Parthenon and inflamed by their classical inheritance, they sat upon the marble steps of this inspiring institution and the debate (a la Greek) got underway.</p>
   <p>An Irish officer of the law, not having classic inclination and audaciously refusing to recognize the Grecian god-like paternity, ordered them, swinging his hard club to "scram." They refused to depart, even when the second command to go was given. The four Greeks, being well fortified by their inheritance and depending upon their ability to talk, endeavored to convince the unappreciating "copper" that, they being sons of Zeus, according to their traditions, were law abiding citizens, and that sitting on the steps of their Parthenon (the Field Museum) was in harmony with their traditions. The infidel "copper" could not agree with their idle talk (as he thought), and in a belligerent tone, demanded their departure.</p>
   <p>The Greeks, in the twinkle of an eye, held a conference and their spokesman, the toughest one, a native of historic Crete, with sagacity diverted the mind of the police officer with a whispered challenge to fight. The guardian of the law being Irish and proud of it, his handsome face red and his blue eyes flashing, disregarded his police authority and accepted the <pb facs="5422062_3_0769.jpg" n="3"/>challenge. As an Irishman, he was ready to show the stupid Greeks that Ireland was not afraid of any one, and that a single handed Irishman could fight four Greeks at a time. The stage was set for action, when, by Zeus' will, a squad sergeant passing by smelled the powder of war and alighted to reinforce the civic army. The educated sergeant, sizing up the situation at once, explained to the uninformed Greeks, that a city ordinance prohibited their sitting on the steps. The Greeks, being true to their tradition of obedience to the law, departed whispering invocations to Zeus to have mercy on poor America, a country so ignorant as to pass an ordinance depriving them of their classic custom.</p>
