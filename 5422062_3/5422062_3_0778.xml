   <p>A rare exhibit of Greek curios, including embroidery and needle work, tapestries, bronze, hammered brass articles, icons, and a varied selection of Greek antiques are displayed at the present time in Kitson Hall, at an art exhibit sponsored by the International Institute.</p>
   <p>Special credit for the arrangement of this wonderful exhibit is due Mrs. Mathilda-Jelal, Greek social welfare worker, whose work among the Greek people in this community is extensive.</p>
   <p>She is assisted by Mrs. Louis A. Olney, Miss Catherine H. Johnson, executive of the Institute, Mrs. Nicholas Houpis, Mrs. Thomas Noukas, Mrs. Demosthenes Generales and Mrs. Theodore A. Stamas.</p>
   <p>To describe the embroidery and do it justice, would be difficult, the articles donated for the showing by local Greek people are so extensive and of such <pb facs="5422062_3_0779.jpg" n="2"/>excellent craftsmanship. Rare handweavings, beautiful hand-woven lace, articles for every occasion, attract the immediate attention of all as they enter the hall.</p>
   <p>Included in this is a collection of artistic work from all the provinces of Greece, owned by Miss Florence Nesmith, while Mrs. Jelal's own collection of rare pieces is worthy of special mention. A particularly interesting piece is the rare cashmere shawl, more than 150 years old, which is embroidered in gold, owned by Mrs. Jelal.</p>
   <p>Hand-woven draperies and rugs, rare tapestries, the intrinsic value of which can scarcely be measured, jeweled shawls and other embroidered articles are also displayed.</p>
   <p>In the collection of antiques, there are rare Bibles hundreds of year old, odd bits of jewelry, hammered brass, carved wood, glassware, and table implements.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0780.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There is a particularly valuable display of icons, the religious Greek pictures, one especially donated for this occasion by Mrs. Demosthenes Generales, over 300 years old, which is embroidered in pure gold. The religious lamps, which burn in front of the icons, are of particular interest, and are found in all Greek churches and burn as a sign of their religion. These were used during the wars of the Greeks, where the people gathered for religious services, a risk indeed while they were under the Turkish yoke. A rare "Mangali," the equivalent of the parlor stove in this country, attracts considerable attention. These household articles are possessed only by the wealthier Greek people, and such stoves, in which "Xyloearvouno," a wood coal is burned, are used in the rooms where the Greeks entertained. Poorer people used the chimney hearth. Such an article is a luxury.</p>
   <p>A rare piece of workmanship, which is really a mystery piece, is that owned by Rev. Panos Constantinides of the church of the Transfiguration, made by his father when in this city in 1927. It is a replica of The Lord on the Cross, <pb facs="5422062_3_0781.jpg" n="4"/>after the crucifixion, in a truly religious setting.</p>
   <p>The figures, cross and objects in the scene were enclosed in the bottle from the small opening at the top, a mystery of craftsmanship, put together piece by piece.</p>
   <p>An interesting display of authentic Greek costumes is arranged on tailors' dummies. The hall is lined with tables, every one holding its own special attractions. Local Greek women escort guests around and interpret the value and meaning of the various curios.</p>
   <p>Guests are also allowed the privilege of being served the famous Greek delicacies of Coulourakia, Lokoumia, Pastele and Baklava, all of which are tasty foods.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon there was a program of music by the Makelatos Sisters, who played "Il Trovatore."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0782.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Miss Androniki Makelatos playing the violin and piano, Charles Ganellas, prominent young man in all local Greek activities, sang "Come Back," or in Greek "Gyrise Piso," and "Ah Sweet Mystery of Life," by Victor Herbert.</p>
