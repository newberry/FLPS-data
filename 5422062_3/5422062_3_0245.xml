   <p>Through the organization of the Greek Restaurant Association of Chicago, our Greek community gains another important business association. Now we shall have two powerful employers' associations, the restaurant and confectionery business associations. Working parallel and in close touch with one another, these two organizations can contribute much to the development of business relations with the Americans. Our business affairs will undoubtedly improve very rapidly.</p>
   <p>Five hundred confectioners and that many more Greek restaurant owners can indeed become a very important factor in our city and can be recognized as progressive and reliable businessmen by all American business and industrial institutions with which they must deal in the future. As businessmen, most of us Greeks must cultivate valuable relationships <pb facs="5422062_3_0246.jpg" n="2"/>and friendships with American businesses and banks in order that we may obtain credit and other business facilities in the financial world.</p>
   <p>In order to attain these two ends, we must have two advantages if our businesses are to be successful; they are: (1) a systematic organization of our own particular business; and (2) honesty and sincerity in all our business deals. We need both of these pre-requisites because, we regret to say, above all, we lack systematic organization. Without system confusion follows making it impossible for us to meet our obligations.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to discourage our fellow countrymen but we desire to recommend to them whatever will help them in the advancement of their business. As we all know credit in the United States can be granted in unlimited amounts; that is why one does not necessarily need large capital to start in business. The greatest asset is honesty; systematic and methodical organization is the foundation of business. As far as honesty <pb facs="5422062_3_0247.jpg" n="3"/>is concerned, we notice that almost all our people have every good intention to rise on the business ladder through honesty. In regard to the second qualification, that is, proper system, we find that most of our businessmen are found wanting. That is the reason why they are sailing on the open sea without a rudder. Consult R.G. Dunn and Bradstreet's United States Business Inventories and you will see that many Greeks whose businesses are worth ten thousand dollars or more have obtained credits amounting to only five hundred or a thousand dollars. Then we hear endless complaints to the effect that some American business concern refuses or hesitates to extend any credit to our businessmen.</p>
   <p>Why is this so? Simply because our restaurant men, confectionery store operators, and hatters and cleaners avoid or neglect giving the representatives and officials of American business establishments the true valuation of their businesses and other tangible assets. Most of us do not know yet what a checking account is; we know many Greeks whose daily business runs into hundreds of dollars but who keep the receipts <pb facs="5422062_3_0248.jpg" n="4"/>of the day in their pockets; others keep their money in small safes. This practice can be attributed to the fact that many among us are afraid that, if we say how much our business is worth, we will be taxed.</p>
   <p>All these disadvantages put our businessmen in doubt and, therefore, they do not know how to proceed. That is why on numerous occasions many Greek businesses have failed, particularly because of the lack of credit which is the only or the main means of maintaining any business enterprise.</p>
   <p>So in order to forestall such misfortunes and in order to enhance our reputation for integrity we recommend these two things; honesty and system.</p>
   <p>Do not conceal the truth about the true state of your business. Do not carry your money in your pockets. Open checking accounts and pay your bills with checks. Be prompt with your obligations and pay your bills on time. Conduct your business honestly and sincerely and you will see that <pb facs="5422062_3_0249.jpg" n="5"/>the Greeks will occupy a prominent place in the business world.</p>
