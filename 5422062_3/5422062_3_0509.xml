   <p>p. 4.- Here is something to think about. Some fifteen months ago, the Greek Women's University Club, staged a "profound recital" with Greek songs being conspicuous by their absence. About a month ago, at Orchestra Hall, the Byzantine Ensemble, a less academic and assuming organization, composed primarily of Americans, presented a musical program exclusively Greek. The critics raved in their praise.</p>
   <p>At present Paul Demos, is staging a "United States Marine" stunt, by organizing a Greek chorus and thus saving Greece from eternal disgrace, after Venizelos and his tribe refused to participate at the coming huge house party, preferring Tabloid Politics to glorifying exhibits at a Chicago World's Fair.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0510.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On Thursday night February 16th, the Byzantine Ensemble is to appear in a concert at the Chicago Women Club Theatre, 72 East 11th street to present another program of singing but like all its appearances this presentation is to have the flavor of Greece.</p>
   <p>What is this all for? Is Greek music catching on with us? Will the professional nation-savers of the present and future exploit their leadership with Greek music? Is music the sole representation that the World's Fair is to have as far as the Greeks are concerned? Yes! An emphatic yes! is the answer to all of the above questions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demos will stage Greek music. The Byzantine Ensemble will stage Greek music at the World's Fair. At the concert of the Byzantine Ensemble on Feb. 16th you will witness something true, ever present with you, still never felt by your senses. Greeks of twenty-five years ago sang to their hearts content. Greeks of the Middle ages did likewise. Even Greeks of a hundred years ago sang songs of beauty.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0511.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From the classical tonalities sprang the beginnings of a musical art that served as the backbone of all Western music. These beginnings finally emerged into the Byzantine. At this stage a transformation took place. A change for something more profound, more fuller, more emotional--Byzantine music.</p>
   <p>Byzantine Music, unlike all other musical expressions, is replete with characteristics unique in themselves. It is a music born of cosmopolitanism. It demands universal acceptance because it admitted in its structural make up a system of musical forms complex in themselves and in their intellectual speculation.</p>
   <p>Byzantine music was not the product of a single national temperament. It was the outcome of a great psychological wave, world wide, transcending racial barriers and gathering all musical expressions under one scale and one mode, something that may be termed as an expression of supreme unity and complete realization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0512.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In this unification lies the difference between Greek and Western musical forms. The eventual success of the Byzantine composer was forecast by the classical. His eventual emersion into the water of supremely constructed homophonic gens of ethereal glamour and divine aspirations, became realized within the humanized aspects of the Christian faith. Up to this date, this music dominates. Our "Vlahica" songs, or do you prefer to call them "Demotic", are the direct offsprings of this great musical age, the Byzantine.</p>
   <p>My only hope is that in the future, since all indication point towards it, any professional national savior who attempts to do anything with Greek music should approach the subject with certain artistic reverence. Artistic prostitution, for personal gain is the greatest crimes to the mind of the sensitive. Let us hope for the best.</p>
