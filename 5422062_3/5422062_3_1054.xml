   <p>One of the strongest impulses to the founding of the Greek Press here was due to the size of the Greek colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Greek Chicago is not only a tower of strength when it comes to preserving our manners and customs but also because it deals with material things as well. Buildings have been built and establishments erected which contribute much to the eternal unity of the Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press is going to ask permission to publish autobiographies of the Greek men and women of Chicago and its surrounding neighborhood. With this support Greeks throughout the world will hear of the deeds and progress of our colony.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press has included in its program details of all movements within its colony because its belief is that the first duty of a newspaper is faith, impartiality and a true statement of the facts of the region.</p>
