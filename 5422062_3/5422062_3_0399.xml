   <p>p. 5.- We are always proud to write about the younger Greek generation when it gains honor in scholarships. One such young man is James Chelos, student of New York University. James is awarded the Carnegie Scholarship of $2,000 or for outstanding scholarship. He is going to study in Europe at the expense of Princeton University.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chelos is well known to the Greeks of Chicago, because he lived here while attending Chicago University and has made many friends. As a student at the University of Chicago he received the following honors:</p>
   <p>Two undergraduate scholarships of $225.00 each from the University of Chicago, graduated with honors in Art and in French; received his Bachelor of Philosophy degree with honors; won the Carnegie Fellowship of $1,200.00 to study Art at Princeton University and won the New York University Fellowship of $1,500.- to continue his study of Art at the New York University.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0400.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Next Monday, April 21, at 7:45 to 8:00 Chicago time, Mr. Chelos is going to speak over the radio on "Greece Today". Those who have radios should tune in on this brilliant young man.</p>
