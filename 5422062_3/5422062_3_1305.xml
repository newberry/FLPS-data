   <p>We walked into Reverend Glynos' 4th grade class the other day and witnessed a class in Greek grammar and reading. A contest was going on between the girls and boys to see who would make the least mistakes in reading and spelling.</p>
   <p>For a long time they were tied, but soon the boys proved to be better readers and won. However, as individual spellers and readers the girls here showed their superiority. We find four girls and one boy winning prizes for perfect reading and spelling. These five students are: Nicholetta Salavrakos, Toula Tountas, Theodora Filopoulos, Patsy Kasson and John Dimopoulos.</p>
   <p>The contest proved to be very interesting as well as amusing.</p>
   <p>The boys were taught the art of being gentlemanlike by standing beside the desk of the girl as she read. Rev. Glynos' purpose in having them note each other's mistakes is a notable one in education of children, since in watching for mistakes, they note the words carefully and refrain from committing the error themselves.</p>
   <p>We hope to have the opportunity to visit all the classes of the Koraes School.</p>
