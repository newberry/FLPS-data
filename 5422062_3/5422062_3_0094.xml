   <p>p. 1- It is better late than never. The much-needed cooperation among the thousands of Greek confectioneries in Chicago is at last a matter of fact.</p>
   <p>With great delight we hear that the Chicago Greek candymen have combined in a huge organization entitled "Greek Confectioners' Association of Chicago." That is progress; over 6,000 candy stores under one roof. Bravo!</p>
   <p>In the election held last Sunday the following officers were chosen:</p>
   <p>George Chiaquoris, president</p>
   <p>S. Phasseas, vice-president</p>
   <p>J. Adinames, secretary</p>
   <p>K. Johnson, treasurer.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0095.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The exact number of Greek confectioneries in Chicago is not known. Some wholesalers, claim that there are 6,000 or 7,000, others say there are over 10,000; anyway it is a tremendous force, and if it is properly exercised, the Greek candymen will be noteworthy.</p>
   <p>Those who are not yet members of the Association will do a service to themselves and to their trade by applying for membership. If you are united and strong, the syndicate, corporation, or chain-store will not be able to take your business away from you. And the only way to keep the wolf from the door is to be organized, not for to-day only but for tomorrow as well. A word to the wise.</p>
