   <p>Something unique in the annals of Chicago drama will be presented at the Civic theater Sunday evening May 25, when "Maria Doxapatri," a Greek Tragedy of the thirteenth century is performed in the "dead" language of medieval, or Byzantine Greek.</p>
   <p>The drama, written by Benardakis, a Greek dramatist of the last century is being given by the Greek American Community of Chicago and Western suburbs in an effort to maintain the interest of the present generations of the literature and lore of the Greece that arose from the ashes of the ancient Empire. The play portrays the conquest of Arcadia by the crusaders under Prince William <pb facs="5422062_3_0432.jpg" n="2"/>Champlain of France.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five American born Greek young men and women students of the Plato Greek school will portray the historical characters of "Maria Doxapatri."</p>
   <p>The drama is being directed by Theodore Pofantis, 70 year old director of the Athenian Theater of Greece.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pofantis is known through out Europe for his performances of the classic of Euripides and Sofocles. He won fame as a tragedian in the role of "Oedipus Rex," which he and his company have performed all over the world.</p>
   <p>He acted in the opening of the Royal theater of Athens in 1888 and has been on the stage fifty-years.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_3_0433.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There are thirteen scenes in "Maria Doxapatri." The settings and costumes are in Franco-Byzantine style.</p>
