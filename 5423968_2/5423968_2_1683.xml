   <p>Stockyards' officials are to reject the government mediation relative to a settlement of the strike in the presence of an arbitration board, according to a statement made by John E. O'Hearn, general manager of Armour and Company. He claims that the right of the government to intervene in the case of the strike has faded out on the grounds of all previous agreements concerning the matter. This was the answer given to the secretary of the Union, Dennis Lane, who has turned to Secretary of Labor Davis to take steps to settle the strike.</p>
   <p>The employers aver that they cannot and will not recognize the demands of the strikers because working conditions are normal and the strikers have been replaced by others. The increase in the price of meat in <pb facs="5423968_2_1684.jpg" n="2"/>New York City compelled meat retailers to join in the strike, however, company officials say that this is only temporary.</p>
   <p>Late reports have it that rioting has recurred in the vicinity of the packing house industry. A mob of strikers attacked a group of strikebreakers boarding a streetcar and about nine persons were injured.</p>
   <p>Omaha City was also the scene of further rioting. According to a report received from the Chief of Police, a group of picketers attacked a similar group. An unidentified person was beaten into unconsciousness. The strikers also threw themselves upon a streetcar which was transporting strikebreakers; shots were fired and scores were hurt.</p>
