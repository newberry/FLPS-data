   <p>To the Christian Mothers! Very often we appealed from this section to the mothers that they should not demand too much from the school and that they should help the school. It is not a great merit to the parents who only clothe the children, supply them with books and send them to school. It is also their sacred duty to see that they not only attend the school regularly but also that they do their home work. From time to time they should see their teacher and inquire about their children's attendance as well as their conduct. So controlled the child consequently has better care and a chance to become a better pupil. Their education is more advantageous. When through with school the books are usually thrown into a corner or given to other children. As soon as the school is over "sonny"does not think about books any more. Here the mothers should see that the grown up children continue their studies after physical work; to look into their books frequently. This will be useful in the future.</p>
   <p>Above all let them study the catechism and the History of the Bible. Let them study frequently. Our nation shall last as long <gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="missing"/></p>
