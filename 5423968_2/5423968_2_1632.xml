   <p>The Polish workers, who have been on strike for nearly two months, are gradually being re-employed in the Stockyards. A majority of them are already back on their jobs. Practically all the skilled workers from Locals 87 and 116 have been rehired because company officials could not have then replaced during the strike. Many workers are still unemployed because their places have been filled by strikebreakers. Negros, Mexicans, Italians, etc., have been given employment in their places. They are gradually being removed and replaced by the former workers.</p>
   <p>Employment managers have realized From past experiences and concede today that the best workers are found among the Poles. All those who have not taken any active participation in the strike have been taken back. They desire to keep away the former directors and instigators order to prevent any further labor disturbances.</p>
