   <p>The meat trust has received some unpleasant news from England. The English government, or rather its War Department, has informed the meat trust in the United States--Swift, Armour, Sulzberger, Cudahy, and other meat barons--that as long as they are under government investigation and as long as their case, in which they are charged with illegal manipulations, is pending, the English government cannot place orders for meat to be supplied to the English army.</p>
   <p>This was no small business for the meat trust in America, since England imported yearly about fourteen million dollars' worth of salted and canned meat for its army and navy, not counting the many millions of dollars' worth of fresh meat which was sold to private firms.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1412.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, the loss of so large a contract is a severe blow to the beef, pork, and mutton barons. This has affected them more seriously than all the investigations and court trials which Uncle Sam's government has instituted against them. And in addition, rumor has it that other governments which the American trust has supplied with canned meat for their armies will follow England's example and will cancel their contracts.</p>
   <p>The meat trust, then, is experiencing no small difficulties, especially since England has turned to Argentina and Australia for its meat supply, and will import from those countries the meat it needs for its army. The meat trust in the United States can, therefore, lose this market permanently, in spite of the fact that its case here will not be affected by these matters.</p>
   <p>A similar blow threatens the steel, tobacco, oil, and agricultural implement trusts, against which the government of the United States <pb facs="5423968_2_1413.jpg" n="3"/>has also instituted legal proceedings for illegal manipulations. England also intends to break off her commercial relations with these trusts, until their cases are ended, and other countries will follow her example.</p>
   <p>The United States, or rather its merchants and industrialists, is threatened with the loss of markets for its industrial goods and agricultural produce thanks to the knavery of a handful of people who created trusts and oppressed the citizens of their country with high prices.</p>
   <p>The trust, putting up a good front, threatens that this battle will not harm them nearly so much as it will the American people. It might produce a financial crash and general stagnation in the entire country, which will cause the laboring class great hardship. It is true that then everything will be cheaper, and meat prices, especially, will tumble, but then, the farmer will not receive so much for his produce, the ranchers will get less for their cattle, and the laborer will not receive as high a wage as he is now getting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1414.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In our opinion, there is not much truth in these subterfuges and threats. Several decades back, and even several years ago, we did not have such powerful and thieving trusts in this country, and therefore food, clothing, fuel, shoes, etc. used to cost only half as much, and the laborer earned almost as much as he does now. If, at present, in some places, the workers' wages were raised five or ten per cent, prices of necessary articles were raised fifty per cent. The farmer and the cattle-raiser, too, do not receive much more for their produce--in fact, they are dependent upon the trusts and must accept what the trusts offer them. Therefore, neither the laborer, farmer, nor cattle-raiser benefits from the high prices now prevalent; only the greedy creators of trusts and their intermediaries profit by them.</p>
   <p>If, then, the trusts complain that they have lost large foreign contracts and talk nonsense about the country's going bankrupt through general stagnation, then we will give them some good advice which will save the country from such an eventuality.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1415.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let the meat trust, for instance, sell its meat here for the same prices which it received from England, France, Russia, Germany, or Japan. Then, meat consumption will double and will offset the losses sustained by the trust in its foreign trade. Everyone knows that one can purchase fresh, dried, salted, or preserved American meat in the English market cheaper than here.</p>
   <p>In order to do a ver<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> large volume of business, the meat trust sells its products at a smaller profit abroad, and makes this up on us, knowing that we must pay for each item whatever the trust demands, especially since a high tariff protects the trusts from all foreign competition.</p>
   <p>The same is true of the agricultural implement trust, since American harvesters can be bought cheaper in Europe than in this country, in spite of the fact that the trust pays the freight and duty. For instance, a sewing machine imported from American factories can be bought in Poland, under Russian domination, for fifty rubles, whereas here one <pb facs="5423968_2_1416.jpg" n="6"/>must pay between sixty and seventy-five dollars for the same machine.</p>
   <p>Commerce and industry cannot remain in the hands of a few people who exploit these two branches of our national economy for their own benefit, robbing millions of citizens in the process. Let the people mere conduct commerce and industry honestly and without the mediation of trusts, as they used to do, and one will have no reason to complain of the lack of consumers' demand; and there will be plenty of work, because the laborer, being able to get everything cheaper, will buy more and superior merchandise. Instead of buying a pound of inferior meat once a week, as he is now doing, the laborer will buy five or ten pounds when meat prices are lower. Therefore, it will not be necessary to export meat because there are enough consumers here. The same is true of merchandise which today cannot be purchased because of its high price; but when prices are lowered, we will have right here in our own country the best and safest market.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1417.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We get along in this country without many things because they are too expensive while, on the other hand, foreign markets purchase such articles at a much lower price. The people here would consume all the meat which is exported if it were not sold here as though it were worth its weight in gold--a consequence of the dishonest manipulations of the trusts.</p>
