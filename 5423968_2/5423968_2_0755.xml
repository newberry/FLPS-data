<title level="a">BLESSING OF A CHURCH BANNER IN THE SACRED HEART CHURCH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>On Sunday, Sept. 20, took place in Town of Lake the very beautiful ceremony of blessing the church flag in the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, where Father Krabasz, a very energetic and deserving person is the parish priest.</p>
   <p>The Sacred Heart Society, whose banner was blessed, belongs to the Polish Roman-Catholic Union as group No. 533. As the blessing of the banner was the first ceremony of its kind in that parish, its significance was of great importance.</p>
   <p>It certainly was a grand and solemn celebration which will be remembered for a long time.</p>
   <p>The ceremony of blessing the banner was performed by the parish priest, Rev. Francis Krabasz, and was followed by a very beautiful sermon rendered by Rev. Jung, pastor of the Good Shepherd Parish, a very popular and well-liked priest.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0756.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The unfurling of the banner took place in the parish hall in the presence of many guests and the sponsors of the banner. Among the guests we noticed Mr. Adamkiewicz, president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union and other members of the staff. The meeting in the hall was started by a short speech given by Mr. Krolewczyk, president of the Sacred Heart Society, who introduced Mr. Adamkiewicz.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamkiewicz gave a short talk, praising the flag and wishing them success in the future. There were also other speakers. The celebration ended by an entertainment which lasted until late at night.</p>
