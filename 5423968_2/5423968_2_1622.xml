   <p>Editorial Observation</p>
   <p>We have two strikes-railroad and coal. Properly speaking, if it concerns large and small strikes, there are more of them. In such a great and commercial country, as the United States, we cannot get along without strikes, especially under present conditions. That is why they are repeated constantly. Today a strike breaks out in one city, tomorrow in another city. Today in one factory, tomorrow in another. Small local Strikes, cut out on a smaller scale, usually do not last long. In such cases, an understanding is reached more easily and quickly. And if an early agreement is not reached, then one or the other side eases out--the workers losing most often.</p>
   <p>But the above two strikes are different from all others. In the first place they differ as to size and, secondly, they concern not only one class and one locality, but all citizen throughout the country.</p>
   <p>The coal strike effects the railroad operations and the entire commerce.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1623.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Without coal the factories would have to stop. Without coal the railroad operations would have to stop. On the other hand a railroad strike holds back communication and transportation. In one word, one and the other effects directly the interest of the country and the welfare of all the people. The general public cannot look upon such strikes with indifference. Truly we are all interested very much in the railroad and coal strikes. We are all awaiting an early conclusion of that painful struggle between employer and employee.</p>
   <p>The Poles in the United States constitute a working class. We have very few employers among us. The Polish press does not represent Capital, because it does not have it. Our capitalists are capitalists to the extent that they can live from their own incomes. Then it is no wonder that the sympathies of the entire Polish Society, and in no less a measure of the press, are on the side of the worker. The Pole desires the workers to <pb facs="5423968_2_1624.jpg" n="3"/>come out of the strike victorious, because, in that, he sees the bettering of a livelihood for that entire part of society, which is of Polish descent. That is an understandable fact.</p>
   <p>But here it is only proper to take into consideration that the desires of the Poles remain just desires. Why? Because Polish workers do not have their own labor organizations. All the Polish worker can accomplish, is to last out the strike. He has no other influence on the running or ending of a strike.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the labor union are those of other nationalities. They make all the treaties, they live in luxury, they decide, and the Polish worker must suffer for everything. He is a soldier, a warrior sacrificing everything for others. It quite often happens that while this polish worker is taking away the last piece of bread from his family and is standing at his post, others go and take up his place at work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1625.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This is the whole tragedy of the Polish worker in America. He is a tool, but not a leader. He fulfills the orders of others, but does not give out orders himself and does not benefit from the orders.</p>
   <p>We admit that strikes for a principle are necessary. Maybe sometime in the future, when the employer will know how to settle all the misunderstandings with the worker by way of citizen-like, sensible conferences, strikes will not be necessary. But today they still are quite often the only means of preventing harm.</p>
   <p>The worst is that this method often brings poverty and want upon the Polish workers. That is why we need labor organizations purely Polish, who, through their leaders would create an influence not only on the working class, but, above all, on the employers class. The way the matter stands today, the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>olish <pb facs="5423968_2_1626.jpg" n="5"/>worker becomes the "Goat" of sacrifice.</p>
   <p>As to the railroad and coal strikes, it is proper to have in mind with consideration, that they have a variance of character. Because they have an influence on the interests of the entire country, they are considered as a government problem, to which the United States has primary rights. So then the government has justly taken a live interest in one and the other.</p>
   <p>We must admit that our government has demonstrated much good will so far. In reality, it is considering taking absolute control of the mines and railroads. It desires an understanding between employer and employees, and in this aim, it is exerting all its energy.</p>
   <p>But if they do not come to an agreement, if the employers as well as the leaders of the labor unions, continue to oppose the projects and intentions of the government, then undoubtedly it will come to such a decision with which to comply. The employers themselves will not start the operation of <pb facs="5423968_2_1627.jpg" n="6"/>the mines in an understanding with the workers--that will put the whole affair into the hands of the government, but then, neither one nor the other will be satisfied.</p>
   <p>Every step of the government in this affair will be upheld willingly by the community, because these two strikes cannot go on without a settlement. The government, as the representative of the entire country and all the citizens living within it, must care about the entirety of its country. The government cannot allow for ruin, anarchy, a complete stand-still. That is way the Polish workers should have this under observation.</p>
   <p>Strikes, such as the railroad and coal, are a calamity for everybody. Neither the workers, the employers, nor the country benefit from them. The fraudulent and greedy individuals are the ones who benefit from them. Among these there <pb facs="5423968_2_1628.jpg" n="7"/>are not any Poles. There are only Jews.</p>
   <p>For the Polish workers, there remains under present conditions, only consideration. Not to get heated up, not to listen to everybody, but to have his own mind. And in the future, to educate children to form associations, support each <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> occupy higher offices--so as not to be the "Goat" of <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/></p>
