   <p>The Students' Aid Society of Chicago held its annual meeting last Sunday, March 25, and elected the following officers: I. M. Helinski, president; W. Perlowski, vice-president; A. J. Danisch, recording secretary; Stanley Biegalski, financial secretary; Adam Majewski, treasurer; and Paul Marciniak, marshal. A special commission, consisting of Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, T. M. Helinski, Paul Nawrot, W. Janiszewski, B. Majchrowicz, Mrs. J. Litewski, and Mrs. J. Orlowski, was appointed.</p>
   <p>The Students' Aid Society has been in existence for five years. According to the secretary's report, the gross income of the Society during the five years of its existence amounts to $2,967.54.

The amount of this collection, plus cash on hand of $155.75, will be used to pay $588 for tuition fees up to the end of 1916 and $8.25 for stationery and postage.
