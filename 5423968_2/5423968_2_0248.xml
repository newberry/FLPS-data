   <p>The news reaches us that the St. Stanislaus Kostka High School, conducted in the parish of the same name by the Reverend Piechowski of the Resurrection Fathers, will reopen in spite of the relatively low attendance of last term.</p>
   <p>To the general joy and satisfaction, a sufficiently large number of youths with a desire for higher education have already registered; this insures the continued existence and development of the institution.</p>
   <p>That our Polish youth will be given a decent education which will prepare it to look upon the future with confidence, we have no doubt. The courses of study have been arranged after the American system, any other arrangement being impossible at the present time. The school will have four professors. A commercial course, under the direction of an experienced and capable English <pb facs="5423968_2_0249.jpg" n="2"/>teacher, has been added. The tuition fee is twenty-five dollars per year.</p>
   <p>We wish the best of luck to this beneficial institution, and health and strength to its professors; on the other Land, we commend the Poles, who extend their efforts to every field in their desire to raise themselves to an equal level with other nationalities, instead of permitting themselves to be "pushed around" by the Germans and Irish.</p>
