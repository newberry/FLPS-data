   <p>Officials of the packing houses have called upon the police for assistance in suppressing the strikers and keeping order in the ranks of those seeking employment. Hundreds of job seekers gathered about the Yards yesterday.</p>
   <p>Only a small majority of the workers are taking part in the strike. According to the packers, this portion amounts to only ten per cent. The union leaders have called the strike because they are opposed to the recent reduction in wages. At the same time, company officials say that the strike was called because the union is dissatisfied with the plan of shop representation.</p>
   <p>The director of the strike, Cornelius Hayes, states, in defiance of the contention of the officials in regard to the cut, that the companies <pb facs="5423968_2_1734.jpg" n="2"/>must reduce the employees' salaries in order to pay dividends to their stockholders. He further claims that large dividends have already been paid. His contention was based on statistics. When the companies tried to introduce a five per cent cut in June, Judge Alschuler did not approve of their demands. Then the owners presented twenty-four false representatives of workers on the stand. It was by these means that the reduction was granted by the Judre, he claimed.</p>
   <p>Reports show the number of strikers to be as follows: Kansas City, 2,000; St. Paul, 2,000; Fort Worth, 2,000; and Oklahoma City, 600.</p>
