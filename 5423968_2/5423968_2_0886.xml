   <p>"To the Polish Ministry in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, D. C.</p>
   <p>"Prince Lubomirski</p>
   <p>"Your Excellency: We are informed that Your Excellency has negotiated with the United States Government for a loan to your country. In addition to the hundred million dollars which have been leaned to your nation by the United States Government, and also to the additional fifty million dollars which were loaned to your people by the private American investors, Your Excellency is asking for another and much larger sum."</p>
   <p>Then, after threatening the Polish ambassador that the financiers (read Jews) will look into the Polish internal matters and see whether the Polish government is mistreating the Jews, he continues: "There are in your country three million <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Poles (Jews who are betraying Poland. Editor) whose religion is different from that of the rest of the population. Those differences are not organic of cardinal; they are additional. Yet, in spite of the fact that these differences are <pb facs="5423968_2_0888.jpg" n="3"/>insignificant, they were used as <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> or an excuse for murdering and robbing the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. Children, women, old people and invalids were wantonly butchered and robbed, together with the strong, just because they were Jews.</p>
   <p>"In regards to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and cowardice, those murders and plunders have no comparison with the old Russian pogroms, because under the old Russian stardom the government would make an attempt to present it. But in your country, your government planned it purposely and carried it out in Lemberg, Nolan and Pinsk. In the last city the terrible <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> was accomplished by the army; all the murders word Polish uniforms.</p>
   <p>"Thousands of innocent people have been killed and abused; their belonging have been stolen. This was <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the Polish soldiers, the Polish <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> murders and robbers who were incited by the Polish government. The victims were people who loved and had served Poland in peace and war, whose <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> <pb facs="5423968_2_0889.jpg" n="4"/><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
