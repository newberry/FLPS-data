   <p>John Mitchell, former president of the miners' union, uttered memorable words in defense of organized labor in one of his speeches. At present, this speech is the object of vicious attacks by the capitalists and their press, nonunion workers, and individuals of the middle class who do not understand the labor movement or the needs of the working masses.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mitchell, in his speech on labor unions, stated many truths. He asserted that unions, or craft guilds, are judged by the mistakes they make, but are not judged by the good they accomplish. "We organized workers judge every organization and every institution by the good it accomplishes, not by its mistakes, which can occur anywhere," said Mr. Mitchell. Capitalists and nonunion workers, on the other hand, judge union labor only by its mistakes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1606.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The unions are, therefore, condemned for their mistakes, but are not praised for their good work which benefits the entire community. We forget, nevertheless, that more people are killed on the Fourth of July as a result of carelessness in handling [fire crackers] than the number of workers who were killed as a result of disputes in union organizations themselves since the rise of a free American republic.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Mr. Mitchell, not without reason, argued that labor craft guilds have accomplished much here, not only for the labor cause, but also for the people and nation at large. Union organizations not only defend the worker against the reoccurrence of the slavery of the Middle Ages and the exploitation by leeches who suck the very marrow of life out of the backbone of the nation --i e., the laborer, but, at the same time, build structures to help create economic well-being, enlighten the laborer, and elevate him to the plane on which he should stand. If the intellectual level of the laborer and his understanding of his own needs remained unchanged, who knows whether he would not <pb facs="5423968_2_1607.jpg" n="3"/>have been treated here in the same way as the Negroes were treated on the plantations in the southern states before the abolition of slavery. Unions here have done a great deal of good for the working class; they elevated it intellectually, and, at the same time, raised the wage scale of the laboring masses.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the whole labor movement cannot be held responsible for the mistakes of a few individuals, any more than socialism can be held responsible for the insanities of some of its adherents, or Catholicism, for its bad priests.</p>
   <p>Everywhere there are good and bad people; therefore, in unions one finds fanatics who only harm the labor cause. The whole movement, however, cannot be held responsible for these extravagances. Essentially, the labor union is a good institution. Capital is organizing itself to defend its interests, although it aims to exploit this working class as much as possible. Why should labor not organize itself in order to oppose this exploitation?....</p>
   <p>Every organization which aims to uplift the downtrodden masses is good. One <pb facs="5423968_2_1608.jpg" n="4"/>should always respect those who organize the unenlightened and defend them against the privileged class. This work, however, must be conducted wisely and honestly, so that it will bring actual benefits to those who are organized and incorporated into one body for the protection of their own interests. Labor unions in America have accomplished a great deal for the workingman because they raised his wages, and elevated him to the status of a man--freeing him from slavery. Labor unions both in England and America have built structures to help create economic well-being and respect for the laborer; they have become the obstacle to exploitation and the forces for the enlightenment of the laboring class. They should therefore, be respected by the laborer. Every laborer should join a labor union if he wants to bring about better living conditions for himself. Nevertheless, union laborers must see to it that they have as their leaders men who are honest and worthy, who are themselves laborers, and who really have "the cause" at heart for the handful of "shouters" who occasionally become the leaders of the working class do more harm than good to the worker's cause.</p>
