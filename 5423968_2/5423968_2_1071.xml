   <p>With his visit to the Polish Roman Catholic churches at St. Michael and of the Immaculate Conception in South Chicago and to the Church of Our Lady in Englewood, Archbishop Albin Francis Symon, the special envoy of Pope Pius X to the Polish Roman Catholics of this country, finished his episcopal mission and visitation among his countrymen in the archdiocese of Chicago. He will proceed to complete his visitation in other cities on his way back to Rome where he will submit a report of his findings in America.</p>
   <p>In speaking of his visit to the various parishes in this city and throughout the Archdiocese of Chicago and of the conditions which he found in general among the Polish Roman Catholics during his visit Archbishop Symon said: "Nowhere have I felt so perfectly at home and so thoroughly among my own people as I have here in this city of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1072.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Archbishop Quigley and Bishop Muldoon are splendid churchmen and the many kindnesses shown me have made me feel the warmth of loyal children of the church to one of its clergy.</p>
   <p>"I find my people here virile, strong and progressive. I find them following the footsteps of their forefathers in their loyalty to their faith and to the country which has given them a new home and new opportunities. I find that the teaching of religion in their parochial schools has been a potent influence, saving them from radicalism and socialism.</p>
   <p>"I find that they are seeking higher education, and that, too, not only along lines which help them to look after their temporal affairs, but along the true Christian way of Catholic education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1073.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"This Archdiocese of Chicago is one of the greatest in the world and the work in the interest of education, morality and humanity which the church does here is wonderful. You are especially fortunate in having so good a leader of churchmen directing the work, and such a study, hard-working and loyal clergy. I fear that Chicago has often times been painted in wrong colors.</p>
   <p>"The Catholic in this city has special facilities for good Catholic education. You have the Jesuit fathers conducting a first-class college. You have a Polish college conducted by the Resurrectionist fathers, where in addition to the regular course the study of Polish language, history and literature is kept up.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1074.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"I leave Chicago feeling that my countrymen here are working hard along right lines. The fact that they still love their mother-country is a good sign. They will make the better American citizens for it. In saying my good-by to my people here I would admonish them one and all to ever remain loyal sons of the church and of Poland; to be true American citizens, ready to fight and die for the country of their adoption; to love one another and their neighbors; to educate the youth in the true Christian way, which will make them the best citizens and make them proof from the dangerous influences of socialism and agnostic radicalism; to support and said their parochial schools; to be loyal and obedient to regularly constituted church authorities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1075.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"So far as to my detailed observations and the result of my mission is concerned I can not, as I said before, discuss it either in public or in private. That belongs to the holy father, under whose instructions and with whose blessing I came here."</p>
   <p>This afternoon Archbishop Symon will go to St. Cloud, Minn., and from there to other cities. On Sept. 8, he will visit South Bend and the University of Notre Dame.</p>
   <p>He will leave for Rome within three weeks.</p>
