  <body>
   <p>Every man of sense and feeling knows that a good wife, a model housekeeper, and a mother who loves her children, is the guardian angel of the family, bringing good fortune and order to the family hearth. Therefore, the husband who is not spoiled to the bone under the gentle and noble influence of his wife, slowly gets rid of various faults and bad habits, becoming a useful man to his family and society.</p>
   <p>A woman, if she knows how to conduct the affairs of her own little kingdom at home, will prepare a paradise for her husband, will gain for herself his true and lasting love, will rear the children according to God's way and will earn the respect of all.</p>
   <p>We see today how some couples are mismated, to whom a joint life becomes a virtual hell and continuous suffering. On the other hand, we come across married couples that are happy, fortunate, always satisfied with their lot. In one family the head of which, a husband and father, earns less money per week than his neighbor and has more children to feed but in spite of this <pb facs="5423968_2_0609.jpg" n="2"/>we see in his home neatness and order; the children are clean and neatly dressed; at home every piece of furniture is in its place; the food is nourishing, healthy, and always prepared on time; the housekeeper always joyfully greets her mate, returning home from work, and there can be seen a mutually satisfied and fortunate life.</p>
   <p>There are, on the other hand, families to whom the ties of matrimony are a fatal weight. Both husband and wife are constantly walking around with a sour face, gloomy; one has no word of love for the other, only constant reproaches, provocations or curses. Even the greater earnings of the husband, here, is not sufficient because the husband not being able to find happiness at home goes to seek it in some saloon and there drowns his cares in a whiskey glass; the wife, then, bored at being home alone, neglects the care of the home, the children, and even herself so that the home becomes disliked, not only by the members of the family but also by strangers.</p>
   <p>From the woman, therefore, should come happiness, beauty, and the welfare of the home. Our Polish women should be the personification of all that is good in home life. Alongside a good and consulting wife a husband becomes good, <pb facs="5423968_2_0610.jpg" n="3"/>thrifty and industrious. The laziness and silly chattering of a wife does not bind a man to his home but the sensible care of the household and kind words for the one who has spent the whole day,by the sweat of his brow, earning the daily bread for himself and family.</p>
