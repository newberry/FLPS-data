   <p>We have received the following correspondence for publication:</p>
   <p>"At the annual meeting of the Association of Polish Printers, the following administration was elected for the year 1896: President, A. Jaszkowski; vice-president, W. Czarnecki; recording secretary, Joseph J. Gmys; financial secretary, I. Ruszkiewics; treasurer, John Chonarzewski; marshal, S.K.Sass; executive committee, A. Iardo, A. Eichstaedt, and S. Arwasewicz; delegates to the Allied Printers Trades Council, Joseph J. Gmys, Julian Szczepanski, and John Tarkowski.</p>
   <p>"The Association was organized in 1894 and a few months ago joined the International Typographical Union.</p>
   <p>"The following Polish printing shops have accepted the terms submitted to them by the Association and have signed contracts to employ only printers belonging <pb facs="5423968_2_1566.jpg" n="2"/>to the Association: Gazeta Katolicka, Spolka Wydawnictwa Polskiego (Polish Publishing Company), Zgoda (Peace), Dziennik Polski (Polish News) and Sztandar (Standard).</p>
   <p>"The financial condition of this Association as of April 1, 1896, is as follows:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Income</cell>
     <cell>$241.60</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Expense</cell>
     <cell>116.10</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Balance</cell>
     <cell>$125.50</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>"We wish to announce that Mr. Dyniewicz refuses to agree to our terms and continues to hire cheap labor, refusing to pay the reasonable wages agreed to by all the other Polish printing shops.</p>
   <p>"In conclusion, we appeal to you, dear countrymen, to support only those printing shops employing union members, and we can assure you that when you order any kind of printing work from any of the above shops, you will get the job done quickly, beautifully, and cheaply. By giving your jobs to union printing shops, <pb facs="5423968_2_1567.jpg" n="3"/>you will help us, because the more work you give to these shops, the more men will receive employment.</p>
   <p>"Please address all correspondence to Joseph J. Gmys, recording secretary, 77 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois."</p>
