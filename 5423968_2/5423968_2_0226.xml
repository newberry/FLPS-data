Other military societies were also present, namely: The Second Division of the Free Polish Krakuses and the Holy Trinity Cadets. Bridgeport sent the Stephen Batory Society. Societies from the Holy Trinity Parish and national societies from the North Side were also present. Bridgeport and South Chicago sent delegations.</p>

   <p>The dedication ceremony was performed by the Very Reverend Stanislaus Fitte, member of the Holy Cross Congregation, and a professor at Notre Dame university, in Indiana. He delivered a suitable speech. Reverend U. Raszkiewicz, from Otis, Indiana, spoke in Polish. Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of the Holy Trinity Parish, thanked all societies for their participation, and Stanislaus Slominski ended the event by leading a rousing cheer in honor of the Poles from all settlements.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken by the following persons: A. Majewski, W. Wleklinski, J. Poczekaj, S. Wojtalewicz, Joseph Kowalski, and Michael Majewski. The collection brought $193.41. There were also offerings by the societies, which will be announced later.</p>
   <p>The participants were profoundly impressed by the dedication ceremony.</p>
