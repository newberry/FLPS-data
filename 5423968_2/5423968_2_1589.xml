   <p>The second meeting of the Polish printers will be held tomorrow (Sunday) at 2:30 P.M. The purpose of the meeting is to give the finishing touch to the organization of the association which the printers decided to form at their first meeting on July 23.</p>
   <p>We hear that a committee appointed for the purpose has already completed the by-laws, which will be presented at tomorrow's meeting. After this meeting the registration fees of new members will be increased.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we call to the attention of those who did not attend the last gathering that tomorrow the registration fee is only one dollar. This association is open to every printer eighteen years of age or over. Those who don't register tomorrow will have to pay a higher fee later.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1590.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We presume that all Polish typesetters, pressmen, and feeders know the purpose of the Polish Printers' Association. More about it will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. Besides the advantages of a low initiation fee, the members of this association are privileged to make amendments to the by-laws. The meeting will be held at 141 West Division Street.</p>
