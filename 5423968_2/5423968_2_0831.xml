   <p>Certain people high in Polish circles are constantly making irresponsible statements which may engender the very situations which they fear, and create hostility among the various national groups in America.</p>
   <p>These persons are engaged in a battle to save the Polish youth. Even though we may concede the truth of some of their contentions, we condemn the methods they use to achieve their ends.</p>
   <p>Recently a Polish newspaper reported a speech in which the speaker, carried away by a feeling of intense and extreme nationalism, declared that when Poles become the objects of persecution in the United States, as undoubtedly they will be, Polish youth will then become so conscious of its national origin as to undergo a Polish renaissance. Polish youth will, he said, fight to protect what should be sacred to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0832.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If we accept that proposition as true, then, since there are other national groups in America similar to the Poles, America will become a country of minorities, suspicious of one another and lacking in devotion to these United States. As a result, cooperation will be lacking, and days dangerous to the welfare of our country will have come.</p>
   <p>We adhere to the belief that the interests of Poland will be served best if we become good citizens of the United States, properly discharge the duties we owe it, and raise the standard of the Poles.</p>
   <p>When we gain social prestige, Poland will automatically benefit because our successes here will be reflected on Poland as the country of our origin. Let us work out our destiny here, and let us leave Poland alone to work out hers.</p>
   <p>The speaker emphasized that Poles in the United States will be persecuted because of their national origin. If he has any basis for such belief we should like to know the facts behind it. None of us have even dreamed of such a <pb facs="5423968_2_0833.jpg" n="3"/>possibility. If this danger is real, we should get ready for it. If it is not, then such statements create ill will and arouse resentment against imaginary conditions. We doubt very much that America will become another Russia.</p>
   <p>We admit that each national group has a right to contribute of its culture to the common culture of the American people. Yet anyone who helps to lessen barriers between national groups here and to promote homogeneity of outlook toward American institutions is of great service to America. We have too many leaders who attempt to serve two masters at the same time, who try to reconcile service to an alien country with service to America.</p>
   <p>God save us from these well-meaning, but bigoted and chauvinistic people.</p>
