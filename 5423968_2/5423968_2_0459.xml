   <p>1. The aim of the Circle of Resurrectors is to improve the members by way of</p>
   <p>I. Double temperance</p>
   <p>a. From alcohol in any form and quantity</p>
   <p>b. From narcotics, any form of tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, opium and morphine.</p>
   <p>II. National education on the basis of the Catholic religion.</p>
   <p>2. With the desire of results, the circle will make its regular meetings every week for mutual understanding, education, lectures, etc. With this aim the circle will keep a library with national literature, especially for teetotalers.</p>
   <p>3. Our circle will spread the idea to the people by lectures, education, plays, newspapers, pamphlets, and other literature devoted to national affairs and abstinence. We will support poor students, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0460.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>4. Our circle will get its financial support from its members as fees, public lectures, plays, from publishers and offerings. Members' fee will be paid monthly, and it will be given to the consideration of the members to set the amount of fees to be paid.</p>
   <p>5. Any Catholic Pole who will bind himself for one year to the double temperance, may be a member of our circle.</p>
   <p>6. Every member should keep his promise to observe double temperance, attend regularly the meetings, pay members' fees and spread the idea of abstention, or he will be expelled. Every member has a right to our library and the privileges of our circle.</p>
   <p>7. Authority of the circle is:</p>
   <p>Director, his substitute, secretary and librarian.</p>
   <p>8. Circle resolutions will be accepted by the majority vote of members present. To make legal resolutions, there should be at least two-thirds of the members present.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0461.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>9. The representative of the circle is the director or his substitute and secretary, who may, with the use of the seal, sign resolutions or obligations.</p>
   <p>10. The dissolution of the circle will be decided by all members only, even in case the majority members should vote for dissolution, and should leave the rest of the members to continue their work and duty.</p>
