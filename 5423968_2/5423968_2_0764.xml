May God bless the parents of those who acted as godmothers and godfathers of the bells. After the Easter holiday special services will be held as a means of expressing our thanks, first to God for blessing us with such a beautiful Sunday for this affair, second to the parents of the children who acted as godfathers and godmothers, and third, to all who took part in the event.</p>
