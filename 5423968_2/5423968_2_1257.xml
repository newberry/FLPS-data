  <body>
   <p>The readers of the Dziennik Chicagoski are familiar with the earnest activity going on to help to solve the urgent needs of our less fortunate brothers.</p>
   <p>We have been accused by fellow-citizens of other nationality groups of having our citizens beg out in the streets and criticized for falsely representing the Christian faith because we do not practice Christian doctrines.</p>
   <p>It has been announced and explained that a Polish Welfare Association has been organized and a committee chosen. This committee has been appointed <pb facs="5423968_2_1258.jpg" n="2"/>two weeks ago to make plans for this project. If the plans materialize, this organization will place the Poles on the same level with other nationalities relative to aiding its poor. Those that have any doubts about the intentions of such a plan are welcomed to examine the statements of the committee.</p>
   <p>We are concerned about those who can understand the principles of such an organization, for they can become actual members or founders of this great work, and give it impetus. It could enact rules and regulations that would be strong enough to endure all difficulties and elevate the Christian honor and position of the Poles living in this great city.</p>
   <p>Without ardent Christian supporters and active honest members, an association <pb facs="5423968_2_1259.jpg" n="3"/>of welfare cannot materialize. In the presence of nearly one hundred thousand Poles in Chicago the maintenance of this kind of society under intelligent arrangement and wise administration can be possible, although it will not perform extraordinary things. However, without certain moral and material offerings, no organization can exist.</p>
   <p>It is well known that no conscientious Christian turns his eyes from the sight of an unfortunate situation. He is always willing to offer assistance to those stricken with poverty. It is a different thing entirely to recognize a situation of this kind and deny it assistance. It is also another matter to help someone occasionally instead of everyone in a like predicament; and another matter to offer persistent assistance to all the poor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1260.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Therefore, during Apostolic times when help was carried out on a large scale, it was necessary to form a special order of deacons for this particular work. The history of the Holy Roman Catholic Church shows evidence of organizing and maintaining such institutions for the aid of the unfortunate.</p>
   <p>This could not have been any different for the Holy Ghost gave them all the same hearts.</p>
   <p>"The multitudes were of one heart and everything was shared in common." (quoted from the Bible). The early Christians well remembered the words of their Lord and Savior: "Come my blessed friends of my Father and share the Kingdom that has been prepared for you since the dawn of time. When I <pb facs="5423968_2_1261.jpg" n="5"/>was hungry you gave Me food, when I was thirsty you offered Me water, when I was a guest you have quartered Me; when I was naked you have garbed Me, when I was ill you visited Me, when I was in prison you came to see Me."....Then he will say to them who have been collected on the left side: "When I was thirsty you denied Me water" ...and they will answer: "When did we see You, O Lord, thirsty, hungry, or unclad... and did not serve You?"</p>
   <p>And He will answer: "As long as you have not helped those unfortunates within your surroundings (My brothers) you have not helped Me, but denied Me!" 25th Gospel of St. Matthew.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1262.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Therefore, the entire civilized Christian world is outstanding for its help to the poor.</p>
   <p>Because there was no official welfare organ organized in any of the parishes, various societies have undertaken this work in part. The churches through the sponsorship of special donations and collections have also managed to participate in helping the poor. But the growing ranks of the poor necessitated the formulation of a society to cope with the situation. Today, there has been a formal announcement made of this kind of an organization called "The Polish Welfare Association," which has spread its wings over all the Polish parishes of Chicago. Since St. Stanislaus Kostka parish is the oldest and the largest in this city, it has undertaken the pioneering work of this project.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1263.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Whoever is a Christian, whoever has a kind heart, whoever is rich in patriotic feeling, and whoever persues happiness and success in this free country and great city, let him not deny a helping hand.</p>
   <p>We implore the present Polish population of Chicago, who are citizens of honor, to give a helping hand with an open heart to this noble cause. In this respect, they will become the founders and builders of a strong foundation of this organization. Through this kind of action, we will help to elevate the standard of those of our brothers who have been economically stricken, and show to other nationalities that we are not beggars, but a homogeneous group of progressive people willing to lend its unfortunate brothers a hand.</p>
   <p>In the name of Jesus Christ, we beg of all of you to attend the meeting to be held at the Polish Hall Sunday, February 7, at 4 P. M.</p>
