  <body>
   <p>The greatest wealth of every nation is its native language and religion. The nation that loses this treasure approaches national and moral bankruptcy. These treasures ought to be surrounded with more particular care, if a nation desires to preserve its moral and national existence.</p>
   <p>For quite some time various American chauvinists have attempted with their varied powers to eliminate the foreign languages and religious education from private schools.</p>
   <p>They desire to pass laws demanding the teaching of the English language only, in the schools. In many localities religion can be taught, but only in the English language.</p>
   <p>In some states statutes have been enacted; in others, different reformers have followed their example without necessity, solely because of their desire to obtain acknowledgment of their zeal from the various American chauvinists.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0844.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>With such measures these reformers degraded their national dignity and became detrimental to their nation and also to their religion.</p>
   <p>Recently when this affair was brought before the highest tribunal in the United States, it was spurned because of its being in opposition to the Constitution of this country, and it was classified as being against the freedom guaranteed to the people.</p>
   <p>We, without doubt, having the freedom of learning our national language, should avail ourselves of this opportunity. It is high time then, that we remove this obnoxious barbarism from the schools which are teaching compulsory English and replace it with instruction of our national Polish language and religion. There is no scarcity of such American chauvinists among the Poles who propose the teaching of religion in the Polish schools, in the English language.</p>
   <p>Let those who without force began to teach religion in the English language, <pb facs="5423968_2_0845.jpg" n="3"/>also without constraint, return to the Polish teaching of this subject; because otherwise, they shall be forced to do so. Although in the past we have looked upon this with an ache in our heart, we have not scourged them before public opinion, but common sense pointed out to us that it is a violation of citizens rights in this country.</p>
   <p>Let us not hesitate in giving the public information concerning the names of these Polish degenerates - these American chauvinists, who installed the English teaching of religion in the parochial schools and intend to continue doing so.</p>
   <p>We know that among these American degenerates, there are some who can not express themselves fluently and correctly in the English language, but still are propagating Americanism and chauvinism among our society. If their Polish conscience will not rouse itself, let us then endeavor to awaken it by the voice of public opinion, which will compel them to stand openly on the side of their nation or with the party of degenerates and renegades.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0846.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In the past the Polish language was taught altogether too carelessly in the Polish-American schools. The children use a Polish-American jargon and do not speak the true Polish. This fault is due to the teachers who are not able to teach the principles of grammar and do not possess the love for our Polish language. It would be worth while for us to remedy this in the future.</p>
   <p>Now that we have the freedom of being able to teach Polish, it ought to be our duty to put forth all our efforts in order that we may keep it pure, by taking on more capable teachers to arouse in our children the love for it. If they possess that love for our native language, they will want to read Polish books and newspapers, and by doing this they shall fulfill their various needs.</p>
