  <body>
   <p>A crowd of several thousand people gathered yesterday, at 2 P. M., to witness the ceremony of laying the cornerstone of the beautiful edifice on West Division Street which is to house the Polish high school of the Venerable Sisters of Nazareth.</p>
   <p>Architect Diethelm and contractors Ratkowski and Ostrowski, well known in Polish circles, are in charge of the work.</p>
   <p>A little before 3 P. M., the marchers began to arrive--first the mounted marshals, followed by the brave Cadets of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, and then the Guards of the Queen of the Polish Crown, of the same parish. The platform, upon which a throne for the Archbishop had been erected, was occupied by a number of priests--Reverends Vincent Barzinski, <pb facs="5423968_2_0275.jpg" n="2"/>Joseph Barzynski, Theophilus Szypkowski, Simon Kobrzynski, Le Grand, Snigurski, Domogalski, J. Kasprzycki, A. Nowicki, and Lipski.</p>
   <p>A reporter of the Daily News and the editors of the Telegraph and Wiara i Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland) were among those present. Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, recalling his military days, busied himself in assigning positions to the marshals and to a great extent, in controlling the throng.</p>
   <p>The weather was favorable, and the heat was not as intense as it had been in the past several days.</p>
   <p>The foot of the platform and the stairs leading to it were occupied by the pupils of the Venerable Sisters of Nazareth. The children were dressed in white, and were under the guardianship of the Sisters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0276.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Most Reverend Archbishop, who had donned his pontifical robes at the Polish Orphanage, was escorted to the platform by the Reverends Kasprzycki and Le Grand, who were attired in dalmatics.</p>
   <p>The cornerstone, to the right of the main entrance and bearing the inscription "J. M. J., Erected A. D. 1892", was bedecked with garlands of natural foliage and two bouquets of natural flowers, one on each side.</p>
   <p>After the performance of the required rituals--singing of prayers, psalms, and the recital of the Litany of All Saints, during which both the devout and the clergy knelt down--the copper box containing the usual erectional document, written in Latin on celluloid paper, was sealed and placed into the opening in the stone and encased with bricks.</p>
   <p>After this ceremony the Most Reverend Archbishop went to his throne, and the <pb facs="5423968_2_0277.jpg" n="4"/>Reverend Snigurski addressed the crowd. "Some sixty years ago," he said, "the Poles began to arrive in Chicago because of the persecution to which they were subjected by the three confiscatory governments. They arrived here with a Polish song upon their lips, with a deep love for the Polish nationality and an abiding attachment to the Catholic religion in their hearts. Even though not many of their homes had as yet been built, nevertheless the Poles soon got busy in erecting a divine edifice, for the Polish heart cannot do without Polish churches, Polish prayers, and Polish hymns. As long as we will do this, we need not fear the enemy.</p>
   <p>"Along with the building of a church, they thought of the building of a Catholic school in which their children could learn to love God, Poland, and the Polish language. A Pole who says that he is a Catholic but who is ashamed of or neglects the Polish language, is not a true Catholic. As long as Poland stood by the Catholic religion, she was strong and famous; hence, stand by this religion and become strong. But let no one who professes <pb facs="5423968_2_0278.jpg" n="5"/>this religion deny his Polish nationality, for that would be contrary to God, by whose will nationalities exist.</p>
   <p>"You should educate your children for God and Poland, since no other nation will do that for you. An alien will not teach us Polish patriotism; therefore, we are in need of Polish educators, who would teach our children that a sensible person will never deny that he is a Pole, that he is a Catholic. Your children will learn to love God and Poland in this new school. Endeavor, therefore, to elevate the Polish schools in general by sending your children to them. God will bless your efforts, and you will have good children, who will honor and respect you. You will have an easy death because of the conviction that you have fulfilled your obligations to God and country. Furthermore, after death, you will have the joy of seeing your children in heaven, because he who truly loves God and his motherland will not be deprived of heavenly reward.</p>
   <p>"Let us never lose our spirit in the presence of opposition arising from <pb facs="5423968_2_0279.jpg" n="6"/>everywhere; let us constantly combat evil, and God will aid us."</p>
   <p>The place of the reverend speaker was taken by the Most Reverend Archbishop himself. "We are laying a cornerstone for a Polish school," he said. "I am inexplicably glad of this, because I am aware that this school will at the same time be Catholic. It will be a beautiful evidence of how the greatly sacrificing Polish nationality is attached to the Catholic Church, this Church of their fathers. I know that the Poles endeavor to see that their children obtain an education in schools founded in the spirit of our Holy Church. I am glad of this and praise you for it, and for that reason I sincerely offer this school to you, whose students will be equally good Catholics and good Poles."</p>
   <p>After these brief and sincere words, which created a great impression upon the audience, the Most Reverend Archbishop left for the Polish Orphanage, where he examined two classes, in which he was welcomed by the songs of the little orphans. After this, he changed his pontifical robes <pb facs="5423968_2_0280.jpg" n="7"/>and, in company of the clergy, came to visit the Venerable Sisters of Nazareth, who received him with great hospitality, after the old Polish manner.</p>
   <p>Our wish for the Venerable Sisters is that the number of their pupils increase twofold and that their conscientious efforts and their fundamental educational training may find a proper field of activity.</p>
