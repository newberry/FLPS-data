   <p>Fellow countrymen:</p>
   <p>We were driven out mainly by heavy pressure and misery from the old country; we threw away our empty desperation. We did not work in the bottomless sea of foreign influence without our knowledge, but with faith in God tied to our tongues. Virtue and Polish habits are always drawing us closer to national unity.</p>
   <p>From the midst of our modest and poor living, we shot into heaven our verification of the old faith in God and his many saints. Near them the young hearts in our parochial schools are rejoicing at our good intentions.</p>
   <p>But nevertheless we all feel that we need a higher culture and higher <pb facs="5423968_2_0075.jpg" n="2"/>branches of teaching so we can overcome our lack of culture and ease our suffering.</p>
   <p>In the city of Chicago where the population of Polish people surpasses the population in the city of Lwow in Poland or the city of Crskow, it is proof to us that we must have more and higher branches of teaching to save our language and the history of our native land, as well as our existence in America.</p>
   <p>The Polish colleges were founded in 1892 by the O. O. Resurrectionists and in several years expanded to the great number of the present day; praised are the patriots who helped bring recognition to our Polish schools and teachings.</p>
   <p>In the old building near Division Street there is no school lecture hall, not even a reliable hall for drilling our children; there are not sufficient rooms to accommodate our constantly increasing number of teachers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0076.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Because of the fire <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, the school and the teachers rooms cannot be <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, which proves to us that we Poles should make it our duty to have a new modern up-to-date school built to accommodate all our Polish youngsters.</p>
   <p>But alas: another more important matter knocks at the hearts of our caretakers; above all, the heart of our well known leader, Most Rev. Father John Kosinski. Therefore we Poles with our nationality, three million strong in the United States, must, for the sake of our schooling, expend our Polish colleges in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This institution has received the approval from our central government to establish this college and to be recognized on a par with our American colleges. It should, in time, come to be the first Polish college in the United States.</p>
   <p>What praise it will be for our Polish people! What great advantage will it bring to our youngsters and the Polish families?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0077.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The higher Polish gymnasiums and Polish universities in Catholic Christianity support culture and science and in a short time will elevate the standing of the Polish nationality and open now fields for our talented Polish graduates.</p>
   <p>Fellow countrymen! This kind of work will place us high in the eyes of other nationalities and will shatter the arguments of our enemies who are trying to make an example of us and classify us as lower than any other nationality, but this is not so and we Poles should fight and demand our rights in this free country.</p>
   <p>Fellow citizens! Let us add our efforts and not hold back our donations so that the splendid plan of Rev. Father John Kosinski can come to reality in the shortest possible time.</p>
   <p>The foundation (for our Polish college in Chicago today represents a first-class high school) surpasses the European gymnasiums.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0078.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There are quite a number of educational collections gathered by the Order of Resurrectignist Fathers. There are educational faculties and above all youth is desirous to learn.</p>
   <p>Fellow countrymen, it is in your power, upon your willingness and sacrifices depends, the success of moving the Polish college to a new building, scientifically improved and developed, to be a fortress and guardian against outside influences, who are denationalizing our youth, depriving them of their basic belief in God and in the future of our dear Fatherland.</p>
   <p>Let us all lend a hand in the deed, which the Rev. Rector John Kosinski at present desire to bring into reality; lot us give our youth a higher education and ability to prepare a better future for the nation.</p>
   <p>Let it be that from faith and education will come a rebirth of our nation, and we will be able to celebrate in the near future our resurrection!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0079.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Having this conviction, the citizens committee organized for this aim under the leadership of the Very Rev. Bishop Paul Rhode, calls upon all fellow countrymen, without exception, to give even a small bit for this purpose, so noble and patriotic.</p>
   <p>May it be that in the publicly announced lists of donors there be found the humble offerings of the poorest. Let every Polish man and Polish woman lend a hand in this act.Let our old Fatherland and our foes see our unity and solidarity, let all of us receive more faith and belief in the future, when everybody, without exception, will put in their offerings for a place and the erection of institutional edifices which will be a testimonial of love for our country, language and Polish education to our future generations.</p>
   <p>Heartily and ardently we beseech you, fellow countrymen, with all your ability to support the Rev. Rector John Kosinski, whom we have invited as treasurer of the Committee.</p>
