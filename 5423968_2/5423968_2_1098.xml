   <p>The local Germans and some of the English papers report that, according to the last census, about 700,000 Russians and Poles live in the United States.</p>
   <p>The complete accounting is not yet finished and we cannot accept these figures as correct. They are reported by papers not favorable to the Poles. We admit that there are very many Germans in the United States. They like their fatherland more in song than by acts. It is their fatherland where the best beer and most money are. In the end they care very little about us, but it makes us furious that they count us with the Russians, giving figures which are apparently too small.</p>
   <p>If the final count does not show a greater number of Poles, the blame rests with us. The press and clergy did their part. In spite of that we are classed with the Russians or Austrians. The census takers are not to blame, but our own stupidity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1099.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are ashamed of our origin and instead of calling ourselves Poles, we want to impress the Americans with the great number of our enemies and pretend to be Germans, Russians and Austrians. Our imbecility was shown at this census. Why on this occasion the Poles and Russians were mixed is hard to comprehend. It is hard to believe that the Americans would mistake Poles for Russians or vice versa. It would be proper that a Polish man of influence protest to Washington before the counting is finished. A handful of Russians living here ashamed of their small numbers are trying to make us be counted with them.</p>
   <p>The society of barbarians is even jealous of our number in figures, and we must request to make a separate count of Poles and Russians. We will bring a tabulation out of which the reader can see the falsity and insufficiency of same. We also do not admit that there are more Swedes than Poles in the United States.</p>
