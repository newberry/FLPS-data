   <p>As we stated yesterday St. Stanislaus College celebrated solemnly last Sunday its closing exercises. St. Stanislaus hall in which the celebration was held, had been filled by the public. While it is true that the audience was quite large, it is also true that a larger audience was expected. Such large attendance indicates very plainly that the public is interested in higher learning and in the development of our higher Polish institution. Among the audience were guests from Milwaukee, Wis., Pittsburg, Pa., and other cities from which the youth comes in order to profit by studying in the college. The clergy was also very numerously represented.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of college choir singing, college orchestra program, and speeches. There were also presented a part of the Shakespearian play, "Merchant of Venice," Act IV, and Fredrowska's "Revenge," Acts IV &amp; V. The program was concluded by a beautiful speech rendered by Rev. Francis <pb facs="5423968_2_0060.jpg" n="2"/>Gordon, who presented the graduates with their diplomas.</p>
   <p>Every program was very interesting and, as usual in that college, very carefully worked out and exeouted. The orchestra and choir is conducted very ably by Prof. B. Golaszewski, who deserves credit for his activities and devotion during the last twenty years in the field of art. This year his choir sang "Reveille," specially composed for this college by W. Zelinski, and an English song, "Old Glory is Waving." They were sung with astonishing precision.</p>
   <p>The introductory talks in English and Polish were given by W. Zahajkiewicz, a student in the first academic class, which was unusual for a first class student who had confidence in himself and clearness of voice in both languages.</p>
   <p>The excellent speeches delivered by the students during the celebration demonstrated how wonderful was the attention given to the diction and <pb facs="5423968_2_0061.jpg" n="3"/>rhetoric of both languages. The Shakespearean and Polish plays created a great interest among the public.</p>
   <p>Here the students had a wonderful opportunity to display their talents. The audience applauded very frequently. The participants had a great opportunity to observe how carefully trained are the students of this college in the knowledge of the English and Polish languages. The plays in which the students took part belong to the most difficult ones, even for professional artists.</p>
   <p>The students were not only able to satisfy the audience but also to rouse their admiration. The program was conducted by Rev. Francis Gordon, who delivered a long speech stressing the necessity of education and the importance of such institution. Then he gave out the diplomas to the graduates and the program was ended.</p>
