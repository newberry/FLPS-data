   <p>The industrialists and capitalists are greatly displeased by the fact that such motion pictures as "Intolerance," "The Birth of a Nation," and others are being shown in Chicago, and their displeasure is due to the fact that these pictures open the eyes of the people, who are warned against exploitation and made to realize that the only hope of the classes groaning under the yoke of misfortune, lies in overcoming evil.</p>
   <p>Humbug pictures, such as those in which Charlie Chaplin and other comedians play foolish tricks to make the stupid people laugh, are O. K. in the opinion of the capitalists and all sorts of exploiters of the workers because they keep the people in ignorance and do not rouse them to healthy thoughts which would surely hamper their nefarious actions.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, pictures which tend to rouse the people to a reasonable outlook on the world and things in general become in the eyes of the capitalists <pb facs="5423968_2_0527.jpg" n="2"/>something immoral, even pornographic.</p>
   <p>This is the viewpoint of those who neither plow nor sow, but live. Live? Yes! But they live off the toil of others--the toil of the exploited and oppressed.</p>
   <p>The opinion of the chosen few is also shared by some of the judges of Chicago. What is immoral in the eyes of the capitalists is, by some strange coincidence, also immoral in the eyes of these judges. Everyone knows the efforts the capitalists have made in order to prevent the showing of "Intolerance".</p>
   <p>But all their dishonorable efforts have been in vain, and at present much is heard about a new picture, "The Birth of a Nation," which has been running in one of the downtown theaters for several weeks.</p>
   <p>The history of the battle which the moralists waged against this picture is unusually interesting. They even obtained an injunction against the Epoch <pb facs="5423968_2_0528.jpg" n="3"/>Producing Company in order to prevent the latter from showing this picture. The matter, however, was taken to the Superior Court. This is what the Court decided:</p>
   <p>"We see nothing immoral in the showing of 'The Birth of a Nation.' If any picture is, as the plaintiff states, immoral for children, then it is also immoral for adults. In this case no definite line of demarcation between adults and children can be drawn. The chief of police is certainly not a psychologist who can judge what sort of influence a given picture exerts on the disposition of the people. The "Birth of a Nation" can be shown to both adults and children in Chicago."</p>
   <p>This is the opinion of the Superior Court. Judge David, who expressed it, well knows that the moralists consider everything immoral which the parasites living off the toil of the working people do not like.</p>
   <p>The people, who regard things with good, healthy common sense, are now beginning <pb facs="5423968_2_0529.jpg" n="4"/>to recognize the pretended morality of certain individuals whose characters are spotted with many immoral little affairs. There will come a time when the exploiters of the people will no longer be able to hide behind the cloak of morality. Time will show what the illusion conceals. He who is evil will not be able for long to pretend that he is virtuous.</p>
