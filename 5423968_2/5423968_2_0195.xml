<title level="a">ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA COLLEGE TO OPEN ON SEPTEMBER 3</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>One of the professors at St. Stanislaus Kostka College sent us the following article about the activities of that institution:</p>
   <p>"When the St. Stanislaus Kostka college opened its doors to the public over four years ago only thirteen students enrolled. In the following year eighty-eight were registered. This was indeed a large increase over the initial year.</p>
   <p>"The outlook for this year is even brighter. It is expected that over one hundred and twenty will register, and in time we believe that even this number will be surpassed.</p>
   <p>"During the course of the past four years much good has been accomplished. The parents have willingly intrusted their children to this institution of learning. The students have willingly adjusted themselves to the curriculum <pb facs="5423968_2_0196.jpg" n="2"/>and discipline of the school. Results speak for themselves. A certain number of students have already obtained profitable positions. Others will complete their studies in higher institutions of learning.</p>
   <p>"The St. Stanislaus Kostka College offers complete courses: classic, academic and business. The college is continually forging ahead to meet the needs of the day. Its professors are competent and have the necessary academic background. The English and Polish languages are given special consideration. </p>
   <p>"We desire to offer our students a complete understanding of their native tongue, and at the same time to prepare them for filling positions in their various stations of life. A thorough course in the English language is given.</p>
   <p>"In time, when financial conditions permit, the college will erect its own buildings.</p>
   <p>"Our program follows the same course as those offered by the leading American colleges. To this is added religion. [Thus the curriculum includes] moral, mental and physical development.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0197.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Fraternal societies are being organized and an alumni association is being formed. The college is to have its own orchestra and choir.</p>
   <p>"The number of professors on our staff is being increased. Various steps are also being taken to make our college comparable to if not better than the outstanding colleges of the country. Our professorial staff has been increased for the coming school year. This staff will be as follows: Reverend Simon Kobrzynski, president; Reverend John Piechowski, rector and manager; Reverend John Kruszynski, vice rector; Reverend S. Cosimi, professor of French and Italian; J. B. M. McEvoy, English and Greek languages and mathematics; P. A. Schaedler, Italian and German languages and the sciences; S. Zahajkiewicz, Polish literature; Ignace Kowalski, Polish history and drawing; F. Kostka, Vocal and instrumental music. In a few more days two other professors will be added.</p>
   <p>"The college will open its doors on September 3. The tuition fee is moderate. Further particulars can be had by calling at the rector's office, Noble and Ingraham Streets, between 10 A. M. and 12 noon."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0198.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>So much for the article from the professor.</p>
   <p>For our part, we heartily support the Polish College and urge all Poles to send their children to this educational institution.</p>
