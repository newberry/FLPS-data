   <p>The parish orchestra of St. Michael Archangel Church, on 83rd Street in South Chicago, gave a concert last night, June 16, for the benefit of its beloved pastor, Rev. Adolph Nowicki, on the eve of his name's day. The group of the parish orchestra is young and small--numbering but six people--but so is this parish young, separated from St. Mary's Parish, also in South Chicago. Despite its small number and inexperience, the orchestra played "God Save Poland" and several other musical scores, played on wind instruments in a rather careful manner and with true verve. A great deal of credit for the success of the concert is due Mr. Wiedeman, the able organist of this parish. The circumstances under which the band was formed are worthy of admiration. The band is made up of workingmen, of people who can take up their music only after [they have spent] an entire day at hard manual labor. This would indicate that the Polish people lack neither good intention nor ability as long as they can find someone who is willing and sufficiently capable, to become interested in them. A person of that type is the Rev. Adolph Nowicki, a man who is ardent and skilled in the organizing of our people. During his short stay at this parish he has formed several organizations.</p>

   <p>Undoubtedly the parish orchestra will also develop successfully and will be of great service to the parish in time to come. After completing several musical compositions in the temporary rectory, the orchestra extended its good wishes to its beloved pastor and played several other musical compositions in the rectory proper. Rev. Vincent Barzynski, who was also present at this celebration, added to the spirit of the occasion by playing several national compositions on the piano. The melodious strains of the parochial orchestra could be heard at the 83rd Street Station even after 10 o'clock. Long may the orchestra live and successfully develop. May the ardent pastor, Rev. Adolph Nowicki, live the years of Methuselah (or at least a half of them) in good health and fortune.</p>
