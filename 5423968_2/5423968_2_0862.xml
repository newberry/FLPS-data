<title level="a">DR. ZALUSKI WRITES ABOUT THE POLISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In one of the daily papers published in Warsaw, we have found an article written by Dr. Zaluski who has been among our people in America, and recently returned to Poland.</p>
   <p>Dr. John Zaluski, while in the United States, through his contact with prominent Poles, became familiar with many vital statistics concerning their number and activity. He has carried all this information back to his native country and written about the Polish emigrants in America.</p>
   <p>According to the article, one of the most important facts revealed is that there are over three million Poles in the United States. They populate two sections of the country. The first group spreads throughout the large cities of the north central and northeastern states. They are found in large numbers in the cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo. The total number in these cities reaches nearly two million. A majority of them are engaged in <pb facs="5423968_2_0863.jpg" n="2"/>industry and the remainder in farming.</p>
   <p>"The second group," writes the doctor, "is found in the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania; namely, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. There are about a million Polish people in this state. The third center is New York. Over a half a million Poles are located here. The Polish people in general are well organized."</p>
   <p>"When I asked upon what foundations the Polish people are organized, I have found out that it was the parish churches," writes Dr. Zaluski. He states: "The foundations of the organized Polish emigrants in America are the parish churches of each Polish community. It must be remembered that the parish is not only the church, school, and shelter, but also the medium that advocates national activities and obligations. Its influence also reaches the life in the home.</p>
   <p>"There are about seven hundred Polish parishes in America. And the organization of nationalism among the Polish people by the church is nothing special, for this <pb facs="5423968_2_0864.jpg" n="3"/>is the general practice of the Catholic Church. The life of the parish is the foundation of national life."</p>
   <p>"The spirit of the Polish-American citizens is one of great understanding. The Polish spirit is constantly improving its horizon relative to its mission in America, and knows the great value of the individuality within its ranks. From a national point of view, this is an unusually favorable condition," he stipulates.</p>
   <p>"It is also of interest to know that beyond the parish there are other forms of organization which add to the completeness of community life; namely, social clubs and political groups. But even these cannot hold meetings without having the parish play some part in it. As it happens many times it is the parish which possesses the auditoriums, halls, public buildings, etc."</p>
   <p>"Who among the emigrants returns to Poland?" To this he replies:</p>
   <p>"The freedom of Poland is one of the most important factors that has motivated <pb facs="5423968_2_0865.jpg" n="4"/>the emigrant to return to his native country. The ones that are going back are those who were held back because of the War. However, this re-emigration is not very great. A greater number are awaiting the settlement of political and industrial conditions in the new republic. This number is separated into two groups: the wealthy emigrants and the early, patriotic emigrants (the oldtimers). On their return, they will take an active part in the affairs of Poland."</p>
   <p>"This element," he writes further, "will be one of great value, for it will be instrumental in attracting American capital."</p>
   <p>"What influence did the World war have on the Poles in the United States?" Dr. Zaluski asserts that forty-two thousand Polish-Americans volunteered when the American government called for one hundred thousand volunteers. Out of the total only three thousand were Jews. This is comparitively a small number considering the fact that Jewish emigration was as great, if not greater than the Poles to America. </p>
   <p>"What about the interest in the fatherland? In reality, the Polish people in <pb facs="5423968_2_0866.jpg" n="5"/>America are keeping in close contact with the affairs in Poland. A warm feeling of patriotism is expressed by a great many."</p>
   <p>[Newspaper Editor's note: The facts as presented by Dr. John Zaluski are true in every form.]</p>
