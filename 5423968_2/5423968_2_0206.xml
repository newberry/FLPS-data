   <p>A beautiful review presented by the students and teachers of the Sisters of Nazareth Parochial School climaxed the school work for the summer. A large number of Polish persons were present who were impressed by the accomplishments of the small boys and girls.</p>
   <p>The "Hymn to the Blessed Virgin" by Moniuszko, Polish composer, opened the program. This was followed by several piano numbers in the form of duets and trios. The following participated in this number: Pearl Gorna, Angeline Dorszynska, Mathilda Zwiardowska, T. Wleklinska, Angeline Ratkowska, M. Dobrocka, C. Barzynska, and Frances Gorska. There were also other musical numbers that deserved recognition.</p>
   <p>Declamations in Polish were delivered by Sophia Markowicz and Ursula Klarkowska; in English by B. Pstrong, Alexander Mendykowski and Miss Mary Barzynska. An <pb facs="5423968_2_0207.jpg" n="2"/>outstanding recitation, "Concert of Concerts," from "Pana Tadeusz" [Mister Thaddeus], was given by Miss Jaroslawa Weclewska.</p>
   <p>Beautiful choir and solo singing was rendered in English, Polish and Italian. The following distinguished themselves in this field: Catherine Barzynska, R. Danysz, A. Manna, and M. Malinska. </p>
   <p>The sketch presented by the children of Mr. Freblowski's class enraptured the audience.</p>
   <p>A one-act comedy "Figiel Wiarusa" [The Veteran's Prank] was liked. Peter Szczepanski, Angeline Wisniewska and M. Malinowski took part in this humorous play.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with the song "Rybacy" [Fishermen], by Moniuszko. A warm hand was extended to the students for their efforts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0208.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On the whole, the program gave sufficient evidence that the Sisters of Nazareth's teachers are conscientious workers. The results brought about from this work for our children can be considered valuable. This is shown by the continual increase of the enrollment at this school.</p>
