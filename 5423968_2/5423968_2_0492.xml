   <p>Fights at Polish weddings are again coming into fashion. In a dance hall at West Hammond, a fight took place where blood flowed in streams and corpses fell.</p>
   <p>John P., a Pole, was killed instantly and policeman K., also a Pole, was seriously wounded and is in a critical condition in St. Margaret's Hospital.</p>
   <p>Another man most likely will die from a bullet wound. All together, a sad incident and shameful in the highest degree to the Polish name. The encounter was caused by whiskey which was alleged to have been stolen from the saloonkeeper, and indulged in without restraint.</p>
   <p>In many settlements of Poland many weddings are celebrated without <pb facs="5423968_2_0493.jpg" n="2"/>the use of intoxicating liquor. Why can't participants in wedding celebrations here do likewise? Instead of quenching their thirst with whiskey, use soda water, coffee, or tea.</p>
   <p>Recently we have had many such incidents, but they are too bad to be printed.</p>
   <p>In another case an ardent policeman took several wedding celebrants, who were "feeling good," to the hoosegow, and besides these, several entirely innocent and prominent citizens, who pointed out to the ardent guardian of safety the brutality with which he had carried out his duty.</p>
