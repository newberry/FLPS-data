   <p>One person was critically wounded last night when disturbances occurred again in the Stockyards. Riots started when a Negro, in the employ of Wilson and Company fired into a crowd of strike sympathizers. The colored worker was arrested and taken to a police station under a guard of one hundred policemen. The crowd of strikers surrounded the officers and demanded the Negro.</p>
   <p>A colored worker was attacked in an Ashland Avenue streetcar. At 22nd Street the Negro escaped and sought refuge in the Standard Oil Company Building. Using a doorway as a vantage point, the colored man opened fire upon his approaching pursuers. Miller, one of the crowd, was seriously shot, and was immediately taken to the County Hospital. A medical examination gave the wounded man a slim chance to live. A <pb facs="5423968_2_1681.jpg" n="2"/>nearby resident, Miss Fanny Mutl, was wounded while working in her kitchen, when a bullet penetrated a window of her apartment, striking her in the head.</p>
   <p>Reports from Oklahoma City stated that nine persons were wounded in strike rioting.</p>
