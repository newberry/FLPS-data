   <p>Before reviewing what harm is done to children from the pedagogical viewpoint one must first acquaint the readers with the manner of selecting the "young amateurs."</p>
   <p>In order to make the play a success it is necessary to select only the most able and intelligent children of the school for the play. The teacher must also be sure the parents of the chosen children are well off financially. The children are then taken to a separate room for rehearsing where they spend "weeks and months" deprived of proper instructions, and because the "sister" who may be occupied with a certain group cannot watch the rest of the children they become unruly and loose proper respect for their teacher. The time lost away from school rooms cannot be made up because the teacher is not able to go far back and review the lessons that only a few from her class missed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0129.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Omission of certain subjects in class is not as important as of others. The absence of pupils during "reading" is not very harmful but the presence of the children in the classes of arithmatic, history, naturnal sciences and religion is required as the necessary illustrations and explanations of the lessons by the teachers is essential to the clear understanding of the subject.</p>
   <p>The children which were obliged to stay away too long from classes have a difficulty in understanding the subjects taught, become discouraged and loose all interest in the subject. Only the most gifted children are able to overcome those handicaps. It is against the laws of pedagogy to send the child away during the school hour even for a short period because the children use all their mental capacities during the explanation of the lesson given by their teacher in order to have a clear understanding of the matter under discussion. The teacher is even advised to stand in one place, if possible, so as not to distract the pupils attention. These pedagogical laws are based on age long pedagogical experience. Thats why its a violation of the most elementary <pb facs="5423968_2_0130.jpg" n="3"/>laws of pedagogy to have the children rehearsing for weeks and months leaving or returning to their classes in the midst of instructions, going to or returning from rehearsals. This not only creates an unnecessary disturbance but makes other pupils in attentive because all are more interested in the progress of the future play than in what the teacher has to tell them. The teachers task is them made so much more difficult as she must go from bench to bench trying to pacify "the babblers,"and even though the teacher is lucky or able to restore order the minds of the pupils are to occupied with rehearsals to care for lectures and teachers' explanations.</p>
   <p>Further, the minds of the little amateurs are so occupied with their roles in the play that they loose all interest in their textbooks and even in their sleep they either recite their part in the play or go through the hysterics of weeping or spasms of laughter.</p>
   <p>During the examination in the class the child gives the lack of time as <pb facs="5423968_2_0131.jpg" n="4"/>as an excuse for not having prepared the lesson; to much being devoted to the memorizing of role. And though the rehearsals could be arranged after the school hours it would be against the law of hygiene because the children should not be kept in school longer than the required period without the detriment to their health, otherwise their bodies are too tired and their minds too dull for any intellectual effort at home. Having the rehearsals in the evenings has nothing to command them either as it exposes the unprotected children to the dangers of the night. There are also objections to the kind of plays selected. Very often the children are trying to portray the character of people and their ideas as well as gestures and behavior of which they cannot have even the slightest notion because it is beyond and above understanding of the childs mentality.</p>
   <p>The child is required to memorize the role which it later recites "without feeling, without accent, without life and the movements of the child make that queen and a Saint appear a caricature." There is then no benefit either to the school or the child, on the contrary there is a bad and ruinous influence on the child's moral development. The views of the majority of experienced priests and pedagogians agree with our ideas in this matter. The views of the physicians <pb facs="5423968_2_0132.jpg" n="5"/>who agree with us on this question from the hygenical stand point will be expressed in the next issue.</p>
