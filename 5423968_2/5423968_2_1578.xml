   <p>The undersigned wishes to inform all Polish tradesmen, namely, locksmiths, blacksmiths and machinists, that a labor society embodying these trades was organized on December 8 for the purpose of uniting all Polish workers in these fields.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of this organization is to assist members in securing employment in their respective fields. This assistance will be extended to those that have had experience in the above-mentioned trades in America, and to those that have recently arrived from Europe. In general we wish to better the lot of our compatriots.</p>
   <p>Further information about this society may be obtained by attending the next <pb facs="5423968_2_1579.jpg" n="2"/>meeting to be held on December 15, at Lechert's Hall, Division and Cleaver Streets. The proceedings will start promptly at 4 P. M.</p>
   <p>All our compatriots experienced in the three mentioned trades are urged to attend this meeting. They are invited to take part in the discussions. New members are welcomed.</p>
   <p>J. Szymanski, secretary.</p>
