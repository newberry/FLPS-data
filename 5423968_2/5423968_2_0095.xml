   <p>Sunday, May 10, 1908, the dedication of the new St. Stanislaus school will take place. The societies of surrounding parishes, combined with all the societies of St. Stanislaus parish, will open this great celebration by parading through the neighborhood streets; bands playing, and with one of the most beautiful banner displays ever seen by the people.</p>
   <p>At Wood street and Chicago avenue the Polish cavalry will form an arch way for His excellency, Archbishop Quigley; thence they will parade back on the same streets to the school of St. Stanislaus.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father Gordon, pastor of St. Stanislaus parish, invited Charles Warren Fairbanks, Vice-President of the United States, to be present at this great celebrated dedication. Mr. Fairbanks and a delegation of high officials accepted this invitation and will take part in this great dedication.</p>

   <p>The dedication ceremonies will be opened by Archbishop Quigley, with the assistance of many priests. The police will be summoned to keep law and order, due to the fact that so many thousands of people will be present and all present will try to get to the front to witness this dedication; to avoid injuries to the women and children the police will be there. Following Archbishop Quigley's speech, Mr. A. J. Kwasigroch, leader of the choir and of Polish organists of Chicago, will conduct a number of Polish songs; this will be followed by the blessing of the new school by Archbishop Quigley.</p>
   <p>Banquet</p>
   <p>At 5 o'clock, after the dedication ceremonies are finished, a banquet will be given in the St. Stanilaus auditorium, by the Theodore Kosciuszko Citizens Club, under the supervision of Father Gordon.</p>
