   <p>Polish trade in this country is as yet in its infancy. Thus far it has not developed sufficiently to attain the position of power that the trade of other nationalities has. It is certain, however, that it could have become powerful if all our people had patronized Polish businessmen and stores. Instead of taking our money to strangers and frequently fattening our most bitter enemies, let the Poles take it to their own people, let them support Polish trade and commerce. Individual wealth in trade, commerce, and agriculture is the wealth of the whole nation. If our people do not develop agriculture, trade, and commerce in this country as others have developed them, then our lot will always be hard labor in factories, coal mines, forests and city streets. Other nationalities will not support Polish trade and commerce at all because they have their own. It depends entirely upon Poles to keep their hard-earned money in Polish hands.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1497.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>wherever we turn in the larger American centers, we notice huge stores and million-dollar skyscrapers, packed from top to bottom with articles of every description. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>e notice gigantic factories, railroads, electric and gas plants, streetcar lines, and every branch of trade and commerce--vast wealth. But all this is in the hands of strangers. Our people can barely afford to have a small business place; their small trade limps because it is not supported properly by our own nationality. Being insufficiently developed, Polish business cannot attract strangers. A great deal of hard-earned money of the Polish laborer as well as the millions of dollars which he has turned over to strangers, lies in huge stores, factories, railroads, and other links of industrial and commercial development. It is not enough that he give strangers the best he has in the form of strong muscles, ability, and diligence; in addition he relinquishes to strangers the meager pay he receives in return for his labor. By so doing he makes our people poorer. We must understand that only through mutual strength and support can we hope to raise Polish industry and commerce in America to a place where it will be at least equal to that of strangers. Let us, therefore, patronize Polish businessmen as much as possible, <pb facs="5423968_2_1498.jpg" n="3"/>and not patronize strangers, because other nationalities do not support us in anything.</p>
   <p>Polish businessmen, on the other hand, should endeavor to serve their consumers as well as possible and give them quality at the same price as strangers. When this is done they will attract their fellow Poles and will always be able to rely upon Polish support. Numerous complaints are heard that a Polish businessman is abrupt to his customers, that he fails to give them as good quality as strangers do, that the service is slow, that the store does not have what the purchaser wants, and things of similar nature. These complaints, naturally, cannot pertain to all businessmen, for, after all, even among our people there are those who know how to give courteous, fast, and capable service to consumers, and who have products that are not in the least inferior to those sold by people of other nationalities. But, then, there are also those to whom the charges mentioned apply. If a person has no business sense and does not know how, or does not wish, to serve his customers courteously and well, it were best that he leave business alone; he himself will not profit in business and he will harm others more capable than he. Business is a profession that requires long years of study and the sacrifice of a great deal of energy <pb facs="5423968_2_1499.jpg" n="4"/>and money. A bungler in any profession will remain only....a bungler. He will gain nothing himself and will do harm to others. To conduct business it is necessary to have a "vein of cunning", if one may use the term, energy, and....a knowledge of things.</p>
   <p>In addition to that, if a Polish businessman wishes success, it is necessary to advertise in newspapers, as businessmen of other nationalities do. They spend huge sums of money annually for such purposes and, from all indications, they profit from it; they would not spend money foolishly. Today, advertising is the greatest power. Polish businessmen should make use of it if they wish to have success. If Polish businessmen make their wares known to others through the means of newspapers, then it will not be long before they will be on equal footing with businessmen of other nationalities.</p>
