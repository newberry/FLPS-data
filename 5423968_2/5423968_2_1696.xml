   <p>The police department has taken complete control of the Stockyards. One disorderly mob after another had to be dispersed, many were arrested, and scores were hurt. Agitators stood upon the arms of the strikers and spoke words of encouragement for the continuance of the strike. The police, acting upon the orders of Chief Fitzmorris, made an attempt to cover all points of vantage in the area of the Yards but this failed when sporadic disorders broke out in various places. At each scene the police were greeted with stones. Shots were fired many times, but fortunately there were no fatal casualties. The police had tear gas bombs in readiness.</p>
   <p>Those who were scattered by the officers gathered about 31st and Loomis Streets and began to throw bricks at the passing streetcars that were carrying strikebreakers to work. Many persons, including children who were returning from school, were hurt by flying glass. The police had <pb facs="5423968_2_1697.jpg" n="2"/>difficulty in breaking up the violent mob.</p>
   <p>One of the most vicious struggles took place at the closed gates of Davis Square. The people attacked the police and sought shelter behind the buildings. When the officers began to wield their clubs only then did the angry crowd split up, but this took some time.</p>
   <p>As the police were breaking up this mob, riots started in many other places simultaneously. Practically the same tactics were used by the disorderly element. The Chief of Police expressed hopes that the strike situation has improved, although there are a number of those who continually attack the police in their line of duty. According to him, it is believed that this group belongs to the "Red" party.</p>
   <p>Many of the upstarts among the strikers were arrested and fined by Judge Samuel H. Trude. Some were held to be tried before the Grand Jury.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1698.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The unions disclosed that a general strike will take place Monday, when other labor groups employed in the Yards will participate. Alexander Nielubowski, president of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butchers (sic), asserts that over six hundred teamsters will go out on strike today or tomorrow and that fourteen hundred men from the wagon repair departments would strike Monday. At the same time, news came from the packing house officials that conditions were getting back to normal in their plants.</p>
   <p>The attorney representing the owners of the packing houses announced that if the strike does not stop, wholesale arrests will be made. A few of the officials said that some of the strikers are gradually returning to their former jobs and that the, strikers are not interfering with the returning workers.</p>
   <p>The first steps taken toward a better understanding were by Hayes of the <pb facs="5423968_2_1699.jpg" n="4"/>Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher's Union (sic). He presented the reason for the strike. According to him, the misunderstanding between the workers and the companies during the War and the continued refusal of recognizing the union were the primary causes. Arbitration, which Judge Alschuler used to settle the difficulties during the War, will most likely be resorted to in order to bring about a mutual understanding of the workers and company officials. In conclusion, he said that he and his assistants are of the opinion that the public will demand arbitrary methods as a means of settling the strike, to which the workers will agree.</p>
   <p>Local strike leaders, although they showed signs of negotiating with the owners of the packing industry, are preparing for a wider spread of the strike. Yesterday, notices were sent to other workers employed in the Yards to join their cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1700.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>James Lisner, 4323 So. Marshfield Avenue, and Albert Stazik, 4512, So. Marshfield Avenue, were arrested. Officer W. D. Jablowski was injured during the arrest.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Sobrto, 4507 So. Marshfield Avenue, and her son were arrested for throwing stones at Officer Willard Malone.</p>
   <p>The following were also arrested: Louis Korlaski, 4541 So. Marshfield Avenue; George Staniski, 4900 So. Honore Street; Francis August, 4834 So. Paulina Street; Joseph Zalak and Casimir Marcejla, 1643 W. 44th Street, and many others.</p>
   <p>The price of meat has skyrocketed to new heights. A pound of pork is selling at thirty cents per pound and a pound of beef at nineteen cents.</p>
