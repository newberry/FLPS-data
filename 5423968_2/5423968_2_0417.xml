   <p>"It was so nicely written that everyone in the house cried," said a good workingman, Plewa, everytime he brought back the household Bible borrowed from my library. I listened with real satisfaction to the discussions about this or that book by the peasants, which several of them had read and then they argued about the heroes of the novels.</p>
   <p>Often I heard an old gray-haired man reading aloud to the women who listened, without loss of interest, while they picked feathers late into the night.</p>
   <p>The grateful listeners, men and women, encouraged the reader with outbursts of joy, anger, or floods of tears. Today this habit of reading in the evening has not stopped in the old country where the people are eager to get hold of a book and read together - but it has stopped with us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The greater number of our families spend their evenings in a new and different fashion. The daughter returning from the shop is transformed in a few minutes from a plain working girl to a powdered and coiffured lady - dress and hat in the newest mode - leaves the house because there is waiting for an hour on some street corner, with chattering teeth, her "Frank" with whom she is to go to a dance.</p>
   <p>The greater number of our young men are doing likewise, and the older men, if not in a saloon are at a neighbor's, with a full pail, playing poker. The mother while talking to one of her neighbors is criticizing her other neighbors; while the children are on the streets until late at night.</p>
   <p>Who would care to read? For the younger generation, and the older also, there appears to be too much paper and print in books. Books should be a necessity in our daily life. They educate the heart, develop the brain and give information about many useful things; therefore, the parents, if they cannot read themselves, should encourage their children to read, in the evening, good <pb facs="5423968_2_0419.jpg" n="3"/>useful books and awaken in them a love for books and in this way save themselves much sorrow. A child is not spoiled reading at home instead of being on the street or attending dances; they will also learn to speak correctly. The fact is that numerous English books with immoral contents can be bought for a few cents, and our young people read them eagerly. It is a most sacred duty of the parents to devote some part of the evening to reading together with the children. Instead of Mary running out to meet her beau, if Frank is sincere, he can spend the evening talking and reading, or in playing amusing games; then fewer of our young people would be ruined. "He who runs away from the shadow of his mother or father carries the devil in his pocket." Evenings should be a restful time, after a day's work, to feed the soul, for it also needs food.</p>
   <p>He who labors physically during the day should educate his mind in the evening; he who works mentally should spend the evenings in some physical exertion.</p>
