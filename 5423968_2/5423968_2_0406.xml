   <p>Evening schools will be opened for the benefit of the European immigrants, who can receive an education without cost to them. Persons who cannot speak the English language, which is a hardship for them in our country, should take advantage of this opportunity and benefit from these evening schools, under all circumstances.</p>
   <p>The educational program is very extensive and contains the following: mathematics, history, languages, and, most important of all, courses in factory trades.</p>
   <p>For women and girls there also will be a large field, because they will be able to take the following courses: millinery, sewing, cooking, book-keeping, stenography, etc.</p>
   <p>The evening schools will be open every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. There is absolutely no charge and courses will begin on October 7th, <pb facs="5423968_2_0407.jpg" n="2"/>1912.</p>
   <p>Upon signing it is necessary to pay only one dollar deposit, which the Board of Education will refund at the end of the evening school term.</p>
   <p>The Jewish element has taken advantage of these evening schools, and has the largest attendance; next are the Germans, the Italians, and other nationalities. There are but very few Poles, and what is the result?</p>
   <p>We see it in our daily life: other nationalities are much further advanced and control higher positions in politics; industry, etc, than we Poles.</p>
   <p>It is high time for us Poles to awaken from our long sleep and pull ourselves together, by working hard to elevate ourselves and our nationality. All of us Poles, who want to learn something, should attend these schools in order that we could become equal with the other nationalities.</p>
