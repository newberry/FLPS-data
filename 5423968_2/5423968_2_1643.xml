   <p>The strike in the Stockyards has come to an end and the strikers are returning to their jobs at the present time. The strike has affected the Town of Lake, Bridgeport, and St. Peter and Paul communities. It is expected that conditions will improve shortly, pending the return of the strikers to their former positions.</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers Union (sic), Dennis Lane, received an order several days ago to call off the strike. Mr. Lane says this action was taken because there was no adequate means for providing for the destitute strikers and the situation was getting worse each day. He has recommended that all strikers return to their work. Whether or not they all receive their places is not definitely known.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1644.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is said that the apparent cause for the discontinuance of the strike was the condition of extreme poverty among many of the strikers. During the entire strike period the packing houses were kept in operation by strikebreakers, who appeared in large numbers.</p>
