   <p>We have referred to this subject many times in the past; we talked about this subject in reality on every occasion. Many times we had to fight to resist the forceful attempts made to disorganize the parochial schools. The American Poles, principally the children attending parochial schools, were the ones mostly affected by the misunderstanding and hard feelings caused through the efforts of the organizers.</p>
   <p>Writing about equalizing these schools we must compare the teachers' contributions, their respective systems, programs, incomes, and the results.</p>
   <p>The Most Reverend Father Paul Gutowski, pastor of St. Casimir parish, said: "This parochial school of St. Casimir is under my personal supervision."</p>
   <p>This school, after thirteen years of existence, has been so well cared for that at the present time it consists of sixteen classes divided equally, <pb facs="5423968_2_0090.jpg" n="2"/>eight classes for boys and eight for girls. Each section consists of eight classes. The teachers are of the Felician Order.</p>
   <p>Father Gutowski invited the examination commission in charge of high schools to come and give an examination to the children that have completed their eighth year of schooling at St. Casimir, and compare their marks with the children of public schools.</p>
   <p>The examination took place the following week among the graduating students totaling 28 students. To the surprise of the high school superintendent in charge of this examination, only one student received a mark of 75, while the rest of the class averaged between 80 and 100.</p>
   <p>The superintendent said that not one public school averaged as high a mark as this parochial school. On the strength of this examination, the school of St. Casimir received a charter, entitling students of this school admittance to any high school in Chicago without taking an entry examination.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0091.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is, truthfully speaking, a huge success, and credit should be given to Father Gutowski for his splendid work in the past, and wish him success and prosperity for the future. He is also in favor of having parents send their children to school, not to work, at an early age.</p>
   <p>The success of the students at the past examinations proves that the parochial schools are equal to the public schools at all times. The Polish people hope that this is enough proof to convince the optimistic people that the students of the parochial schools are not inferior to those of the public schools, and are asking the parents of other nationalities not to forbid their children to play with the children that attend parochial schools. Aren't we all equal in this city as well as in this country?</p>
   <p>Let the people laugh at the work of the Polish people in Chicago; this does not mean that the Poles should flinch and discontinue expanding. St. Casimir is only one of the many Polish parochial schools in Chicago, but there are many in other cities in the United States.</p>
   <p>The parochial schools are continuously expanding and improving their buildings according to the style of the present day, and the same is true of <pb facs="5423968_2_0092.jpg" n="4"/>their methods of teaching.</p>
   <p>The Polish immigrants that have come to Chicago in recent years have compared the public schools with the parochial, and have justly stated that of the two, the parochial is by far a better and more advanced form of teaching. The marks, student averages, and scholastic standing of parochial schools, are far superior to those of the public schools.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless there are people working against parochial schools, people who are constantly finding fault with their style of teaching and rating them below the public schools. They also claim that the teachers lack qualification and competence.</p>
   <p>The greatest percent of people making these complaints against the parochial schools do not know the system and method of teaching in these schools; all they possess is a fraction of the true systems of teaching used in public schools and according to these, judge the parochial school. These complaining people never donated money for the upkeep of any church or school, still they <pb facs="5423968_2_0093.jpg" n="5"/>feel that they have the right to express their inner feeling on a subject of so great importance. Do not judge something you do not possess or understand. What compels people to make these complaints is not known. Is it ignorance or bad will? For this ignorance we have medicine - visit the school, familarize yourself with it and convince yourself with has work and then we can talk. For bad will we haven't any medicine, but unfortunately it plays the most important role.</p>
   <p>Many people cannot be convinced or persuaded to change their ideas and attitudes about certain things. These people have one-track minds and will dispute over the least little subject.</p>
   <p>We have endeavored to reflect the spirit which persuades a body of students whose paths to success lie in the observance of all true virtues. We sincerely hope that in the future this printed memorandum of our efforts will aid us and tend to strengthen the friendship which already binds us.</p>
   <p>A school can somewhat be compared to a nation. It cannot be fully organized <pb facs="5423968_2_0094.jpg" n="6"/>unless, it has serious and intelligent citizens who can materialize their connections and sacrifice self pride for its basic principles.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the pioneer movements at this time will become more centralized with the oncoming years and the stability of its existence firmly rooted in school activities.</p>
