<title level="a">THE EMIGRATION REVIEW ON AMERICAN POLES</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In its last few editions, the Emigration Review has published a detailed report .... of the travels of Doctor Dunikowski in America, ending in its last number with the following remarks which are of great interest to us:</p>
   <p>".... Professor Dunikowski's journey proved that there is actually an impressive number of Poles in North America, and that these countrymen of ours, living together in large groups, have every chance of retaining their original nationality forever. There are a million and a half, or perhaps by this time, two million people who are free, well-to-do, and are already somewhat enlightened through their own Polish schools in the practice of American life. But these people will not easily permit themselves to be divested of their Polish nationality even by the Americans.</p>
   <p>"In many sections, a third generation of Poles is already rising. They <pb facs="5423968_2_1190.jpg" n="2"/>are well-built physically, handsome, and of a lively temperament as a result of better physical and spiritual nourishment than the old country could have afforded them. These people, who constituted a burden to their homeland, or possibly would have increased the death rate after a short and miserable life, are attaining a decent position in America.</p>
   <p>"With us in Poland, they occupied the lowest intellectual level; in America they are changing beyond recognition; they are becoming intelligent and useful citizens. They learn to read and write the Polish language in Polish schools built at their own expense. Although it is true that these schools have their faults, they have one invaluable point in their favor--they exist and keep alive the national spirit.</p>
   <p>"Practically all of these people have acquired a deep love for their mother country and are doing their utmost to retain the Polish language and the Catholic faith; economic well-being and hope promote rapid germination of <pb facs="5423968_2_1191.jpg" n="3"/>these spiritual needs.</p>
   <p>"There are in the United States, whole sections with a majority of seventy to eighty per cent of people who are truly Polish, as for instance, northern Wisconsin, and certain parts of northern Michigan. In sections of Chicago, as in Stanislawow, Wojciechow, [St. Stanislaus', St. Adalbert's] there are 100,000 Polish people; Buffalo ...., Detroit, New York, and Brooklyn have 40,000 each; Cleveland, (neighborhoods of Krakow, Poznan), has 25,000, not counting the smaller sections.</p>
   <p>"There seem to be enough of our people abroad then, to awaken us from the apathy with which we have looked upon emigration. We should interest ourselves in, and not underrate these Polish masses overseas, who in any case may give valuable contribution to our national cause.</p>
   <p>"In the first place, our newspapers should take a different attitude toward this problem than has been true heretofore, for their attitude has been essentially humorous. Interest in the Poles abroad will require no material <pb facs="5423968_2_1192.jpg" n="4"/>sacrifices, for our countrymen are fairly prosperous; at most, we might be expected to supply their public libraries with Polish books. Authors and publishers who would donate books might even expect profit, for the workers there buy the books that they like. One edition, printed in Posen and sold in America, brought its publishers a fortune."</p>
   <p>The interesting Emigration Review closes the report with an enumeration of the greatest needs of the Poles in America, and with a promise that it will return again and again to the affairs of the "fourth partition," as they call us.</p>
