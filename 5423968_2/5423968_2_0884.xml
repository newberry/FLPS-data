  <body>
   <p>There exists in the United States a band of Lithuanians saturated with a mad hatred against Poland; and who, most probably for German money, are spreading defamation against Poland by means of English pamphlets. Lately, they have been circulating in Chicago, at Humboldt Park, three kinds of circulars. On one of the circulars there appears a bloody hand, giving the impression that it was stained with the blood of innocent victims, and on the sleeve there appears a Polish White Eagle.</p>
   <p>On another circular there is a sketch representing a woman who is tied to a post with a rope; two Polish soldiers, in Polish caps called "Rogatywka," are whipping her unmercifully; another woman, who was whipped to a state of unconsciousness, is lying on the ground, while a man hastening to the resuce of the tormented women, is being dragged by his hair by one Polish soldier, and beaten by another.</p>
   <p>On the third circular a bull represents Russia tearing down a fence which represents The League of Nations; on the side is a fox, sitting on Lithuanian soil and barking at the bull; but Poland is the tail of that fox. Besides this there are slanderous and defamatory telegrams which are reprinted from English anti-Polish newspapers, telling of the alleged "Pogroms of the Jews in Poland and the terrorizing of Lithuanian and Ukrainian people by Polish soldiers; about the killing of innocent people by Polish imperialism, endangering the democracy of all central Europe."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0885.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Strictly speaking, these circulars contain nothing but lies, slander and defamation that have no foundation from A to Z, - dirty attacks.</p>
   <p>In reality, these attacks will not harm Poland. This agitation, incited by the Germans and the Jews, will only expose their ignorance and lack of humanity. Such action is but an idle threat; shooting with an empty gun, looking for a hate where there is none. Such behaviour creates only distrust between the Poles and the Lithuanians. It is the duty of every Lithuanian to crush such base agitation in its infancy.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians should realize that their future is with Poland, otherwise, they will be absorbed by the Germans and Bolsheviks.</p>
