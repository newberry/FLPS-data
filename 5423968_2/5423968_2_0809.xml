<title level="a">FORTY-HOUR DEVOTION COMES TO AN END AT ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKI'S PARISH</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>February 21, 22, and 23 have been three days of great devotion at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Church. Thousands of people attended services and offered prayers during this annual forty-hour Devotion. During the day and evening both churches of the parish, the upper and lower were filled with devout people.</p>
   <p>During the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, groups of children representing various orders sang and prayed. The girls were dressed in white.</p>
   <p>Both churches were decorated with fresh flowers, ferns, and fan-like palms. The center altars were lighted by hundreds of candles glowing magnificently. Six sermons were given every day. The visiting priests extolled the word of God, moved the people to repentance and prayer, and guided them on the path of Christianity. After the sermon, the devout took their places at the confessionals.</p>

   <p>Many visiting Polish priests, who had come to help Father Vincent Barzynski, were instrumental in making this year's services a great success. Three from Milwaukee, one from Hammond, and nine from Chicago participated in the rites.</p>
   <p>The Resurrection Fathers, noted for their European hospitality, prepared an interesting schedule for their visiting brethren. The entertainment was patterned after that of old Poland.</p>
   <p>Would to God that this sacred religious ceremony may implant in the hearts of those who participated in the services, as well as in the hearts of all the people of the world, a lasting belief in the word of God.</p>
