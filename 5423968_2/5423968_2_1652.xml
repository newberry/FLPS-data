   <p>The Stockyards' strikers are making an effort to have the local government set up an arbitration board and investigate their grievances. They want this board to judge for itself whether or not a packing house worker, earning from $12 to $18 per week, can properly feed and clothe his family, besides paying the gas, coal, and other bills.</p>
   <p>All those persons who witnessed the unwarranted shooting on the part of the police last Monday, when a parade was staged by the strikers, are requested to come to the union headquarters at Slowacki's Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets. It has been reported that Chief of Police Fitzmorris has come to Town of Lake to determine for himself the state of conditions.</p>
   <p>Anthony Mrozek (sic), who was shot in Monday's parade, is still in a critical condition at St. Mary of Nazareth's Hospital. His condition has turned a little for the better.</p>
