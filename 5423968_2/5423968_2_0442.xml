   <p>The war with alcohol is not yet over and already there is appearance of another one, the Tobacco War. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the organization that was intrumental in winning prohibition, will try to deprive humanity of pipes, cigars, and cigarettes.</p>
   <p>According to the information received from the representatives of that organization, the methods used will be the same as that in war with alcohol.</p>
   <p>At first there will be an agitation among minors, who will be taught about the harmful results caused by smoking tobacco. The anti-tobacco propaganda will be spread throughout the country and in every state. At the same time there will be a thorough and impartial investigation conducted, as to the evil effects caused by smoking tobacco, to individuals and society as a whole.</p>
   <p>The same group of people who prepared statements in regards to alcohol will also be engaged in collecting statistics and facts pointing out the injurious effects of nicotine.</p>
   <p>There will also be organized a committee for investigation of the harm of tobacco from the medical point of view.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0443.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So far, judging from the preparation going on, the anti-tobacco crusade has not yet started in earnest. At present, only war material is collected; necessary funds, organization of workers for new agitation, but the preparation has begun. Now is the right time for society to declare whether it agrees on war with tobacco or not.</p>
   <p>It is easy to foresee that the people as a whole will not remain indifferent to the tobacco crusade and will defend smoking. Tobacco cannot be as damning as alcohol because the effects are not so fatal. Very seldom we here of death or any other serious injury caused by using tobacco as we do by alcohol.</p>
   <p>The influence of tobacco is very mild and in many cases it supplies us with pleasure and happiness. During the World War there was a great agitation for collecting tobacco for the soldiers. Tobacco was a great comfort and pleasure to the soldiers, it helped them to forget their troubles, it quieted their nerves, built their energy and gave them encouragement. The tobacco war is causing a serious uneasiness as to what we shall be deprived of next.</p>
