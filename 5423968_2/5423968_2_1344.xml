   <p>In the country of the White Plague, the temporary prosperity of American industry was instantly exhausted when manufacturers, in their aim to reduce the wages of labor and to lengthen working hours, made conditions worse and it is most abominable in New England, the land of the White Scourge where textile mills predominate. Of all branches of American industry this intolerable existence is most dominant in the textile industry, where low wages and an unsanitary environment are destroying the working man's vitality. Health conditions, not only in dye-houses, but in spinning and textile mills are terrible. Probably no other industry in the United States has called so many strikes and lockouts.</p>
   <p>The decayed sections of Pennsylvania and other mining states, together with the New England States, where textile mills are the chief source of employment, are the greatest offenders. And in spite of the warning given by President Roosevelt against the reduction of wages, the manufacturers here decided to force a 12 1/2% reduction, and in some cases as much as 27%; at the <pb facs="5423968_2_1345.jpg" n="2"/>same time lengthening the working hours, and increasing the speed of production. This action compelled the unions to come out in defense of the workingmen; a strike resulted which affected all manufacturers. This was shown in the last union communication. During the past week in New Hampshire, workingmen of three factories went out on a strike. The union is trying to adjust the reduction of wages by conferences and in certain factores through arbitration. If this attempt should fail the strikes will inundate New England.</p>
   <p>The rapidity of wage reductions instigated by textile mill owners was revealed at the end of last year; the union, however, entered with energy against this speedy onslaught. Manufacturers, nevertheless, did not deem this a victory, for they were successful in controlling the administration of the union in New Bedford. This was, however, accomplished secretly, and without the approval of union officials. A lower wage was agreed upon, which fact, in turn, demanded a reduction throughout the textile industry. The treason was <pb facs="5423968_2_1346.jpg" n="3"/>then exposed by the New Bedford Textile Council: it rebounded immediately with an intense echo. Nine factories in New Hampshire,together with two in Vermont, and the entire state of Massachusettes, announced a curtailment in the factory ranks. This course demanded organization of the working class; it has been followed energetically up to the present time, which was disclosed in Boston by the main union communication. The need for such an affiliation is constantly increasing in New England and other places because of the steady growth in this industry.</p>
   <p>The past week, from Monday, March 7th, to Saturday, was devoted to investigations which were arranged by the Senate Committee in behalf of our American youth. Three hours each afternoon had been scheduled for hearings. As a result the entire ranks of American cities started pilgrimages to Washington under the auspices of the so-called Youth Congress which consisted of young men's associations from the whole country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1347.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This drive, as far as Chicago is concerned, consisted of about one hundred delegates who departed to the Nation's capitol, armed with the resolutions of many meetings, wherein youth demands educational and working assurance. One point in its request is that public labor bureaus be extended for the benefit of the unemployed youth.</p>
   <p>An industrial conference was held in Chicago with an attendance of about 2,000, among which were many prominent social workers, pedagogues, industrial representatives, and union officials. These two-thousand persons represented the salt of American citizens who,after many bitter controversies, analyzed and brought out the Nation's future need.</p>
   <p>"It is brutal to take away a man's only means of support, especially when he has a family to care for."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1348.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>These words were acknowledged with a storm of applause. "Who spoke thus? "some of the readers will ask. Yes, who?</p>
   <p>Probably some representative of the C.I.O. with a communistic outlook; or perhaps some dreamer from President Roosevelt's Brain Trust. No! it was said by a factory owner, The White Crow was Harry L. Nunn, president of a large shoe manufacturing firm of Milwaukee, Wis. "Labor should receive the same recognition as capital, "said this strange man.</p>
   <p>"Nothing can be more brutal than releasing a workingman from employment; he has a family, and no means for its support. However, it is easily understood what influence can be exerted on the toiler who knows that in the treasury of the factory is enough money for the officials' fabulous salaries, and also to pay dividends while he, the laborer, is thrown out on the pavement," further averred this original White Crow of the industrial kingdom. There are, however, sympathizers among manufacturers, but alas! - they are in the minority.</p>
