   <p>A sacrilegious ceremony of laying a cornerstone of schismatic Kolasinski's "church" was conducted in Detroit, on Sunday, May 5, on the feast of the Pentecost.</p>
   <p>Were Kolasinski to admit that he created some new form of religion, by erecting a church for this new denomination, even with all the self-manufactured ceremonies (he himself dedicated the cornerstone), perhaps then we would not call this a sacrilege, although, until now, every action of this apostate constitutes a moral offense. But this former Catholic priest actually committed a sacrilege, because he endeavors to form the conviction among the people who follow him with a peculiar fanaticism, that he has remained true to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Since in the presence of these people he could not perform the ceremony of dedicating the cornerstone of the "church" that he is building without a bishop, he imported some man, evidently a fraud, whom he <pb facs="5423968_2_0807.jpg" n="2"/>presented to the people as the Bishop of Podole, Menceslaus Hordnicki, who had arrived to perform the ceremony. In the Detroit newspaper, The Evening News we find a very extensive report of this whole comedy. The reporter is himself aware that all of this was a comedy, because in speaking of the hypothetical bishop he always inserts the word "bishop" in quotes. He describes the "bishop" in this manner: "Menceslaus Hordnicki (the 'bishop'), is an equitable man, whose gray hair and slightly wrinkled face indicate that he must number some fifty years of age. A stooped form, broad shoulders, thick and hard hands prove that he must be more accustomed to heavy manual labor than to the performance of ecclesiastical functions."</p>
   <p>Kolasinski told the reporter that the "bishop" speaks neither English, German nor Polish, but only Russian. Nor did this impostor utter a single word. Instead his "secretary" made a short address in Polish. In addition, he stated: "Pay no heed to the bishop or the Pope, but turn only to God. Bishop Foley did not want to dedicate a church for Father Kolasinski; now you see that a bishop was found and you will have your own church instead of begging for seats in Bishop Foley's church."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0808.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Some twelve to fifteen thousand people were supposed to have participated in this dedication of the cornerstone, including associations with banners, music bands, and the like; the homes of Kolasinski's followers were decorated with Polish national banners and with flowers.</p>
   <p>The "bishop" left for the station in the afternoon to arrive in Chicago, as Kolasinski stated, and then go on to Cleveland. However, they arrived at the station at five o'clock in the afternoon instead of nine in the evening. The reporter spoke to the "bishop" in English, German, and French, but evidently he was not understood. Later Kolasinski escorted his "bishop" to the home of Joseph Przybylowski, where this swindler spent the night.</p>
