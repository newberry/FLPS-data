   <p>In many instances the cause of family quarrels is the failure on the part of the wife to develop a liking for keeping proper order in the home. In court the husbands claim that due to slovenliness they become disgusted with their wives and neglect them.</p>
   <p>It is true that there is no greater fault in a housekeeper than her failure to keep an orderly and clean home. The husband stays long enough in dirt and dust during working hours so when he gets home he desires that his home, be it humble or elegant should be kept in order. A good wife and housekeeper will sweeten the life of the husband,who works so hard for that piece of bread, if she keeps clean the place where he seeks rest after returning from work, cares for his linens and other things pertaining to order. Woe be to him, who has picked <pb facs="5423968_2_0612.jpg" n="2"/>himself a lifes companion, who has no conception of proper order. The home then becomes disgusting, the family becomes indifferent, the wife becomes aggravating and the husband starts to avoid his home, uses intoxicants freely and finally starts breaking of pots and plates over the head until the marriage ends in a divorce.</p>
   <p>Everything in the home should be kept in order. The wife and mother should be distinguished by keeping clean her own body and dress. You do not have to enter the home to see how it looks. To pass by it is sufficient. Where one sees torn curtains in the window, where the window panes are smeared, where not one bit of neatness is to be found in front of the home, no grass not a flower or shrub, there you will find the inside of the home is no better.</p>
   <p>You can also tell the mother by her children. When their dresses are clean and their faces washed, they have a clean mother, but just as soon as they are dirty and ragged you can not expect much from the mother. Therefore, the wife and mother is much to blame in regard to her family, because the children appear emaciated, pale and sickly, not from hunger but from dirt.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0613.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Of course, you do not have to look at the husband and father. His shirt is dirty and torn, garments all rags. He is as lean as a rail, because he has not eaten regularly nor relished his meals because of a filthy home, he is infested with vermin and is worrying. The home no more being pleasing to him he goes to saloons in order to find enjoyment. If he has already lost his courage and energy he drinks more and more and finally the poor unfortunate becomes a confirmed drunkard. All this is true, but for what reason? Because of a slovenly and negligent wife.</p>
   <p>It is true, that fortunately and especially among the Polish women we have very few of this kind, but it never hurts to present such a sad picture as a warning to our women readers.</p>
