   <p>After we have devoted considerable time to books in schools, colleges and universities, we yearn to apply ourselves to the practice of our profession, or to business, or to whatever we have chosen for the daily grind. This daily grind then becomes a habit, so much so, that we ultimately become so many Babbitts, or similar characters. Hence, "Do you read?" is a fair question to propound to any of us. Apply the question to yourself, Dear Reader. Ask yourself, what have I read since I left school? Did you limit your reading of the newspaper to certain news items, or to the sport page, or have you read the many informative articles which we find in the modern newspaper? Have you perused any of the magazines, and do you do so regularly? How many books have you read, say, during the last six months? If you did read a few, what sort of books were they? Were they only the widely advertised novels, or did you add to your store of knowledge by reading books on social, economical, historical, or scientific subjects?</p>
   <p>The man who is ambitions to forge ahead should find interest in publications which are replete with the necessary information in regards to progress in every field of human activity. Do you find interest in books recording the latest archeological discoveries? What do you know of the restlessness of the natives of India, <pb facs="5423968_2_0392.jpg" n="2"/>Mahatma Ghandi, their leader, of the political situation in the Baltic republics and how it reflects upon the situation in Poland?</p>
   <p>Have books on psychological themes interested you?</p>
   <p>Why let the other fellow get ahead!</p>
