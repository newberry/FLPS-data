   <p>Last Sunday Chicago was resounding with sumptuous Irish festivities in celebration of the arrival of the president of Ireland, William T. Cosgrave.</p>
   <p>A solemn mass was said in St. Patriok's Church (the patron of Ireland), during which an Irish pastor, William J. McNamee, invoked the benediction for the high representative of Ireland and the Irish people.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by enthusiastic crowds to the Union station, from where he was to leave for Washington, Mr. William T. Cosgrave expressed his thanks for the tremendous reception and, speaking about certain Mr. M. J. Faherty, he said: "He is the type of an American of Irish blood, of whom Ireland is proud. Ireland is his mother and America his wife."</p>
   <p>We have here a clear example of how the Irish people love their fatherland <pb facs="5423968_2_0835.jpg" n="2"/>and its representatives. For them all Roman shrines are accessible and the princes of Roman-Catholic faith generously bestow benedictions upon them.</p>
   <p>Now, let us imagine that the president of Poland is to visit Chicago. Where would the Poles hold a solemn mass in his honor? Perhaps at Prelate Bona's, who once denounced him as a "degenerate and mason," or perhaps at Cardinal Mundelein's, who forbade even Archbishop Cieplak, a church dignitary, to perform a pontifical mass.</p>
   <p>O how poor are our Polish brothers, who must take these humiliations meekly and always be under the crushing boot of an Irishman or a German. They bring him in offering their Polish hearts and hard earned money, and what do they receive in exchange? Scorn and slaps, that's all.</p>
   <p>Won't we ever awaken and cast off the shackles of our Irish-Roman servitude and become a power assembled in our own Polish National Catholic church? We would not have to go to the Irishman nor the German <pb facs="5423968_2_0836.jpg" n="3"/>and humbly ask his permission to hold a solemn mass in honor of a high Polish dignitary.</p>
   <p>But let's not lose hope! There are signs that our community is beginning to awaken. More and more of our brothers abandon their Irish-Roman protectors and enlist in the Polish National Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>May the complete emancipation come soon!</p>
