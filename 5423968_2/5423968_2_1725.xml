   <p>Dr. A. Pietrzykowski, well-known among the Polish people of Chicago, was critically wounded yesterday in a streetcar while on his way to his office in Town of Lake. The streetcar had difficulty in getting pass the milling crowds between 45th and 46th Streets. It arrived on the scene during the time of the early rioting. Just as the car was making its way through the mob, someone of barbaric instinct threw an empty bottle at the car. The bottle struck the window where the doctor was sitting. Pieces of glass struck him in the head, causing severe wounds on the scalp and face. No panic was caused in the streetcar, although there were a number of women passengers.</p>
   <p>It was later discovered that the streetcar was attacked because some strikebreakers had boarded it. The strikers stopped the car and searched everywhere. Later, the conductor managed to get the car under way.</p>

   <p>Without doubt,this riotous demonstration will not get any public sympathy. On the contrary, it will do them harm.</p>
   <p>To Dr. Pietrzykowski - we send our condolences.</p>
