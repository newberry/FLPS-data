   <p>The annual Forty hours Devotion Services have taken place on December 6, 7, and 8, at St. John Cantius' Church. Hundreds of people, both young and old, filled the church during the three days. A majority of the parishioners partook of the Blessed Sacrament. Reverend Stephan Rowalczy, first pastor of this parish, opened the services by officiating at High Mass on December 6.</p>
   <p>Some of the visiting priests were: Theodore Czastka of North Chicago; Felix Prange of Bowmanville; W. Warakomski of Chicago Heights; and Leon Jasinski of Cragin.</p>
   <p>The altars were decorated with fresh cut roses, lilies, chrysanthemums, etc., and richly illuminated by many candles. The altars were not only decorated by the nuns of the parish school but also by many generous members of the parish and by visiting friends.</p>

   <p>Credit also is extended to Francis Nowicki, organist and choir director, for his untiring efforts in presenting the finest religious songs and music. His excellent organ playing, coupled with the sweet music of the church choir, made it seem as if the people were attending a religious concert.</p>
