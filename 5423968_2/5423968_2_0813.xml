<title level="a">"POSTNIK" OR POLISH CHRISTMAS EVE SUPPER.</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>Throughout Poland the day preceding Christmas was always observed as a Fast Day, even by the children.</p>
   <p>That Fast Day was observed very respectfully not only as a church regulation but because it was also an old Polish custom, a kind of a national holiday, very solemn because it ended with a special Christmas Eve supper called "Postnik."</p>
   <p>A Polish Christmas Eve supper was a great family religious feast at which no meat was served.</p>
   <p>As soon as the sun sets and the stars begin to appear on the dome of heaven, the entire family, dressed in their best attire, gather at <pb facs="5423968_2_0814.jpg" n="2"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/> <pb facs="5423968_2_0815.jpg" n="3"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/></p>

   <p>The night is changed into day and it would last until dawn had it not been for the sound of the bell from the high church tower, which calls them to the church. There they sing Christmas songs filling the hearts of the faithful not only with historical recollections but also with sacramental reality, holy fire and heavenly light. They will begin the old Polish Christmas song, "In the cradle lies Little Jesus," recalling sweet emotions originated at the supper table and brought to the altar. When the words; "And the Word became Flesh and dwelled among us," are sounded, all the faithful fall on their knees and at the same moment the human sounds of Christian carols are joined with the angelic praises sung to the glory of the Incarnate Majesty.</p>
   <p>This is how Poles of the olden times started the observation of the Christmas Holy Day.</p>
