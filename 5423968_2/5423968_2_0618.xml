   <p>Marriage is a devilish affair full of changeable situations. If I should advise you today to "get married," you would bless me one hundred times and you would curse me one hundred times, I am sure. Just think--seven or eight years from now you return home tired as a setter after hunting. The rooms are full of smoke because the stoves went out of order. Two children are sick with scarlet fever, and the wife has an attack of hysteria or is sitting in a corner with eyes filled with tears and looks at you as if it were all your fault. Then, obviously, you begin to tear your hair in desperation and during this pleasant performance it suddenly dawns on you that I was the one that advised you to enter the bonds of marriage. Then you buy yourself some chalk, run to my home and in large letters you write on my door, "Here lives an old idiot!"</p>
   <p>But, let us take for granted that I persuade you not to tie yourself up with a woman, and you, obedient to my persuasions, dismiss the thought of marriage.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0619.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Do you judge that the result will be different? There will come a time when you will be troubled with stomach catarrh; there will come a time when sitting alone in your bachelor "cell" you will think if you could only get married you would have the warmth of the family circle; that you would be surrounded by a wreath of beautiful heads of children; that your lovely wife would be serving you tea and your oldest daughter would entertain you with stories. Then you would also buy chalk and write on the door of my home, "Here lives a boob above bobbs!"</p>
   <p>You see, my young friend, misfortune is the unavoidable addition to our life; the dreary days blend with the bright without regard as to whether somebody enters your port of matrimony or you remain an old bachelor. The married man who has been chained for some length of time imagines during his sad moments and during misfortune, that fortunate are his unmarried friends, and the old bachelor thinks more than once, upon seeing some sympathetic scene from the family hearth, that the life of a bachelor is not worth a pinch of snuff.</p>
