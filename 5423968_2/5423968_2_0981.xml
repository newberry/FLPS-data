   <p>The members of the Chicago Board of Education at their meeting on the day before yesterday were confronted three times with propositions to change the name of the public school called Bismarck School.</p>
   <p>The Bismarck School is located at N. Central Park Avenue and Armitage Avenue.</p>
   <p>The first petition was that of Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance. On the motion of Mrs. Snodgrass, it was decreed to table the petition. At first they wanted to throw it in the waste basket. Next in turn came the petition of the Czechs, delivered through Mr. Geringer, editor of the Czech (Bohemian) daily newspaper Svornost. After a lengthy discussion, the members of the commission, again on the motion of Mrs. Snodgrass, decreed to table the motion.</p>
   <p>Before presenting her second motion, Mrs. Snodgrass said: "If these people <pb facs="5423968_2_0982.jpg" n="2"/>propose to select as names of our schools the names of deserving Americans, or people who have rendered America great service, I agree to that. However, the petitions submitted attack a man who long ago has passed on to receive his reward. When that name was selected for the school, this man personified everything praiseworthy of that time. Today those same attributes condemn him in the popular mind. In such surroundings a member of the board, Mr. A. Czarnecki, presented the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, the name of Otto Von Bismarck, as an officially given title of one of Chicago public schools is abominable and subject to reproach of a considerable part of Chicago's tax paying citizens, and reminds them of persecutions, sufferings and iron rule which they or their parents endured in their native country during the rule of Bismarck, when during his efforts to strengthen and build up the German Empire, he unmercifully tried to crush the oppressed nations within its boundaries; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, the name of Bismarck, his life and work, stand for autocracy in <pb facs="5423968_2_0983.jpg" n="3"/>contrast to democracy, for the crushing of the Polish national life, Alsace, Lorraine and Schlesswig Holstein, so as to strengthen the patrimony of Bismarck, and being the main cause why many of the tax payers in this city and citizens and their fathers had to flee from their own country and become fugitives;</p>
   <p>Whereas, Bismarck did not give any special services to the United States, he did not accomplish anything which would be of benefit to culture, the people or citizenship, from an American viewpoint, or from the point of view of those who believe in democracy, and not in autocracy, and his life and character are not fit examples for school children in a free country;</p>
   <p>Therefore, let it be resolved that the name of the Bismarck School, which is located at the address of 2010 N. Central Park Avenue, corner of Armitage Avenue, shall be changed; and in the place of the name of Bismarck, shall be selected a name in harmony with American ideals and activities, which will not remind us of autocracy and persecutions the great masses of Chicago's <pb facs="5423968_2_0984.jpg" n="4"/>tax paying citizens, the name of such a person, whose example the children in free America can follow;</p>
   <p>Let us resolve, that in changing the name of Bismarck School, we will take into consideration, such names as Franz Sigel, hero of the Civil War or Baron Von Steaben, hero of the United States revolution, that in recognition of the services, which they gave to our country in contrast to the lack of any services whatever given to this country by Otto Von Bismarck."</p>
   <p>After the reading of the resolution, Mr. Czarnecki added a few more words of the bitter truth, comparing Bismarck with despots like Nero and Atilla, after which he personally proposed that the resolution be sent to the Committee on Nomenclature. The members of the Commission agreed unanimously on the proposition.</p>
   <p>In order to bring about the change, Commissioner Czarnecki needs the help <pb facs="5423968_2_0985.jpg" n="5"/>of all in general. The prominent Poles and Polish societies ought to send their requests demanding the change in the name of the Bismarck School to the hands of the Secretary of the School Commission. The address is: Secretary of the Board of Education, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
