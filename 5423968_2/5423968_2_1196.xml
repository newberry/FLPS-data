   <p>Not even for a moment did we suspect that our articles relative to the dissension between liberal and conservative Poles, intended for our countrymen in Europe, would bring about a new polemic so soon, that is, before we had time to present our side of the question. The Kuryer Polski, the only Polish newspaper in Milwaukee, enters the arena now, declaring with strange antagonism that no one reads the articles of this "sheet". Envy speaking again, no doubt.</p>
   <p>With sibylline sagacity it calls the liberal camp a "Progressive party, founded upon religious principles," holding the Dziennik Chicagoski responsible for the assertion that the secular intelligentsia is composed of outlaws, and saying that our paper makes no mention of the unworthy priests. That no names were divulged is true, but everyone who reads our paper knows how untrue are these assertions of the Kuryer.</p>
   <p>We are not interested in further polemics with the Kuryer, since at present <pb facs="5423968_2_1197.jpg" n="2"/>we are busy trying to give our opinion in regard to this dissension, so misconstrued in the old country.</p>
   <p>However, since our articles on this question are evidence of the falseness of the statements made by the Kuryer in regard to our newspaper, it would not be amiss if we undertake here to say something about this so-called "Progressive party, founded upon religious principles," that our readers may know more about it. Well, the party is progressive, its leaders are progressive, so "progressive" in what regards the clergy, that they are point-blank antagonistic to the Catholic religion. The group upon which they propose to thrive--and they have been successful so far--is composed of people partially good and partially devout. We have written before about the people in the liberal camp. So far as they are concerned, this party is progressive, and founded on the principles of religion.</p>
   <p>As to the unworthy ones among the clergy, we have condemned their behavior time and again during the past, even though the Kuryer gives us no credit for it. Bad as a few members of the clergy have unquestionably been, we should not lose sight of the fact that the clergy, as a whole, have rendered great <pb facs="5423968_2_1198.jpg" n="3"/>services to the Poles in this country. They have added to the culture of the Poles by bringing up their children to be Poles, by educating them to think, and to love Poland so as to become loyal citizens, thus contributing to their welfare.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, we pointed out the fact that the greatest degree of welfare among the Poles in America is to be found in the parochial neighborhoods, whereas in districts where there are no churches a lack of welfare and culture is noticeable. The Poles in churchless districts are regarded by the Americans as if they were Italians or Chinese.</p>
   <p>Says the Kuryer: "We have a great number of examples to the effect that these clergymen--the ones worthy of high esteem, not the others now--have tried with intelligence, or rather' half intelligence;" to ingratiate themselves to the people, obviously for the purpose of securing some assistance in their task of oppression. What happened later among the intelligentsia thus attracted, we can observe every day. Some of them remain with the clergy--some drifted away and formed a progressive party, based upon religious <pb facs="5423968_2_1199.jpg" n="4"/>principles. The clergy, being aware of the fact that most of our people are Catholics, and knowing how to deal with them, were thus able to carry out their future plans."</p>
   <p>This same Kuryer, not so long ago, besmirched the head representatives of this party, saying that it knew of what sort of representation it consisted.</p>
   <p>The exemplary clergy have always been eager to preserve among our people an ardent faith in and love for the fatherland, a love based on the love of God. Such is the purpose of the clergy, and should they not accomplish it, they would be unworthy of their vocation. Never and nowhere did the clergy attempt to make cosmopolitans out of the people, nor did they try to extinguish their spirit of patriotism. On the contrary, they have always taught love for the fatherland, showing us the necessity of bringing up our children as Poles. To realize this, they have established Polish schools, conducted national parades, and formed societies--all for the purpose of preserving the fatherland's customs and traditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1200.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Now that the Progressive party has come into being, its organizers endeavor to do away with the clergy's influence by denying them participation in national affairs. At the beginning some priests belonged to this party, priests whom we have previously designated as unworthy. They were overconfident in our opponents' assurances of an undefined reverence for the Catholic religion. Also, there were some who did not know the party leaders well enough. These walked out on the party as soon as they got wise to it, not as the Kuryer claims--that they were forced out. Soon the attack was on against the entire clergy and everything connected with them, including the societies they had established, which were denied admission to their sessions. Not content with this, an effort was made to deny the fact that most of the Poles are Catholics and to have the people believe that Catholicism destroyed Poland. However, those who pretend to be great patriots are the same ones who failed to teach their children Polish by refusing to send them to Polish schools, thus permitting them to forget the language they had learned at home from their mothers. Those who have talked so much of reverence toward the Catholic religion are the very same ones who distort, in their speeches and articles, historical facts, in order to make the public believe that Catholicism <pb facs="5423968_2_1201.jpg" n="6"/>was the cause of the fall of Poland.</p>
   <p>In view of all this, is it any wonder that the priests, thus slandered for no reason whatever and noticing the effects of this campaign from the pulpits, have accepted the challenge, fighting against such patriotism in the newspapers and in their sermons?</p>
