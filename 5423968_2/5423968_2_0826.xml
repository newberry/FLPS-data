   <p>Summary:</p>
   <p>The self-humiliation of our poor Poles is really unusual.</p>
   <p>Everyone of us Poles understands that in the Irish parochial schools our children are being systematically and purposely deprived of their Polish soul, and finally yield to the process of "Irishization."</p>
   <p>But this is not all. The Irish in America never were friendly towards us and they never will be. They consider themselves a higher and more privileged group here and look upon us with contempt. We have witnessed many incidents when an Irish priest from the St. Mark's Church, admonishing children who were playing near the church, shouted: "Get away from here, you dirty Polack!"</p>
   <p>And imagine! To these "friends" of our nation our poor Poles are sending their children for education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0827.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Don't they spit at their own faces by doing so?</p>
   <p>The only compassion they deserve is our prayer: "O Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do."</p>
