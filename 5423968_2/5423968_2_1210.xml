   <p>Having made a general brief review of both clashing camps among the Polish immigrants in the United States, we devote a few lines to describe this struggle, as well as the methods of warfare used.</p>
   <p>Before going into details, let it be said that it behooves us to stir up this matter, sensitive as it is to both camps, even at the risk of hurting both the ones we favor and their adversaries, with whom now and then we have our polemics, which, of course, are devoid of any animosity whatsoever.</p>
   <p>To begin with, we must bear in mind that the members of each camp are themselves divided into two classes or groups. In the ranks of the camp that oppose the clergymen, one class is composed of people who <pb facs="5423968_2_1211.jpg" n="2"/>fundamentally glow with hatred toward the priests, for, since most of them are non-sectarian and atheists, they are cold to religion. Even though in certain respects they are convinced of their unfairness, yet they strive to defend themselves stubbornly. Under no circumstance will they give ground before the reasoning of their challengers, and they cling to the conquest of their apparently decent views and intentions even if it brings harm to them. The other class consists of those who presume to be justified in this bona fide struggle and therefore think they follow the path of a good cause. Among these are devout Catholics, a few people of other faiths, and a number of ardent patriots. They are nevertheless partially blind to the most obvious facts, because their leaders would not wish them enlightened. They contend that the clergymen are unworthy and exploiters and should be dismissed for the good of the church. Lastly, there are the ignorant, who are involuntarily carried away by the current they fell into. This class is preponderant. The administration and direction of affairs rest solely in the hands of the former class, who also are in charge of the encounter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1212.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Again, in the other camp there are two groups of warriors. First, there are those of dignity, confident in the power of their just cause, who remain calm and dignified. With them is the other group of warriors, more violent and infuriated, who condemn their opponents openly and en masse. Every good proposal made in their midst is either ignored or regarded as detrimental. They disregard everyone and everything, even the rights of their foes. In this camp, this class constitutes the minority. This fact is important to the camp; sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful. The administrative officials of this camp are themselves divided--some favor the first group, some the second.</p>
   <p>We must realize that beyond the bounds of these camps are gaping crowds who--like street gossipers--alternately support this or that side. These are instigators who, if successful, ridicule those with whom they ostensibly sympathize. They pretend to embrace their ranks, attributing one thing or the other to infirmity or to indifference to public affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1213.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The gossip of the challengers of the clergy is naturally spread by the socialists, communists, anarchists, and, lastly, the atheists. Fortunately, these outcasts of society are few among the Poles, and if they are successful in an uproar, it has a very insignificant effect, since the camp they pretend to sympathize with does not recognize them. On the other hand, the opposition takes advantage of every such disturbance to prove to their opponents what type of friends the latter have.</p>
   <p>The gossip in the camp of the allies of the clergy is spread by people not as interested in the camp as in elevating themselves to the skies. There are some who would enlist in the ranks of either camp if they could see personal benefits, with the hope of peace and distinction. They insist upon convincing the world that the administration should fall into "better hands"--meaning themselves. Their object, whenever there is a misunderstanding, is to intensify dissension. The reason why they do not join a camp is that they consider themselves too good to be classed as common members in the ranks. They do, however, glow with sympathy and the <pb facs="5423968_2_1214.jpg" n="5"/>assurance that they would lead the people to victory, were they entrusted with the command.</p>
   <p>The main defense weapons now at the disposal of the camps are the newspapers, which will make public the arguments of both sides. One article in our next issue will be devoted to one of them.</p>
