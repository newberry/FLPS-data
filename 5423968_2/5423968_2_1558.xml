<title level="a">LABOR DAY IS WORKINGMEN'S HOLIDAY</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Labor Day is to be observed next Monday. All work will be suspended and the day will be solemnly commemorated. This holiday, introduced by labor and trade unions, has been declared by the government a legal holiday in all the states of the Union. On this day all workers, whether from the mine, the work bench, the plow or the office, suspend their work and arrange parades and demonstrations. In this manner they publicly display the strength and solidarity of organized labor.</p>
   <p>Although these demonstrations are conducted by workers who are union members, the mass meetings and parades are attended by a great number of non-union workers who in this manner express their sympathy with organized labor. On next Monday we will see hundreds of thousands of workers swarming the streets of various cities all over the country, peacefully, but most impressively, <pb facs="5423968_2_1559.jpg" n="2"/>displaying their unity and power.</p>
   <p>This labor holiday is looked upon with disfavor by the capitalistic group, who tolerate it only because they are fully aware that these labor activities are sanctioned by the entire nation. They can only look upon the masses marching, and wonder how many benefits the workers could acquire by organization and unity, which of course would bring about an inevitable end to exploitation by capitalists, as well as a limitation of their riches.</p>
   <p>The great majority of the workers are not aware of their own power. The education of the worker on the question of organization is progressing very slowly; he is approached by so many different teachers and union organizers, whose policies differ and whose honesty is not always above question, that it becomes a difficult problem for the worker to determine who truly is his friend and who his enemy.</p>
   <p>The Socialists are assuming the right to become labor leaders, but they are <pb facs="5423968_2_1560.jpg" n="3"/>fighting organized unions. The unions have difficulties of their own; the leaders are often neither honest nor intelligent, and as a result there is much friction and wasted energy. These dissensions retard the welfare of the laboring class and the development of unions, organizations which constitute the only effective weapon of defense against well-organized capital.</p>
   <p>The observance of Labor Day should not be limited to street parades, but should include a series of lectures teaching the principles of organization and the power of solidarity.</p>
   <p>Particularly in this country of constitutional rights, the workingman should zealously defend his rights and the organizations established to protect them. By the power of the ballot box, American labor can remove from the statute books any legislation that is injurious to its interests. However, all reforms that are to be accomplished should be selected with care and with the interests of the entire nation in mind.</p>
