   <p>There are many occasions for sighing, reasons for complaint, so many they are difficult to mention. At times it is better to reprimand with a harsh word, than to smooth with a gentle hand.-</p>
   <p>I am convinced that everyone of our readers wishes to serve his country to the utmost of his ability. We have many obligations towards our Fatherland and there are many ways of serving it. Our duty to our country and our brothers could be properly fulfilled. Peace, unity and understanding are necessary to us and the whole nation.</p>
   <p>How correct is the poet who says,"Our Poland has not perished, will not perish so long as love unites the hearts of a scattered family."</p>
   <p>Alas, one of the characteristic faults of our people, especially on foreign soil, a fault that weakens us and is a reason for much shedding of life and blood, is the lack of peace.</p>
   <p>Repeatedly the threads of sincere brotherly love are broken. We view a straw in <pb facs="5423968_2_1103.jpg" n="2"/>our brother's eye with secret joy, but see nothing in our own.</p>
   <p>For peace are working, alas, a few befuddled countrymen. Attacks and unfriendly feeling among the Poles on foreign soil, sometimes arise from foolish reasons and blinded with a desire to do injury, fail to see how ridiculous they are. The least suspicion, shadow, hearsay, gossip, peculiar glance, difference of opinion, etc. causes trouble among us.</p>
   <p>The longer it lasts the more the weeds choke and kill any finer feeling. The insulted would sooner shake hands with a stranger than with a brother in reconciliation. Unfortunates! They forget our christian law-giver taught not hatred but love and commanded forgiveness. He who does not love his brother cannot love his country.</p>
   <p>It is a lie that one could <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ove humanity and not his countrymen.-<pb facs="5423968_2_1104.jpg" n="3"/>An unnatural son, is he who for some trivial matter, despises his brother; he cannot sincerely love his countrymen, his country, not humanity. He who in his breast carries a heart of stone, turns away from a reconciliation, clenches his fist at a brother instead of opening his arms to peace. He who breeds harm and revenge, gathers poison in his heart.</p>
   <p>Instead of gathering the manna of peace and unity, those who through ulterior motives created a misunderstanding instead of putting out the fire, pour odorous oil of gossip and denunciations on it, such denies his duty and is the Cain of his nation. Because of such tempers, condemn such shameful behavior; do not listen to their whispers, do not put any faith in their words, but point your finger at them, for he who blackens his brother and harms him is the Judas of his Nation. If he does not come to his senses he soon will become a vile traitor and they who believe him will be pulled into a pit from which there is no return. A blind unfortunate is he who lives in unrest. A traitor who breeds and stirs it up.</p>
   <p>O! where is a word to curse betrayal!</p>
   <p>That like a disease from hell arises</p>
   <p>Falls on men of courage and deed,</p>
   <p>Confuses their hearts and weakens their arms!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1105.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He who really loves his country forgives trifles and refrains from clashes because he knows what a loss it is to the people, if the motive to live in unrest, and stone each other, instead of joining hearts and hands in working together dominates.</p>
   <p>Unrest and eagerness to quarrel is one of the most harmful characteristics of our nation. The Hand of God weighs heavily over our unhappy country; It groans under the weight of the sin of her unnatural sons. That sin was the reason for the down fall of our country, it is the source of all our past and present suffering. Who does not see this?</p>
   <p>The ties of brotherhood are shamefully broken in circles where complete peace reigned. Unrest, hatred and quarrels, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> one against another, as far as the eye can see. Lack of brotherly love hangs over us, pulls at our legs like a chain, preventing our step in the march of progress. If you wish, Brothers, tense your shoulders, lift the stone under which our country groans. But how can this be done, living in <pb facs="5423968_2_1106.jpg" n="5"/>enmity and unrest? Beware of quarrels because friends are sooner forgotten than enemies and division weakens us. Love of country is our eleventh commandment. He does not fulfil it who bickers with his brothers. Offer on the alter of self sacrifice your personal aims, specially if they are unworthy as hatred and revenge. We should build a true "God's Peace"; forgive each other so that Heaven may forgive us.</p>
   <p>It is a mortal sin to kill a man, it is no less a sin to kill his good name. Mirabeau said "Ten people in harmony can accomplish more than ten thousand in discord." Our people are divided into camps, tearing themselves apart, with their own hands. It is not necessary to prove that in union, there would be strength and great influence in internal and outside affairs. Such unity would have to be sincere, lasting and enlivened by deep thought, a solid foundation, arising from geniune love of humanity and deep faith in its own strength and destiny. The thought of peace radiates with beauty the power and glory of our tradition, left to us by Meczyalaw and Boleslaw, to whom the white eagle was a symbol of unity of the nation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1107.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The white eagle defended its young as long as its wings were not clipped.</p>
   <p>The Poles were not only a self reliant nation, but powerful as long as the spirit of love shone on them. Quarrels sapped our life blood and weakened the nation. Poland lost her self reliance and is to-day as Stowacki said "Another's servant." To pave the way to peace and stay on the road is one of the main problems of our people. Let no one shirk his duty and light the way by his own example, for others to follow.</p>
   <p>Boys, pull the weeds,</p>
   <p>That are choking our meadows.</p>
   <p>Not by halves, Love Poland</p>
   <p>But with all your soul.</p>
   <p>We should, we must! Let us not poison our lives but placate misunderstandings, not only to avoid quarrels but help others; urge brotherly love for a happy man <pb facs="5423968_2_1108.jpg" n="7"/>is he who sees the ray of happiness in the eyes of another as if he were the one to put it there.</p>
   <p>Let us learn by the sad experience of our fathers, whose disagreements plunged them into an abyss and from our grandfathers, whose unity and power so often shone with glory.</p>
   <p>Their example should be our guide. The road they took we should follow in peace and harmony to the end. In the end. our deeds will be wreathed in our country's former glory.</p>
   <p>Let, then, peace grow and spread deep into the soil.</p>
   <p>Let her grow fruit to feed the strength of our nation.</p>
