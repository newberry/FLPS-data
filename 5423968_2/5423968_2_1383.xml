   <p>For the first time in the history of the city, the people of Chicago are suffering as a result of the exhorbitant prices of foodstuffs. The speculators in foodstuffs, with the cleverness of a fox, hardly let a day pass without inventing some excuse to raise the prices of important foodstuffs such as flour, fruits, meat, vegetables, milk etc.</p>
   <p>Within the past twenty-four hours the speculators have managed to raise prices tremendously. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> have gone up from 48 cents to 57 cents a dozen, potatoes from $2.80 to $4.00 a bushel, milk from 10 cents to 13 cents a quart, etc. And, according to the food bandits who call themselves suppliers, this is only the beginning.</p>
   <p>Hunger and poverty, too terrible to describe, are holding forth among the poor families, of which there are thousands in Chicago. The Salvation Army, which visits the homes of the poor working classes, reports that scores of families can just barely manage to get bread. There can be no thought of meat and <pb facs="5423968_2_1384.jpg" n="2"/>other indispensable foods.</p>
   <p>"I visited eight laborers' homes today," says one of the Salvation Army workers, "and found that oatmeal boiled in water, without milk or sugar, is the only food that these families have.</p>
   <p>"Two families I visited have had nothing but oatmeal for two weeks, and this they managed to get only with great difficulty. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>otatoes are unknown to them, even during celebrations and holidays."</p>
   <p>This is the present food situation in our city, and prices are constantly going up.</p>
   <p>Investigations by the municipal, county, and Federal authorities in the matter of the high cost of living have produced so far no results at all.</p>
