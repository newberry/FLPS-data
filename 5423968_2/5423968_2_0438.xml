   <p>For some time there had been conducted in the United States a campaign for passing of a law that would prohibit the use of automobile, baseball playing, publishing of newspaper and attending of theaters on Sundays.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, in Boston, Mass., a sculptor was arrested for finishing a bust on Sunday.</p>
   <p>For that reason the press fights for freedom and strives to enlighten the citizens of this country that it is not the law that compels people to observe holy Sunday; but the inner conviction of each individual, based on proper understanding of a given religion and adaptation of its rules and regulations (principles).</p>
   <p>The United States was famous on account of its freedom;under the protective wings of the Starry Banner came the patriots persecuted by European governments.</p>
   <p>Whoever came here found an asylum, and the hand of his European persecutors could not reach him in America.</p>
   <p>And today the reformers are endeavoring to limit that freedom, they are trying to deprive our citizens of the dearest thing they possess: Freedom.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0439.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The prohibition has been enacted. Have they done right? Today people have to hide even a glass of beer with which the working man refreshed himself after hard work in a factory.</p>
   <p>The reaction marches forward - it is even trying to limit personal freedom, it is trying to change free citizens of a country into the tools of a clique.</p>
   <p>Those who worked for establishing prohibition have plenty of liquor and if they run short, they take a trip to Europe.</p>
