   <p>"Whoever does not wish to earn less than he is now earning, should join the Tailors' Union! In a short time, a new law will come into effect in the state of Illinois preventing women from working more than eight hours a day. Violators of this law will be subject to a fine of from three to a hundred dollars. As soon as this law goes into effect, employers will undoubtedly reduce the already small wage of shopworkers. The only safeguard against this is to organize a tailors' union for men and women and to demand a wage rate equivalent to that of a ten-hour day. Work in shops is difficult and poorly paid, for women as well as for men, and we should not allow a single penny to be taken away from us. On the contrary, we should ask for higher wages. This is a good occasion for it; if we do not take advantage of this occasion, it will be a disgrace to us, as Poles, in the eyes of other national groups that have their own unions and are not dependent upon other bosses, as are we.</p>
   <p>"A meeting will be held at Szulc's Hall, on the corner of Cleaver and <pb facs="5423968_2_1584.jpg" n="2"/>Division Streets, on the fifth of August at two o'clock in the afternoon for a more detailed discussion of this matter and for organization of the union.</p>
   <p>The Committee."</p>
