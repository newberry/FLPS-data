   <p>Last Sunday, March 7, the English Literary Circle, composed of students from the junior and senior classes of St. Stanislaus Kostka College, staged a special literary program before a selected group of guests. This group, attending the classes of Professor Hecher, instructor of English literature, was not bold enough to display its achievements before the public.</p>
   <p>This program, made up of speeches and declamations, demonstrated the part it is going to play in American life of the future. There is a great need for such youth, because, if our society is not going to have representatives in the American sphere of life in the future, representatives that will elevate and defend the Polish name, what is going to happen to our position <pb facs="5423968_2_0160.jpg" n="2"/>before the public eye? Heaven knows! For today our standing has fallen to such a degree that some compare us to Chinese coolies. If this continues we will be completely lost and no trace of our accomplishments will ever be found. And this should not be. After all, God has endowed us with the same qualities as other peoples; perhaps we even have such qualities as no others possess.</p>
   <p>Surely, our compatriots abroad display such characteristics. There the Polish name rises from the ruins like a phoenix, untouched, unharmed. There, although the enemies [Austria, Prussia, and Russia, the three powers that dismembered Poland] are doing their best to extinguish the light of the Polish spirit, all of Europe pays respect to the Polish name and often speaks of the accomplishments of Poland. It is high time that we in America actively work to elevate the Polish name from its unjust low level to its proper place in American life. But this is not to be attained through vociferations and longings, but through quiet, constant, <pb facs="5423968_2_0161.jpg" n="3"/>united, willing, animated, and brotherly work in all general Polish matters.</p>
   <p>To whom are we to give a willing hand in general Polish matters? For what and to whom should we sacrifice our property and life? If we have a Polish heart it should be done for our youth which has a Polish and Catholic heart, which is anxious to learn and to serve society. It is worth while to make sacrifices for such an ambitious group.</p>
   <p>The youth of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish is worthy of such sacrifices. To neglect this group would be a great wrong and costly in the future. </p>
   <p>Dear compatriots! The St. Stanislaus Kostka College needs your support. Through the work of Reverend John Kruszynski, rector, who devotes all his time and effort to the College and his ability to choose capable instructors, <pb facs="5423968_2_0162.jpg" n="4"/>the College has attained high standing. You can find this out for yourselves. Messrs. Hocker and Schaedler are good examples of worthy instructors. They have devoted much of their time to our youth; although the task was difficult, they managed to develop great interest in their classes. Therefore, you should come to the assistance of the rector and the Polish youth as well. Your efforts will not go unrewarded, and remember:</p>
   <p>"This truth of the holy faith is:</p>
   <p>That kindness rules the life of man,</p>
   <p>That the trophies of the world are sacrifices."</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph....</p>
