<title level="a">THE FORTHCOMING BAZAAR FOR THE POLISH CENTRAL RELIEF FUND</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>We have some interesting and encouraging information. The Polish Businessmen's Association, in Chicago, is taking energetic steps to increase the relief fund for our suffering brethren in Poland. The method followed by the Association, if continued, can only result in success. The watchword has already been passed along and the amassing of contributions and donations for a bazaar is now in progress. The income derived from this bazaar will be turned over in its entirety to the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy has always supported Polish trade, commerce, and business most vigorously. It has not merely looked to the financial losses it would suffer by incurring the hatred of other chauvinistic nationalities. The reason is that this newspaper is more concerned with the welfare of our national ideals and of our people than it is with financial returns. At present, when our Polish businessmen give proof that they are <pb facs="5423968_2_1494.jpg" n="2"/>Poles, not for cold calculations and business, but because they are Poles body and soul, we will strive with redoubled energy for their welfare and will spread the slogan in our Polish communities: "Support the Polish Businessman".</p>
   <p>If half the hard-earned money of our people remained among Polish businessmen, and was not dispersed unnecessarily, the Poles in the United States would be far wealthier than they are at present. Let us learn by observing other nationalities, such as the Bohemians or even the Germans, how to gain material strength. Following their example, let us endeavor to keep the money our people obtain by hard work from circulating much among other nationalities and keep it constantly turning over in Polish circles. This can be accomplished only by supporting Polish trade and commerce. Let us remember that the money paid for articles is not completely lost to us; it can return to us more easily if it is in the hands of a fellow Pole than if it is in the possession of someone of another nationality.</p>
   <p>Chances are that some of our people are attracted by bargains, that they <pb facs="5423968_2_1495.jpg" n="3"/>allow themselves to be taken in by various low-priced close-outs, bankruptcies and fire auction sales. These are conducted often by unscrupulous people of other nationalities who speculate on our naivete. But many of our people have been fully convinced that the price is of no importance, but the relationship of the price to the material is of utmost importance. If, therefore, a Polish businessman is not anxious to purchase his materials at such auctions, nor does he resort to any such misleading sales, and has good and substantial quality, though a bit more expensive, then why should our people refuse to buy from him? The money our people earned by hard work should go into our banks, stores, and businesses. If we insist on spending the money, then let us see to it that a Pole profits; too often such money gets away from our control.</p>
