<title level="a">FORTY PERSONS HURT IN STOCKYARDS' RIOTING EARLY THIS MORNING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Forty persons were hurt this morning in a riot at 40th and Wallace Streets before the motorcycle police could disperse the crowd. No arrests were made. As far as it is known one person was killed instantly and three others died later. Many others were beaten by clubs. Governor Small announced that he will send out the State militia to keep order among the strikers. All the saloons in the vicinity of the Stockyards were closed. It has been said that the cause of these riots was due to over-indulgence in alcoholic drinks. Many women participated in the rioting this morning, and they withstood the onslaught of the police longer than the men.</p>
   <p>The victims were as follows:</p>
   <p>An unknown Negro worker was killed. He was stoned and then thrown into the river. Among those shot were: George Pile, 4405 So. Wood Street;</p>
