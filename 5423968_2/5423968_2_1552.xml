   <p>The strife between employers and employees is not concerned so much with increasing wages as it is with recognizing labor unions. The employers, on their part, are willing to consent to everything--they have promised to increase the workers' wages and to bring about better working conditions in their business concerns--but they do not want to recognize unions. They are not in favor of the so-called closed-shop principle and it is because of this question that all conditions of settlement are nullified. Both sides, in this instance, have their own reasons and causes, and both factions carry on bitter arguments on the matter of recognizing the union. The workers are fully aware of the fact that the dispersion of labor unions, which results from the employer's refusal to recognize them, means death to organized labor. It means that the working classes would have to rely completely upon capitalism, which would easily conquer the dispersed and disorganized workers and <pb facs="5423968_2_1553.jpg" n="2"/>then exploit them shamelessly.</p>
   <p>The capitalist-employers, on their part, know well that only organized workers can put an end to exploitation. They are also aware that an army of union members well acquainted with their goal will not consent to such degenerate conditions as those found where nonunion workers are employed. Labor solidarity and unity in action is a whip, a safeguard against exploitation, which is so extensively and unconditionally applied in the local labor situation. The capitalist-employers would sacrifice a great deal in order to break labor unions, because they know that after destroying these great protective walls of labor they can do as they please and regain their losses with interest. In many factories the employers even pay the wages that their workers have demanded and established, but they will not recognize the union. They conduct their business on the so-called open-shop basis--that is, they hire union as well as nonunion men. They pay their employees union wages because they know that, if a smaller scale were given, the workers would organize, enroll in a union, and demand even more than they are now receiving.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1554.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The capitalists are paying a union scale in order to preserve a pleasant peace, in order to keep organized workers out of their factories--employees who would inform each other and combat the exploitation and brutality of their "bosses."</p>
   <p>The more enlightened workers, on the other hand, know well the value of organization, and for that reason they combine and assist each other. They defend the union as a lioness would her cubs if they were attacked by hunters. Deprivation and hunger are of secondary importance, their organization and its welfare are their sole concern.</p>
   <p>The tailors' strike of 1910 clearly manifested this respect for, and defense of, the tailor - employees' union. Although the employers increased the wages and promised to better working conditions, the workers broke off all discussions when they were faced with the condition that the tailoring concerns were to be open on equal basis to union and nonunion employees.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1555.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Great indignation was manifested among the striking tailors when Thomas A. Rickert, president of their union, and Miss Jennie Adams, well-known labor agitator, consented to this underhandedly presented condition. These two representatives, after reviewing the conditions presented by the bosses, ordered the strikers to return to work. But these leaders were accused of treason and the order was ignored completely. The result of this was that the tailors became affiliated with the Chicago branch of the American Federation of Labor. They empowered this organization to continue the strike and to negotiate terms with the employers. At the same time, the strikers did away with the advice and the management attempted by the noisy demagogue--those people who only know how to rave and rant, and in reality have accomplished nothing beneficial to the laboring class. By so doing, the organized tailors manifested that they know how to distinguish the chaff from the grain, and that they will not allow themselves to be misled by any blackguards who consider their mission in behalf of the labor cause to be the use of threats and wild, vociferous expressions.</p>
