   <p>We are constantly told that prices are falling; yet, we are continually paying higher prices for our purchases! Truthfully, one must understand this matter and be forebearing. Wholesale prices are falling, although not rapidly. They do in truth indicate a tendency toward lower prices. However, the Christmas season is rapidly approaching. Because of this, prices have been increased by the retailers. Another reason is the large demand for various kinds of goods. One must not forget the fact that the merchants would never have a Christmas, if they did not make a substantial profit on their sales. No, without this profit Christmas would never be the same to them.</p>
   <p>It must be admitted, though, that this year's prices have not reached the high level that prevailed during the War. We can all remember those two years when we had to purchase unwanted commodities in order to get what we actually needed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1482.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And the prices were unheard of. This year we have something to be thankful for, for such exorbitant prices are not in existence. Although Christmas trade has revived considerably, the people are not losing their heads.... or their pocketbooks. In this respect, a decrease in prices is evident. This may be true in the wholesale markets, but in retail trade prices have been raised, because of the holiday season. One can certainly expect that prices will drop after the first of the year.</p>
   <p>In general employment has increased during the month of October. The first half of November appeared to be stable; the earning power has dropped. The employers are making an attempt to keep as many men working as possible. No layoffs are being made. The work is being distributed in such a way that the same number of men can work despite the fact that they put in less hours. In this way, the people that would otherwise be idle are able to make enough to last them through the holidays and winter months.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1483.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Retail trade has been slightly stimulated. Holiday purchases are not at their height. After all, there is no great hurry. Many are waiting until the final week before they do their buying. In business circles, it has been said that business will be better than was expected. A few months ago, a prediction was made that trade during the Christmas season would be poor, much poorer than in previous years. The reason for this was the lag in employment. The earning power has always been a determining factor in judging whether business will be good or bad. This year's indications pointed to the fact that it would be poor. Therefore, the many unemployed that would ordinarily buy during this period are left without funds. Lack of work also means shorter hours for those employed; shorter hours mean less pay; and less pay means fewer purchases.</p>
   <p>At present the United States has over two million veterans out of work. There are another two million regular employees out in the streets. This accounts for over four million workers who are without jobs. These potential workers represent a tremendous earning and buying power during normal times. Despite this, taxes and commodity prices are ever on the increase.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1484.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Yet, in view of these depressing conditions, the average person, moved by the spirit of Christmas, tries his best to make his family and friends happy. If he has no money he borrows it from somebody. The future is mortgaged in order to make the present more cheerful. This spirit seems to be traditional--there is no other way out.</p>
   <p>Because of this, wholesale and retail trade is given a boost. It seems that this year is somewhat better than last year. Therefore, this unexpected upturn in trade has given everybody a better feeling, a hope that in the near future conditions would improve.</p>
   <p>This is a good indication. The New Year will bring to an end a year that has been considered one of the severest in many years. The expansion of trade during the pre-war period and the sudden spurt of industry during the war took place in years of plenty, but the aftermath is just the contrary. No sooner had the people become adjusted to one trend than another came along to dispel all hope and disrupt all plans. This has left a telling mark on many. Many people <pb facs="5423968_2_1485.jpg" n="5"/>have adopted the idea that conditions such as these will always prevail. Nor are they content with the reductions in wages. Morale and spirit have been broken as a result. A great deal of this has occurred in the past year. Since the New Year is approaching, new hopes are being revived and the unpleasant past is quickly forgotten. The small upturn in business has brought renewed hope to the commercial and industrial world and the New Year will be greeted with a hope that the spell of the depression will be broken.</p>
