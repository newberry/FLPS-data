<title level="a">ABOUT MATERIAL HELP FOR STRIKE VICTIMS</title>
<title level="a">SEVERAL HUNDRED FAMILIES WITHOUT MEANS OF LIVING IN THE STOCKYARDS DISTRICT</title>
</bibl>

   <p>On the South Side of our city, in the Town of Lake district, today despair has stoken into the homes of many families of Polish working men who for two months have been on strike.</p>
   <p>Today the Polish worker who not only has lost everything during the strike, has not even got the hope of earning for the future, because times are hard, economic stagnation, artificially created, does not give a workingman an opportunity to earn enough to support his family.</p>
   <p>The situation of the workingmen who are on strike is desperate today, and especially that of the children, who cannot be blamed that such a social condition exists, that their fathers cannot find work.</p>
   <p>Knowing exactly the situation of these unfortunates, we appeal to the merciful hearts of our readers, brothers of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union and sympathizers, to send their offerings, whatever one can give to the administration of the newspaper. All the money will be given to the Welfare Committee of the Polish Parishes in the stockyards district.</p>
