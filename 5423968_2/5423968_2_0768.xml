<title level="a">NEW BELLS BLESSED IN ST. JOHN CANTIUS'S CHURCH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In beautiful April weather the new bells of St. John Cantius's parish were blessed with solemn services and pomp.</p>
   <p>All the local societies gathered at their designated places and marched en masse along Milwaukee Avenue; other societies from St. Stanislaus Kostka's, St. Hedwig's, and St. Michael the Archangel's parishes fell in behind them. At 3 P.M. the streets surrounding the church were filled with societies in full regalia, guests, and thousands of spectators. Thanks to the marshals of the groups, everything was executed in perfect order. The marshals' commands could be heard despite the pleasant din of the many bands and orchestras. The American and Polish flags, society banners, streamers, etc., added color to the occasion.</p>
   <p>A platform before the church, specially erected and decorated for the affair, supported the three large new bells. The largest, weighing 6,000 pounds, was <pb facs="5423968_2_0769.jpg" n="2"/>named St. Anne, the second, 4,800 pounds, St. John, and the last, 2,800 pounds, St. Hedwig.</p>
   <p>The blessing ceremony was conducted by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, superior of the Fathers of the Congregation of Resurrectionists and pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Church. He was assisted by the Reverend Stanislaus Nawrocki pastor of St. Mary's of Perpetual Help, as deacon, and by the Reverend Adolph Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael the Archangel's, as subdeacon. Youthful members of the parish held the ribbons that were attached to the bells and acted as godmothers and godfathers.</p>
   <p>The celebrant was attended by a number of clergymen, among them being the Reverend Fathers John Kasprzycki, pastor of St. John Cantius's, John A. Babski, Florian Matuszewski, Eugene Sedlaczek, Joseph Gieburowski, John piechowski, John Obyrtacz, John Kruszynski, F. Byrgier of Sobieski, Illinois, and John Radziejewski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0770.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>An inspiring sermon was delivered by the Reverend E. Sedlaczek, who pointed out the purpose of the bells, which are to serve for the glory of God and for the convenience of the faithful.</p>
   <p>Full details of the affair are not given because the services were so elaborate that it would be impossible to do so without making errors. We conclude this report with a statement from the pastor of St. John Cantius's Church, who is sincerely happy and thankful to all people of good will who have made this unusual occasion possible. He hopes that this young parish will continue to grow in the same spirit.</p>
