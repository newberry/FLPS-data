   <p>There are two sides to every story; to the one side you may have to add, and probably, you may have to detract from the other. However, here we are concerned only with the side that outweighs the other.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are in this country at the present time many urgent problems that require immediate solution, and that if the many gentlemen, now engaged in fighting the liquor interests, would turn their attention toward the solution of these vexing problems, their accomplishments would be more valuable, and they would be rendering a real service to their country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0484.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The harm resulting from the use of liquor <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> not as yet been definitely ascertained, and is <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Some learned persons claim the liquor, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> smallest <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> is harmful, others again claim <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>No two people are able to agree on the question of whether the use of liquor is beneficial to the life and health of the man in the mine, the factory, or the street.</p>
   <p>We therefore <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> sacrifice his time and money, endeavoring to further the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of the life and health of his fellowman, would do well to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> proposition acceptable to a greater number of people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0485.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If there is a certain group of people in this country, who firmly believe that the use of alcoholic liquors is harmful, they are at liberty to make these facts known to all. They are at liberty to agitate and to promote prohibition. If this is accomplished legally, it would be constitutional, and would not be considered a curtailment of personal liberty.</p>
   <p>If they can convince the majority, that some article in the constitution is bad, and should be amended, and if the majority vote accordingly, so it shall be, and that puts an end to all recriminations. The majority rules. Words and arguments don't mean anything, and the ballot is always the most effective method of silencing the antagonists.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0486.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The argument is that those in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>occasionally, or they enjoy seeing there <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> On the other hand, hundreds and thousands of people <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> their lives in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> their hand lives in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> where they drink to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> their hard earned money that is <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> undermining their health, depriving themselves of the much needed <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> sleep, wasting precious time that <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> reading good books. This <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> his family and the community.</p>
   <p>Such daily drunken <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> are sad and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>

   <p>The Russian-Japanese war is a splendid proof substantiating the above statement. During the night, while the Japanese officers slept and rested, the Russian officers played cards, and drank wine. Although both sides appeared alert on the field of battle, the Japanese being thoroughly refreshed, were able to outsmart and outmanoeuvre the dissipated and tired Russians.</p>
   <p>Napoleon drank one glass of wine with his dinner, and sometimes during inclement weather, on the field of battle, he would drink a glass of punch.</p>
   <p>Poland suffered great losses because of inebriety and overindulgence. The flourishing nobility of Poland in the eighteenth century drank wine by the jugfull.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0489.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>But when it became necessary to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> invaders, this <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> liquor barrels. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> shoulders of the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> drunk,  or even <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>It is our <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0490.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Dont drink or spend because, as a member of your organization or lodge, you want to do your share in the raising of funds. You and your lodge would profit more if, instead of drinking, you would drop the five dollar bill outright into the treasury.</p>
   <p>If you want to fight the prohibitionists and reformers; if you want to divert their attention and agitation to some other cause, then you and your friends, must adopt moderation and temperance.</p>
   <p>When refusing a drink will cease to offend a friend, when drunkenness and the drunken orgies at the bars and saloons will end, the agitation of the prohibitionists and reformers will end. We will then enjoy a healthier, happier, and longer life. We will enjoy greater security, because our savings will be greater.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0491.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Women, it has been proved, live longer than men, even though they are the weaker of the two. Why? Because they are either total abstainers from intoxicants, or use them in moderation.</p>
