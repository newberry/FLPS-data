   <p>The census of our school children, also of the city population, is now being taken by enumerators, who are paid by the City Board of Education. We have been advised that many Poles, when asked what their nationality and where they were born, give Germany, Russia, or Austria as their birthplace; unmindful that by doing so they attest the partition of Poland.</p>
   <p>We have seen in the books of enumerators, that this is a fact, indeed. We have seen many Polish names, even of the better known citizens, earmarked by the enumerator with the word "Germany". Enumerators are obliged to faithfully mark the answers to the questions; they are not allowed to contradict anyone but when Poland is given as the birthplace, they will give special attention to such answer. Let us not, therefore, so freely attest the partition of Poland, with this seemingly insignificant answer. It is true, that the present census, like all previous ones, will not show the actual number of Poles in Chicago for the reason that those who are born here officially regard themselves Americans and admonitions of the press will not reach a large percentage of those, our native, who seem to think that they are Catholics, and subjects of czars or emperors,  rather than Poles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1060.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But the present census may show us the number of those truly enlightened Poles, who realize the importance of protesting against the partition of Poland, and who, although Poland has been effaced from the political maps of Europe are reminding us of her existence.</p>
   <p>Again we remind: "Do not attest the partition of Poland!"</p>
