   <p>In the final report for the year of corporations to the Internal Revenue Department, 244,544 corporations were taxed for a net profit of $9,036,980,163, while 169,917 corporations showed a lost of $1,739,107,755. Monopolistic and dominating corporations during the year earned over $9,000,000,000, practically half of the total of all corporations, but the smaller corporations, suffered the loss of $1,175,000,000. In spite of these losses by the smaller corporations, the majority of Republicans proposed a law to increase the income tax on corporations for the year of 1926 from twelve and one half to thirteen and one half per cent.</p>
   <p>Many of the smaller manufacturers who showed a loss, assumed, that the high protective tax would assure the success in industry, but met with disappointment; this also affected the farmers. There are those who are ready to condemn, without exception, all corporations as instruments of exploiting working masses, this is however, an erroneous belief as corporations show a gain, but this gain is not all net profit, and there are those who also suffer a great loss.</p>
