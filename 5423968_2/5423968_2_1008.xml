   <p>Vicious priests involved in troubles of their own making are fighting not only the Polish National Alliance, but also all parishioners who do not obey them blindly. In such cases they usually cover themselves with the cloak of religion, and try to hide their wicked deeds with that sacred garment of which they are not worthy. They complain at the pulpits and in their degraded press that some liberals and Masons of the Alliance are making an attempt to overthrow religion; that they are destroying the religion of the Polish people by attacking the servants of Christ, which is an abominable crime and apostasy. These gullible clericals think that our people are so blind that they cannot see the difference between good and wicked priests, or between religion <pb facs="5423968_2_1009.jpg" n="2"/>itself and unworthy servants of God. Our people know very well that a priest is not the religion itself. Religion is sacred, necessary for the human soul, a shield against evil; and that unworthy priest who brings only disgrace into religion should be treated accordingly.</p>
   <p>Let the honest clergy weed out from their midst the unworthy tare which degrades the teachings of Christ, and their will be no conflicts between the clergy and national organizations of the people. Religious journals defending the church against fanatic infidels are necessary, but what is the purpose of such gutter journals as Gazeta Bostonska, Wielkopolanin, Polonia, and other clerical papers? Of what moral value are they to the faithful followers of Christ? They serve neither God nor the people, but a handful of worthless individuals degraded and rotten to the core, whose beastly nature is hidden under priestly garments to the disgrace of the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>No reader of Dziennik Zwiazkowy can prove that our paper was or is against religion or morals, and whoever maintains that, is a liar.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1010.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The publications of the Polish National Alliance are not founded for the purpose of attacking any religion, but for the purpose of protecting our national interests and spreading enlightenment. The hooting of the owls will not scare the soaring eagle. Attempts of vicious priests will not harm the Polish National Alliance. Wicked people hurt only themselves. The clerical press may assail the Alliance, but it will be like bumping its head against a stone wall.</p>
