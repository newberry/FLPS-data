   <p>Great joy reigned recently when news reached the public that the price of meat was dropping and that other food articles were becoming less costly. This joy, however, was short-lived; information is again current that prices on all meats are being raised. For some inexplicable reason, it was found to be necessary for the exploiting trusts to lower meat prices quickly. But this so-called "low-cost" did not last long; prices are already rising gradually, and perhaps they will be even higher than previously. This is known as regulating prices by trusts. Evidently, the trust was interested in defeating some independent company and hence lowered its prices on meat in order to ruin that competitor. Now that the trust has removed the obstruction from its path, prices are again being raised. Certainly no one will believe that so much meat was on the market during one week that it was necessary to sell it at a lower price, and that the following week there was such a need of meat that it was necessary to sell <pb facs="5423968_2_1436.jpg" n="2"/>it a few cents per pound higher. There are other causes of high cost and temporary low prices, of which only the trusts are aware. The question is, how long will people endure this exploitation?.....</p>
