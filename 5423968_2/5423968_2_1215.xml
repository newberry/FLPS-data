   <p>The impending clash between the camp friendly to the clergy and the camp unfriendly to it, will be a struggle for supremacy. From one angle, the priests, who are the virtual founders of Polish parishes, schools, and societies--a fact their adversaries cannot deny--would like to exert their influence on the immigrants here, so that they remain loyal to the faith of their fathers and guide themselves in accordance with the principles inculcated on them by the Catholic Church. These principles, in political life as well as in national affairs, will keep control of the immigrants' purposes. On the other hand, the opposition, so to speak, wants to make a monopoly out of patriotism, and, announcing itself as the national choice, intends to compel the priests to confine their activities to religion, or--if they wish to participate in national affairs--to submit to a directorate.</p>
   <p>This clash has been going on for quite a long time.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1216.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many of our societies still cling to the old camp, while others have strayed away to join the opposition. The presumption of the author of an article published in the Emigration Review [published in Poland]is unfair, especially when he states that today there are more priests in the camp of the opposition than in the one loyal to the clergy. The truth is that the latter is considerably greater, and no one would dare deny it.</p>
   <p>But if we analyze carefully the type of people who compose the opposition and compare them with the type who compose our side, we shall perceive a great difference.</p>
   <p>By the side of the clergy are most of the early settlers, with the exception of a few who, imbued with the so-called "freedom of thought" and a well-developed hatred toward both priests and religion, had already declared their position upon their arrival here. The children of the early settlers, the majority of whom attended parochial schools, cling to the clergy camp. Only those who have strayed away from the flock, or who have been snatched away from parental care to be educated in nonsectarian public schools, are <pb facs="5423968_2_1217.jpg" n="3"/>impregnated with freethinking ideas. The serious-minded citizens, abiding by the rules of the Church and by the virtue of honest labor and thrift, have become possessors of real estate and fortunes, of which they dared not dream in the old country. These citizens, not only because of belief but because of gratitude as well, adhere to our camp, to which they owe even their material welfare. Besides--though their number is not great--there are the more educated representatives of the true intelligentsia, whom the clergy have always endeavored to gain into their forces, so that they may be assisted in their numerous difficult tasks. These people have become devout Catholics, and they do not recognize any sophism which forbids the priests to take an active part in national affairs.</p>
   <p>To the other camp--which forever and whenever an opportunity arises boasts of comprising the entire "intelligentsia"--belongs the so-called intellectuals recruited from among the people previously described. However, it wouldn't be fair to say that there are not respectable people in their ranks or that all of them are not loyal to the Church. At the time when some of the priests were in the camp of the opposition, a number of Catholic societies joined <pb facs="5423968_2_1218.jpg" n="4"/>their camp and still remain in it. The leaders of the camp insist that they are faithful to the Catholic religion and that they only oppose the intervention of the Church in affairs of the state. This exclusive directorate, headed by some foes of the clergy, decided to launch a campaign against the influence of and interference by the priests, so as to free the people from old ideas and prejudices.</p>
   <p>Viewing both camps from the same angle, their forces appear alike, with equal influence upon those outside the camps. It is true that in our camp numerical strength and age prevail, as well as education and standing in this country. However, in the camp of the opposition, our advantages are apparently outshone by noisy claims to Polish patriotism, by an ostentatious exterior, and by such a phraseology, oral and written, as has ever impressed the populace. The ranks of both camps have increased with the influx of newcomers. Now and then a few leave one camp to join the other.</p>
   <p>This dissension has survived various clashes, and more than once a white <pb facs="5423968_2_1219.jpg" n="5"/>flag was hoisted by both sides. Proposals for a mutual understanding to end dissension have been made from time to time, but at best they have only effected a truce, the struggle flaring anew on the slightest provocation.</p>
   <p>Although uncomfortable and in some respects exposing us to shame, this clash has certain good points, and the final results may turn out favorably. We shall write more on this question in the next issue of this paper.</p>
