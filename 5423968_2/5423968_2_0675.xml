<title level="a">RESPECT YOUR FATHER</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Young people listen! You love your mother, and demonstrate your love towards her in a manner that she understands.</p>
   <p>But the father, my young people, you love him, also, but in another way. Do you respect him? And do you show him that it is so? And make no mistake?</p>
   <p>In the bottom of the heart there remains, no doubt, a spark of parental respect. But what if that spark is not found there?</p>
   <p>Often we have had examples of disrespect for the father. More than once, we have heard "sonny" in front of his companions refer to him as the "old man."</p>
   <p>Just stop and think, young one, that you, will sometine be a father and have a son, who will also call you "old man." This will be unpleasant and bitter to you, but it will be too late. You will probably try to make amends, but your father will be asleep in his eternal grave, and throughout your life and will <pb facs="5423968_2_0676.jpg" n="2"/>regret the thoughtlessness.</p>
   <p>When you think back to the days of your youth, you will remind yourself, that you had often shown your love to your mother, but you had forgotten about your dad, in spite of the fact that you loved him. The biggest sorrow that you ever encounter will be the memory of your bad conduct or lack of respect for your father.</p>
   <p>Remember son, that your father and mother had to struggle for your existence in this world. He loved you as well as your mother, but he probably did not show it. Sometimes your father is not the same as others; he does not dress as well, and has customs of the "old country". You do not have to be ashamed of that, because you do not know that in the future your son will look down on you; if, for instance, you do not give up the habit of chewing tobacco. Do not be ashamed of your father if he does not have the education that you possess, which means that he does not know how to speak English, because there will probably come a time when you would be glad to hear the language of your parents, from your son, but he will not know how to speak it. Do not curse your father, if at some time <pb facs="5423968_2_0677.jpg" n="3"/>he has caused you some harm, because in the future you will draw on yourself the curse of your children.</p>
   <p>Mothers, teach your sons in this respect!</p>
