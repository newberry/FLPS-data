   <p>(We have received the following correspondence, with a request that we publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>Brethren: We have an opportunity now to join the painters' union, known as the "Painters' Brotherhood". The initiation fee has been lowered, and no doubt everyone can pay it.</p>
   <p>There are many Polish painters in Chicago who, through ignorance of the English language and American customs, and through lack of opportunity, are forced to labor in other fields. The Polish painters have an opportunity now to join hands, for our mutual welfare, in our own labor organization, a Union of Polish Painters, which will be affiliated with the national organization.</p>
   <p>And we Poles should follow in the footsteps of representatives of other <pb facs="5423968_2_1572.jpg" n="2"/>nationalities, guard our own interests, help one another, and not allow anyone to beat us.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, the undersigned gathered together on February 16 and decided to organize a branch of the Painters' Union. We, therefore, ask you, brother painters, union and nonunion, to come to a meeting on Thursday, February 20, at 8 o'clock in the evening, in Mr. A. Skrzydlewski's Hall, corner of 18th Street and Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>So, let us get to work, brothers! If we organize our union, we will receive the same benefits the others do. We should all appear at this meeting.</p>
   <p>K. Brukwicki, E. Arnold,</p>
   <p>S. Uznanski, S. Jankowski,</p>
   <p>B. Markiewicz, T. Kolanowski,</p>
