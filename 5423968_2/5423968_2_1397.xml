   <p>Yesterday's telegrams brought the news from New York, that a jury in a New York court, after an hour of deliberation, brought in a verdict of not guilty, in the case of the Triangle Waist Company, charged with manslaughter. The factory owned by the above company was destroyed by fire on March 25th, and 147 women, and men were burned to death or killed by jumping out of windows.</p>
   <p>Responsibility for this disaster was placed on the company, because no safety measures were used against fire, and all workers were trapped. Prosecutors called approximately one-hundred witnesses who proved that the company, because of the lack of safety devices in accordance with the city fire ordinance, was guilty of gross negligence.</p>
   <p>The tragedy stirred the opinion of the entire nation against the employers who neglected to take the necessary precautions to save the lives of workers in case of fire, and who was responsible for the lives of 147 innocent workers'lives. All were of the opinion that employers should be punished, but a jury of 12 married men who were heads of families and persons of responsibility, after short deliberation came to the conclusion that employers were not responsible for this accident.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1398.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Who is guilty? Were the employees guilty in working to provide for their families? If the employers are not guilty, why were not the city building inspectors prosecuted for neglecting their duties and causing the death of 147 persons?</p>
   <p>Indeed, the justice of American Courts is strange. The accident in New York is not the only one of its kind; many peoples are killed daily in factories, mines and railroads because the companies don't want to spend the money necessary to safeguard employees, because this may decrease their net profit. Just eight years ago the theatre Iroqois, in Chicago was destroyed by fire, and 600 lives were lost. Was anyone punished for this crime? No, Human life is cheap. No wonder then, that families of victims are cursing justice.</p>
