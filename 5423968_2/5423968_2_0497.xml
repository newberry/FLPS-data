   <p>At the North Side Turner Hall there gathered a few hundred delegates sent out by various organizations representing many nationalities in Chicago, aiming to unite societies to seek Possession of the citizens' rights in arranging meetings, festivities, sundry pastimes, etc.</p>
   <p>The gathering which was beyond any doubt the largest demonstration ever witnessed, was held March 25, and 40,000 persons came in protest to restriction of decent amusement.</p>
   <p>As it is known, the city government for a long time has already restricted licenses to handle "drinks" even for becoming amusements arranged by respectful organizations. This restriction of the citizens rights exasperated many citizens and led to this demonstration, at which were 500 delegates representing 388 organizations.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's meeting many convincing speeches were orated: from among the speakers spoke also Mr. John J. Smulski, who pointed out many interesting facts dealing with the whole situation.</p>
   <p>They arranged a series of resolutions and established a lasting organization called "The United Societies for Local Self-Government." They resolved that the <pb facs="5423968_2_0498.jpg" n="2"/>committee consist of representatives of all the wards.</p>
   <p>The new permanent organization shall have each year a meeting and shall select its officials, who shall be vigilant in protecting the rights of the citizens. The present year officials are: president, John Koelling; secretary, Geo. A. V. Massow, and vice-presidents are John H. Cervenk, Frank J. Karcz, Stephen Poporic, Vincent L'Aviere, A. F. Olson, Leopold Nevman, and S. W. Haremski. To the executive committee consisting of forty persons belong Poles besides the ones mentioned above like Mr. Karoza and Haremski are the following: Mik Budzban, W. Laszkowski and Com. Frey.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's session many nationalities were represented such as German, Polish, Danish, Hungarian, Italian, Swiss, Croatian, Swedish and French.</p>
