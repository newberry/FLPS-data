   <p>The initial forays before the mayoral campaign have already begun. In the Democratic Party the contest is mainly between two candidates for the nomination--Carter H. Harrison and Washington Hesing, publisher of the German Illinois Staats Zeitung. Both men are millionaires, and both are interested principally in achieving honor. It is not strange that the Germans are supporting Hesing with all their power. It would be no small triumph if they could bring their candidate through and, having already elected a countryman to the governorship of Illinois, elect also a German mayor of Chicago. However, not all of the Germans are supporting Hesing; there are many influential Germans in Harrison's camp. It is amusing to note that the Illinois Staats Zeitung, which two years ago could hardly find words enough to describe Harrison's greatness, slanders him most vigorously.</p>

   <p>Amusing also are the excuses it resorts to in explaining why it praised him two years ago and now drags his name in the mud.</p>
   <p>The Poles, so far as can be determined, are supporting Harrison. They can expect no benefit from Hesing. His paper, politically favorable to the Poles in exceptional cases, very often ridicules us with intense racial hatred. Hesing has never been a great friend of the Polish people.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Harrison forces met at Briggs House yesterday evening. At this meeting, a campaign committee, including our Peter Kiolbassa and Stanley Kunz, was chosen.</p>
