  <body>
   <p>Very interesting conclusions concerning the Poles have just recently been found in the private papers of the late Stephen Buszczynski, famous Polish historian. These conclusions, which are of great importance and worthy of public attention, are as follows:</p>
   <p>The Poles quite often commit errors which proceed from the old weakness of the nation. The principal fault of the Poles is Disunity--a weakness which even an ardent love of their country has been unable to root out.</p>
   <p>The second fault, which proceeds from the first, is that every Pole would like to deliver Poland in his own way, paying no attention to what others have to say.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_1157.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The third fault is lack of perseverance. The Germans are right when they say that the Poles know how to die for their fatherland, but do not know how to live for it.</p>
   <p>The fourth fault is lack of the spirit of generosity. Years ago, the people were more generous because they were more prosperous. Today, they are not so generous, and we cannot expect to accomplish wonders with small donations and little co-operation.</p>
   <p>The fifth fault is procrastination.</p>
   <p>The sixth fault is talkativeness. We like to make parliamentary speeches, wasting time talking instead of doing something more practical.</p>
   <p>Finally, the seventh fault is lack of self-confidence. [We trust too much in] the old saying, "Everything will take care of itself".</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the public has the ridiculous and illogical conception that if <pb facs="5423968_2_1158.jpg" n="3"/>a person commits a crime or some blunder from conviction, his crime is not a crime and his blunder is not a blunder. On account of this false conception, crime and blunder are tolerated by the public.</p>
   <p>We should read these observations and ponder over them.</p>
