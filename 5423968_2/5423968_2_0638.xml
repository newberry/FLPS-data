   <p>Damage is being wrought in Polish society in America by the scandal of child whipping by a Polish family in Chicago. This affair is widely publicized in American newspapers.</p>
   <p>In reality, this is a matter of exceptional degenerate conditions, but involuntarily suggestive of unhappy reflections on the theme of child rearing by the Polish emigration. Because with shame we must sincerely admit to ourselves that we take little interest in rearing our children, and that too often we entrust this bringing up to the streets. Then when we notice deficiencies and lack of character, we resort to the "bringing up of ours" with a stick, and try to beat them into obedience and out of "evil." We punish our children physically with a moral lash, with terror, tyrannical bending of spirit and mind, to suit our own whims.</p>
   <p>The result of such abuse, because such bringing up is nothing else, is bound to reflect most fatally on these innocent victims of our own <pb facs="5423968_2_0639.jpg" n="2"/>ignorance and outbursts of our ungovernable temper.</p>
   <p>The brutality of corporeal punishment and the cruelty of the stronger over the weaker does not exist in the Christian spirit.</p>
   <p>Science rejects it and condemns it decidedly as a symptom of barbarism, recommending entirely different methods, scientific, and the only kind that bring the required results in the modern rearing of children.</p>
   <p>The results of scientific study based upon the watchful and diligent investigation of a child's mind and spirit, proclaim today in a most convincing way that it is a physical impossibility to compel a child to certain things against which the heart and the mind of the child revolts instinctively. It is true that we can temporarily and only apparently force obedience to our absolute will and superior force, but as a result of such terrorizing we warp its character, and make <pb facs="5423968_2_0640.jpg" n="3"/>of it for the future, a moral cripple.</p>
   <p>An interesting lecture on this theme was rendered last Friday at the University of Chicago by Dr. Jessie Taft, who is a prominent authority in the field of child psychology, as well as a director of the Child Study Department of Seyfert's University, Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>She outlines an altogether modern method of rearing children: One should awaken scientifically in the minds of children an interest in those directions, in which the development of the child is most desirable.</p>
   <p>The schools can do a great deal in this direction, but the most lasting cardinal fundamentals are received by the child in the home of its parents. Therefore, in order that it should be good and fit, we must above all devote more attention and time to the child than we have in the past, not forgetting for a moment the most important commandment: Do not beat children.</p>
