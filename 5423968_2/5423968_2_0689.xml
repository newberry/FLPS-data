   <p>As in other years, this year we turn the Mother's attention to the coming vacation time. Schools will stand empty for two months, teachers will enjoy a well earned rest, but the streets will be filled with children deprived of a mother's care, not only will they wander aimlessly on the streets, but will create disturbances with their yelling, running and fighting, they will be spoiled in a fearful way. Mothers should know that the streets are schools of ruination and bad companions. A mother should also know, where her child is, with whom and in what manner he is playing. A child should not be allowed to spend the whole day in play.</p>
   <p>Vacation is not to allow the young people to waste whole days but to rest and spend some time with good books.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0690.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It surprises the mother sometime to find her children stubborn, disobedient, quarrelsome and with an amazing knowledge of curses.</p>
   <p>If the mother spent less time in the yard inspecting her neighbors' dresses and hats, if she would not lock the door and put her children out in the yard, then her Frank and Johnny would not learn to curse. A mother should not take her eyes off her children for a moment, but play with them as often as possible, talk to them and give them some occupation suitable to their age. Children roaming the streets not under the protection of a Guardian Angel, this, the spoiling of our children is due to the mother and the streets. It often happens that after the children have received Holy Communion, parents send their children to factories, where for a meager sum of money, the children ruin their health, while still very young, become cripples or unfit for work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0691.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is a wrong system for the parents, and a false sense of profits. Those children whose assistance is absolutely necessary may go to work, but their work should be such that will not wreck their strength and health. There are parents who do not need help, who are well off and whose children possess some talent and still they are taken out of school and sent to work with a pail. Such parents sin, our immigrants need educated people, a talented child instead of going to work, should be educated further. Education will not hurt, it costs, it is true, money, time and effort, but has its reward. There are two things to which we call the attention of our mothers. Watch your children carefully during the vacation period, and if you have any talented children urge them on to further education.</p>
   <p>We know from experience that our American Boys do not especially like to learn or go to school. But there is a cure, - a well oiled switch or strap. After this medicine a desire for learning will be found.</p>
