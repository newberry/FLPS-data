<title level="a">ARMOUR POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL IN CHICAGO ABOUT POLAND</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Armour Polytechnic School is one of the first schools of this kind in America. Besides its main school building it has its own factory, in which students are engaged in various types of work that come within the sphere of their study. THere the students learn to be engineers, mechanics (I belong to them), electricians, chemists, miners, metal workers, architects, etc.</p>
   <p>There are about two thousand students attending the different day and night courses. Jews and Germans constitute a large percentage of them. They boast that they are Jews and Germans, and behave themselves in an arrogant manner. At present the Germans have dropped their noses, but to offset that the Jews, especially those coming from Lithuania and Poland, are raising their heads high and admit that they are bolsheviks and that they would like to bring about "certain changes here in America."</p>
   <p>There are a few Poles hiding in corners, who are ashamed of their <pb facs="5423968_2_0957.jpg" n="2"/>nationality, they speak only English. In the school bulletin it is marked that there is only one Pole in the whole school among almost two thousand students, meaning that I must be the one.</p>
   <p>On account of the death of former President Theodore Roosevelt, the president of the school told everybody to assemble in the main hall where patriotic singing and speeches took place, and also five minutes of silence to honor the memory of the late Mr. Roosevelt.</p>
   <p>The president of the school, Mr. Ganzalus, spoke on the life of Roosevelt and Poland.</p>
   <p>In order to understand in what way Poland and Roosevelt came together in the talk of our president, let my respected brothers of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union be kind enough to listen to the following story:</p>
   <p>A few years ago Mr. Roosevelt agitated war preparedness for America and called the Germans barbarians and demanded war with them. I sympathized with his demands that America should prepare for war, which anyhow was <pb facs="5423968_2_0958.jpg" n="3"/>unavoidable.</p>
   <p>Wherever I happened to have the opportunity, I spoke to people, whether they were Poles or Americans, telling them that Poland also was a republic and that in Poland there was freedom of religion, freedom of speech; there was everything, but the preparedness for war, and that is why the Polish nation is being maltreated already for the second century. The same thing can happen with America.</p>
   <p>This does not mean however that I support the extreme chauvinism of Roosevelt, who demanded we close our schools, hang up our newspapers, etc. I supported him only in preparedness for war, and this from my great love for the "German."</p>
   <p>My opponents nevertheless often told me to shut up because they said I was still green and did not yet understand American affairs. (It was then the third year since my arrival from Poland). In order to <pb facs="5423968_2_0959.jpg" n="4"/>shut the mouths of my opponents I collected all my arguments on paper and sent them for examination to Roosevelt. He gave me the following answer:</p>
   <p>Oyster Bay, Long Island, N. Y., June 8, 1916.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Nurczyk: That's a capital letter of yours! You are an American of Polish birth, but I wish that many of our college presidents, and other men of pure native American blood, who pride themselves on their intelligence, had one half your understanding of the situation.</p>
   <p>You preach sound American doctrine.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
   <p>With this letter I shut the mouths of all my opponents.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0960.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Now, when Roosevelt is dead, this letter with such flatter contents about an American of Polish descent is of much importance to us Poles, the more because Poland needs help to the utmost.</p>
   <p>So then, before the memorial solemnities in honor of Roosevelt, I showed the letter to our president of the school, furnishing him with my explanation.</p>
   <p>This created an immense impression of the president. During the solemnities, in his speech about Roosevelt, he cited by entire explanation and letter from Roosevelt, expressing himself very flatteringly about Poland and the Poles. He prepared himself at first for this speech by reading paragraphs from the history of Poland.</p>
   <p>The results of this talk for poland are evident. The students are writing exercises using Poland as a theme, reading material from papers and from historical manuals. I personally was told to write <pb facs="5423968_2_0961.jpg" n="6"/>thorough exercises about the situation in Poland, about our past and what I think abou the future of our nation.</p>
   <p>These are all educated people, who as professors already occupy important positions which the students will occupy in the future. Therefore we ought to depend on their opinion about us.</p>
   <p>However, the Jews and Germans are looking askance at me. There is one professor teaching history of civilization, a German by descent, who takes pride in his knowledge received in Berlin. THis one, in his lectures whenever there was talk about Poland, would cast an aspersion upon it. Maybe he is doing that unconsciously because he studied in Berlin with the Prussians, and they everything about Poland written awry.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if the Poles would themselves aspire to this school. It is so richly endowed and the accommodations are such that everyone can benefit from them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0962.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>If you are a workman working in a so-called machine shop and would like to learn your work better, you could work while learning in this school, because they have a first class factory. You can learn joinery, molding, blacksmithing, everything in general. They have a special laboratory for research investigation of fuels and greases. They teach about automobiles, about wireless telegraphy, etc.</p>
   <p>Several Poles, through my persuasion, are attending the evening courses. They are studying that with which they are occupied during the day, improving their earnings.</p>
   <p>Fr. Nurczyk</p>
   <p>Stipendiary of the Polish R. C. Union.</p>
