   <p>It is said that half of the Chicago policemen are engaged in bootlegging.</p>
   <p>Members of the "Cooperative Club" held a meeting at the Great Northern Hotel, at which Dr. Thomas A. Carter, a prominent Chicago physician, spoke on prohibition.</p>
   <p>"The eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, has completely thrown out of balance, the life of the average American." - said the physician. "Today the average citizen will walk a mile for his favorite brand of cigarettes, but he is careless about his health. Prohibition has completely corrupted our youth of today. A young girl of today learns to drink whiskey before she reaches maturity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0431.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Drunkenness, develops in her, an egotistic disposition. The average young man takes the same course. Why do we have so many unhappy marriages today? Because, - 'like meets like.'"</p>
   <p>That is Doctor Thomas' opinion of American prohibition.</p>
   <p>Prohibition in the United States! What a beautiful and noble expression! Do not burst into laughter, when you pronounce the word Prohibition.</p>
   <p>In fact, it is a ridicule of common sense and the American public.</p>
   <p>Prohibition was adopted during the World War, when millions of young people were across the ocean, fighting for democracy.</p>
   <p>Before the American people had a chance to look around, a band of bigots, preachers, habitual evangelists, professional reformers and other bootleggers, forced prohibition on the American public in order to rid the country of saloons, <pb facs="5423968_2_0432.jpg" n="3"/>and other places where liquor was sold. "The saloons must go," - such was the slogan of our dear benefactors of humanity, pastors of different denominations, and members of the Anti-saloon league.</p>
   <p>"When the saloons disappear, there shall be no more crime; and all America will become virtuous." So preached the evangelists of the Billy Sunday type and the Aimee McPherson type, the evangelist in skirts, who spends her spare time, when not engaged in battle with Sodom, in the company of a moving picture operator.</p>
   <p>Saloons have disappeared, - let their memory rest in peace, but, - they were replaced with speakeasies, and bootlegging; in other words, murdering the people by means of poisoned alcohol.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, 6,000 saloons went out of existence, but in their place more than 15,000 speakeasies were opened, and the number is increasing daily.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0433.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This condition exists everywhere in fact in every place, where human beings, did not renounce the use of alcoholic drinks, in spite of the order issued by the government.</p>
   <p>Million Gallons of Poison</p>
   <p>Prohibition, or the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States exists only on paper, because the people of today consume millions of gallons of poisonous whiskey, which is made of denatured alcohol. In the past, people drank liquor, but we did not fear much, about murders, suicides, robberies and crimes, of every description as we do now.</p>
   <p>Prohibition gave birth to bootlegging, which, in turn brought forth wholesale murders such as we witness in large cities, by means of machine guns.</p>
   <p>Liquor is smuggled secretly into this country from England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada, and worst of all is the fact that ignorant liquor dealers buy liquor of an inferior quality, and sell it to the public as the best imported <pb facs="5423968_2_0434.jpg" n="5"/>stuff, for which they charge a very high price, in America.</p>
   <p>A high official of the New York City police, stated that bootleggers secure the right to operate their loathsome business, through bribery. And the chief of Chicago police made the statement that half of the policemen in Chicago, are engaged in the bootlegging business. This condition, in other cities is not better and sometimes worse.</p>
   <p>People of the lower classes, drink the inferior type of liquor, but the wealthy, have the very best kind.</p>
   <p>Bootlegging is an internal business, and the government, not desirous of losing any revenue, imposes a tax on the bootlegger's income. Bootleggers are even permitted to deduct the amount spent for bribing officials; from their income tax.</p>
   <p>European nations discarded prohibition when they found it impracticable.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_2_0435.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>In America, prohibition still exists, but only in theory. In practice they wittingly violate this law at every step, penalties do not prevent violations.</p>
   <p>How long will this poisoning of the people continue? Will the American Nation eventually arise from that lethargy and modify the Volstead Act?</p>
