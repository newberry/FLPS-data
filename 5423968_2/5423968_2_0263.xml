<title level="a">THE GIRLS OF ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA SCHOOL DISPLAY THEIR TALENTS</title></bibl>

   <p>A program was presented yesterday evening in the School Hall near Bradley Street by the girls of St. Stanislaus Kostka School. The varied program lasted all evening from 7:30 to 10:30. The performance, which was a credit to the school, was viewed with interest by an unusually large audience.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of piano and zither solos, songs, a ring and broom exercise, and a four-act play entitled "Dwie Matki" (Two Mothers). The nuns who, as teachers, prepared the children for this public appearance, are to be marveled at for their efforts and their zeal.</p>
   <p>The ring and broom exercises are to the girls as military drill is to boys; these were greatly enjoyed by the audience. About eighty girls, many of whom are still quite small, performed the exercises with wonderful precision. All dressed alike, the girls looked like a corps of cadets and certainly <pb facs="5423968_2_0264.jpg" n="2"/>equaled them in perfection of drill. It was impossible to perceive the slightest fault in these exercises, which were not always simple; there was no visible adult conducting the drill, while commands were called by one of the girls.</p>
   <p>The four-act play was a drama based on a fourteenth century legend. The exactness with which the play proceeded was astounding, in view of the fact that no prompter was present.</p>
   <p>The whole performance was successful in every way. As far as we know; this was the first public appearance of the girls of St. Stanislaus Kostka School; every appearance in the future will certainly draw a large audience.</p>
