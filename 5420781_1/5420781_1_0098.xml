   <p>Important meetings sponsored by the Chicago Fundamental Ministers' Union and the National Union of Christian Schools were held last Monday afternoon in the Christian High School, and in the evening in the Church on 72nd Street.</p>
   <p>The main speakers were the Reverend P. B. Fitzwater, who spoke on the topic "Parents' Responsibility in the Education of their Children," and the Reverend J. Althius, who spoke on the topic, "The Need and Method of Co-operation in the Field of Christian Education". The main speakers in the evening were the Reverend J. O. Bushwell, President of Wheaton College, who spoke on the topic, "The Crying Need for Christian Schools," and J. J. Hiemenga, who gave a good lecture on "An Investment Bringing Eternal Revenues".</p>
   <p>It is particularly worthy of mention that thirteen different societies were invited all of which saw the necessity of Christian Education and wished to foster it.</p>
