<title level="a">MR. J. HOEKSTRA CANDIDATE FOR ASSESSOR IN THE TOWN OF CALUMET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Mr. J. Hoekstra, of 310 West 111th Place, is the only Dutch candidate on the Republican ticket for assessor of the township of Calumet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoekstra does not need any recommendation. Since 1886, when he came to America, he has lived in the above township and is well known and liked by nearly everybody, old and young, rich and poor. He is therefore so well acquainted with the local situation of the township that one would find it impossible to get a fitter person for the office of Assessor.</p>
   <p>Moreover, he knows the duties and other matters of the office. Five times he served as Deputy Collector under five different collectors of the township. And the work of Collector is so closely connected with that of Assessor that it was necessary for Mr. Hoekstra to make <pb facs="5420781_1_0318.jpg" n="2"/>himself acquainted with the activities of that office.</p>
   <p>The editor of this paper considers it its duty to insist that nobody refrains from voting, that everybody should poll for Mr. Hoekstra as Assessor, a position which can be filled by Mr. Hoekstra.</p>
   <p>How you vote otherwise does not matter so long as you put a cross before Mr. Hoekstra's name.</p>
   <p>This year new assessments will be made and it is in everybody's interest that a capable, honest, and conscientious officer is chosen. Such a man is Mr. Hoekstra, our candidate for Assessor.</p>
