   <p>Editor of Onze Toekomst:</p>
   <p>The American has progressed in many respects, but in others he is left wanting. For instance, in the large cities of the Netherlands and England comfort stations are provided to accommodate men and women. I must say that they were just as necessary as drinking places. But where will a stranger find comfort stations in our large cities? In the saloon? That is a business establishment and no place for women. But as I must go to a saloon, I buy a nickel cigar for appearances' sake.</p>
   <p>Some time ago two men went with me to a saloon. Each of them bought a glass of whisky, costing fifteen cents. I wondered if they have wives and children who are in want. It would keep many people out of the saloons if public comfort stations were provided here.</p>
   <p>Some days ago, I read in a Dutch weekly that the distiller makes from a sack <pb facs="5420781_1_0210.jpg" n="2"/>of grain with the help of harmful supplements, a barrel of gin retailing for 120 guilders. The farmer, who raises the grain, receives 4 guilders for it; the government, who taxes the gin, receives 32 guilders. The railroad company charges 7.50 guilders for transportation; the distiller, who makes it, receives 27.50 guilders; the drayman, who takes it away, asks 2.50 guilders for his services; the saloonkeeper, who sells it, receives 47.50 guilders. The toper gets a headache, and the poor wife a licking, while his children go hungry. Instead of clothes these wretches are dressed in rags.</p>
   <p>God has given us grain to make bread, not to squander by making a hellish liquor out of it.</p>
   <p>Thanking you for the space in your paper, I am</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>S. Bolt, 1516 Estes Avenue</p>
