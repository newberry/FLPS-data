   <p>Dutch History, Art, and Literature.</p>
   <p>Giving ear to the urgent request of many interested people, Dr. T. de Vries, teacher of Dutch history, art, and literature, at the University of Chicago, has published in book size, through Eerdmans-Sevensma Co., of Grand Rapids, a number of principal lectures delivered by him at the university, under the title: Dutch History, Art, and Literature for Americans.</p>
   <p>It is a concise book of more than two hundred pages and contains lectures on the following subjects:</p>
   <p>Influence of Holland on America.</p>
   <p>Dutch and American History - A Comparison.</p>
   <p>William the Silent.</p>
   <p>Philip II. </p>
   <p>Rembrandt.</p>
   <p>The Rise of Amsterdam.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0439.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Jacob Steendam, the First Poet of North America.</p>
   <p>Washington Irving and the Dutch People of New York.</p>
   <p>It is very difficult to imagine a book in which such important subjects, as the above mentioned, are discussed in such an excellent, and yet, succinct and clear manner. The whole shows us a master of his business, a person who knows history. In those lectures, historical facts are unfolded which nearly were forgotten, because they are nearly nowhere to be found although their origin is mentioned every once in a while. Dr. de Vries understands the art of giving his readers or listeners a clear view of history.</p>
   <p>Above all things, we read with great pleasure his "Washington Irving and the Dutch People of New York," enriched with several appendices. Not only Irving's "Knickerbockers of New York," but especially his Rip van Winkle are terribly begrimed. Even proof is furnished that Rip van Winkle, with which Irving showed off so much, was truly stolen from our own Dutch writer and scholar, Erasmus.</p>

   <p>The book is illustrated with several beautiful pictures, under which appears the portrait of the writer himself in his study room.</p>
   <p>Here now is really a book that ought not to be lacking in a Dutch-American family. Parents, give it in the hands of your children, if you want them to have respect for the old mother-country and the Netherlands' race.</p>
