   <p>In the First Christian Reformed Church of Chicago, a meeting took place last week, in the interest of Christian education. Delegates from six school boards, as well as twenty teachers, six ministers and representatives of many consistories were present. The object was to form a closer union and more co-operation with the different schools in Chicago and vicinity. The point was especially stressed, that the diplomas given by the Christian Schools, should have the same value, as those given by the public schools. There was a committee appointed, consisting of four school principals and two preachers, to investigate the qualifications regarding same.</p>
   <p>The desirability was also expressed for the forming of a central union or league, through which the local societies would be closer connected and as a result could work together more collectively.</p>
