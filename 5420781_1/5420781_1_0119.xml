   <p>The semi-annual meeting of the 110th Place Society for Christian Education, took place on the evening of April 1st, in the Church auditorium of the First Christian Reformed Congregation. The members with their wives were well represented. Mr. C. Smithers, president of the board, invited the Rev. Doezema to open the meeting, which he did by reading the scripture, and a prayer. Secretarial minutes, reports of Union meetings, and of the treasurer were heard. After this, Rev. Van Beek of Oak Lawn delivered a good speech, which was recognized for its historical truths.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob Bosch, president of the committee of the new school, spoke next, and explained before the audience how the committee was anxious to build the new school. Having started with the financial end of the project, he could report that things were going satisfactorily, and that forty people had already subscribed $20,000.00. If the committee could continue the work in this manner, the building of the new school could commence very soon. God bless our school and all other Christian schools. The Rev. Van Beek closed with a prayer.</p>
