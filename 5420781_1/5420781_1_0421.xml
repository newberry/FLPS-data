   <p>The Amsterdam Standard reminds us that next September New York City expects to celebrate with great pomp the tercentenary anniversary of Hudson's first journey up the Hudson River, and the centennial anniversary of Fulton's first navigation by steam upon that body of water. The festivities will last seven days and the entire country is expected to participate in this great event.</p>
   <p>The paper adds the following: "Hudson first sailed up the river under the Dutch flag, on a Dutch ship, named 'Halve Maan' (Half Moon), in the service of the East India Company. Although he was an Englishman, his voyage consolidated and enhanced our glory by the colonization of Manhattan, out of which rose New York, which was first called New Amsterdam.</p>
   <p>"Our desire at this time is to have the Netherlands, as well as the Holland Society of New York participate in this jubilee. We are glad that a group of men have taken the initiative and are contacting interested people to see <pb facs="5420781_1_0422.jpg" n="2"/>what can be done.</p>
   <p>"It is expected that the government will take part in this jubilee. America has never forgotten its Dutch origin, and in Michigan, Iowa, and Illinois, new Dutch colonies are developing."</p>
