   <p>The Dutch Society "Excelsior," which is giving its annual picnic on Saturday, July 4, in Jestram's Grove, Hillside, Illinois, held its annual meeting last Friday, June 26. The board of directors chosen for this year consists of the following members: J. van den Berg, president; D. Baar, vice-president; B. van der Molen, secretary; P. Woltman, treasurer; A. Heis, vicar; C. Tetswaard, librarian; R. Huizinga, sergeant at arms; and A. Dijkema, B. van der Molen, Jr., and E. Heringa, directors. Dr. H. B. De Bey was chosen to act as physician.</p>
   <p>The auditor's report indicated that the Society had 150 members, and that during the year, $993.29 had been received as contributions and special gifts, from which $728.12 was spent; consequently there was a Credit balance of $265.17.</p>
   <p>The Society, which regularly gives its picnics on the 4th of July, has <pb facs="5420781_1_0511.jpg" n="2"/>chosen a suitable day. This gives everybody an opportunity to spend the day away from the noise and traffic of the city. The usual public amusements such as foot races, boating, egg-rolling races, etc., will be on the program as usual.</p>
