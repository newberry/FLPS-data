   <p>The Ton family, who last week held their eleventh family re-union now counts 448 members, at least that amount is written on the family register. The family is that of Jan Ton, who in 1849 settled in Roseland. Of his nine children, only one is among the living, namely, Mr. Jacob Ton, age 74, and living on Michigan Avenue and 109th Street. The family historian, Mr. C. J. Ton, declared in his report of the year gone by, that no death had occurred, but that the family had increased by 12 young Tons. Seven marriages took place during the year.</p>
   <p>The family historian has the habit of mentioning the names each year, of all the members of the family, who are over thirty years of age and unmarried. It seems that this habit has the power to make many of them seek a mate for life, there are few who wish to have their name published year after year, as a hardened bachelor or a crabby old maid. The day at Thornton Park was beautiful, and was enjoyably spent.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0243.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The following persons were chosen as officers for the coming year: N. R. Koopman, president; Peter de Groot, vice president; "Beau" Brennen, secretary; Col. M 'A Hout, treasurer; C. J. Ton, historian. The last mentioned is a candidate for State Representative from the 13th senatorial district.</p>
