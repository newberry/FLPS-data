   <p>The annual meeting of members of the burial fund Zelfhulp, was held last Wednesday evening in Mandel Hall, 30 East Randolph Street. It was well attended and nearly all the seats in the large auditorium were occupied. The result of the meeting was; R. Vander Molen was re-elected President; H. Stuit, Vice-president; I. Emmering, Secretary; R. Mulder, Treasurer; Dr. H. B. DeBey, W. DeHerder and J. DeBoer, were also re-elected Directors.</p>
   <p>The new revised by-laws, which were formulated by the committee, appointed at a former meeting, were read. It was decided to have them printed and mailed to the members at least two weeks before the special meeting, which will be held in March or April.</p>
