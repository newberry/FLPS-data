   <p>On Thursday, April 29th, my beloved son Simon Kuperus, known here as Cooper, lost his life through an unavoidable accident. In the center of the city there was a great fire in a grain elevator. Fifty of the fireman came through unscathed, but my son and his Lieutenant were buried under the debris of a falling wall. It took his companions twelve hours to find his body, but then it was already too late.</p>
   <p>It was his day off, but he had taken the place of a friend, and would have been transferred the following week to a more convenient station. He was loved by everyone and friendly to all who knew him. Besides his father and mother, seven brothers and sisters mourn this heavy loss.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, May 2nd. he was laid to rest in St. Bonifacious Cemetery, accompanied, from the Superior Cathedral on Superior Street, by a cortege consisting of the family and 150 firemen. I, his mother confirm my hearty thanks to the Fire-Department and friends for the interest shown in this tragic death.</p>
