   <p>Mr. Editor: Allow me a place, if you please for the article below in your newspaper, "Excelsior" is the name of our society and excelsior is the purpose for which we stand; higher yet higher with the help of all the Dutch of this city. In the last meeting of the society Excelsior, a plan was brought forward to make efforts for the acquisition of a Home for the aged, for the benefit of our Dutch people. We all know that in Chicago are many aged Dutchmen who due to their old age are not capable of making their own living. So many are there who must apply to one or other charitable institutions and ask for assistance for their support. that they may spend their last days there. And very often the support of our aged by friends and relatives as a rule is short lived. And so you see, then the poor farm is their only refuge. And what that means only those who have experienced it know.</p>
   <p>It is especially for this reason that nearly all other Nationalities have their own Home for the Aged. They feel the need therefore and work so that this need may be satisfied.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0538.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And it is with that self same feeling the same honor and respect for our aged, that our meeting decided to call on all our countrymen and ask their support to attain this purpose. No, the plans are not developed. For this purpose the need is great. Therefore the cooperation is necessary of all the Dutch, and in particular of all the Dutch societies, no matter of what nature.</p>
   <p>Already in our meeting a committee was appointed to discuss, if possible with other Dutch societies and Church organizations of this city, with a view to work collectively in the interest and to the support of our dependent aged Dutch here in Chicago. To you Mr. Editor, thanks in advance for publishing this article in the name of the society Excelsior.</p>
   <p>B . Vander Molen, Secretary.</p>
