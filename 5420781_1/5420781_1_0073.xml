<title level="a">A CHAIR FOR THE DUTCH LANGUAGE, LITERATURE AND HISTORY AT OUR UNIVERSITY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It is well known that the Chicago Section of the General Netherlands' League is trying to obtain a Chair in the Dutch Language, History, and Literature at the University of Chicago, and a prediction has been made in reference to it. The Chicago Section received from the Board of Directors at Dordrecht, Netherlands, the following letter:</p>
   <p>To The Board of Directors of the Chicago Section!</p>
   <p>Gentlemen;</p>
   <p>In answer to your letter of September 14, at our Board of Directors meeting of October 23, we decided to inform you, that it is with the greatest of pleasure, we have taken cognizance of your efforts, to establish a Chair for the Dutch Language, Literature and History in the University of Chicago. We hope you succeed.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0074.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first movement shall be of very great importance. If a Dutch teacher is appointed at one of the American Universities, then, through the great competition among the Universities, the others will follow. And as one nation has the right to show its civilization and principles in your country, then, it is by all means "The Netherlands".</p>
   <p>With interest we are following your activities in this affair, and at all times we will be glad to hear the progress made in this matter.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours.</p>
   <p>By The Board of Directors,</p>
   <p>H. Kiewiet de Tonge, President;</p>
   <p>W. Dicke, Secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0075.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A short contents of the petition which the Section of Chicago has brought into circulation to be signed is of the following effect:</p>
   <p>To The Trustees of the University-Senate of Chicago;</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.,</p>
   <p>Gentlemen;</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned, of Dutch origin, and who are in sympathy with the purpose of making the people of America acquainted with the Dutch history, literature and language, humbly request, the eraction of a Chair for the study of Dutch history, literature and language, at the University of Chicago, this Chair also comprising the now existing sub-division of Netherlands' Art, in the Division of Art, at the University.</p>
   <p>We are requesting this of you, in earnest, for the sake of the great value of Dutch history itself.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0076.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The peculiar and intimate relations "The Netherlands" have had and still have with the United States, in the colonizing of the Dutch, in several Eastern States, and immigration of a later date, encouraged public interest in the Dutch art and literature, by every nationality.</p>
   <p>Furthermore we point out such need of a Chair, because Chicago, and its celebrated Universities are situated in the center of three quarters of the present Dutch immigrants, of the United States, and also because the University of Chicago has several individuals of Dutch origin as students. Already a division of Netherlands' art is established. This fact shows undisputably, this University to be, the center of Dutch civilization and influence in the United States.</p>
   <p>Hereby we assure the University of Chicago with all our hearts, moral support and if possible financial help in case a Chair as above described, should be erected at the University.</p>
