   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>I wish to thank you for the information, which you have given, regarding the cost of instruction, in your last issue. The situation however, undergoes no change in my opinion, that the cost of each child to the city is $60.00, or that each citizen pays $60.00 for each child. Concerning your remarks, that I would be convinced that I did not pay enough taxes, that may be true, but there are thousands of others, who also do not pay enough.</p>
   <p>However, I would like it if I had to pay more, my position would then be much better financially. Concerning your assertion that public instruction is an expensive luxury, I consider education the most beautiful and the most useful thing on earth and in my opinion, there never was, and never will be, too much paid for it, compared with other expenditures. Regarding parochial education, every one has his or her feelings, and I also have mine as an individual. And with this I consider the discussion closed. I thank you Mr. Editor, in advance for the placing of these lines. Greetings: C. B. Koop</p>
