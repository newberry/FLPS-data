   <p>Question: In the daily newspapers we read much concerning the coming Hudson Celebrations, taking place during the week of September 25, to commemorate the discovery of the Hudson River in the year 1609. Although Henry Hudson was not Dutch by birth, he, nevertheless, was in the service of a Dutch firm, and so the undertaking was strictly a Dutch venture. In view of this, allow me to ask this question: What is being done by the Dutch in Chicago to commemorate that fact? Or are our people indifferent about this matter?</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>S. V. D. Werp</p>
   <p>Answer: As far as we know nothing is being done. True, the Chicago division of the General Dutch League has considered the case in earnest. It would have been glad to plan a large gathering in the Downtown district, be it in the Auditorium Building or some other well known hall where one or more famous speakers would appear, but it was a question of money or rather of lack of it. Such a meeting would have cost at least $1,000, and it is hard to find someone who is interested enough in the case to spend such a sum.</p>

   <p>Other plans were also considered, for example, a large gathering exclusively for Dutchmen. This would be possible with the co-operation of the churches or the different Dutch societies. But to do this, there must be co-operation, and that is usually non-existent among our people. But it is not yet too late. Possibly there is someone among those who read this who can tell us how to handle this problem.</p>
