   <p>Notwithstanding the unfavorable weather, the attendance of the "Taggers" in the Second Christian Reform Church of Englewood was surprising. More than two hundred were present. After attending to business, the meeting was opened by the singing of the Doxology, the reading of a chapter of the Bible and prayer. Mrs. D. De Jong gave a report on thirteen different denominations, which had been helpful in the work for this home. The ladies have gathered during the last six years $10, 471.36. The ladies of the church, where the gathering took place, had prepared a wonderful program and refreshments, of which good use was made. Mr. Tamminga, in short, pointed to the fact that the time was ripe to build a new home. Later we will hear more of this. The meeting was closed with prayer by Harry De Boer.</p>
   <p>Mrs. P. Roosma.</p>
