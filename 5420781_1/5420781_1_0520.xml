   <p>The general yearly meeting of the burial fund "Zelf Hulp" will be held at Handel Hall, 40 East Randolph Street next Wednesday, February 9.</p>
   <p>We would prefer not to have to mention this meeting at this time, but, because the board is not following the usual method this year of announcing the meeting, we are compelled to do so. Previously, the meetings were generally announced in Onze Toekomst (Our Tribune), but it seems that the board is making an exception this time.</p>
   <p>For that reason we like to call the attention of our readers to the fact that it is of the greatest importance that all franchised members should be present to elect an official to whom they wish to entrust the interests of "Zelf Hulp" in the future.</p>
   <p>Intentionally, however, we are abstaining from recommendations. We are <pb facs="5420781_1_0521.jpg" n="2"/>leaving this matter to the judgment of the members, knowing that what has been said by others about this subject is sufficient to provide the members with a guiding rule in their selection.</p>
   <p>We know that the public expects from a Dutch-weekly that it should give advice in this matter, but people must not resent it if modesty requires us to refrain from recommendations.</p>
   <p>One thing, however, we will say, namely, that we fully agree with the decision of the board, a short time ago, to install a new method of bookkeeping. The system kept by the secretary, is obsolete and inaccurate. The system can be simplified in a manner that would save half of the time, while giving more accurate results.</p>
   <p>This would also be an economical investment. Regularly there are two men working in the office. If the secretary could do this work alone, the club would save every week a tidy sum of money.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0522.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In 1909, the so-called free members took up a collection, and in spite of that, the surplus fund has lost about $2,000. A little economy, therefore, should not be superfluous.</p>
   <p>But the installation of a new system of bookkeeping is no child's play. This requires practical knowledge, which is not possessed by everybody.</p>
   <p>Finally we make the request, that anybody, who is able to come, should not stay at home, but should show enough interest in the welfare of our burial fund, to come and bring his vote for such persons as he considers to be worthy of the confidence of the public.</p>
