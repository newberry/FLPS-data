   <p>Only a few days ago the request came to me from the Holland Society of Chicago that if it were possible I might devote my time and my labor to the movement to establish a Chair of Dutch language, history, and literature at the University of Chicago. This task, regardless of the honor connected with it, I pronounced, so far as I personally was concerned, a delicate task, and against my undertaking it I mentioned three obstacles. In the first place, I am unknown to the Dutch in America, and this fact might easily damage the movement; in the second place, I have been repeatedly mentioned in connection with the movement, and it would appear that I was working in the case for personal profit; and in the third place, I know the condition of the Dutch in America and their inclinations only in part, and I did not know how to lead the movement to a successful conclusion. These three main obstacles, however, were overcome by the members of the Holland Society of Chicago. In their opinion I was the right man, and they would provide <pb facs="5420781_1_0378.jpg" n="2"/>the necessary means to introduce me personally; they would provide all the documents pertaining to the history of the movement; and last but not least, the Holland Society had decided to guarantee a fund of a thousand dollars, half the amount necessary for the success of the cause, and at the same time they pointed out to me the way to procure the other thousand. I was informed that inasmuch as my name was connected with the matter, it would be genuinely American for me to put my hand to the plow. Never was a university, a school, or a church established unless those men who were most interested made a supreme effort. Thus checkmated, I could hardly withdraw, and since I could see the general interest in the matter, an interest shared by many men of reputation and influence, I had reason for joy and thanks that the Holland Society had such confidence in me as to make me its advocate and counselor.</p>
   <p>In the first place I had to introduce myself, and for me that was a delicate matter. I felt somewhat as Beets did when he wrote that chapter in the Camera Obscura in which he himself played the main role, which was the reason why he was embarrassed. But the Holland Society came willingly to my aid. One of the <pb facs="5420781_1_0379.jpg" n="3"/>members had without my knowledge written to the Netherlands and requested references regarding me. As a result of this the following letters were handed to me with the request to make them known to the Dutch in America as my introduction. The first letter is from Dr. A. Kuiper and reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Glad to see your handwriting, and I venture to state that Mr. De Vries is a very clever man, of keen understanding, thoroughly acquainted with Dutch history and with the Dutch language. I do not see how you could find a better teacher, and I shall be very [glad] if you succeed in giving him a Chair in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly, </p>
   <p>Dr. A. Kuiper.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0380.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The second letter is from Professor H. Bavinck and reads:</p>
   <p>Amsterdam, October 28, 1910.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir and Friend:</p>
   <p>It gave me great pleasure to receive a letter from you and to note that you are in good health, and I was no less happy to read that Mr. T. De Vries may obtain a Chair of Dutch history at the University of Chicago. I hope that the money will be collected, and that a Chair will be established in Chicago for the history of our people. That would be of the greatest consequence for the Dutch settlements, and Holland's name would be honored still more in America than it already is. And Mr. De Vries, when placed in this Chair, would speedily prove that he was the right man there. He has studied much about our past and has lived with us in the present. In addition, he is a man of strong convictions, who recalls to our people with spirit their glorious past, and he is thus, through his spirit and his character, more easily understood. Therefore may <pb facs="5420781_1_0381.jpg" n="5"/>God bless your efforts. With hearty greetings from Mrs. Bavinck and me,</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>H. Bavinck.</p>
   <p>The third letter is from the well-known Professor Blok of Leyden:</p>
   <p>Leyden, December 15, 1910.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I have the pleasure to testify that I know Mr. T. De Vries as a very clever man who from his youth has had a remarkable fondness for historical reading and research, buying and reading books and manuscripts and composing useful bibliographies and histories; expecially [valuable] are his biographical notes on the Dutch statesman and Calvinist Groen of Prinsteren.</p>
   <p>P. J. Blok.</p>

   <p>These are the letters which the Holland Society requested me to publish. When I arrived in America to pay a visit to my son, I had the pleasure of seeing consecutively Princeton University, the City of Philadelphia, the Library at Washington, the University of New York, Yale, Harvard, and Cornell Universities, the University of Chicago, and that at Madison, Wisconsin, I gained the acquaintance of a multitude of prominent professors and the welcome accorded to me everywhere made my stay in the New World exceedingly pleasant. Many times, in Holland, I had heard of the hospitality of the Americans, and when I was ready to make a tour of America, the question arose in my mind: What can I do in return when I am hospitably received? I decided to take pictures of historic and geographic interest illustrating all the provinces historic and geographic of the Netherlands, and from them I had lantern slides made so that if desired, I might give lectures on Holland. So I arrived in New York with 350 slides in my possession and found a hearty <pb facs="5420781_1_0383.jpg" n="7"/>welcome awaiting me, extended by the members of the Holland Society. A few weeks later I gave a lecture, at the request of the Holland Society, before its members, and I had the pleasure of spending a happy evening there. Later, when I arrived in Chicago, I had the pleasure of giving a lecture on Holland with lantern slides before the Holland Society in the Stratford Hotel, and I had an opportunity to acquaint myself with many members, whose warm friendship I have enjoyed ever since. And it was here in Chicago that my attention was drawn to the movement for a Chair of Dutch history, language and literature, and in very high circles I was urged to hold myself in readiness for that position. To tell the truth, it had always been my plan to occupy a Chair of that sort at one of the universities, and I had planned my course of study with that object in view. But opportunity in the old fatherland is scarce; there is seldom an opening, and the old party war often plays the main role, so that sometimes one may wait his entire life before attaining his object, even though men of influence stand behind one with their recommendations. Yet what is hard to attain in little Holland would probably be easier in the greatness of America. Nearly all those who came from Europe to America have thought that <pb facs="5420781_1_0384.jpg" n="8"/>they would try to attain there what they could not attain in the old country. And this same thought was with me under the influence of my many friends in Chicago. I would, however, not continue to hesitate what to do. If I wanted to settle here and do for my part whatever was possible to qualify myself to teach Dutch history and the Dutch language, then it would be absolutely necessary to bring a large part of my library, which I had gathered in the last twenty years to America, and that required time. I decided to take a chance with America and Americans, acquired my first naturalization papers, returned to Holland, and brought over a large part of my library, which only a few weeks ago arrived in thirty-four boxes at my residence, 5429 Drexel Avenue, Chicago, and to me it is true enjoyment to see again all those acquaintances of the last four centuries around me, and to be able to spend a large part of my days and evenings with them.</p>
