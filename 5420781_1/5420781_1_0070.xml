   <p>Tuesday, November 17, the committee appointed by the Chicago Section of the General Netherland's League handed over the petition for a chair in Dutch language, history, and literature to the directors of the University of Chicago. As was mentioned before, the directors were already in possession of the petition, but without the signatures. Those signatures were handed over by the president of the committee, Mr. A. Vosterheerdt, with an appropriate speech, to the board of directors of the university.</p>
   <p>Because of a series of unfortunate circumstances, many members of the committee could not be present. Mr. Jacobsma was absent because of illness, Mr. Vennema was in Washington, Professor Nollen had to give a lecture, and Consul Birkhoff likewise could not come.</p>
   <p>The directors, however, were very much pleased with the petition, and assured the committee that financial difficulties were the only obstacle hindering the establishment of the requested chair.</p>
