   <p>Recently I read something that is possibly of great importance for the Hollanders in the United States, at least for some of them. Many of our Hollanders are truck farmers. Some of them have prospered to such an extent that they now possess large greenhouses and hot-beds, but most of them have still only a small existence. I am thinking of the celery farmers and truck farmers around our large cities in the midwest. This, that I read, could open to them prosperity in a big way. Certainly we must be thankful for our daily bread, but it is also our duty to look for advancement. Here is what I read and recommend:</p>
   <p>As we know, the State of California has made laws by which the Japanese cannot own land in California and cannot even till the land with a share in its yield. The highest court in the United States, by a recent ruling, has upheld these laws, with the consequence that about 30,000 Japanese are preparing to leave about 500,000 acres of California land. The Japanese must sell under pressure of the state. The land consists for a large part of small, prosperous truck farms of between twenty and forty acres. These farms produced seventy-three million dollars per year.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0352.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The issue was fought for twenty-six years and now, through the decision of the Supreme Court, the fight is ended with the victory over the Japanese for the State of California. Some in California wonder whether the victory of the State is not too large and ask with fear, what is to become of these farms if the Japanese leave them in such large numbers? And how will the State carry the loss of Seventy-three millions?</p>
   <p>The Japanese are going to other states where such laws do not exist, to the East and to western states, such as Oregon, Washington etc. The newspapers in California say that there are no whites in California to take the place of the yellow race, and that thousands must be imported from elsewhere. And now I come to the question:</p>
   <p>Should this not be for the Hollanders? They are thrifty and many of them are truck farmers. Here is a chance that does not need verification, because the land can be bought reasonably from the departing Japanese. The Christian Reformed Church has a member of her Committee of Investigation resident in that state.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0353.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He is Rev. P. Hockenga. Write to him for insormation. This address you can get by writing to the office of the Wachter and the Banner, at Grand Rapids, Michigan. And make haste because without doubt large land companies will buy the land and then you will pay them double or triple the price.</p>
