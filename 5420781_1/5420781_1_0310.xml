   <p>Our new Primary - Law viewed from the side of the politicians is a complete success; from the side of the voters a failure, notwithstanding the fact that most of our large American dailies praise its good qualities and advertise its good points far and near. It is a failure from the side of the voters, in the first place, because they are compelled to state at the polling place to which party you belong. The independent voter, who only takes the ability and fitness of the candidate into consideration, without asking which party he belongs to is eliminated. This should be changed my writing the names of all the candidates on one ballot. In the second place we call it a failure, because in most cases it does not bind the Convention to stick by a candidate, for whom the voters cast the majority of their votes. How crippled the law is in this respect is proven by the fact, that the politicians of both parties had to make up the lists of the candidates, who were to be supported at the convention, at their caucuses, after the primaries. It is still the same meddling as ever; not the voters, but a few political bosses, decide who shall have the nomination for this or that position. And that is the reason we said, that from the side of the politicians it is a success, but from the side of the voters a failure. It is hoped that this will be discovered and as quickly as possible the necessary changes and improvements be made.</p>
