   <p>The example set by Mr. Eagan, Atlanta, Georgia, is being widely discussed by the press as is evident by the following in the Literary Digest of February 25. Christian methods, adopted to business is the motto of the American Cast Iron Pipe Company, of which John Eagan, one of Atlanta's wealthiest men, is president, being at the same time a leader in public reform. "The Directors," said Mr. Eagan, "are all church members and have chosen another confessed Christian as president, on the principle that that which is taught by Christ is to be the leading principle in our business." Mr. Eagan's platform is short. He wants the most common laborer to receive a living wage; that there shall be steady work for every member of the Organization and a working adoption of the Golden Bule in all relations between employer and employee.</p>
   <p>The company already has practised part of this theory. Right years ago a large industrial Y. M. C. A. building was erected by the company, as a medium for service to their employees, plans have been expanded to such an extent that now there are doctors, a surgeon, a dentist, and a nurse.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0271.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Also a "mutual aid" to give aid in case of sickness, or death, which is administered by employer and employees together, and now a pension fund has been established for the aged and for those unable to work. "Those who have lost their faith in the teachings of Christ may look down upon such a program, but it will not be damaged by that," says the Providence Bulletin. Many who continue according to old methods may keep it up for sometime longer, but the optomist is certain that the Eagan method will be the most successful in time. "Corporations have no soul, but even if this company has no soul, it shows that it possesses a heart," says the Pittsburgh Post. And the Christian Science Monitor adds this: that this method shall afterwards be recognized as the only, best and most profitable. The Golden Rule shall be known as a safe guide in all dealings with our people. To obtain a lasting peace between capital and labor, the question of hours and wages, must be solved in a Christian manner by both sides. Mistrust and money madness must make way for right, regardless of the consequences.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0272.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Still more, examples such as this Company and that of the A. Nash Company of Cincinnati, clothes manufacturers, who by the adoption of the Golden Rule have had marked success, may make the entire trade world to follow the same example. And the result will be: Peace between capital and labor.</p>
