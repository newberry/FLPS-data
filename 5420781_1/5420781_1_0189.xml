   <p>The meeting of the society of the above-mentioned school, which was held last week, revealed that the school is in good financial condition. The report of the treasurer showed that during the year 1906 the school received contributions, gifts, tuitions, etc., to the sum of $2,908.98, and that the total expenditures were $2,935.30; there was thus a small deficit of $26.32.</p>
   <p>The society has 200 members, while the number of children attending school is 250. The school has five teachers, namely, Messrs. L. Van Dellen, H. Jacobsma, and H. Kueper, and the ladies J. Van Wezep and K. Venema. One of the founders of the school is still a member of the board, namely, Mr. A. Muldes, the treasurer.</p>
   <p>We wish to call your attention to the coming general meeting of the society, to be held February 13. This is a meeting for and of the members, and no one ought to think, "They can get along without me." In case you are of this frame of <pb facs="5420781_1_0190.jpg" n="2"/>mind, we assure you that your presence is as necessary as that of anyone else. The administration which is to be elected must represent you. If an undesirable person gets a seat on the board, then you, by your absence, have been responsible for such a person's having been elected.</p>
   <p>There will also be a discussion of the proposed 25 per cent increase in death benefit payments. This is a weighty problem.</p>
