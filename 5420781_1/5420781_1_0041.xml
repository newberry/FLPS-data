   <p>P.1. - Just how good the instruction in our public schools (not only the grade schools, but also the "high schools") is, was again revealed this week when the freshmen of the Northwestern University, were subjected to a spelling examination. Everyone so it seems, had his or her own method of spelling.</p>
   <p>The following are some of the words and the way they were spelled by some of them: Accessible - Excessable. Irregular - Earegular. Counterfeit - Counterfit - Counterpheet. Apprentice - Apprentage, Aprentis. Magazine - Magazeen, Magazene. Plumage - Plumnage, Plumeage, Plumaeg. Anthracite - Anthreesite, Anthrisight. Intelligence - Entelegance, Intelegence. And these examples are by no means exceptions. Similar tests in former years have proved, that at least fifty per-cent of all the students at North-western are poor spellers. And because the students hail from different States and in some cases have studied at some well known institutions of learning, we must take it for granted that the general method of teaching is faulty, for if it were good, it would bring better results.</p>
