   <p>The spacious corridors and rooms of the Chicago Christian High School resembled ant hills, Tuesday, September 6th. All was activity. No sluggards were in evidence. For two months the doors of the school had been closed. Now, vacation was over and the boys and girls again found entrance. Tuesday morning the new students appeared. Naturally they were awed by their new surroundings. However, they regained some of their composure when they realized that being registered was not an unduly painful procedure after all. The older students came in the afternoon. It was interesting to watch them greet one another. It was amusing to see the seniors strut around as if they were in undisputed possession of the place. Registrar Lietzema has made a careful analysis of the registration and the reports that some sixty new students have entered the C. C. H. S were made by him. The total enrollment is 199 pupils. This, if my mathenatics are not faulty, is only one less than the two hundred mark, and perhaps the two hundredth student is even now "signing up." Mr. Lietzema finds that of the 199 there are 107 boys and 92 girls. There are 141 enrolled in the general and 58 in the commercial courses.</p>

   <p>The far West is represented by 21 students, the near West by 32, Englewood by 62, Roseland by 63, So. Holland by 8, Indiana by 2, Evergreen Park by 5, and other suburbs by 6 students. Dr. Wezeman has already won the confidence of the teachers and students. Things are running smoothly under his guidance. The new teachers too, are already "but and ben" with the high school.</p>
   <p>Thursday morning, Mr. Huisjen of the Chicago Jewish Mission was with us and led us in devotionals. Friday, the Rev. Althuis gave us an inspiring address on "The Masterpiece of Life." Both these visitors were heartily received, and it is hoped that their example will be followed by others.</p>
