   <p>In spite of the rain, there was a large attendance to witness the laying of the cornerstone of the new Christian High School, at the corner 71st and May Streets. Mr. George Ottenhoff, President of the society, led the meeting.</p>
   <p>After the Reverend J. J. Hiemenga had opened with a prayer, the chair was given to Mr. N. Knoll, who made a speech on "The Value of Christian Education". After that, Mr. Fahkema spoke and gave a short history of the school. Then Mr. A. Blystra read a few articles, which were placed in a copper box and laid in the cornerstone.</p>
   <p>While the coppersmith was busy sealing the box, the Reverend H. Blystra of Prinsburg, Minnesota, Mr. H. Kuiper of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Reverend J. J. Hiemenga of La Fayette, Indiana, also spoke. After that the actual laying of the cornerstone took place. This was done by the president, Mr. George Ottenhoff.</p>

   <p>Mr. Douma of Roseland closed the meeting with a prayer. A request was made that it be announced that the original idea for a Christian High School was from Mr. James de Boes, who was strongly supported by Mr. George Ottenhoff and Mr. H. Kuiper.</p>
