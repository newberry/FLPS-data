   <p>Through peculiar circumstances two Chicago women, one a mother and the other the wife of a sick man, nearly sacrificed their lives to save that of their loved ones. In both cases blood transfusions were given to their sick relatives. This is a new discovery in the medical profession; but in both cases the sacrifice was in vain.</p>
   <p>One of the women, Mrs. George Higbee of Burlington, Iowa, gave a pint of blood to her son, Jas. A. Higbee. However, the young man died a couple of hours after the transfusion. The mother became so weak through the loss of blood, that it was necessary for her to stay under medical treatment and was not able to attend the funeral of her son at Burlington.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0360.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The other was Mrs. Carl D. Stone, 2200 Prairie Avenue, whose husband was suffering from a nervous fever. To give the man new strength and to drive away the sick germs, the healthy blood of the woman was brought over through a silver tube into the veins of Dr. Stone. But the man died, and the sacrifice was useless.</p>
   <p>It seems to us that this new method of medical treatment is good only in cases where the patient will recover regardless of whether new blood is injected or not.</p>
