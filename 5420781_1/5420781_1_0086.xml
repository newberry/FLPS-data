   <p>Wednesday, November 9, 1927, may justly be called an exceptional day in the history of the "Timothy School Society". On that day the new school - building at 59th Avenue and 14th Street, Cicero, Ill., was dedicated with fitting ceremonies. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon a program was given for the Third Christian Reformed congregation. The Rev. J. J. Weersing functioned as the main speaker and others, who were gifted, contributed with their talents by singing and playing instruments. After the finish of this program, those present went to the new schoolbuilding, where a tasty meal, prepared by the "Eunice Circle." awaited them. Approximately 300 people, who were interested, participated in it. After the meal they went to the second story, where the assembly hall is situated. It has a seating capacity of 500, but was inadequate to accomodate all who came so that about 300 had to be satisfied with standing room outside the hall and in the balcony over the entrance. A song service was first held in the balcony after which the program was commenced. The main speaker of the evening was the Rev. P. A. Hoekstra. Following this was the report of the chairman of the building committee, T. S. Youngsma. Further, other speakers took part in the program and the rest was illustrated by music and song.</p>
   <p>Collections taken up during the meetings amounted to $1,700. With special thanks <pb facs="5420781_1_0087.jpg" n="2"/>a gift of $500 was received. After the evening meeting, the opportunity was given to those who were present, to inspect the new school, one of the most beautiful Christian School - buildings in the United States.</p>
