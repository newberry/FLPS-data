   <p>Monday, June 13th at 8 o'clock in the evening, a meeting took place in the vestry of the Reformed Church at 62nd Street. Mr. P. Court van Woerden presided at the meeting. The purpose was to erect a Christian Anti-Saloon Society. Dr. S. C. Nettinga opened the meeting with prayer, after which Mr. P. Court van Woerden spoke thus:</p>
   <p>"Dear friends, we are glad that you listened to the invitation, to discuss together this evening the formation of a Christian Anti-Saloon Society. Speakers demonstrate what mischief the saloons are causing, that they are abetting prostitution, and are giving an opportunity for immortality.</p>
   <p>Heretofore, before the election of Aldermen, orators and speakers discussed the anti-saloon principle, but today nobody is discussing this matter any longer. It is therefore necessary that we as Hollanders clarify our position through the formation of a Society, a Christian <pb facs="5420781_1_0231.jpg" n="2"/>Society, because we can expect help only from Him, who has everything in His hand, and we as human beings are obliged to do that what God has revealed to us.</p>
   <p>How many family fathers have strayed from home! How many families have! been destroyed! How many young folks are finding their ruin in the saloon!"</p>
   <p>The assembly then asked the speaker different questions, which were all answered by him.</p>
   <p>Reverend Brinkman was invited by Reverend S. C. Nettinga to say a few words. Reverend Brinkman indicated what we have to do as Christians, what our duty is, and how we have to effect our Christian duty socially.</p>
   <p>All people present gave their vote for the formation of a Christian <pb facs="5420781_1_0232.jpg" n="3"/>Anti-Saloon League, and thus the League was started. Upon proposal by Dr. Nettinga the following were appointed as officers: Mr. J. H. Kregel, President, and Mr. D. Baan Secretary. Both accepted for the time being their election.</p>
   <p>As a society, we are now inviting everyone, who upholds a Christian principle, to cooperate with us, and to join us as members.</p>
   <p>May God bless our efforts in honor of His name, and for the prosperity of family, and society. A meeting will be held Thursday evening, June 23rd, at 8 o'clock in the vestry of the Reformed Church at 62nd Street.</p>
   <p>Englewood, Illinois, June 16, 1910.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Society,</p>
   <p>J. H. Kregel, President,</p>
   <p>D. Baan, Secretary,</p>
   <p>6120 May Street.</p>
