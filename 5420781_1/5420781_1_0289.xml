   <p>Dear Friends:</p>
   <p>May we call your attention for a moment to the candidacy of Mr. Herman Teninga for the Republican nomination for Alderman of the Thirty-third Ward in Chicago?</p>
   <p>We should like to tell you briefly what he has done to keep the good name of our Dutch people in high esteem. He was chairman of the committee that obtained beautiful Palmer Park for us here. For two years he was president of the South End Businessmen's Association. As chairman of the executive committee of the sixty-year jubilee, held the 5th of July, 1909, he was an untiring worker. The Mayor of Chicago appointed him a member of the Chicago Plan Committee, which has worked hard to publicize and beautify Chicago. Mr. Teninga has done much for the inhabitants of our ward especially, and for the city in general.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_1_0290.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Is this not sufficient to convince you that his experience is such as to insure his being one of the leaders in the City Council of Chicago? Since we, as Dutchmen and also as citizens of this ward, are aiming at improvement, we must get the most powerful man possible for the office of Alderman. We are sure that you will agree with us that, from the point of view of experience, Mr. Teninga is the right man.</p>
   <p>This election depends greatly on you. We therefore urge you to vote Friday, March 4, for Mr. Herman Teninga.</p>
   <p>Your friends,</p>
   <p>Dirk J. De Jong</p>
