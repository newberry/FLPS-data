   <p>The Biruta Music and Dramatic Society successfully presented "Pabaigtuves" (After the Harvest), a two-act comedy, on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, at St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue.</p>
   <p>The synopsis of the Play is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Tekle," daughter of a large land owner in Lithuania, becomes engaged through correspondence to "Feliksas," a young student of philosophy, whom she never met. After the harvest on his parent's farm, "Feliksas" journeys to meet "Tekle." In the meantime, the latter decides to have some fun and test his love when he arrives. She trades places on the farm with "Klara," a poor peasant girl. When "Feliksas" arrives, he is led to believe that "Klara" is his fiancee. He dislikes "Klara," but is attracted by the charms and beauty <pb facs="5423970_2_0555.jpg" n="2"/>of "Tekle," and makes love to her. Later, his parents arrive on the farm and berate him for falling in love with a peasant girl. He makes a strong effort to convince his parents that peasants are in no way inferior to people of the upper classes, and succeeds in obtaining their consent to marry "Tekle." The plot is then exposed, and the wedding takes place as scheduled.</p>
   <p>This comedy was written by Mikas Petrauskas, according to a similar Play in the Polish language by Korzeniowski.</p>
   <p>The cast of players are as follows: "Tekle"--Miss M. Odeikis; "Sambelis"--V. Brusokas; "Feliksas"--P. Butkus; "Klara"--Miss A. Kalvaitis; the "organist"--V. Pukas; the "Jew"--V. Bikelis; "Katriute"--Miss M. Montvila; "Jonas"--J. Miezinis; "old peasant"--J. Juska.</p>
   <p>Besides the comedy, the audience was entertained with the following Lithuanian National dances: 'Klumpakojis' (wooden shoe dance); 'Suktinis' (a twirl dance); 'Noriu Miego' (I want to sleep); and 'Blezdingele' (Swallow dance). This is <pb facs="5423970_2_0556.jpg" n="3"/>the first time the latter two dances were executed on a stage in Chicago, The audience was mostly pleased with the 'Noriu Miego' dance; an encore was requested.</p>
   <p>All participants in the program were trained and directed by Mikas Petrauskas.</p>
   <p>The newly organized Biruta orchestra, composed of twenty members, participated in the program for the first time, and made a very effective impression. It is probably the first high grade Lithuanian orchestra in America.</p>
   <p>Besides the songs in the Play, the Biruta chorus sang the following Lithuanian songs: "Piauti Linksma, Piauti Gera" (It is Pleasant to Mow, it is Good to Mow); and "Oi Tu Jieva" (Oh You Eve).</p>
