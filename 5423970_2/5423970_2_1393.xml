   <p>Chicago, January 18, 1893</p>
   <p>I, J. W. Zacharewich, instructor of dancing, am revealing to all the Lithuanian youth of Chicago that for the last two Saturdays there were many young men and girls who learned how to move their limbs and to dance "Polka" properly. Last Saturday we began to study how to dance that most popular dance "The Berlin." On this coming Saturday will be the last lesson of this dance. Then we will begin to study the "Waltz."</p>
   <p>I am very glad that we Lithuanians are beginning to teach our youth such a good habit as dancing. Through dance not only one learns how to move his feet, but learns how to be polite.</p>
   <p>When you learn how to dance well you can go to the dancing halls, or arrange dances at home. This will keep our youth from the saloons.</p>
   <p>In the next issue of this newspaper we will publish a lecture which was delivered by a very educated doctor, who says that dancing is very important.</p>
   <p>The third dancing lesson will be given Saturday, January 14 at 8 P. M. at Zeslawski Hall, corner of 32nd and Laurel street.</p>
   <p>J. W. Zacharewich</p>
