   <p>The Sharpalis brothers, Jakutis, Stogis, Stannkevicius, and Paculat, sponsored two concerts. The first concert was held on the evening of May 12, at Davis Park, Town of Lake, and the second concert was held May 15, at Mark White Square Hall, 30th St. and Halsted St. The program was the same at both concerts. Musical and vocal quartettes were outstanding features on the program at both concerts. The musical quartette consisted of the following musicians: O. Paculat played the flute; P. V. Sharpalis played the viola; J. Sharpalis played the violin; and V. Sharpalis played the Piano. The vocal quartette consisted of the following singers: F. Jakutis, tenor; J. Stankevicius, second tenor; P. V. Sharpalis, bass; and P. Stogis, second bass. The musical and the vocal programs were very excellent and the public was pleased with the performance.</p>
