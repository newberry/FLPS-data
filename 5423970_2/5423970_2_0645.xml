   <p>Lithuanians will participate in the program which is being planned to take place in the large hall on Municipal Pier, this Friday, August 23. The Birute Society has been invited to give a few Lithuanian folk dances and our youths are already prepared to fulfill their part of the program.</p>
   <p>Miss S. Staniulis, who is in charge of the Lithuanian program, has announced that the Lithuanian dancers have ordered special Lithuanian national costumes for the occasion. Miss Rakauskas will sing several Lithuanian songs. Several other nationalities will also participate. The program will begin at eight in the evening.</p>
   <p>Admission to the programs on Municipal Pier is free, for they are sponsored by the city. They give people an opportunity not only to be entertained, but also to rest in the fresh air, after a hard day's work. The hall is almost a mile from shore and is surrounded on three sides by Lake Michigan.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0646.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is desired that many Lithuanians will attend to see how the other nationalities and the Lithuanians perform. To get to the Municipal Pier, take any car to Grand Avenue and continue on Grand Avenue right to the Pier.</p>
