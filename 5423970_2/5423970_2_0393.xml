   <p>p. 3.... Last Sunday evening, Jan.3rd, the 18th Street Lithuanian Dramatic Circle successfully presented "A Ruined Life," a three act drama dealing with temperance to a large audience at the C.S.P. hall.</p>
   <p>The play revolved around the main character, farmer Zluobis, showing how he acquired the drinking habit and how that ultimately ruined his life.</p>
   <p>The role of farmer Zluobis was played by P. Buragas, who did his part unually well. The other important roles were played by John Motuzas, Miss Kalvaites, and Miss Karpavicius.</p>
   <p>We would like to suggest that our playwrights and artists devote more time to more realistic portrayal of love scenes. There is wide variety of views and attitudes towards that subject among the audience. In order to produce an agreeable effect the subject must be handled with great care.</p>
