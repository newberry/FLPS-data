   <p>The executive board of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association held its meeting January 25, at Elias Hall, in Town of Lake. The project to publish an official organ of this organization was approved. This publication will be incorporated with a capital of $5,000. The money will be raised by the members of the board and the members of this organization, by selling shares of this corporation. The publication will contain eight pages, will be published weekly, and when the circulation has increased, will be published twice a week, and later--daily. If business improves, the capital of the newspaper will be increased.</p>
   <p>Minor details about the incorporation of this newspaper will be given at the next meeting of the executive board, February 21, at eight o'clock, Elias Hall, 4600 South Wood Street.</p>

   <p>The enlightenment committee of this organization aims to establish evening schools in every Lithuanian community, to teach reading and writing, English, arithmetic, and scientific subjects.</p>
   <p>The establishment of the [orphan] asylum has been given over to the organization's branch, which was created for that purpose.</p>
   <p>Those societies that see the necessity of belonging to this organization, to work for the benefit of Chicago Lithuanians, send your delegates to the coming meeting.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanavicius, general</p>
   <p>secretary.</p>
