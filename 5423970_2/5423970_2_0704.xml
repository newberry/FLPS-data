<title level="a">ELEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE S. DAUKANTAS SOCIETY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Sunday, Oct. 9, 1904, the Simonas Daukantas Society held its 11th anniversary. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the societies Enlightenment of Brothers, Liberty, Truth Seekers, Truth Lovers, Sons of Lithuania, and the Simonas Daukantas accompanied by music marched to the Freiheit Turner Hall, 3417 S. Halsted St.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alex Bijanskas, president of the society, called the meeting to order, then the program started.</p>
   <p>First the choir of Dr. V. Kudirka's Society sang a song, "The Maiden," from the poem of S. Maironis. Mr. Olszewskis spoke. His theme was, "Why our coming to this country." He asked what controls the world today. The money, that all are working for. All the inventions are made for the sake of money. For the sake of money wars are waged bringing about horrible human slaughter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0705.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Not only money rules the world but rules heaven, too. When you have no money you cannot get absolution. At the end of his long speech he said that only drunkenness can control the money.</p>
   <p>Miss Antanina Zimontas read the poem, "Lithuania, Awaken." Mr. V. Vabalas spoke on our educational needs. Only through education and unity will we obtain a better future. He urged parents to give their children as much education as possible.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Rudauskas spoke about the importance of such a celebration and the aims of the Simonas Daukantas to try having its celebrations yearly, often even with financial losses. The society has its own library of 400 books.</p>
   <p>A little girl, Antigona Aukstakalniute, 9 years of age, and a boy, Ernestas Vosyliukas recited the declamation, "Hello Brother Singers."</p>
   <p>The audience applauded the two youthful speakers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0706.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The four sisters Yovaisiute, Miss K. Kaminskiute and Miss V. Matuseviciute sang the song, "Where the Rippling Nemunas is Flowing," and "Adieu, Lithuania." Miss Mary Kasleriute recited the poem from the soldiers' appeal.</p>
   <p>Again the Dr. V. Kudirka Singers' Society sang "Onyte," and "Thou, Lithuania," accompanied on the piano by Miss Aukstakalniute.</p>
   <p>Miss Anna Zimonciute recited a declamation, "The Remembering of the Olden Times."</p>
   <p>Many people did not come to this important celebration because the priest threatened the people with hell if they should come to this festival.</p>
   <p>The Society of the Grand Duke Vytankas of Lithuania promised to participate in this celebration, but did not come. The society was <pb facs="5423970_2_0707.jpg" n="4"/>scared by the threats of the priest.</p>
   <p>Even though the priest had warned the people not to come, the hall was filled with people. The society will make a fair profit.</p>
   <p>The celebration's secretary,</p>
   <p>M. J. Damijonaitis.</p>
