<title level="a">LITHUANIAN TAILORS FORM MUTUAL BENEFIT CLUB</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>There are probably more Lithuanian tailors living in Chicago than in any other American city. However, they have been so quiet that nothing has been written about them in our newspapers. Now they have become active.</p>
   <p>On January 8, the Lithuanian tailors of Chicago organized a mutual aid club, which is to be known as the Mutual Benefit Club of Lithuanian Tailors. Only Lithuanians engaged in the tailoring trade are eligible for membership. The initiation fee will be one dollar; dues will be twenty-five cents per month. Sick members shall receive six dollars per week. All members will be entitled to sick benefits even if they move out of Chicago to other cities or towns in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1743.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Apart from the sick benefits, the club will endeavor to promote the intellectual and cultural development of the members as much as possible; it is planned to establish a Lithuanian-American library and to sponsor educational lectures. In other words, the purpose of the club will be to unite and assist all members in every possible manner.</p>
   <p>The new club cordially invites all Lithuanian tailors living in Chicago to join the club. A special meeting, during which new members will be accepted, will be held on Sunday afternoon, February 28, at the Balkevis Hall, 823 No. Marshfield Avenue. At this meeting the initiation fee for all new members will only be one dollar; later the initiation fee will be increased in accordance with the age of the applicant.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1744.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The regular monthly meetings of the club will be held on the first Wednesday evening of every month. Address all communications in regard to the club to the secretary, J. Mickevicius, 18 Ellen Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
