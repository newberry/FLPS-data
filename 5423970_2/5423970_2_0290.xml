   <p>On September 21, the Birute Choir celebrated its fifth year of existence. In reality this celebration should have been held last spring, but for certain reasons, it was postponed to this autumn. Last Sunday was the cultural holiday of this society. While reviewing the Birute Society's cultural activity in the past, we cannot pass without mentioning this celebration. The Birute's cultural activity in the past and present, deserves the gratitude of the people. The large audience, close to eight hundred people, proved by its attendance that it did not forget to appreciate the benevolent cultural work of the Birute Choir, and those who are working for the benefit of the choir.</p>
   <p>The program of this holiday consisted of two short speeches, and a two-act melodrama "Birute," written by Zemkalnis. The music of the melodrama was composed by Mikas Petrauskas. The first speaker was Mr. J. Ilgaudas, president of the Birute Choir. In his short talk he reviewed the history of the Birute Choir, why it came into existence, and the sufferings which it had borne until this young choir was placed on a sound foundation. The second <pb facs="5423970_2_0291.jpg" n="2"/>speaker was Mr. Pranas Butkus, president of the Birute Society's dramatic section. He spoke on the aims of this society and its significance to the Lithuanian people. In his enthusiastic speech, he told the audience what benefits they are deriving from the Birute's cultural activity. He especially stressed what a great benefit the Birute is to Lithuanian youth. He urged the parents to pay more attention to this society, and to come to a closer understanding and relation with it. The program was concluded with the performance of the melodrama "Birute".</p>
   <p>There is no need of repeating the story of the melodrama, as every Lithuanian has read the play, or knows its historical background. But it should be mentioned that the performance was good. I have seen this play several times before, and I must admit that this performance was a big surprise to me. The cast of Birute was good, but in places, it lacked expression. Miss Horodockaite, for her personification of "Birute," received a beautiful bouquet.</p>
   <p>The "Vaideliutes" made a grand impression with their singing. The Birute <pb facs="5423970_2_0292.jpg" n="3"/>Choir certainly has something to be proud of, with their beautiful voices. Particularly the beautiful voices of the "Vaideliutes" soloists (Misses Rudauskaites). One has a beautiful soprano; the other has a pleasing alto. Although the ancient Lithuanian gods have been buried a long time, if they had heard their descendants sing so gloriously about them, no doubt they would have rejoiced, especially over the singing of the soloists.</p>
   <p>Many objections can be raised against Mr. Banaitis, as "Zudenschtein," the leading role of the drama, because of his acting and singing. He did not appear the illustrious leader of crusaders, because his voice was weak and it does not fit such an important role. But in celebrating such an anniversary, one should not speak about its weak points, so we will keep quiet about them.</p>
   <p>The old "Vaidila" (Z. Stogis) had a strong and good voice, but his voice needs more training,and then in time, we should have a good singer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0293.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Because of lack of space, I cannot give a more detailed review of this spectacle, but in conclusion I should like to mention that the music of this melodrama was directed by Mr. A. Pocius. For all his devotion in preparing and arranging for the presentation of the melodrama, "Birute," the Birute Choir should be thankful. There is no doubt that the Birute Choir will not separate from such a hard worker and instructor. I hope that the Birute will exist for many years, and will continue its cultural work in the future.</p>
