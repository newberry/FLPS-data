   <p>Branch No. 58 of the Association of Lithuanian Working Women of America held a meeting in the Brighton Park Lithuanian colony, of Chicago, Jan. 27. The meeting was well attended.</p>
   <p>It was decided to send a congratulatory letter to the managers of the Vilnis, semi-weekly Lithuanian working class newspaper, for their untiring efforts to convert the Vilnis into a daily newspaper.</p>
   <p>A donation of $5 was ordered sent with the letter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0824.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All those who attended the meeting displayed great interest in the drive for a daily Vilnis. Full support of the drive was pledged by all members. It was also decided to give a masquerade ball in the near future and donate half of the proceeds to the Vilnis.</p>
   <p>A donation of $10 was voted for the relief of striking miners and their families in the coal fields of Pennsylvania. The strike is now in its fifth month. The coal miners union, the United Mine Workers of America, is having great difficulty in furnishing all the necessary assistance to the strikers. The winter season is adding greatly to their misery. They are in <pb facs="5423970_2_0825.jpg" n="3"/>dire need of our assistance.</p>
   <p>This organization is famous for its many donations for the benefit of the working class movement. Decisions to donate to some worthy cause are made at nearly all meetings.</p>
