   <p>The Chicago district of the Lithuanian-American Workers Literary Society gave a very interesting musical entertainment, Feb. 21, at the Chicago Lithuanian Auditorium. Besides Lithuanians, artists of other nationalities paricipated in the program. A capacity crowd attended.</p>
   <p>A number of solos and duets were sung by the following Lithuanian artists: Miss Meldazis, Miss Elena Peciukas, Paul Dauderis, and Ona Pocius. Many were asked to repeat their numbers, especially Ona Pocius, who pleased the audience immensely with her highly developed 
<pb facs="5423970_2_0673.jpg" n="2"/>voice. She returned from Lithuania only two weeks ago. In Lithuania she was a popular member of the Lithuanian State Opera. She proved at the concert that her popularity is well deserved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rodella, famous Italian tenor, also made a fine impression.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Freiheit Chorus, which is a real novelty in Lithuanian programs, electrified the audience with its fine performance. The chorus delivered many encores before the audience finally consented to allow it to leave the stage.</p>

   <p>During an intermission period, Comrade J. Gasiunas delivered a short talk on the aims of the Lithuanian-American Workers Literary Society. He invited those present to join the society.</p>
