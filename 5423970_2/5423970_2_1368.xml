   <p>The Women's Enlightenment Society, since its inception, has striven to do something useful. It is doing the same this year. Last winter it conducted a domestic arts evening school of fine sewing and knitting. It taught writing, etc. The teacher was Miss Teodora Andruseviciute, an artist who is well-known to many. I do not think that those Lithuanian girls and women who wanted to take advantage of this, regret the time they have spent. This year a desired cooking school has been established through much effort. Today every woman, eighteen years old or more, can attend and train herself in the cooking of tasty and healthful foods, economics, and the general management of a home. The Aurora Society pays all the costs.... The school is located at 831 33rd Place, Chicago, Ill. Classes are held every Wednesday at 7:30 P. M.</p>
