   <p>This is the first Lithuanian workers' newspaper published in Chicago. We don't doubt that there will be thousands of people who will approve of this paper with a great enthusiasm, especially those people who live in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Heretofore we have not had a progressive newspaper that would guide the progressive element, be interested in the affairs of workers and represent the working class of people in Chicago and its vicinity. We have three old progressive newspapers in Chicago, written in the English language, which represent the progressive workers' movement in our city and the state.</p>
   <p>The labor movement in Chicago at present is much more pronounced <pb facs="5423970_2_1009.jpg" n="2"/>than in other American Lithuanian colonies in the United States. The clericals and the nationalists have stopped playing a leading role in Chicago. They have been organized for a long time, and in addition they had three local newspapers. They had also a strong public sentiment in their favor. Nevertheless, they failed to hold popular sentiment, and failed to support the predominating local current of movement in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is true that the clericals and nationalists have ceased to reign in Chicago. A great many people have freed themselves from these two parties and have already picked different roads in life. These people who left the parties have joined the new progressive party that represents working class movement in Chicago, and the vicinity. The progressive party is much stronger now than ever before. It has a much greater influence over the public today, and can easily be compared in its strength and the number of members with the combined forces of the other two dilapidated parties, whose power is slowly waning.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1010.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Those people who separated from the two parties (clericals and nationalists) formed one large new group of progressives who are opposed to the principles of the old party. They are proceeding to work out the progressive principles for their new party. From this new group of people, the Naujienos (The News) came into existence. It is known today as the Lithuanian workers' progressive newspaper.</p>
   <p>Naujienos is a Socialist newspaper whose policy is to serve the people, who see their salvation not today but in the future. This paper has determined to serve the public best in the future, as a new organ of the progressive party in Chicago. Naujienos is convinced that the present-day social order of society will affect the different changes of the social order in the future. The present social order will be changed by those who know their needs. The organized working class people know that the change in the present-day social order is the only salvation for them in the future. The change of the social order <pb facs="5423970_2_1011.jpg" n="4"/>would bring many benefits, not only to this organization but to all the working people in the United States. You cannot accomplish anything worthwhile if you are not organized to fight for better conditions in life. The working class of people will have a better hope in the future when they have unity, understanding and a strong organization to fight for their rights and for better working conditions. Labor is carrying a heavy burden upon its shoulders under the present social order. The laborer works under the worst condition and receives starvation wages for his work. At the same time he pays all the taxes to the government, while the politician who does no work receives a big pay. The politician pays very few taxes to the government and sometimes none at all.</p>
   <p>Naujienos has determined to bend all its efforts to support the labor movement of today. It will help the workers to fight for justice and their rights. It will fight against those elements which <pb facs="5423970_2_1012.jpg" n="5"/>are trying to darken the future, destroy the unity, and weaken the energy of the working man. The large group of Chicago Lithuanians who don't want to go along with the short-sighted element of the past, promised to support the principles of Naujienos. The Lithuanian workers who have not yet joined the Socialist ranks should join as soon as possible and help build this organization which is helping the workers to make their future brighter. Those willing to join our ranks will find faithful friends and good advisors. They are the class of people who have the same aims in life as those who have already joined our ranks and stand under the Socialist flag. Socialist workers are separated into two different groups: the first group is the group which understands the principles of Socialism, and the second is the one that does not understand the principles of Socialism or that does not want to understand them. They are afraid to admit that they are Socialists or Socialist sympathizers. However, this group which does not understand now will understand the principles of socialism and its affairs in the years to come.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1013.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The world is changing rapidly and economic conditions will make every worker understand socialism and its aim for the future. The future will tell us the story.</p>
   <p>The Socialist and the non-Socialist workers' movements are based on the very same principle and the same aim in life. They are waging war against the same enemy: injustice and the exploitation of labor.</p>
   <p>They both want to have better working conditions and more time for cultural improvement after their hard work in the shops. This would make life more interesting. Life could be enjoyed as human beings could enjoy it. The working class people as yet don't think the same way and don't understand how to attain better working conditions and time for cultural activities.</p>
   <p>The Socialists have a very good plan for remedying this situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1014.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>They have a better way worked out that leads to a happier future and will aid the workers in reaching their goal much sooner. The people cannot ignore socialism. Sooner or later they will join our ranks when they begin to feel the great economic pressure and the exploitation by capitalists. Although some people are under the influence of those who oppose the principles of socialism; they stand with the Socialists whenever there is a war against the labor movement.</p>
   <p>Naujienos is defending the rights of all working people and at the same time is defending not only Socialist but also non-Socialist labor movements. The greatest support will be given to Lithuanian workers who understand the principles of socialism and who are making every effort to follow the teachings of socialism.</p>
   <p>Naujienos will serve not only Lithuanians in Chicago, but will serve <pb facs="5423970_2_1015.jpg" n="8"/>all Lithuanians in America. Naujienos will make every effort to solve labor problems and scrutinize thoroughly the relations between unions and political parties. This paper is deeply interested in Lithuanian workers in the United States, especially in Lithuanians living in Chicago. Chicago is the best place to discuss important labor problems, because this city is becoming one of the greatest political and economic centers of the United States.</p>
