   <p>The Drama Society presented "The Live Corpses", a three-act comedy at the Hull House Theatre last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The play is quite humorous and consequently, is not tiresome. The acting was also good. Several of the actors were really good in their parts. Among them, J. Prusinskas, in the role of an erratic doctor, and Mrs. K. Moskiene, a cook, must be included. It is too bad that the small role she had did not allow Mrs. Moskiene to remain on the stage very long. But even her brief appearances caught the audience's attention.</p>
   <p>However, Sankunas, in the role of a servant, was probably the best. His gestures emphasized his lines well. He can impersonate a drunkard and that helped him in enacting the role of an old, inebriated servant, who is an experienced "wolf."</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0484.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Damisonaitiene was not bad, though occasionally she lacked sincerity.</p>
   <p>Vaitiekunas is usually very successful with comic roles, and the role of an overseer of an estate was not very easy for him. But, thanks to his experience, he can play it better than anybody else.....</p>
   <p>Briedis, in the role of lawyer, should also be mentioned.....</p>
