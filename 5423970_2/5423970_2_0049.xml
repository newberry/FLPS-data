   <p>Last week in Chicago four private banks became bankdrupt. All American local newspapers published the news about it. Of all the Lithuanian papers only Naujienos published the news.</p>
   <p>Lietuva did not mention these banks because the editor of Lietuva is owner of one of them. Katalikas kept silent because its editor was a heavy stock holder in one of these banks. About Draugas and its connection with the banks we may get some information from Mr. J. J. Elias, the owner of the bank. Mr. J. J. Elias never refuses to give information. Two weeks ago he told the Daily News reporter: "I'm controlling two newspapers"; one of the two newspapers we know is Draugas. This is the reason why Draugas never mentioned the banks last week. The editor of Draugas has some connection with these banks. Lietuva, Draugas, and Katalikas, kept silent about these four private banks that went bankrupt, causing many people to lose their hard-earned money, which they saved <pb facs="5423970_2_0050.jpg" n="2"/>for many years for their old age. This deplorable banking situation must be remedied as soon as possible in order to prevent other banks from bankruptcy. It is necessary to pass strict banking laws in the state of Illinois. If the Government of the United States does not want to pay a pension to the people, at least the government can prevent the banks from closing, and save the old people from poverty and the poor-house. The Government of the United States should use every means to protect its people from poverty and misery in their old age. The government can do at least a little favor to its citizens and protect their life savings from corrupted bankers who are robbing them. Such conditions lower the morale of the people and destroy the spirit of patriotism of the nation. The people lose respect for the government if the government does not protect its own citizens from those who are exploiting them. Thousands of people lost their savings in these four private banks. The newspapers which I mentioned in the foregoing statement knew the condition of these banks, yet they failed in their duty by not informing the people that these banks were insolvent. These newspapers have no honor and do not know their civic duties. They know only how to spread scandalous <pb facs="5423970_2_0051.jpg" n="3"/>reports and lies, maintaining that Naujienos had a strike in its printing plant. When thousands of people lost their savings in the banks, these newspapers kept silent, and before that they kept everyone in ignorance about the condition of these banks. Now the editors of these newspapers are bluffing the people about Naujienos and spreading a false alarm. Their conduct is very childish. A man with a mature mind would not dare to write such things about the Naujienos. It is pitiful that some people grow up physically but not mentally, and therefore, we cannot expect much good from them.</p>
