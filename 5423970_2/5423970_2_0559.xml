  <body>
   <p>The Biruta Musical and Dramatic Society successfully staged two comedies on Sunday, November 7, at St. George's Parish Hall, 32nd Place and Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue. The following plays were presented: A one-act comedy entitled "Vienas is Musu Turi Apsivest" (One of Us Must Get Married); and a musical comedy or operetta entitled "Kaminakretis ir Malonininkas" (The Chimney Sweep and the Miller). The latter is a creation of Mikas Petrauskas. The music was furnished by a sixteen-piece orchestra, which was composed of members of the two best orchestras of Chicago--the Theodore Thomas Orchestra and the Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
   <p>The fame and popularity of Mikas Petrauskas is rapidly increasing, especially in Chicago. His musical creations are very effective, especially when they are played by good musicians. The audience behaved very nicely and, apparently, everyone was fully satisfied with the program.</p>
   <p>The subject matter of the plays is well-known to most Lithuanians and will not <pb facs="5423970_2_0560.jpg" n="2"/>be discussed here. Nearly all the players enacted their roles in an effective manner.</p>
   <p>The cast of players of "One of Us Must Get Married" is as follows: "Tetule", by Mrs. P. Moskus; professor of mathematics, by J. Uktveris; professor of philosophy, by M. Dudas; adopted daughter of "Tetule", by Miss M. Locaitis.</p>
   <p>The players of "The Chimney Sweep and the Miller" were: The Miller, by A. Zacharias; his daughter, by Miss M. Odeikis; the maid, by Mrs. M. Damijonaitis; his wife, by Mrs. L. Sutkus; the chimney-sweep, by J. Ilgaudas; his son, by J. Locaitis; his servant, by B. Balutis.</p>
   <p>All players were instructed under the personal direction of Mikas Petrauskas. The players were well selected for their roles.</p>
   <p>After the stage presentations the audience was entertained with Lithuanian national dances, such as the "Virve (Rope), "Klumpakojis" (Wooden Shoe), and <pb facs="5423970_2_0561.jpg" n="3"/>"Suktinis" (Twirl). The dancers performed unusually well because of the excellent music which was furnished by a good orchestra.</p>
   <p>The affair was a great success in every respect. A capacity crowd attended.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians of other colonies, even in Lithuania, can every the Lithuanians of Chicago, because such excellent affairs have been possible so far only in Chicago.</p>
