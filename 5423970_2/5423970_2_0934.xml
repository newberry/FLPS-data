   <p>The newspaper Lietuva has devoted much space in support of the war registration of June 5, 1915, and the first Liberty Loan drive.</p>
   <p>The following articles were published in support of the war registration: May 11, an editorial entitled "An Opportunity to Render a Good Service," urging Lithuanians to volunteer as[war census]enumerators; May 25, an editorial entitled "Registration or War Census", urging Lithuanian men not to fail to register; June 1, a long article--almost a full page--entitled "Register on June 5," explaining in detail every question to be asked; and, in connection with this article, a facsimile of the registration card with the questions translated into the Lithuanian language and filled in with sample answers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0935.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Liberty Loan drive was supported in the following manner: an advertisement, twelve inches high and four columns wide, entitled "The Duty of a Patriot!", with a facsimile application blank for a[Liberty]bond appeared in the May 25, June 1, and June 18 issues; another advertisement, eight inches high and two columns wide, with a picture of the Statue of Liberty and the words "You Buy a Liberty Bond Lest I Perish", appeared in the June 15 issue; an article entitled "Liberty Loan", announcing and explaining the Liberty Loan drive, appeared in the June 1 issue; a long article entitled "Why It Pays to Buy Liberty Bonds", explaining the bond issue in detail and urging Lithuanians to buy, appeared in the June 8 issue.</p>
