   <p>By comparing the Lithuanian activity of this year to that of the past year, we see that the Lithuanians were more active this year than lost. In talking about activity. I mean such activity as giving lectures, staging plays, arranging musical entertainments, and etc.</p>
   <p>First, it must be mentioned that besides the Aurora society, two other societies gave lectures; of course, not as many at the Aurora society. The Aurora society arranged thirteen lectures; the Young Lithuanians Club, two or three lectures; and the Farmer of Lithuania society, two lectures. The total delivered was seventeen lectures. This is a considerable number. As I have seen, the people attended these lectures in large numbers, and they were satisfied very much, as the lectures were on scientific subjects. I think that these societies will see to it that during the coming winter season, more lectures will be arranged and more people will attend these lectures. It would be very good if in every Lithuanian colony we could arrange lectures during the coming winter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1555.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second object, is theatrical performances. Last winter we have had more such performances than we ever had before, and we and mach better plays. No doubt, we owe this to the energetic activity displayed by our artist, Nikas Petrauskas. If he had not come to Chicago, we would not have seen on the stage the operetta "The Chimney Sweeper and the Miller". Not only would we not have seen this operetta, we would not have such a large choir, nor have learned the national dances. Petrauskas' activity inspired others to take more action in order to outdo him or to satisfy their own ambition.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, what ever the aims were, the cultural benefit was great. Others began to organize choirs, in order that they would not be behind the other organizations. Even though this competition has caused many obstacles and misunderstanding through untactful activity of some persons, the mark set will show that during this winter, notwithstanding the obstacles and bad circumstances, for the sake of cultural activity there was accomplished much, more than ever before.</p>
   <p>The last play of this season will be given by the newly organized Lithuanian Musical <pb facs="5423970_2_1556.jpg" n="3"/>Society "Birute", under the direction of Mr. M. Petrauskas. This new society is presenting, not common, ordinary performances, but is staging the melodrama, "Birute", written by Zemkalnis. The music for the play was composed by Mr. Petrauskas. The melodrama will be staged at the International Theater, corner Wabash and Hubbard Court. This is the theater, where famous Italian and English operas are produced. The "Birute" will be staged on May 31, at 8:15 P.M. This is the most beautiful performance of this winter season. The Lithuanians, not only will do themselves good, but they will show to Americans, that they, the Lithuanians, are capable enough to stage such a play as "Birute". If they want to gain a good name among the strangers, Lithuanians can do so by producing classical edifying operas.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Chicago Lithuanians to come and see this wonderful play, "Birute", to learn and to get the inspiration of beauty and culture. It must be remembered that this staging of the melodrama will cost four hundred dollars. This is not what will be paid to the actors and to the instructor, but actual preliminary expenses. Do you want the actors to take this burden on their own shoulders and present such a play to you free?</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1557.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We, Lithuanians, must attend this performance in multitudes. If we support this musical, Lithuanian society will arrange more theatrical performances for us. Let us fill the theater in order to see the Lithuanian opera. By supporting good undertakings we shall uplift ourselves culturally.</p>
   <p>Sympathizer.</p>
