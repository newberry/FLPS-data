   <p>Miss Klimavicaite is a well-known soloist among Chicago Lithuanians. This year she graduated from the Calumet Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art. June 17, the commencement exercises for the graduates were held. Miss Klimavicaite took part in the exercises. She sang the aria, "More Regal In His Low Estate," from Gounod's opera, "Queen of Sheba," beautifully. She received her teacher's certificate diploma. Finally, the school gave her a gold medal for her accomplishment in her music studies. Also, Miss Klimavicaite has studied with one of the best singing teachers in Chicago, Signor Archangeli, at his school, the Archangeli Vocal School of Bel Canto.</p>
   <p>Miss Klimavicaite, after her graduation from the Conservatory of Music, will give private singing lessons. In the fall, she will teach at the Lithuanian Conservatory of Chicago, which will be established by A. Pocius and Company.</p>
