   <p>A small monthly publication in the English language, entitled The Lithuanian Booster, is being published in Kingston, Pennsylvania. The editor is Thomas Shamis.</p>
   <p>We have seen only the fourth number of the publication. Its value can best be judged by its contents. It contains the following matter: "Let Us", a poem by Thomas Shamis; "Lithuanian History at a Glance" (giving in chronological order the most important events in the history of Lithuania); an article, without a title, about the need for charity; "Mollie's Terrier", a humorous piece; "Lithuania", a beautiful poem about Lithuania, by Louise Atherton Dickey; "An Appeal", another poem about present-day Lithuania, by William B. Neuwells; and several more articles.</p>
   <p>The number contains a map of ancient and modern Lithuania. The subscription <pb facs="5423970_2_1124.jpg" n="2"/>price is fifty cents per year, five cents per copy. The address is The Lithuanian Booster, 27 Short Street, Kingston, Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>Judging from this number of the publication, it has a very capable editor and manager in the person of Mr. Thomas Shamis. We recommend that Lithuanian-Americans who understand the English language subscribe to The Lithuanian Booster. We are especially pleased with the poems, which indicate that Mr. Shamis and his co-workers have plenty of poetical ability.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note; Mr. Thomas Shamis later became a resident of Chicago, and the publication of The Lithuanian Booster was transferred to Chicago.]</p>
