   <p>Lodge 182 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America sponsored a varied program at the A. Vasiliauskas Hall last Sunday night. A one-act comedy, "Bewitched Jackus," and a monologue, "Mister," were presented. Speeches were made and musical numbers were rendered.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. J. Zimontas spoke. He praised the Lodge for sponsoring such an exemplary affair and stressed the importance of unity. The speech pleased his public.</p>
   <p>The comedy, "Bewitched Jackus," was well acted. S. Kriukas and Miss M. Radzevicius were especially good. The other actors were Miss E. Orentas, B. Deliunas, S. Janulis, and P. Krasauskis. Little K. n played a violin solo, his sister, V. Bigelis, providing the piano accompaniment. The monologue, "Mister," was recited by S. A. K. at the end of the program. [Translator's note: Full name is not given.] His rendition provoked much laughter from the audience. No intoxicating beverages were sold at this affair.</p>
