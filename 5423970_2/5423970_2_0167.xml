   <p>Chicago is the capital of the American Lithuanians; we do not lack news of Lithuanian activity here. Especially at present we have a very good and interesting news item. Now all the Chicago Lithuanians are talking about the activities of our artist,singer and composer, Mikas Petrauskas.</p>
   <p>I will make no mistake (in saying) that Mr. Petrauskas has brought new enthusiasm to the Chicago Lithuanians' monotonous life. As soon as the composer came to Chicago, personal intolerance and partisan opinions have been buried; all of us gave a friendly hand to each other and started to work for one cause: to make the first concert of our composer successful, and we have had a complete success. I shall not forget the first concert, when I saw there our spiritual leaders, the intelligentsia and the workers; all of them were Lithuanians. For the first time among the Chicago Lithuanians, they met at a concert like the children of one mother.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0168.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At this concert I have seen the happy faces of Lithuanians; they felt that they had come to their own concert to see and to hear our own composer and singer. I have seen tears of joy on faces, the enthusiasm and brotherly feeling among the Lithuanian public. They forgot their politics, religion and other baseless disputes; they came to see, to hear, and to pay respect to our foremost singer and composer, Mikas Petrauskas.</p>
   <p>Yes, Mr. Petrauskas has succeeded in uniting us and making us see the beauty of the Lithuaian music and song.</p>
   <p>Right after the concert our singer began a hard task. He decided to organize a large Lithuanian choir in Chicago. The Lithuanians never had such a choir before. And he succeeded! After several weeks of hard work, he organized a choir of one hundred singers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0169.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In order that the Chicago Lithuanians can learn the beauty of the Lithuanian song, Mr. Petrauskas will present the operetta, "The Chimney Sweeper and the Miller," at the West Side Auditorium, corner Taylor Street and Center Avenue.</p>
   <p>Also I have heard that if the circumstances will permit, Mr. Petrauskas will present the historical operetta, "Birute."</p>
   <p>Best success to our compatriot!</p>
   <p>Dzukas.</p>
