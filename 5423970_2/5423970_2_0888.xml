   <p>The Lithuanians of America will soon have another daily newspaper, which a group of Chicagoans is now planning to found. The intended daily will be published in a Lithuanian nationalistic spirit.</p>
   <p>There is certainly a need for this daily since continued complaints are heard from all sides against the existing Lithuanian dailies on the ground that they "publish nothing but quarrels".</p>
   <p>The beginning of the organizational work for the new daily was very successful. At the only meeting held for this purpose, the plan for a new daily was enthusiastically greeted and two thousand dollars' worth of shares was bought at ten dollars a share.</p>
   <p>We have heard that the Lithuanians of other colonies are planning to give great support to the Chicagoans. More detailed information will be published <pb facs="5423970_2_0889.jpg" n="2"/>in the following edition of this paper. In the meantime, more information can be had either from Dr. K. Drangelis, a member of the organizational committee (3261 South Halsted Street), or from the Lietuva office.</p>
