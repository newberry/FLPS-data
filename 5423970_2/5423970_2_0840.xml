   <p>Death has ended the life of the Polish Socialist daily Dziennik Ludowy. The last number, issued on the 20th day of April, stated that it was the last issue. Its printing shop is in receivership. Dziennik Ludowy was published for 19 years. This Socialist organ supported the Germans during the World War, and as soon as America entered the war, this paper, as well as Naujienos, joined the Allies. It was an organ of reactionists, the biggest enemies of Soviet Russia. This paper was fooling the Polish people by supporting Gompers politics and upholding at all times the reactionaries. This daily's life was the same as the Menshevikis Naujienos of ours. But the Polish clericals are smarter and have a strong newspaper, so there was no chance for this daily to better itself in their eyes, so it had to put up its feet.</p>
   <p>This daily would have died long ago were it not for the help of the bureaucrats of the unions, especially of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0841.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lately this daily has so lowered itself that it upheld the bloody government of Warsaw.</p>
   <p>While staging the demonstration by workers of Chicago at the Polish consulate, this same daily was sorry that the police did not "hurry to come to break the demonstration."</p>
   <p>Polish workers have discarded this treacherous daily and it has died. The working people have lost nothing by the death of Dziennik Ludowy. Rather, they have one fool less.</p>
   <p>A few months ago the same thing happened to one German weekly. It was the only Socialist paper in America, and this first at last went into bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>Another Polish paper, Glos Robotniezy (Voice of the Worker), weekly, is also merely existing. It began as a daily, later as a weekly of 8 pages, now only of 4 pages. In the beginning this paper had a big influence and <pb facs="5423970_2_0842.jpg" n="3"/>popularity. Later it got sick with Extra-Leftists' sickness, became weaker. Now it is merely existing.</p>
