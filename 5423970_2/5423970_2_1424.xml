  <body>
   <p>The Lithuanian Youth Circle of Town of Lake held its first open forum at A. J. Bierzynskis Hall on March 17. Whether alcohol is good or bad for humanity was the topic of discussion. A large number of members and their friends attended.</p>
   <p>S. Ragauskis opened the discussion by pointing out that alcohol is one of the most harmful inventions on earth. The second speaker, A. M. Barcius, declared that it is solely due to alcohol that civilization has reached its present high degree of development. The speaker stated that no medicines could be made if alcohol had not been invented.</p>
   <p>It seemed that all those who attended were interested in the subject and were satisfied with the discussion. The second in the series of discussions <pb facs="5423970_2_1425.jpg" n="2"/>to be sponsored by the Youth Circle will be held in the same place on Friday, March 24. Whether unions are necessary for workers will be the topic. All the members of the Lithuanian Youth Circle should attend and bring their friends.</p>
