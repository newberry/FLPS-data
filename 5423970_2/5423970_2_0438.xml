   <p>Last Sunday, the Lithuanian Workers Alliance of America presented a play, "The Villain," at 1315 North Ashland Avenue. If some of the actors had shown more life in their roles, the performance, I should say, would have been good. Among the actors should be mentioned P.P. Vinslovas, A.J. Jonavicius, and D. Dapsis, as they performed well. The hall was crowded, and it seems that the audience was satisfied with the performance.</p>
   <p>On the same evening, the Guards of the Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuanian Choir No. 1, at Columbia Hall, presented the "Bewitched Duke." The performance was fair, except for some performers, especially the actresses, who spoke in such low tones that it was very hard to hear what they were saying. Our actors should pay attention to this matter, because no matter how good a performance might be, if the actors cannot be heard the audience will not like it. Those who performed well were: K.S. Sukis, V. Girdvainis, S. Tamosaitis, and J. Parkauskis.</p>
