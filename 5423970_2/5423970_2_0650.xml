   <p>p.4.... The Lithuanian White Rose Club held a masquerade ball on Jan. 16, in the Town of Lake Lithuanian colony. It was the largest ball ever held by our people in that community.</p>
   <p>The ball was so successful that four additional prizes, besides the five originally planned, had to be given out. Prizes were offered to the most popular couples and individuals. Separate prizes were issued to men and women.</p>
   <p>The first prize for men went to a pair of "News Boys"; the second prize was awarded to a pair masquerading as members of the "White Star Club".</p>
   <p>The first prize for women went to a group of "Stock Yards Shop Girls": the second prize went to a pair of women in male attire masquerading as members of the "White Rose Club."</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0651.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first individual prize for men went to "Beff Lugger"; the second prize was awarded to "A. Gupsy."</p>
   <p>More prizes were awarded to other groups and individuals who contributed to the amusement of the crowd.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee deserves much credit for presenting such a successful ball. The net profit from the evening will be about $300.00.</p>
