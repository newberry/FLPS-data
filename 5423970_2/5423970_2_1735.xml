   <p>The Blessed Lithuania Society, a mutual-aid society, has lowered the initiation fee to all applicants who are thirty years of age or under to $1.00 during the next six months; the initiation fee for applicants above that age will be the same as before, according to the age of the applicant. This is an excellent opportunity for young Lithuanian men who desire to belong to a mutual-aid society.</p>
   <p>All members of the society are entitled to a sick benefit of five dollars per week, and a death benefit of fifty dollars; the proceeds of a collection of one dollar from each member are added to the above-mentioned death benefit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1736.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When the wife of a member dies, the husband receives fifty cents from each member of the society.</p>
   <p>This society was established on Aug. 12, 1906. It has about two hundred members at present. New applicants for membership are accepted regardless of political or religious affiliations. Meetings are held in the afternoon of every second Sunday of each month in the Pauga Hall, 1900 S. Union Avenue.</p>
   <p>Edward Capulis is the president of the society; Anicetas Linkos, 3204 So. Emerald Avenue, is the secretary.</p>
