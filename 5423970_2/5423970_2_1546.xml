  <body>
   <p>Dr. A. L. Graiciunas will deliver another lecture on the subject of child health and temperance on Sunday evening, September 25, at the Henry Booth House, 701 West 14th Place. He will explain the rearing of healthy children, the effect of alcohol upon a child whose parents use intoxicating liquors, and the harmful and poisonous effects of intoxicating liquors upon those who use them.</p>
   <p>His talk on the ill effects of drinking will be illustrated with new pictures. Everybody, young and old, is invited to attend this lecture, by which everyone can profit.</p>
   <p>This lecture is being conducted for the benefit of all Lithuanians. When a person learns and understands the harmful effects of intoxicating liquors <pb facs="5423970_2_1547.jpg" n="2"/>upon himself and his children, then in many cases, he will use them more moderately. Such an understanding about alcoholism may be had at this lecture. Everyone should take advantage of this opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted with the subject.</p>
   <p>Dr. Graiciunas has delivered two lectures on the same subject previously, September 19 and 22, in the parish hall at 46th and Wood Streets, in the Town of Lake, Chicago Lithuanian colony.</p>
