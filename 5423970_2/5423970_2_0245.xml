   <p>It is well known to progressive Lithuanian people of Chicago that the Children's Society has organized a Young Workers Orchestra. No doubt there are many Lithuanian children studying music and playing piano or violin; but they are not organized in one group and individually they have no chance to appear before the public to show their talents in the field of music.</p>
   <p>In order to keep their interest in music, they must organize into a musical group and be given the opportunity to appear before the public once in a while. There are many bright and talented children who love music, but in time they lose their interest in it and finally stop playing altogether. If anybody understands a child's psychology, he will know that children like to show their talents to those who are interested in their efforts. The Young Workers' Orchestra, which has <pb facs="5423970_2_0246.jpg" n="2"/>just been organized, will help and inspire those who are interested in music. This organization will be an inspiration and it will encourage young folks to study music. This orchestra made plans for concerts and arranged a diverse program for the concerts which will be held in the near future. The opportunity to take part on the program will be given to all children according to their ability and classification. In addition to the orchestra, singers will have an opportunity also. The singing group will be divided into three categories: duets, quartets and solo singers.</p>
   <p>We believe that our cooperation will give our youth more energy and a greater inspiration to work more energetically in the field of music. If we don't take an interest in their work, they lose their love for music and cease studying it completely. We must make every effort to help and encourage them to study music, not only for pleasure's sake, but also to become professional artists in that field.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0247.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the future we will have many good artists in different fields of music, such as soloists, violinists, pianists, and even symphony orchestras.</p>
   <p>Besides the orchestra there will be elementary instruction given in the theory of music and the children will be taught to play various instruments, such as violin, piano and brass instruments. We will also have a special instructor for vocal training, who will give proper instruction and teach our children singing.</p>
   <p>Those who want to play in the orchestra must know the scales at least up to four sharps, flats and time, in order to play first position well. Our greatest desire is to urge those children who have been studying music to join this orchestra as soon as possible and don't delay any longer. There is a golden opportunity for your children to continue their study in music. We urge every father and mother to <pb facs="5423970_2_0248.jpg" n="4"/>give his child the opportunity to study music and singing and by joining this organization your children will derive many benefits by associating with nice children and at the same time they will be studying music.</p>
   <p>The instruction in music will be given all summer in order to prepare children for the concert which will be given this fall at the Lithuanian Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Instruction on music will be given every Friday from 6 to 8 P. M. at the Mark White Square Park, 30th St. and Halsted.</p>
