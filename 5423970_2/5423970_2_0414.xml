   <p>A gathering at which a play was presented took place in the yard of the St. Anthony Parish in Cicero on Sunday, August 30. The four-act historical drama "Mirga" was presented. Since the weather was favorable, it was possible to stage the play in the churchyard, which was specially decorated for the program. This was the first performance of a play among us Lithuanians that has taken place in the open.</p>
   <p>"Mirga" is a very beautiful historical play which clearly portrays the relations between Lithuania and Poland in medieval times. Besides the presentation of "Mirga", the program was varied by good monologues and the recitation of various poems.</p>
   <p>The evening's program was opened with a monologue, "Life--Struggle--Success", which was delivered by Miss P. Spranaitis. Then Miss M. Ivinskis recited the poem "Traku Pilis", which made a pleasant impression on the listeners.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The declamation was very good.</p>
   <p>After this the presentation of "Mirga" was begun. It was performed in praiseworthy fashion. All the actors knew their roles well. The roles were distributed thus: Miss B. Slegaitis as "Mirga" (she performed well); B. Liebonas as "Bilgenas" (his acting was good); Miss P. Laurinavicius as "Ona" and "Mostevas" (she was outstanding with her clear diction); K. Ivinskis as "Vytautas" and "Proska" (his acting was passable although his diction was not clear); A. Vastokas and Miss M. Ivinskis as soldiers (you could not distinguish which of the soldiers was the girl); Joseph Vilkelis as "Gimbutas" (though he had his role memorized his acting was weak and he spoke too softly).</p>
   <p>It must be pointed out that these actors are all students and are young.</p>
   <p>Poems were recited between the acts, of which there are four in "Mirga". After the first act, Miss B. Kerbadas recited "Mergele Rutu Darzelyje" <pb facs="5423970_2_0416.jpg" n="3"/>(The Girl in the Garden of Rue). The second declaimer was Miss Ann Johnson, who recited "Vilnius". After the second act, "Ant Vytauto Kapo" (On Vytautas' Grave) was recited very well by little L. Norkevicius. After him, Miss V. Feiza recited "Sv. Jurgio Kareiviai" (The Soldiers of St. George)...</p>
   <p>This was the first large program of its kind in this vicinity. It was apparent that all who had attended were satisfied. After the program those attending amused themselves by participating in various Lithuanian folk games and Lithuanian folk dances. The gathering dispersed about midnight. A local Lithuanian student, Mr. B.G. Liebonas, who attends R.T. Crane High School, was the most active person in the preparation of this affair. He is generally a fervent worker in the preparations for programs and various entertainments.</p>
