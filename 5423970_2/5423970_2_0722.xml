  <body>
   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society is the youngest society in Chicago, but its membership passed the older societies. At every meeting we:are getting new members.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of October the 6th the society members decided to have Lietuva as an organ of our society. Every member will pay 25 cents per month to the society, and the society will subscribe to Lietuva for its members.</p>
   <p>This society not only cares about the mutual sick benefit and the funeral expenses, but also looks for the enlightenment of its members. We have a library, where every Lithuanian can go to read books and the newspapers free of charge.</p>
   <p>Our society presented a few theatrical spectacles and will present more. The society is only two years old, but already has two hundred and fifty dollars in its treasury, and the library is worth over one hundred dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0723.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When our society has more members and larger budget, it will then establish a Lithuanian school. As our society has cultural aims, for this reason, many new members are joining this society on every meeting.</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
