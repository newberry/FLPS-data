   <p>The Lithuanian Golden Star Pleasure and Benefit Club was organized on August 3, 1920.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the club is:</p>
   <p>1. To unite into a brotherly alliance Lithuanians of good moral standing residing in Roseland and its vicinity irrespective of their religious and political views.</p>
   <p>2. The club will make no decisions and will donate no money from its treasury for the purpose of upholding or opposing religion or any political party.</p>
   <p>3. The club must have one banquet a year in which all members must participate or pay a fine, the cost of the admission to the banquet.</p>
   <p>4. A member can bring a friend of his who is not from Roseland to the athletic room, but for bringing a local friend, will be fined 50 cents.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1632.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>5. A member of the club must not work in a factory, where a strike is on; if he should work and should be injured, he can get no sick benefits.</p>
   <p>Persons between the ages of sixteen and forty are eligible for membership.</p>
   <p>The membership dues are 50 cents per month.</p>
   <p>The said alliance is divided into three benefit sections:</p>

   <p>Every member of the alliance pays 25 cents extra per year for the alliance's affairs.</p>
   <p>Every member of this alliance pays $2 per year to the death fund. Deaths or no deaths, the dues must be paid.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1633.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A member who has been sick for one year, loses his membership in the organization, no matter to which section he may belong. To the sick member who thus loses his membership the society's treasury pays $100.</p>
   <p>The membership of this alliance is about one hundred and forty.</p>
