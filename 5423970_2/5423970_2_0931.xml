   <p>The office of the Lietuva, 814 West 33rd Street, has been open evenings for the past week to assist and advise those men who are affected by the war draft. Many readers of the Lietuva came to the office from various Lithuanian colonies, such as Englewood, Cicero, the North Side, the 18th Street District, South Chicago, etc. The hearts of many of these men were greatly relieved after they had received authentic information in regard to their status in the draft. For example, one man who was unable properly to understand the announcements in the American newspapers, believed that his number was among the first drawn and that he would be called into the army immediately. It turned out, however, that his number is in the eleven thousand group, and that he will not be called until very long time has elapsed.</p>
   <p>Many men were greatly frightened by practical jokers who misled the men to believe that they will be the first to be called into the army; they showed great relief when they learned their true status at the office of the Lietuva. The office will also be open every evening next week to advise those men who will be <pb facs="5423970_2_0932.jpg" n="2"/>called before the exemption board next week. Information, answers to questions, and the filling out of legal documents--these services will be provided by Attorney Bruno K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva.</p>
