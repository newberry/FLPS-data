   <p>A massmeeting of unemployed workers was held Thursday evening, Jan. 27, to protest against the Chicago police, who split the heads of many unemployed workers who attempted to start a parade at Hull House on Jan. 17.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers was Lucy Parsons, who was one of those arrested as a result of the riot on Jan. 17. William Thurston Brown, an ex-priest and secretary of the Colorado State Socialist Party, also spoke.</p>
   <p>All those who had been arrested denounced the Chicago police as the lowliest kind of human beings.</p>
   <p>Brown said: "I would rather see my son die than see him wear the uniform of a policeman." He also placed priests in the same category with the police.</p>
   <p>Rev. Irwin Tucker and Vincent St. John were also scheduled to speak, but they <pb facs="5423970_2_1439.jpg" n="2"/>failed to appear at the meeting.</p>
   <p>A resolution was adopted denouncing the nefarious deeds of the police.</p>
   <p>A large crowd attented the protest meeting in spite of the severe cold weather.</p>
