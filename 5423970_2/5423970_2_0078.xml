  <body>
   <p>A group of Lithuanians live in the neighborhood of 45th, 46th, and 47th Streets, between Wentworth and 5th Avenues. There are from seventy to one hundred Lithuanian families living there. Most of the Lithuanian workers are employed in so-called "roundhouses" or locomotive barns. A Lithuanian organization flourished here for some time, but is now extinct.</p>
   <p>In this colony, there are four Lithuanian saloons, operated by Tuleikis, Kumpikiewic, Eidimt, and Steponaitis; two Lithuanian owned food stores, operated by A. Krauza, and J. Krauza; one Lithuanian owned barber shop, operated by J. Jonauskas.</p>
   <p>As far as can be determined, there are five Lithuanian property owners here. The names and approximate cash values of the Lithuanian property owners are: J. Eidimt, $4200; J. Tuleikis, $1500; J. Zigmuntavicz, $4500; A. Rauris, $3000; and F. Rumzas, $1500.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0079.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The oldest Lithuanian business establishment in this colony is a saloon, which was opened ten years ago by J. Tuleikis.</p>
   <p>There are more Lithuanian business establishements in this colony, but they are so scattered that it is very difficult to locate them all. It is believed that there are at least two more here than the number mentioned above.</p>
