   <p>Our proposition is this: one man, even if he were the most educated, cannot accomplish as much as a group of people.</p>
   <p>If a newspaper is published by one man, it will not bring to us spiritual benefit, he will publish in the paper what is good for himself only, and very often he makes mistakes. Suppose he dislikes some one, them he will publish all kinds of insults about him, that would bring misunderstandings and troubles, etc.</p>
   <p>When a newspaper is published by stockholders, then there would be no place for private and personal polemics, because stockholders will look and watch that the paper brought spiritual benefit, education, and brotherly unity among us. Such a newspaper would do more good for us, and for our mother country as well.</p>
   <p>The price of one share is only $10.00. We have sold 50 shares, there are 100 shares left.</p>
   <p>If any Lithuanian wants to buy shares of Lietuva, come to office of Lietuva at 567 W. 18th St.</p>
   <p>Stockholders.</p>
