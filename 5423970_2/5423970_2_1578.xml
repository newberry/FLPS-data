   <p>On June 2, a public meeting was held at Freiheit Turner hall. The lecture was arranged by the 4th branch of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance of America. The speaker was Pius Grigaitis who recently came from Lithuania. Pius Grigaitis in his long lecture presented the awful conditions in Russia and Lithuania, and what happened there during the two years of revolution. The people were moved when Grigaitis stated the brutality of the Russian government to the people. Grigaitis himself suffered much, was beaten almost to death, still he has energy to fight against the tyranny of the Russian despot.</p>
   <p>The lecture collected for the revolutionary cause - $36.00. The 4th branch of the Lithuanian Socialist donated $35.00. Total - $71.00</p>
   <p>On June 9, Sokol Hall, 821 So. Ashland Avenue, the socialist's lectures will be held for the cause of revolutionary movement in Russia. Grigaitis will speak there, also American, Russian and Polish speakers will speak at this meeting.</p>
