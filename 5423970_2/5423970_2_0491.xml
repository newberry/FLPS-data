   <p>A select group of local stage amateurs met at the Fellowship House, on 33rd Place, to discuss the Chicago Lithuanian stage and its problems. The fourteen persons assembled unanimously agreed that it was necessary to establish a society of more talented actors, which would do as much as it could to improve the Lithuanian theatrical stage.</p>
   <p>A second, larger meeting was held in the same place on March 14, and the Drama Society was established. This society will concern itself with presenting better plays, using the best, [possible] resources. It will present plays not merely for the sake of presenting them, but will try to make them skillful and artistic. The new Society intends to devote all its energy to this end, and in order to achieve its aims, will not only have a larger number of rehearsals before presenting any play, but will also study drama at special meetings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0492.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Drama Society will begin its presentations next fall. The following officers were elected: K. Jurgelionis, director; B. Vaitiekunas, his assistant; M. J. Damijonaitis, president; J. Briedis, secretary. The following compose the literary committee for the selection of plays: 1) K. Jurgelionis, 2) B. Vaitiekunas, and 3) M. Viskoskiene.</p>
