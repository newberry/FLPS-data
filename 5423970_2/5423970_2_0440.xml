   <p>On November 16, at St. George's Parish Hall, the Lithuanian Youth Circle presented the play, "Who is Guilty," Written by J. J. Zolpis. This was the first time this play was ever presented on the stage.</p>
   <p>The performance of the drama was good. Mr. A. M. Barcius, as a German drunkard, was especially good, as was Mr. J. Sedemka as the lad, "Kastulis." With a few exceptions, all the actors performed their roles well. A bouquet was given to Mr. J. J. Zolpis, who co-starred with Miss Z. Laurinaiciute. Miss A. Uriute, who co-starred with Mr. P. K. Strzineskis, also received a bouquet.</p>
   <p>As always, and at this time too, the Lithuanian Youth Circle had planned this performance with great care. The scenery, which is the greatest concern of <pb facs="5423970_2_0441.jpg" n="2"/>this circle, showed good taste and a good understanding of what is appropriate. It should also be remarked that the right people were selected for the roles. One cannot imagine an old, fat woman in the role of a young, slim, beautiful girl. In other words, the youth of this theatrical circle are working in earnest with full devotion for the uplifting of our art.</p>
   <p>Between the third and fourth acts, Mr. S. Darguzis, a student, gave a talk about Lithuanian-American students, and urged the people to support Dreams of Youth, a monthly magazine published by the Lithuanian Students' Association of America.</p>
   <p>The audience was large. Judging from the applause, the audience was pleased with the performance. One thing that was noticeable and which can be criticized, was that some words in this drama were far from being Lithuanian.</p>
