   <p>p.5. Last Sunday afternoon the Bridgeport Chapter of the A.Z.V.D. (Children's Little Society of the Blossom of Hope) presented a musical program at Meldazis Hall. The program consisted of songs, dances, and music.</p>
   <p>The program opened with a scene from the opera, "Il Trovatore." The scene was animated by a group of girls who danced and sang. It was one of the most impressive parts of the program.</p>
   <p>The above number was followed with recitations and music by the Girls' Chorus. Later a violin orchestra consisting only of children rendered a few musical numbers. This orchestra has made splendid progress. It was organized only last fall and today is capable of taking a leading part in a musical program. That progress is due largely to the capable leadership of comrade Br. Kalkis.</p>
   <p>The program continued with various musical and dance numbers by children. At the end of the program the entire Lithuanian Children's Chorus, under the leadership of <pb facs="5423970_2_0244.jpg" n="2"/>comrade Zarat, came on the stage and sang a few songs, ending with the International song of the working class. Here comrade Zarat was presented with a bouquet of flowers as a token of appreciation for her efforts in training the Children's Chorus.</p>
   <p>Comrade Zarat took over the leadership of the Children's Chorus only a few weeks ago and has already developed and trained the children into a wonderful entertaining group.</p>
   <p>The program ended shortly after 6:00 P.M. The floor was then cleared of seats and made ready for dancing.</p>
