   <p>On August 24 the St. Stanislovas V. and K. Society of Town of Lake celebrated its tenth anniversary. Catholic and national societies participated in the celebration, and marched in the parade through Town of Lake to the Slavie hall, 47th Street and Winchester Avenue, where the program of the evening was given.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the evening was Mr. J. Klimas. The speakers were: Right Reverend A. Briska, Messrs. V. Milasevicia, A. Precinauskas, and P. Gudas. Small children gave declamations. The St. Cecilia Choir of the Holy Cross parish sang "Cantata," the "Song of May," "Why Are <pb facs="5423970_2_1703.jpg" n="2"/>You So Sorrowful, Thou Wayfaring Tree," and several other songs. The choir was directed by Mr. V. Dauska, who is well known to Chicago Lithuanians. As always, the choir sang excellently.</p>
   <p>At the celebration, twenty veteran members of the society received gold medals for not having required beneficiary aid during the ten-year existence of the society. Many people were present at the jubilee program of this society.</p>
