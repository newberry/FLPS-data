   <p>A very strange thing has happened in Chicago in connection with the motion picture exhibits of Mr. Raciunas. The latter was prohibited by some of our respectable priests from showing any scenes of the Lithuanian National Cemetery, which is located in Justice Park, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Raciunas, as we all know, is traveling among Lithuanian colonies, showing motion pictures of interest to Lithuanian-Americans. He filmed a few scenes at the Lithuanian National Cemetery last year during an outing of the Chicago district of the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>The cemetery is the public property of Chicago Lithuanians. Therefore, it should be a pleasure for them to view pictures of their own property. However, some Chicago Lithuanian priests think differently; they ordered Mr. Raciunas to eliminate the cemetery scenes when showing his films in a parish hall. He included <pb facs="5423970_2_1263.jpg" n="2"/>the cemetery scenes, however, in all of his shows in other locations.</p>
   <p>This is an unimportant matter, but, after all, we are living in the twentieth century.</p>
