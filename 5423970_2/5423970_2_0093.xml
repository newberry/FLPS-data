   <p>Now is the best opportunity to get one or more shares at that prosperous store, the Bell Clothing Company.</p>
   <p>The Bell Clothing Corporation for the last three years has been doing good business at 983-87 Milwaukee Avenue. Since this corporation is doing good business, it has courage enough to open another store in the new establishment which A. Olszewski is building at 33rd and Halsted streets. This corporation pays to its stockholders larger dividends than any other corporation. If any stock holder wishes to resign, the corporation refunds the invested money on demand.</p>
   <p>The man who belongs to this corporation always feels at ease. For his invested money he gets good dividends every year, and when he wants to resign he knows that his money will be refunded on his demand.</p>
   <p>The stockholders of this corporation can be residents of Chicago or of <pb facs="5423970_2_0094.jpg" n="2"/>other cities. Every one can buy one or several shares, but not more than 100. Money invested in this business brings better profits than money deposited in the bank or loaned to mortgagers.</p>
   <p>Those who have saved some money should invest in this corporation, buy one or more shares, and reap huge benefits.</p>
   <p>At present the price of the share is $10. When the new store will be opened, the price will be $15 per share.</p>
