   <p>p.2...There will be a concert in honor of Mikas Petranskas, one of the most accomplished Lithuanian composers, at the Lithuanian auditorium, on April 2nd. In early childhood he showed musical talent. While only a lad of twelve, he played an organ for church services. Throughout his youth he studied music, even though at times finances were almost nil. He attended the Imperial Conservatory of Music at the now so-called City of Leningrad. During this time, he worked his way by teaching others.</p>
   <p>After being graduated with the highest honors, he returned to Lithuania and began staging his own productions. Political misunderstandings forced him to leave his native country for a period of time, and he then studied in France and Italy.</p>
   <p>At the present time he deserves credit and praise for having written some of the best Lithuanian operas and operettas extant. Some of them are, <pb facs="5423970_2_0124.jpg" n="2"/>"Queen-Of-Snakes," "Devil The Inventor," "Marry Me," "The Grand Duke," "The Holy Night," and the most widely known among Lithuanians is "Birute," which is a patriotic narrative.</p>
   <p>Among the operettas are: "Chimney Sweeper and "Windmill Hand," "Adam and Eve," Consilium Facultatis" (Meeting of Faculty), "King of the Forests."</p>
   <p>These are but a few of them. His works are almost innumerable.</p>
   <p>Since he is now leaving America to return to Lithuania, his birthplace, all of Chicago Lithuanians will do him homage at the concert April 2nd, at the Chicago Lithuanian auditorium. This is but a small courtesy to express our appreciation of one who merits royal laudations.</p>
