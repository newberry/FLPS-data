   <p>Local Lithuanians know that we have the Lithuanian Public Library here. It seems that there is no necessity to write about it. Every one has the opportunity to read books and newspapers during the library hours. This library has not been in existence a long time--not yet one year--and therefore does not have many books; nor does it have money to buy more, and very few people have donated books to it.</p>
   <p>Recently, the Farmers of Lithuanian Society of the West Side, Chicago, donated fifty volumes of books to our library. The library board is very thankful to the Farmers of Lithuania Society for this big donation. At the same time, we appeal to individuals and societies to donate to our library--the Lithuanian Public Library of Cicero--books for which they have no further use.</p>

   <p>We are living in a free country. Therefore, let us use the freedom. Instead of establishing saloons and supporting them, let us establish libraries. The Lithuanian Public Library of Cicero, was established by a few enlightened Lithuanian young men. The growth of this library will depend on the good will of the people. If there can be found enough people to support it, then our library will grow. We hope that Lithuanians will not forget, and that they will extend their helping hands to this institution of enlightenment.</p>
   <p>P. S. Send the books to this address:</p>
   <p>A. Samoshka,</p>
   <p>1213 South 48th Court,</p>
   <p>Cicero, Illinois.</p>
