   <p>It was mentioned in No. 21 of Lietuva that there was a split in the society. There were two distinct parties, one wanted to belong to the Catholic church, not to go against the Catholic religion, not to keep books in the library against religion or priests.</p>
   <p>The reverend Kranczunas wrote a letter to all the Lithuanian societies, that if any society does not want to belong to the Catholic church, will refuse to support the church or priest, or if such a society will keep such members who refuse to support the Catholic church and priest, and who will not go to confession, such society will be discriminated against by the church and cannot hold meetings in the church hall.</p>
   <p>At this meeting the infidels demanded the return of their paid dues, while other infidels agreed to remain in the society and go to confession. We will see if they really go to confession.</p>
   <p>It is a good thing that such members were dismissed from the society.</p>
