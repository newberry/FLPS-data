   <p>The majority of you know already that the Chicago Lithuanian Women's Enlightenment Society has for the past several years held a school for women during the winter months. The following subjects were taught: reading, writing, cooking, sewing, etc. The above-named society has this winter opened a school for women at the Mark White Square Park Hall, Halsted and 31st Streets. The cooking school is open every Thursday evening at eight o'clock; admission, ten cents. At the cooking school, Mrs. A. Z. Slakis will deliver lectures on diet hygiene on two successive evenings. The handicraft school is open every Monday evening from eight until ten, in the same place where the cooking school is held. At this school are taught reading, writing, designing, sewing, knitting, and embroidery.</p>
   <p>Therefore, those students who wish to learn any one of the above subjects must bring their own material, and the teachers will give complete instruction in any subject. Admission, ten cents, We cordially invite members, as well as those who are not members, of this society to attend the school.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
