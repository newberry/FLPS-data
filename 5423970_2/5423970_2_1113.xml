   <p>From this date the newspaper Lietuva became mine. I, A. V. Zalauskas, bought this newspaper from Mr. Rokosz. The newspaper will be edited in the same spirit, except on one point, that we will begin to publish scientific articles and we will not be afraid to tell the truth; there will be no exception as to the classes nor condition of man. As propagators of the pure science of Christ, we openly will uphold the truth and the downtrodden.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper Lietuva will become the mother of toilers, orphans and unfortunates, and it will be the whip against pharisaism and despotic exploiters.</p>
   <p>I, as a Lithuanian, by seeing our brothers who are moaning under the yoke of today's pharisaism and capitalism, decided to donate several thousand dollars for the good of my beloved mother country and for my brothers, in order to put one brick on the temple, that our patriots with unspeakable <pb facs="5423970_2_1114.jpg" n="2"/>patience and courage are building.</p>
   <p>I understand that the only salvation of our nation is science; we are in the abyss of darkness where the Lithuanians are sunk so deep. Therefore, I say, one must have a heart of stone to conceal his conscience, to renounce the science of Christ, to be a peddler of one's soul, to be a traitor to his nation for not helping our sinking brothers.</p>
   <p>Brothers, Lithuanians, you must understand your own condition, listen to the calling voice, the savior of our nation. Science is the only weapon that will improve our living, enlighten and protect us from our exploiting enemies.</p>
   <p>Your servant,</p>
   <p>Zaleskis</p>
