   <p>The Lithuanian Independent Club of Chicago held its semi-annual meeting, Dec. 17, 1904. Mr. Zehaitis, the chairman of the evening, made a motion to make collections for the relief of Lithuanian exiles in Siberia, and for students aid. The motion was carried and $10 was collected. This sum was divided into two parts, $5 was given to the exiles in Siberia and $5 was sent to the Aurora Society Fund, for poor students.</p>
   <p>The club decided to make contributions at every meeting towards other worthy causes, such as helping poor students who are in need of funds, the Lithuanians in exile, and other who are in need of assistance.</p>
   <p>We cannot bear to see our people suffer Russian persecution and injustice. Our people have been heavily burdened for many generations by the tyrannical Russian government. Now we have to share Russia's burden. We <pb facs="5423970_2_1750.jpg" n="2"/>share their burden financially.</p>
   <p>Those who can afford it are asked to contribute to the relief fund as much as possible. It is our moral duty to help our brothers and sisters across the sea. We must make every effort to extend a helping hand to our needy ones. They depend upon us for help and we cannot forget them, for it is our duty to help people.</p>
   <p>All future meetings will be held at the Azuka's Hall, which is located at 33rd St. and Auburn Ave., Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>These meetings will be held every 2nd and 3rd Saturday of the month. We invite all those who want to join our club. The club gives aid to its members when they are sick and cannot work. It costs only $1.00 to join this club.</p>
