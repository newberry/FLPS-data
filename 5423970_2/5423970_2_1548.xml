   <p>Dr. A. Z. Zimontas delivered a lecture on the cause and prevention of toothaches on March 7, in the Southwestern part of Chicago. The lecture was sponsored by the 28th Chapter of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society.</p>
   <p>The lecture was very interesting and highly educational. The lecturer made a special effort to explain the meaning of all technical terms so that the audience might derive greater benefit from the lecture. This excellent example should be followed by our newspapers, which often contain undefined and generally unknown words.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted, however, that only a small group of people attended the lecture. It seems that our people are too stingy to pay a dime to hear a lecture. But why are they not stingy when they go into saloons, where they spend not dimes but dollars? Apparently our intelligentsia will have to labor a long time before they will succeed in raising the intellectual level of our people, especially the "old <pb facs="5423970_2_1549.jpg" n="2"/>Americans." Our young people, however, are showing a greater appreciation for the higher things of life. It is hoped that the labors of our intelligentsia will bear greater fruit in the future than they have in the past.</p>
   <p>The society has completed arrangements for two more lectures, to be given in the same church hall as the first lecture. B. Balutis will lecture on Vilna and its history, on March 21. Dr. A. Rutkauskas will deliver a lecture on health on April 18.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the coming lectures will be attended by a greater number of people. Even those who like saloons should manage to leave the bar t least for a short while in order to go there where their brains can derive more benefit than they can receive from the amber colored fluid.</p>
