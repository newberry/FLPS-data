   <p>Next Tuesday, June 31, all the property of the newspaper Katalikas (The Catholic), which folded up at the end of last year when the private bank of John Tananevicius went bankrupt, will be sold by the government at public auction. Every bit of property of the Katalikas, which was owned by John Tananevicius, including fixtures, printing machinery, printing equipment, furniture, books, musical instruments, etc., will be auctioned at the sale.</p>
   <p>The sale will be conducted by Samuel L. Wintenitz &amp; Company. It will be possible to purchase the various items separately. A list of the various items that will be sold can be obtained from the above-mentioned firm, whose address is Room 506, Rector Building, on the corner of Clark and Monroe Streets.
