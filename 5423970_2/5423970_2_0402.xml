   <p>The Society of the Flag of Lithuania in America, Number One, presented a theatrical program at Meldazis Hall last Sunday, October 25. In its advertisements it promised to present the two-act comedy, "The Matchmaking," "Mike's Conversation with His Father," "The Greenhorn," etc., but only "The Matchmaking" was presented. Frankly, it would be a good idea not to bore the public with such things as the conversations of "Mike" and his father. The acting was fair. It was evident that the actors were giving their best. The following were outstanding: F. Gerbenis, Miss F. Pocius, J. Graborskis, Miss J. Sargas, and K. Sirvinokas.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to say where the audience had gathered from. It was evident that this was the first program many had ever attended. Hardly a word escaped the artists without being repeated by the audience. These people should learn how to conduct themselves at a conduct themselves at a theatrical performance. There was <pb facs="5423970_2_0403.jpg" n="2"/>dancing after the program. The audience was not very large.</p>
