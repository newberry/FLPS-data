   <p>A meeting of the representatives of the Lithuanian Public Library on the West Side was held last Friday. The most important decision was to arrange a festive commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of the Lithuanian press this fall. As far as it is known, the commemoration will be effected through the efforts of the nine societies which support the Library. There might even be more [organizations willing to cooperate], for it has been reported that several other local societies are planning to join the list of Library sponsors. A semi-annual examination of the financial status of the Library revealed that it is in a good enough position: the treasury has $102.53. Numerous readers attend. Their number has decreased since the advent of warm weather. The largest number appears on Friday, when the newspapers arrive from all points.</p>
