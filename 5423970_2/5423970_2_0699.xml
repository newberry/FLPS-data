   <p>Last year Mr. Gabris published an appeal in the Lithuanian newspapers, extending an invitation to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the birthday of the deceased Dr. V. Kudirka, and to publish his biography and all his literary works. This would be a monument to a great man. What effect this appeal has had on the Lithuanian public is not known. Here and there the people contributed a few dollars for this good cause. A committee should be appointed to take care of the contributions. Then we would know how much money was donated for this worthy undertaking.</p>
   <p>The Simonas Daukatos Society at its anniversary celebration on Oct.27, 1907 collected $27.40, and from its own budget donated $10, total $37.40, for the publication of Dr. V. Kudirka's literary works. This money is accounted for in the society's budget, because we do not know where or to whom to send this fund, as there is no committee to take care of it. We would like to see the Lovers of Fatherland Literary Society publish the writings of Dr. Kudirka.</p>
   <p>We are also announcing to the Lithuanian public that our society which bears the great name of the foremost historian of Lithuania, has published <pb facs="5423970_2_0700.jpg" n="2"/>a picture of Simonas Daukatos, size 22 x 28. The picture shows S. Daukatos at his desk writing the history of Lithuania. The price on same is $.25, and if a picture is desired, send this amount to M. J. Damijonaitis, 3252 S. Halsted St., Chicago, Ill., where it can be had.</p>
   <p>We have heard that the Chicago Lithuanians are complaining that there is no Lithuanian library. We are, therefore, announcing that the Simonas Daukatos Society has had its own library of five hundred copies of various books for the last several years. Members of the society get the books free to read, while non-members pay $.05 a week for reading the books. The library is at Rugis Hall, 3301 S. Morgan St.</p>
   <p>M. J. Damijonaitis.</p>
