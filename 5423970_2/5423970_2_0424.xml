   <p>On Easter evening at the Meldazis Hall the Youth of Freedom Musical and Dramatic Society performed a two-act comedy play called "Seized." The comedy was interesting and amusing. It gave a good picture of the past struggle between the Lithuanian peasants and the Polish noblemen.</p>
   <p>Some of the actors were quite stiff, shy and lacked experience in the art of acting. Nevertheless, the comedy deserves credit for its performance. All actors did their part to the best of their ability. After the play there was singing by three different choirs. The first to sing was the Lithuanian Socialist League, 81st local, choir; next came the Freedom of Youth choir and the Chicago Lithuanian Socialist Men's choir. The last choir was the best, and some of the singers were very good. This choir sang seven songs and received great applause from the audience.</p>
   <p>After the performance there was a rose dance, and the winner received a bouquet of roses. The hall was full of people and they all enjoyed themselves and had a fine time on Easter evening.</p>
