   <p>Wherever the Lithuanians are living they are organizing mutual and benefit societies. Then they complain that the membership of their societies is not increasing, that such societies are in financial distress, etc.</p>
   <p>The main cause of the weakness of our societies is that they care for the mutual benefit only, but nothing about the cultural work among their members. To have a mutual benefit is not enough for the society. A society must have its own library, where not only its members could read books, but other people as well. The society's duty is to educate the people. Only enlightened people will understand the benefit of such a society.</p>
   <p>Some of the Lithuanian societies in Chicago are worrying that their membership is not increasing, that they are in financial distress. They are in bed situation because those societies do not care about educational activity; they have no libraries, and do not care to have one. It is there that weakness of our societies lies, the lack of cultural activity.</p>
