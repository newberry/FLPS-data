<title level="a">PREMIERE OF K. JASUKAITIS' DRAMA, "THE RESURRECTION"</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Jo. Vis-Kas</title></bibl>

   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance presented K. Jasukaitis' "The Resurrection," a drama in five acts and two tableaux, at the C.S.P.S. Hall, on March 10. Jasukaitis wrote this drama in the Russian language, later translated and reworked it into Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>The drama applies to Russian life, not to Lithuanian. The author, apparently imitating the famous dramatists, had attempted to present the people's psychology and philosophy of living. But whether he succeeded in his task is another question. As the play was presented it did not leave any deep impressions. Especially when one adds the tedious monologues and long scene with no kind of life or action. With the exception of the first scene, the others were mere conversations and dialogues. The first scene was very tragic; the second, strange, romantic; the third, very tedious; <pb facs="5423970_2_0495.jpg" n="2"/>the fourth, comical and philosophical; the fifth, full of everything.</p>
   <p>The theme of the play is good, but its development, its fulfillment is weak and incomplete. The individual types are cast off balance and seem impossible, like caricatures.</p>
   <p>The acting of the L.S.S. Dramatic Circle was as good as the strangeness of the characters and the play itself allowed it to be.</p>
   <p>J. Sankunas, J. Prusinskas, J. Buragas, and S. Strazdas acted their parts very well. J. Uktveris, M. Dunduliene, S. Varasauskiute and the others were also good. The actors tried as hard as they could and as best as they understood. It must be admitted, such scenes as the love scenes of "Nilova" with "Bordina" and "Polezajeva" with "Bobrovskaja" were enacted with diligence, though they were the most difficult. True, one could not identify Varasauskiute's elocution as that of the character she played, but as the elocution of one of our typical declaimers who, with the same intonation, speaks of the roaring of the cannons and the sweetness of a kiss.</p>
