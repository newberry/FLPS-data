   <p>For the first time, I visited the Aurora institution, at 46th and Wood Streets. I had heard much about this establishment, but I had never seen it; hence I decided to visit it. My visit gave me a good impression of this institution.</p>
   <p>The room is large and airy. The library shelves are crowded with various books. All Lithuanian newspapers, published in America and in Europe, are here. ...Polish newspapers are also included. Periodicals and several American journals of a high standard are here. The building is very clean and orderly. Several men and girls were studying in the schoolroom. Mr. A. Lalis teaches them to read and write; others study the English language.</p>
   <p>This is a chamber of light, in this dark Lithuanian colony. But how many Lithuanians take advantage of this place?</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1339.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After a short conversation with Mr. Lalis, I found out that, in the beginning, the Lithuanians looked upon this establishment with disfavor because one young Lithuanian in this district had denounced it. But now, more and more, people are coming to the library.....</p>
   <p>I then inquired, "How can this library exist, when the people use the books and literature--free."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lalis answered that it is very hard for such a center of culture to exist; that to make ends meet they arrange concerts, dramas, etc., and if there is any profit, it goes toward the upkeep of the Aurora Library.....The school covers its expenses by the students' fees.....</p>
   <p>It is to this place we send our future intelligentsia. Many of our societies talk about culture and the enlightenment of our brothers, but their talk remains in the minutes of their meetings. While the Aurora Society struggles for its <pb facs="5423970_2_1340.jpg" n="3"/>existence, helping the poor Lithuanian students, those societies that make so much noise about culture do not come to the aid of this great Lithuanian institution, the Aurora School and Library.</p>
