   <p>The Temperance Society held a meeting in Town of Lake last Sunday. A three-act play, "On the Brink of an Abyss", was presented.</p>
   <p>The acting was not very good. Some of the actors did a poor job of learning their roles. Though it was apparent that some of the actors were capable of playing their roles well, their failure to learn their lines hampered them. It was evident that little preparation had been made, because some of the actors kept coming and going through the wrong doors. However, there were a few who acted well. P. Virbickis and V. Pauksta were very good. J. Vaicis played his role well. Kazmauskas and Miss A.J. Runsas were adequate. Some criticism could also be made of the decorations.</p>
   <p>The program was greatly improved by recitations and songs. The chorus was directed by V. Dauksa. There was dancing after the program.</p>
