   <p>The Biruta Singing and Dramatic Society successfully staged "Blinda" (The name of a Lithuanian Robin Hood, who actually lived in Lithuania early in the nineteenth century), a four-act melodrama, on May 2, at the West Side Auditorium, corner of Taylor Street and Center Avenue. This drama was written by Zemkalnis and is the largest and most popular Lithuanian theatrical play in America. The performance was under the direction of Bronius Vargsas, celebrated Lithuanian actor and playwright. The most distinguished Lithuanian theatrical artists of Chicago composed an all-star cast of players. It was the greatest stage performance the Lithuanians of Chicago ever witnessed.</p>
   <p>Although the performance was excellent, and most players acted like professionals, <pb facs="5423970_2_0570.jpg" n="2"/>nevertheless, there were some weak points. Some players did not act natural at all times. For example, "Ursula" laughed and smiled when she was being united in wedlock with the bandit "Blinda." A marriage ceremony is a solemn occasion, during which laughter is out of order.</p>
   <p>The appearance and performance of the "Jew," "Gypsy," and "Priest" were very natural. It is advisable for our artists to appear on the stage more often; then in a short time we will have a very good theatrical troupe.</p>
   <p>A high grade musical program entertained the audience during the intermission periods. Miss M. Horodeckis and Miss M. Jaksevicius, the best Lithuanian vocal artists in Chicago, sang a duet. The Biruta choral group sang a number of beautiful Lithuanian songs.</p>
