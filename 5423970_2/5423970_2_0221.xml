   <p>Chicago Lithuanians have not forgotten Bruno Vargsas (Laucevicius), whose long illness, which started six months ago, has made his family destitute. Through the efforts of the Biruta Society a total of seventy-five dollars was collected for the relief of the family. Mr. B. Vaitekunas and Dr. K. Drangelis composed the committee which collected the money. The money has been given to Mr. Vargsas.</p>
   <p>The state of Mr. Vargsas' health is now very bad. He has had two operations, but without any favorable results. On Wednesday of this week he was removed from his home to St. Bernard Hospital for a third operation. His life depends upon the result of this operation. Physicians are divided in regard to the exact nature of his illness.</p>
   <p>Bruno Vargsas is the author of a long string of dramatic works. Some of the <pb facs="5423970_2_0222.jpg" n="2"/>more popular plays that were written by him are as follows:</p>
   <p>"Pirmi Zingsniai" (First Steps), "Saliamono Sapnas" (Solomon's Dream), "Jono Sirdis" (John's Heart), "Paskutine Banga" (The Last Wave), "Milijonai Vandeny" (Millions in Water), "Zmones" (People), "Lizdas Naminio Liuto" (Den of a Domestic Lion), "Penktas Prisaky Mas" (The Fifth Commandment), "Gadynes zaizdos" (Wounds of the Era), "Svetimas Dievas" (A Strange God), and many others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vargsas was the editor of the theatrical magazine Veidrodis (The Mirror), and the director of the Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist League. Until he became ill he was the dramatic director of the Biruta Society. He is also a good art painter and sculptor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vargsas emigrated to America from Lithuania about ten years ago. He was born in Lithuania in the village of Kelme, county of Raseiniai, and state of Kaunas. He is now twenty-eight years old.</p>
