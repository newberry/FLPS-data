   <p>The Truth Loving National Society held its first meeting June 24, 1897 at 749 West 22nd Street. John Chmeliauskas explained the aim of the society at the meeting. After a brief discussion it was decided to organize a national independent society, named the Lithuanian National Society of Truth Lovers. The first president was Alexandra Byanskas, the secretary, John Chmeliauskas. Seventeen members joined the society at the first meeting. The income of the first meeting was $6.25.</p>
   <p>The Society's Aim</p>
   <p>1. The Truth Loving Society had for its aim--to help her members in time of sickness and in case of poverty and to have brotherly love toward each other.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1616.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. The Society, to the best of its ability, will try to give national parades and celebrate the more important Lithuanian national holidays; give national shows, etc.</p>
   <p>3. All the Society's doings, both oral and written, must be done in the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>Dues</p>
   <p>Each member of the Society pays 25c a month in the sick benefit fund, and at the beginning of a year each member pays $3.00 for the death fund. If it happens that there isn't enough money in the death fund, then each member is proportionally assessed to get the required amount for the death fund.</p>
   <p>Benefit in Sickness and Death</p>
   <p>Every member having been in the Society six months and having fully paid his dues, will in time of sickness receive $5.00 a week for twelve weeks, but not until fourteen days after his illness.
