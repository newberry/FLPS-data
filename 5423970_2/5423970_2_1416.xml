   <p>Last week, which was "Insurance Week," Lodge No. 36 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America sponsored three lectures, which were delivered in Milda Hall, 3140 South Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>The first lecture, "Health and How to Keep It", was delivered on October 23 by Dr. J. Jonikaitis. It was a highly instructive lecture. The next lecture was delivered on the following day by Attorney F. P. Bradchulis. He spoke on the historical background of "Lithuanians in America," and explained how the Lithuanian Alliance of America was organized. The final lecture was delivered by Mr. C. Kasputis. He spoke on two different subjects--a general review of the history of Lithuania, especially the ill-fated union of Lithuania and Poland, and the history of the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>The public was greatly pleased with the lectures. Lodge No. 36 of the Alliance deserves a word of thanks for sponsoring such useful and instructive lectures. It is to be regretted, however, that more people did not attend the lectures.</p>

   <p>Apparently, many of our people still like saloons and cards better than educational lectures.</p>
   <p>A musical program was given in connection with each lecture. The music was rendered by the Sarpalius brothers, the Bigelis brothers, and by Mrs. Sutkauskas, who sang. The audience was greatly pleased with the entertainment.</p>
