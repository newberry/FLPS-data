   <p>p.3.... The Music and Dramatic Society of Independent Young Lithuanians elected new officers when it met at Auburn Ave. and 33rd Pl., Jan. 13th.</p>
   <p>A detailed report was read to the members on last year's activities of the society. The aims of the society were reiterated. In the main, the society aims to promote lofty ideals among the members and Lithuanians in general, especially through the medium of good music and dramatic productions. The society also renders moral support to socialist and other working class organizations.</p>
   <p>The newly elected officers declared that they would strive to continue and promote the present policies of the society.</p>
   <p>Plans were made and discussed for the presentation of a three act drama entitled "Kova" (The struggle) on Feb. 7, at Meldasiz Hall.</p>
