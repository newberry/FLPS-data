   <p>The newly organized Lithuanian Alliance of America Lodge, which is composed only of women and girls, held its second regular meeting last Wednesday evening, March 3, at the Fellowship House, 831 West 33rd Place. This is the first one hundred percent feminine Lithuanian Alliance of America Lodge in the United States. The first meeting of the Lodge took place on February 17. Regular meetings will now be held every other Wednesday afternoon at the Fellowship House. The Lodge was organized by the efforts of Mrs. Zimontas, Mrs. Damijonaitis, and Miss Lebeckas. The Lodge is progressing very nicely and already has more than twenty members.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Lodge are: Mrs. J. Zimontas, president; Mrs. M. Damijonaitis, vice-president; Mrs. Kiras, treasurer; Miss Lebeckas, financial and recording secretary; Dr. Susanna Slakis, medical adviser.</p>
   <p>The Lodge gave a social affair during the process of organization. Another social is now being planned for the near future. Members of the Lodge appear to be very energetic. Good Luck!</p>
