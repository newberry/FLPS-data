   <p>The twenty-second and thirty-seventh branches of the Lithuanian Socialist League presented their third annual Christmas entertainment on the evening of December 25, at the Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and South Oakley Avenue. It appears that the quality of the program was not as good as that of the previous entertainments of the League.</p>
   <p>The most interesting part of the program was the presentation of the comedy "Zydas Statineje" (A Jew In A Barrel).</p>
   <p>The balance of the program consisted of speeches, songs, and a monologue entitled "Motina" (Mother). One of the speakers referred to the Reverend Schmidt scandal (in Poland).</p>
   <p>The audience appeared to be especially pleased with the songs, including the French "Marseillaise," which were sung by the chorus of the eighty-first branch <pb facs="5423970_2_0396.jpg" n="2"/>of the Lithuanian Socialist League. The monologue was very effectively delivered.</p>
   <p>A capacity crowd attended the entertainment. It was observed that quite a number of people were unable to find seats and had to stand.</p>
