   <p>The directors of the Chicago Public Library inaugurated a new foreign-language section last Monday night. It is true there were books in foreign languages in the Library before, but they were not arranged in a separate section. Many of the languages were poorly represented. For instance, it was difficult to find anything in the Lithuanian section besides the dictionary published by the Lietuva--and only one part of that. Now, all books in foreign languages will be placed in a special department on the fourth floor of the Library. The books will be on open shelves, so that visitors will be able to help themselves and will not have to call upon the attendant as heretofore. The new section will be made up of twenty-five thousand volumes of the best literature in seventeen languages. It is believed that the section will be equipped and open to the public within a few months. The supervisors of the section will be persons who speak several languages. This should prove a <pb facs="5423970_2_0765.jpg" n="2"/>help to those who do not speak English.</p>
   <p>This opportunity must be taken to emphasize the fact that we ourselves--the Lithuanians of Chicago--are to blame for the inadequacy of the Lithuanian section. The Library procures such books as are demanded by the Library visitors. Since no one demands Lithuanian books, that section is neglected. If, with sixty thousand Lithuanians in Chicago, our language does not occupy a worthy place in the public library, we have only ourselves to blame.</p>
