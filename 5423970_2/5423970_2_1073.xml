   <p>The problem raised by Dr. J. Szliupas that all the oppressed nations should publish a newspaper in one international language explaining the harm done by the oppressors, has been replied by a few more newspapers on this question. The newspaper Ateitis is against such a project. As the (criticism of the) Ateitis is not based on historical and logical grounds, we will pay no attention to such criticism.</p>
   <p>Regarding Dr. J. Szliupas' motives, Mr. T. Siemiradzki, in the Polish newspaper America, states that the big nations have very little interest in the affairs of the oppressed nations; that by not having good writers it will be very hard for the oppressed nations to publish a newspaper in the international language. The big nations would not take interest nor would they consider such a problem.</p>
   <p>In America we lack powerful writers among the Lithuanians, the Poles, <pb facs="5423970_2_1074.jpg" n="2"/>the Russians and the Slavonians, but we must not forget that powerful and famous writers appear only by working hard. By not working it is impossible to develop into powerful writers.</p>
   <p>Let us take into consideration the Finns. When they started their publicity about the Russian oppression, the other nations became interested and are even discussing the Finnish national affairs at present.</p>
   <p>Even though such an international publication would not free the oppressed nations, this idea would be widely spread through publicity, and it would be a step towards reality.</p>
   <p>The Russian government is afraid of the oppressed nations. The tsar starred a merciless persecution of Lithuanians, Russians, Germans and Latvians.</p>
   <p>Many more of the Polish newspapers joined this project brought by <pb facs="5423970_2_1075.jpg" n="3"/>Dr. Szliupas. In the last issue, the Zgoda urged all the Polish societies to call meetings, in order to discuss this problem. The Russian newspaper Swoboda is calling a Russian convention on January 2, at Jersey City, N. J. It is the duty of the Lithuanian organizations to take this matter into consideration. In Europe neither the Lithuanian nor the Polish newspapers took up the question in open discussion.</p>
   <p>We must not forget that not all of the newspapers in Europe can freely discuss this problem.</p>
   <p>The Polish "Zwiazek" supports Dr. Szliupas' project and has elected a committee of the following men: F. H. Jablonski, M. Sleczynski and Dr. Zuraneski, to take this problem into consideration and to get in touch with other organizations. What will come of this we will see later.</p>
