   <p>We Lithuanians must always be on the watch for opportunities in life; otherwise we cannot attain much. We have made a great step forward since the liberation of the Lithuanian press, but we have much farther to go in order to catch up with the progressive nations, especially in commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>Several decades ago very few of us engaged in commerce in Lithuania; we left that to people of other nationalities. We busied ourselves with plowing the soil. This occupation, it is apparent, is very appropriate to the peaceful nature and honest conscience of the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Though they remained true Lithuanians in spirit from the beginning to the end, many of our more enlightened brothers were forced, by various circumstances of life, to lose their identity as Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Having been reared in the spirit of the small towns and farms, we were forced <pb facs="5423970_2_0876.jpg" n="2"/>to adopt strange ways to make a livelihood after we came to America. Farming conditions here were altogether different. Moreover, we were swayed by the conveniences and the variety in the cities. It is very difficult for a peaceful farmer to live in a crowded city, among strangers who speak a strange language. It takes a long time to become accustomed to the new conditions of life and to realize how one can make his living under seemingly unfavorable conditions.</p>
   <p>On all sides we saw commerce, industry and trades, all of which were strange to us. First of all we had to acquaint ourselves with everything. Only then could we begin to do something ourselves. An old proverb says, "The beginning hinders the work." We can agree with that, for all of us have had to live through many hardships during our first days in America.</p>
   <p>After we had been here a while, things began to get better; some of us went into business and others entered the professions. We accomplished this by our own <pb facs="5423970_2_0877.jpg" n="3"/>individual, unorganized efforts. We have not yet become organized to do something more important.</p>
   <p>Here and there we have founded co-operative stores--little ones-- but they have seldom survived and those which have survived are not prospering.</p>
   <p>The industrialists of America watch carefully the progress of everyday life and manufacture quickly what the people demand. They do this by organized effort.</p>
   <p>What is most important and necessary for the Lithuanians of America today? During fifty years we had no press. We did not have the opportunity to learn to read in the old country. The majority of us learned only after coming to America, for here the schools are open day and night.</p>
   <p>We are now living through a most interesting period of the world's history. We must have news every day; daily newspapers are needed. A large number of our <pb facs="5423970_2_0878.jpg" n="4"/>fellow nationals know no other language than Lithuanian. Considering the number of Lithuanians in America, we should have tens of Lithuanian daily papers.</p>
   <p>The newspaper Lietuva, which has been published as a weekly until this time, will soon become a daily.</p>
   <p>Noticing the demands of the Lithuanians, we see a broad field for this paper. A clean, noble daily newspaper is required by the Lithuanians of America.</p>
   <p>By organizing our efforts, let us accomplish that without which the Lithuanians can no longer continue. Let us buy shares in the daily newspaper.</p>
   <p>For full information, write to the Lietuva Daily Committee, 814 W. 33rd Street, Chicago.</p>
