  <body>
   <p>The editor and the traitor of Lietuva were arrested February 3, 1899, by a deputy sheriff and taken to the county jail. The following day both prisoners put up a $2,000 bond and were released at 11 A. M. from the county jail until trial. The reverend rector of St. George Lithuanian parish was compelled to do that for the benefit of the people in the community, according to the wishes of the Lithuanian Catholics in Chicago. Even though the rector felt sorry, yet he had to make a complaint against these people for lies and slander in their paper, Lietuva, against our holy church and Reverend Father.</p>
   <p>The reverend rector suffered enough from slander in Lietuva against him for half a year; he finally lost his patience and decided to seek justice in civil court. Even the priests from other colonies began to send protests through Catholic papers to our rector, during that scandal in Lietuva, and requesting him to give account of his parish. Father Krauciunas, of St. George's parish, Chicago, Illinois, promised to other priests to give account of his work after the trial which is pending now in civil court in Chicago.</p>
