   <p>A concert was given by the teachers of the Beethoven Conservatory of Music last Sunday, March 7, at the St. George's [Lithuanian] Parish Hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. Those who participated in the program were: Mr. A. A. Aleksandravicius, Mr. P. Bartkevicius, Mrs. Ona Pocius, Mr. J. Jakaitis, and Mr. Anthony Pocius, who is the director of the Conservatory.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Aleksandravicius played the following numbers on the piano: "Nocturne," by Liszt; "Oi Eisim, Mes Cia Nebusim" (We Will Go, Go, And Not Stay Here); and "Concert Waltz in E Flat," by Fieldhouse. He displayed a lack of smoothness in some parts, but on the whole was very good.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bartkevicius, who played a few numbers on the clarinet, displayed good technique and tone. Mrs. Pocius demonstrated her usual talent as a singer. Mr. Jakaitis sang "Bezode Daina" (Song Without Words), and was called back by the audience for an encore. The technique of Mr. Pocius, who is an accomplished <pb facs="5423970_2_0142.jpg" n="2"/>pianist, was as usual very good. The concert ended with the singing of "Ave Maria" by the Bach-Gounod Trio.</p>
   <p>Besides the musical program, a lecture on the subject "The Cultural Aspects of Music" was delivered by Mr. J. A. Chmieliauskas, who is a member of the editorial staff of Lietuva. Generally speaking, the concert was a success, and in quality stands out above all our so-called "concerts". The attendance was not large.</p>
