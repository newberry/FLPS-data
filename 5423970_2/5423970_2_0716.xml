<title level="a">INTRIGUES IN THE SIMONAS DAUKANTAS SOCIETY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Rev. M. Krawczunas having personal animosity against the publisher of Lietuva, Mr. A. Olszewski, because he blames the former for keeping up the Polish school in the Lithuanian parish and for the deficit in the parish budget, is trying to expel Mr. Olszewski from the society.</p>
   <p>The readers have read in the last issue of Lietuva the complaint against Olszewski, written by Rev. Krawczunas to the Simonas Daukantas and St. Casimir societies. The complaint of Rev. Krawczunas was rejected by both societies. Now the priest is trying another intrigue to expel Olszewski from those societies. The priest hired three of his ignorant followers, who are members of Simonas Daukantas Society, and sent them to get the signatures of members to call an extra meeting, These three members obtained six signatures, and the other six names the priest signed himself. Now then, according to the by-laws of the society, ten members can call the extra meeting, so the meeting was called on Sunday, Dec. 11 to expel Olszewski from the society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0717.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The administration of the society foresaw the intrigue of the priest, who provoked a disturbance and a fight at a national celebration in the past, so they thought the priest and his thugs might start a fight at this meeting too, so the administration brought police to the meeting. When the president called the meeting to order, the priest asked what the meeting was called for. Some of those present said that they knew nothing, while others said that they never signed their names, that their signatures were forged. When Rev. Krawczunas saw that the meeting would be dissolved as illegal, he pulled from his pocket the charter and shouted: "I am the master here." At once the priest jumped behind the table, and tried to expel the administration. The priest's followers at once joined the commotion, started to swear and shout, so that it was impossible to understand what was said. The police were watching that there should be no fight. So the meeting was closed.</p>
   <p>All left the hall, except the priest, who with few of his followers remained in the hall. Behind closed doors, the priest held his own meeting, elected a new administration, and told his ignorant followers <pb facs="5423970_2_0718.jpg" n="3"/>that he would take away from the society the books, budget, and the charter, and those who are against him would be kicked out of the society.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we, the administration of the Simonas Daukantas Society, are standing for justice and for the good of our society, which as a national and scientific name, are protesting against such shameless conduct of the Rev. Krawczunas. We are asking the priest to stop intriguing in the societies, and spreading hatred among Lithuanians. Instead of inducing hate among the Lithuanians, the priest would act more prudently if he expelled the Polish nuns from the Lithuanian school, quit feeding them with Lithuanian money and watch the altar, from which you have exhorted us since you came from Russia.</p>
   <p>The Administration of Simonas Daukantas Society.</p>
