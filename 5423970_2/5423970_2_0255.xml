   <p>Last Sunday afternoon and evening, May 13, the Knights of Lithuania Chorus gave a concert at the fieldhouse of Mark White Square, 29th and Halsted Streets. Every seat and every bit of standing room were occupied by the large crowd that attended. Many people were turned away at the door because of lack of room in the hall.</p>
   <p>The director of the concert was Anthony S. Pocius, well-known Chicago Lithuanian musical artist. The Chorus is a highly finished group, and for that reason the audience was greatly pleased with the concert.</p>
   <p>The concert began at 4 P. M. with the Chorus singing "Lietuva Tevyne Musu" (Lithuania Our Fatherland), the Lithuanian national anthem. Then followed a duet, "Da Pacem Domine," by Ona Pocius and M. Janusauskas; they received tremendous applause. Another feature of the program was a song from "Lucia," <pb facs="5423970_2_0256.jpg" n="2"/>sung by a sextet composed of Mrs. Ona Pocius, Mrs. M. Janusauskas, Mr. J. Kudirka, Mr. J. Balsis, Mr. A. Pocius, and Mr. Kazanauskas.</p>
