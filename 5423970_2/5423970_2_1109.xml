   <p>We are hereby announcing to all of our readers of Lietuva that the beginning of any business takes lots of money and effort. I issued seven numbers of this paper at my own expense, and I do not mean to stop publishing it. I will go on with the help of God.</p>
   <p>The subscription of Lietuva is only two dollars per year. I ask all readers to renew their subscriptions and do their best to get new subscribers.</p>
   <p>I am sorry to say that many Lithuanians do not even know the meaning of a newspaper. I, myself, asked many people to subscribe to the newspaper. The answer was that they don't know what I meant by a newspaper.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of our readers to explain to our brothers in literary darkness what benefit they will get by reading such a good newspaper as Lietuva. Our aim is to make this newspaper Lietuva one of the greatest Lithuanian newspapers in America. And this is possible to accomplish by the help of our brother Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>We are asking our readers to renew their subscription, and we will go on as we did, with our publication of Lietuva.</p>
   <p>Editor.</p>
