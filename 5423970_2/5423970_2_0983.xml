   <p>The storm in Europe is really unusually violent. One can see that, even in Chicago. The European war has made changes which have never been seen before in a whole line of Lithuanian newspapers published in Chicago.</p>
   <p>For many years, a Lithuanian daily newspaper in America was promised; first in one place, then in another. But all those promises used to remain only promises. When the war started in Europe, the Lietuva, in order to give the public the latest news from the boiling whirlpool, began to publish a daily supplement which carries the latest news from the battlefields. A short time later, two Chicago weeklies, the Katalikas and the Naujienos became dailies. In this manner we [now] have three newspapers published in Chicago daily: Lietuva-Supplement, Katalikas, and Naujienos. The Lietuva, besides its daily supplement, will be published each week as hitherto. The Katalikas has formally cancelled its weekly newspaper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0984.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>How many dailies will come into existence among the Lithuanians in the East and in general, we are not informed.</p>
