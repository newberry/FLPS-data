  <body>
   <p>Comrades, the Communist Party has ordered the establishment of schools of learning for all party members. The propaganda committees of all sections of the party have been entrusted with the responsibility of organizing, establishing, and conducting these Schools. All foreign language groups in the party, such as the Lithuanian section, should have schools in the languages which they understand best.</p>
   <p>Classes are to be held at least twice each month.</p>
   <p>The study and learning of the principles of class struggle has been going too slowly among our Lithuanian people. In some colonies Lithuanian workers refuse to get interested in such matters, in other colonies there is a lack of sufficiently educated comrades to act as instructors.</p>
   <p>A good knowledge of the principles and problems of the Communist Party and the entire labor movement is essential to every class-conscious worker.</p>
   <p>Such an education also makes it possible for us to answer intelligently and successfully the attacks and slurs of our enemies.</p>
