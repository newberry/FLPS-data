   <p>On the 29th day of July the Lithuanians of this vicinity held their meeting for the purpose of organizing a branch of the Lithuanian corporation, "Star", with its main store at 4605-4607 South Ashland Avenue. The meeting was larger than any ever held by Lithuanians of this neighborhood before.</p>
   <p>Dr. Graiciunas, brothers Algmanavicius and others, and also some of the leaders of the "Star" corporation spoke. They spoke about the material and moral livelihood of the Lithuanians and how to improve living conditions. Dr. Graiciunas delivered a very influential speech. He said Lithuanians must join together in order to accomplish good results for ourselves.</p>
   <p>"I am very much pleased to see the Lithuanians taking part in the commercial development among themselves" he said. Adam Algmanavicius and his brother, said that in this country, we, the Lithuanians have the same rights and business opportunities as people of any other nationality. We Lithuanians <pb facs="5423970_2_0096.jpg" n="2"/>are just as able to conduct business as any other people.</p>
   <p>This meeting did not forget our brothers in Lithuania, where they are fighting against the despotism of the Russian Czar. Dr. Graiciunas asked for a collection and $2.64 was collected. The money was sent to the treasurer of the American Lithuanians Revolutionary Fund.</p>
