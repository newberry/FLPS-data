<title level="a">LITHUANIAN WORKERS' SOCIETY</title><title level="a" type="sub">by K. J. Milauskas</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>As we know, many Lithuanians live on the West Side of Chicago. Usually Lithuanian workers are employed by tailoring shops, but here there are also Lithuanian craftsmen and businessmen. Many Lithuanians have various stores and saloons. There are many Lithuanian societies, national as well as religious. They have their own parish: St. Michael's Parish. There is also a women's society. All the societies, as well as the individual Lithuanians, live in harmony and work in common for their own benefit.</p>
   <p>The more prominent Lithuanians recently organized a society here called: "The Lithuanian Workers' Society of America." All Lithuanian workers should turn their attention to the Society for it is accessible to all and is supported by profitable stipulations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1715.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In it are found the following four classes: if a member pays twenty-five cents a month, he will receive a sick benefit of five dollars a week; if he pays fifty cents a month, he will receive a sick benefit of $10 a week; if he pays seventy-five cents, he will receive $15; if he pays one dollar, he will receive $20 weekly. In addition to this, each member pays two dollars a year, from which payments, death benefits of $200 will be paid to each member. After twenty years of membership in the Society, the payments will no longer be required. There are no additional payments to be made other than those mentioned above. Every Lithuanian worker, between the ages of sixteen and forty, is eligible for membership in the Society. It is understood that health is a prerequisite.</p>
   <p>Meetings are held on the first Sunday of each month at the St. Michael Parish Hall, 1644 Waubansia Avenue.</p>
