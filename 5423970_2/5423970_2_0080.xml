  <body>
   <p>Lithuanians live in the following western suburbs of Chicago: Maywood, Melrose Park, and Bellwood. In these three colonies, there is a total of two Lithuanian organizations and eleven Lithuanian business establishments.</p>
   <p>The largest number of Lithuanians live in the Melrose Park colony. In this colony, there are nine Lithuanian business establishments: Three food stores, operated by F. Petrowicz, J. Liubecki and Vaiszvils, and Kvederas; one hardware store, conducted by J. Stefankiewicz; one dairy store, managed by J. Januska; one real estate and steamship agency, operated by Golubicki; and three saloons; managed by F. Lepinskis and Jasiulis, J. Stefankiewicz, and Anthony Prabich.</p>
   <p>In the Bellwood colony, there are two Lithuanian saloons, operated by F. Lovre, and Stipeiko and Rajunis.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0081.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The two Lithuanian organizations of these colonies are located in Melrose Park. Their names are : Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania Society, a mutual aid society, and The Lithuanian Club. The Algirdas society was organized in 1903. It has about one hundred fifty members and about $1500 in its treasury. The Lithuanian Club has about twenty members, and about $100 in its treasury.</p>
   <p>The first Lithuanian business establishment in this locality was a saloon. It was opened in 1901, and is still in existence, being operated by the original owners, F. Lepinskis and Jasiulis.</p>
   <p>In Melrose Park, there are about twenty Lithuanian property owners; in Bellwood, there are about five.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that there are from four to five hundred Lithuanians living in these colonies. They attend the Irish Roman Catholic church, as there is no Lithuanian parishes here.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0082.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Reverend N. Lukosius, a Lithuanian priest from the North Side Chicago Lithuanian colony, comes here during the Easter season to administer to the religious needs of the Lithuanian Catholics.</p>
   <p>All Lithuanian workers who live in this area are employed in the following factories: Latrobe Steel and Coupler Company, American Can Company, where a number of Lithuanian girls also are employed; Featherstone Foundry and Machine Company, Charles W. Shonk Company, lithographers, where a number of Lithuanian girls are employed.</p>
   <p>The earnings of the workers range from $1.50 to $3 per day. Most of the workers work ten hours a day.</p>
   <p>In Melrose Park, the Lithuanians live on 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Avenues. This village begins at 9th Avenue and runs west up to the Northwestern railroad tracks. Bellwood starts at 23rd Avenue and runs west. Maywood starts at 9th Avenue and runs north.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0083.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The distance from the Chicago loop to Melrose Park is about twelve miles. Madison Street cars run from the Chicago loop to Melrose Park, Bellwood and Maywood.</p>
   <p>During the national unemployment crisis, the Latrobe Steel and Coupler Company was idle for eighteen months. That greatly reduced the Lithuanian population in this area. The factory resumed operations again about two months ago. More workers are being hired, and the jobs are very good.</p>
   <p>The air in these Lithuanian colonies is free from smoke and bad odors, and is very healthy; the area is filled with beautiful trees and shrubbery. For these reasons, Lithuanian who can find jobs here will enjoy the ideal living conditions.</p>
