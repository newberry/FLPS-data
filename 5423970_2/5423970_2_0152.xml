  <body>
   <p>The musical concert of Mikas Petrauskas and the Biruta Singing and Dramatic Society, which was held on Sunday evening, October 3, at Music Hall, 203 Michigan Boulevard (Fine Arts Building), was a great success. More people attended this concert than attended the first concert of Petrauskas. All the seats in the hall were occupied.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily News, in the October 2 issue, advertised it as the first Lithuanian concert in Chicago. However, that is not true, because the first Lithuanian concert in Chicago took place in the year 1907.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to repeat the program here, because it was printed in full in the September 24 issue of Lietuva (Lithuania). However, in addition to the songs listed on the program, Mr. Petrauskas sang: "Rusti Mergele" (Insolent Lady); "Laukiu, Kolei Man Paliepsi" (I Will Wait Until You Tell Me); and "Pauksteliai Ciulba" (The Birds Are Chirping). The Biruta Chorus sang the following song, in addition to those listed on <pb facs="5423970_2_0153.jpg" n="2"/>the program: "Noriu Miego" (I Want To Sleep).</p>
   <p>Mr. Petrauskas sang a total of eighteen songs; eleven of these were in Lithuanian, two in Italian, and one each. in French, Russian, German, Polish, and English. The most successful songs were: "Pasakyk, Lietuva, Mylimoji" (Tell Me, Lithuania, My Love); "Rusti Mergele"; "Ditiatko" (Not Enough), a Russian, "Lauksiu, Kolei Paliepsi"; "Jojau Diena, Jojau Nakti" (I Rode--A Horse--In the Day Time, I Rode in the Night Time); and "Pauksteliai Ciulba." The audience was mostly pleased with "Rusti Mergele," and "Jojau Diena, Jojau Nakti," which amused everyone and received much applause and shouts for encores.</p>
   <p>Anthony Pocius accompanied on the piano. He also played a solo, Mendelssohn's "Concerto in G Minor," and two shorter pieces by Schumann and Chaminade.</p>
   <p>The following Lithuanian vocalists: Dauksa, Strumskis, Janusauskas, and Limontas, sang Petrauskas' quartet, "Gamta Grazi" (Nature Is Beautiful).</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_0154.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Biruta Chorus sang a total of five songs.</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the program, members of the Biruta Chorus presented Mr. Petrauskas with a wreath of flowers in the shape of a lyre.</p>
   <p>It was announced in the program that in the near future a concert will be given by the music students of Mr. Petrauskas.</p>
