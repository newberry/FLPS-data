   <p>The central bureau of the Lithuanian-American Proletarian Art League is now perfecting plans to sponsor schools with classes in proletarian art and literature. Efforts will be made to organize such schools in as many Lithuanian colonies as will be possible.</p>
   <p>The study of art is not as hard as it seems. All that is needed is ambition, a little natural talent, and some time for practice <pb facs="5423970_2_1271.jpg" n="2"/>and theoretical study. The proposed schools will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of proletarian artists among our people. There is a great need for proletarian artists among our people, and it is hoped that a reasonable amount of interest will be shown in the proposed schools.</p>
   <p>The study of art goes hand in hand with the study of literature. For that reason it is necessary to study both subjects at the same time. The following plan of study is suggested for the proposed schools:</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1272.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>1. Study of the Lithuanian and English languages: Grammer, syntax, and rhetoric.</p>
   <p>2. Study of art: What constitutes art; the different classes of art; bourgeois and proletarian art; proletarian artists and bourgeois art and bourgeois artists.</p>
   <p>3. What is the theatre, and what is its significance in the life of the people?</p>
   <p>4. The study of literature: Literature in general and its significance; art-literature and its classes; poetry and the rules governing its composition; belles-lettres; prose and its composition; <pb facs="5423970_2_1273.jpg" n="4"/>the Lithuanian "Daina" (peasant folk-lore), and its significance; the significance of drama and music.</p>
   <p>The above are elementary, but very important subjects to be thoroughly understood by every proletarian artists. Every subject mentioned above must be repeatedly analyzed, discussed and studied separately until it is clearly understood by every member of the class.</p>
   <p>The following books, which are available in the Lithuanian language, can be used as some of the textbooks in the proposed schools:</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1274.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>History of Western Europe; Proletarian Poetry; The Works of Janonis; The Torch; and King Coal.</p>
   <p>The central bureau of the league will be glad to cooperate with any branch in organizing the proposed schools. These schools can be started with any number of students. They should be organized and conducted on the same lines as the present schools of the Lithuanian section of the American Labor (Communist) Party.</p>
