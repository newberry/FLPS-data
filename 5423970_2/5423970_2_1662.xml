   <p>On Saturday, April 15, the Famous Name of Lithuania Young Ladies' Society [a mutual aid benefit society for single Lithuanian ladies] staged a five-act drama entitled "Dumblyne" (Mud Puddle). The presentation was a success in every respect except that some of the players showed a lack of experience on the stage. The following members of the cast performed their parts exceptionally well Mr. A. Venckevicius as "Mr. Bagrevicius," Miss L. Petrauskas as "Ona," and Mr. M. Jasinskis as "Antanukas".</p>
   <p>After the staging of the drama, Misses M. Visciulis and A. Visciulis sang a few songs. It appeared that their singing pleased the audience the most. They gave several encores, and received bouquets of flowers. Miss L. Petrauskas, who took part in the play, also received a bouquet of flowers. The program ended with several declamations and recitations.</p>
