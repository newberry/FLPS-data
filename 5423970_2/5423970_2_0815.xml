   <p>This is an easy contest, and it is open to all young people of Lithuanian descent who have never been in Lithuania. Does not that make almost all of us eligible? Even the editor? From the stories that we have read and the tales that we have heard, we all have some idea of what the country of Lithuania is like. Some have uppermost in mind that it is the land of song and merriment; others think of it as the land of fine steeds or the land of great heroes. We have read or heard again and again of the beauty of its forests and the charm of its farm life.</p>
   <p>Without consulting any books or seeking information from any authorities, just write down your idea of Lithuania. Paint in words the picture that comes to your mind at the mere mention of its name.</p>
   <p>Your account does not have to be absolutely in accordance with facts, for as <pb facs="5423970_2_0816.jpg" n="2"/>you know, this contest is essentially of the imagination. You may write a brief description, or you may give us your idea in story form, or you may even turn to verse and send in a poem.</p>
   <p>It may be as brief as you want, but we require that it shall not exceed five hundred words. When submitting your contest story, you will also please let us know a little about yourself. It is necessary that we have your name in full, your address, your education, and your occupation.</p>
   <p>Begin to write now, and send in your story without delay. The closing date and the judges will be announced in this section in a later issue.</p>
