   <p>On September 28, at Meldazis Hall, the Young Lithuanians National Club of America gave a performance with a large and varied program. This society, whose purpose is to support drama and national affairs, is in the fourth year of its existence. For various reasons, up to the present time, this society has been unable to take an active part in theatrical activities. Not long ago, a dramatic section of this society was organized. The president of this theatrical group is Mr. Juodis and the stage manager is Mr. B. Vaitekunas. In the month of June, a choir was organized, conducted by Mr. M. Girnius. As you can see, the choir is very young. At present, to demand that this new choir do as much as Lithuanian choirs that have been longer in existence, is impossible. Well, let us return to the performance. As has been stated, the program was large and varied and consisted of two parts. The first part was the three-act drama, "The Haunt of the Domestic Lion", by <pb facs="5423970_2_0456.jpg" n="2"/>"Vargsas". This play portrays the bad influence of a drunken father. It shows how the family is ruined, when the head of the family becomes a "domestic lion", who does not care for his family's home life, but only aims to destroy the "nest", the home of his own family. It shows how the bad conduct of a father ruins the life of his own children. Even though this drama is short, consisting of thirty pages, it is very beautiful, and clearly illustrates our daily life. We Lithuanians can learn much from this play.</p>
   <p>As to the performance, it can be said that the audience liked it. When the play was over, the audience approved it with much applause, because the people have seen the effects of drunkenness and have learned how it ruins the family. As for the manner in which the roles were acted, we can say that we cannot expect perfect acting from beginners. We believe that in the future the members of this society will become good actors and will present excellent dramas before the Lithuanian people.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program was a concert. The most important part was the choir of Mr. Girnius. The choir is new, and therefore cannot equal older <pb facs="5423970_2_0457.jpg" n="3"/>Lithuanian choirs of Chicago, but in the long run, Mr. Girnius will have the choir in good standing.</p>
   <p>One part of the concert which was very good, was played by Mr. Bigelis' children: Juozas, eight years old; Karolis, ten years old; and Veronika, twelve years old. Juozas plays the violin and Karolis plays the piano. They are small children, but when they started to play, the people were surprised that such young children could play so well.</p>
   <p>The audience consisted of about seven hundred people. It must be mentioned that the conduct of the people was bad.....In the future the noisemakers at concerts should be quieted. They not only disturb the players, but also the audience who wish to hear the play.</p>
   <p>I have learned that this same society will give another performance on October 12, at Freiheit Turner Hall. The program will consist of speeches, monologues, recitations, songs, etc.</p>
