<title level="a">THE AURORA SOCIETY'S FIRST LECTURE</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>On October 27th at the University of Chicago Settlement hall, 4630 Gross Avenue, was held the first lecture which was arranged by the Aurora Society. The lecture was read by Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas on the subject, "Physiology." There was a moderate number of people, but there could have been more. Our people do not care to attend lectures, because they can get no drinks there.</p>
   <p>The lecture was very interesting. If the people did not understand from reading, they understood when the speaker showed slide pictures, and also from the questions which the doctor explained so clearly that everyone understood, even those who had not heard before of such a thing as physiology.</p>
   <p>The second lecture by the Aurora Society will be given on November 10 in the same hall, the University of Chicago Settlement, 4630 Gross Avenue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1569.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This lecture also will be delivered by Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas on physiology. This will be a continuation of the first lecture. Even if you did not attend the first lecture, attend this one, and you will understand clearly; the doctor will make you understand. The lecture will start at 3:30 P. M.</p>
