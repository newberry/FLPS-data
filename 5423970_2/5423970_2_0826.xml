   <p>We are very pleased to say that the Daily Worker, official organ of the American Labor (Communist) Party is greatly improving. It contains news from the world, news and educational articles, about the American and international labor movement, important political articles, and valuable correspondence from factory workers.</p>
   <p>J. L. Engdahl, editor of the paper, writes: "The main problem of the Daily Worker at present is how to make the paper the mass organ of the American working class. Efforts to achieve that goal are being made hand in hand with efforts to develop the American Labor (Communist) <pb facs="5423970_2_0827.jpg" n="2"/>Party into a party of the American masses."</p>
   <p>Lithuanian-Americans are contribution towards the support of this paper. They should also assist in the present campaign to make the paper the organ of the American masses.</p>
   <p>Many class-conscious Lithuanian workers have children, who shun their parents and the labor movement when they grow up. Such parents should subscribe to the Daily Worker for their children. Instead of wasting their time reading the capitalistic dailies the children would become thoroughly acquainted with the American working class movement. When our young people read only capitalistic publications they cannot help <pb facs="5423970_2_0828.jpg" n="3"/>being ensnared by their influence. The Daily Worker, which is devoted to the interests of the American working class, strives primarily to encourage the workers to take a greater interest in the real problems of their life; it encourages them to unite and struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, and a higher standard of living.</p>
