   <p>It is known that in Chicago there are over 1,200 Lithuanians. Some of them are very poor, but many of them are well to do. Some of the Lithuanians have a few hundred dollars, while few have a few thousand dollars. Few of them keep their money in the bank at 3% interest. Others are keeping their money with some Jew without any interest, just for a safe keeping, others are keeping their money in their trunks.</p>
   <p>Once in a while a good friend breaks into the trunk and runs away with the money.</p>
   <p>The best way to protect our money, where it will bring interest, is to organize a building and loan association, where a man can put his money, get interest, and the money will never be lost.</p>
   <p>For this purpose we are calling a meeting on the 9th day of February at Azukas' hall, where we will discuss the plans how to organize such a loan society. On this meeting we will see how many Lithuanians will take interest in organizing such a society for their own benefit. Committee.</p>
