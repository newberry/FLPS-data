   <p>Last Sunday, in St. George's parish hall, the Biruta Singing and Dramatic Society gave a musical concert and program which was the first public activity of the Society this fall. An unusually large crowd attended.</p>
   <p>Besides the musical program there were orations and the presentation of a monologue. Mr. Frank Butkus, former president of the Society, explained in an address what an important role the Society is playing in the life of our youth. He urged parents to encourage their children to join the Society. It was learned from his talk that the Society is now entering its eighth year of existence. It was originally organized and established by Mikas Petrauskas, famous Lithuanian musical artist and composer. Mr. Anthony Pocius, director of the Biruta Chorus, delivered a talk on the subject of music. Dr. K. Drangelis, the present president of the Society, also spoke. A monologue entitled "Ispanai" (Spaniards) was presented as the final number on the program.</p>
