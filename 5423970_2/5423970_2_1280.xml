   <p>Summary:</p>
   <p>Lithuanian workers, members of the American Workers' Party, have opened their own school. They are supporting it steadily. Marxism and Leninism are taught and a general understanding of labor movements. International labor movement is discussed here also, and current events of the day. All workers should attend this school.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Chicago has proposed a plan to buy the elevated and surface lines from the companies. This plan is made so that such a purchase means very little. Rights are given to the companies until the city pays up. But the sum is so large that it is hard to believe that the city will be able to pay. The Works' Party says that this plan is a good one for the benefit of the capitalist. Even an A. F. L. Committee, on highways made the statement that the plan is a big thief's scheme. Some of the unions, (the unions expecting to get employment in digging a tunnel) agreed to the plan.</p>

   <p>The Labor Defense Council asks help for miners suffering from effects of a great storm. These miners are of southern Illinois, and of Indiana and Missouri, mostly. Send donations to International workers' Aid, 19 S. Lincoln St. Many members of Workers' Party are soliciting donations already.</p>
