   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America, branches of the district of Chicago, will show to the Lithuanians of Chicago such a spectacle as they have never seen before. Up to the present time, there has been a great deal of talking about the various Lithuanian organizations. But very few know what benefit has been derived from them. Therefore, the Lithuanian Alliance, branches of the Chicago district, will present in tableaux what benefit the Lithuanian Alliance of America is giving to the Lithuanian public. It is calculated that the Lithuanian Alliance of America has paid out close to one hundred thousand dollars to widows and orphans, and for other charitable purposes.</p>
   <p>On April 13, at South Side Turner Hall, 31st and State streets, the Lithuanian Alliance, branches of the district of Chicago, will present a comedy "The Golden Calves," for the first time not only in Chicago, but <pb facs="5423970_2_1711.jpg" n="2"/>in America as well. It will show in tableaux the need for organizations. All the Alliance branches--more than ten of them--will have their representatives on that evening, and various committees areworking in earnest to make this program a great one.</p>
   <p>We believe that the program will be one of the greatest and one of the most original spectacles ever seen.</p>
