   <p>p.5................The Lithuanian Daughters of America, a mutual-aid society, held their pre-annual meeting on December 13, at Mark White Square. A large number of members attended. New officers were elected and various important question were discussed.</p>
   <p>Some questions aroused bitter and heated debates, especially the matter of replacing twelve "sleeping" directors with new "live" ones. However, the same board of directors was re-elected after they had promised to show greater activity in the future.</p>
   <p>Among the new officers elected were: Mrs. O. Mazeika, president; Mrs. M. Sniuka, vice-president; Mrs. Krinca, financial secretary; and Mrs. Valancius, treasurer.</p>
   <p>According to a report made at the meeting, a profit of $50.00 was realized from <pb facs="5423970_2_1645.jpg" n="2"/>a masquerade ball, which had been held by the society in the Lithuanian Auditorium on November 25.</p>
   <p>This organization has over one hundred fifty members in good standing. Any Lithuanian working class woman, who is in good health, may join this mutual-aid society.</p>
