<title level="a">THE LITHUANIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY BECOMES A REALITY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday a meeting was held at the Aurora Hall, 3149 South Halsted Street. At this meeting there were the presidents and secretaries of twenty Lithuanian national societies of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was reported that twenty acres of land have been bought at Archer and Kean Avenues. One thousand dollars of earnest money have been deposited, and legal papers are ready. The deal must be completed on or before the New Year. The place is very beautiful and it is easily reached.</p>
   <p>The cemetery, with all its improvements, will cost more than $10,000. All the delegates approved this transaction. Up to the present time, if Lithuanians have not been buried in St. Casmir's Lithuanian Roman Catholic Cemetery, they have been buried in other cemeteries. [It was reported] that in the Waldheim Cemetery more than 700 Lithuanians are buried; in Greenwood Cemetery there are more than 400. They pay from fifteen to one hundred dollars for a grave, and the money goes to strangers, not to Lithuanians.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1717.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The mortgage will be known as the "First Mortgage Gold Bonds," at 3%. The series will be in fifty and one hundred dollar bonds. It will be very easy for individual persons and societies to buy these bonds, because they are secured by the national cemetery land.</p>
   <p>The bonds are sold at the A. Olszewski Bank, J. Bagdziunas Bank, and at the Lithuanian City Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>Two prominent persons, who belong to many Lithuanian national societies, are appointed to sell the bonds. They are: Steponas Markunas and Vaitiekus Sedleckis.</p>
   <p>Many projects among the Chicago Lithuanians have failed, but the project of the Lithuanian National Cemetery has become a reality, and it will continue in existence, because it was laid on a sound foundation.</p>
