  <body>
   <p>The White Rose Lithuanian Athletic Club, of the Town Of Lake district, is making plans to build a clubhouse.</p>
   <p>The Club has purchased a lot at 4605 South Paulina Street on which to erect the clubhouse, and building operations are scheduled to start in the near future. It is planned to erect a two-story brick building, to be used solely by the club.</p>
   <p>The plans for the building were drawn by Mr. Zaldokas, the famous Lithuanian architect. The first floor of the building will contain a bowling alley, billiard room, library and reading room, and a bathhouse. The second floor will contain a hall for meeting purposes and a gymnasium. The cost of erecting and equipping the building will be about ten thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The White Rose Club, which is a mutual aid society for Lithuanian men, was organized in 1908. It has a membership of over two hundred robust young men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1600.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The officers of the Club are: J. Baciunas, president; A. V. Bagdonas, secretary; and A. Sobonkis, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The White Rose Club will be the first Lithuanian organization in Chicago to have its own building.</p>
