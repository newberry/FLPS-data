   <p>A branch of the Lovers of Fatherland Society was organized on Sunday, January 15, on the North Side of Chicago. The first meeting was held with songs and declamations.</p>
   <p>Their first meeting was called to order by Miss Mary Aukstakalniute. She explained the purpose of the society, urged all Lithuanians, men and women, to join it, because it is national, and its aim is to spread enlightenment among our brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>Miss Aldona Narmunciute recited the poem, "I am a Lithuanian Child", and sang "I am Reared in Lithuania".</p>
   <p>Miss Antigona Aukstakalniute recited the poems: "Wake up Brother Ancestor" and "As Long as You are Young, Loving Brother, Sow the Seed"; she also sang two songs, "Hello Brother Singers" and the "Love of Litauania".</p>
