<title level="a">THREE DRAMAS STAGED BY CHICAGO LITHUANIANS LAST SUNDAY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday, October 24, the Lithuanians of Chicago staged three dramas and observed one important anniversary. According to reports, all were financially successful; each affair was attended by large crowds.</p>
   <p>A three-act drama, entitled "Isgriovimas Kauno Pilies" (The Destruction of Fort Kaunas), was staged in the State Street Turner hall, under the auspices of the Providence of God Lithuanian Roman Catholic parish. The performance of the actors was very poor. During the entire performance, beer was sold to members of the audience. The performers were so poorly trained in their roles that it was necessary to cancel the third act of the drama. The scenery also, was not appropriate. Even the least informed members along theatrical lines in the audience noticed that the performance was bad. The priests who sponsored this Play without suitable performers and scenery deserve to be severely censured, because such performances adversely affect the attendance at our subsequent stage presentations. Furthermore, the sale of intoxicating drinks during a theatrical performance cannot be construed as a good moral practice, <pb facs="5423970_2_0563.jpg" n="2"/>especially when it is sponsored by a parish with a priest whose main duty is to teach morality.</p>
   <p>The next presentation took place on Town Of Lake in Columbia hall, 48th and Paulina Streets. A comedy, entitled "Gudri Nasle" (The Clever Widow), was staged. It was sponsored by the first branch of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. The behavior of this audience was no better than that at the above mentioned performance, The players in this instance did not perform any better.</p>
   <p>The third presentation was held on Bridgeport, in the Freiheit Turner hall, 3421 South Halsted Street, sponsored by the Mockus Theatre Company. A play entitled "Tarnas Be Kantrybes" (An impatient Servant) was staged.</p>
   <p>In South Chicago, the local Lithuanian organizations commemorated the 40th anniversary of Lithuanian mass emigration to America. The program consisted of orations, songs, and recitations.</p>
