   <p>June 28, Friday, there were held examinations of pupils in the Lithuanian school. The examinations were in the English, German and Lithuanian languages. Some of the Lithuanian pupils were unable to speak Lithuanian when they started in this school, but now they can speak and read Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>There were twenty-one boys and twenty girls that took the examination for the past year. All together there were sixty pupils during the year in the Lithuanian school. The school will be open during the summer vacation time. Parents decided that it will be much better to keep the children in school instead on the street.</p>
   <p>We are proud of our teacher Mr. Daugela. He is willing to teach our children during the summer time. He not only teaches our children, but he also teaches the adults.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1388.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our teacher Mr. Daugela says that in this Lithuanian school he can prepare his students even for college.</p>
   <p>Those who want to get an education go to our teacher Mr. Daugela. He will teach and prepare you for a higher education.</p>
