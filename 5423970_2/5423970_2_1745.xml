   <p>A detailed financial statement of the Ausra (Aurora) Society, a student aid and general educational society, was given for the years 1907 and 1908 by Dr. J. Sliupas, treasurer. Sources of income and all expenditures, including the names of all students that are being assisted by the society, were listed in detail.</p>
   <p>The society had an income of $438.54 during the year 1907. The balance from 1906 was $398.45. Expenditures for 1907 amounted to $461.90, leaving a balance of $375.09. The income for the year 1908 was $611.88. Expenditures during 1908 amounted to $457.80, leaving a balance of $529.17, which still remains in the treasury.</p>
   <p>Among the students who are receiving financial assistance from the society are K. Jurgeamonis, who is attending school in Paris, France, and Anthony Lalis, who is attending school in Berne, Switzerland. The former <pb facs="5423970_2_1746.jpg" n="2"/>received one payment of $50. in 1907. The latter received two payments of $75 each during 1908.</p>
