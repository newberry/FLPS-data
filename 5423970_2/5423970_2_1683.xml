   <p>The annual meeting of the Farmers of Lithuania Society was held at the Meldazis Hall last Sunday. It must be pointed out that this society has been growing so fast that most halls are already too small for its meetings. This meeting, therefore, was held in the large hall.</p>
   <p>Many members attended the meeting and calmly and seriously discussed problems of the present. The subject of the Alliance of Chicago Societies was also brought up. Because the Alliance is apparently in disorder and because it indulges in too much "politics" and too little work, the Society voted to drop out of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>It was decided to donate thirteen dollars to the Lithuanian Public Library <pb facs="5423970_2_1684.jpg" n="2"/>on the West Side. Letters from the Lithuanian Relief Fund and the Lithuanian Assistance Fund were read to the meeting and put aside without discussion. The society does not favor any particular fund. It has already donated a hundred dollars from its treasury and it takes up extra collections at its meetings for Lithuanian war relief. The society intends to send this money directly to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The present officers were re-elected for another term: J. Biezis, president; J. Raugevicia, recording secretary; B. Lenkauskas, financial secretary; M. Meldazis, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The society now has about four hundred members and is strong financially. Many of the newer members are girls and women. Five new members joined the Society during the meeting.</p>
