   <p>On September the 15th the spectacle of the Kraziai massacre was performed. The hall was crowded to capacity. There were Polish people too, but not many. The spectators saw with their own eyes how the massacre in Kraziai was committed; they saw the wounded people, the struggle in defending their church; they heard the cries and moans of the wounded. This was a great spectacle, there were no dry eyes in the hall.</p>
   <p>The performance with a few exceptions, was very good. The people were satisfied and were glad that they came to see it.</p>
   <p>It was a financial success too. The profit for the society was $170.</p>
   <p>Now the Simonas Daukantas society wants to present another play; all young Lithuanians please go and register with the society, and let Dr. Stupnickis decide what part in the play you can take.</p>
   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society.</p>
