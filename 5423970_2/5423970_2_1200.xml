   <p>Many people, after arriving in America, have made thousands here. How? Because they knew the English language they went into business and, thanks to their knowledge of the language, were able to do business with all the inhabitants of the United States. They made the first step towards success and laid the foundation for it when they began to study the English language. If thousands have attained success in this manner, why can't you? Now every Lithuanian can achieve this because he can obtain the Lietuva's Lithuanian-English and English-Lithuanian Dictionary, the largest, most carefully compiled, and comparatively least expensive dictionary ever to have appeared among the Lithuanians. Even one who does not know the language, with the aid of this dictionary, can read everything in English and understand it. The third edition of the dictionary is nearly exhausted. Hurry! The price of both parts is $6.00; in expensive and strong bindings (as illustrated), $7.00. The Lithuanian-English Part, $2.00; in attractive bindings, $2.50. The English-Lithuanian Part (with pronunciations of each English word), $3.00; in durable and beautiful <pb facs="5423970_2_1201.jpg" n="2"/>bindings, $4.00. Ask for a pamphlet describing the dictionary. It will be sent free. When ordering the dictionary or requesting the pamphlet, write to the Lietuva Publishing Co., A. Olszewski, president, 3252 So. Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois. [Translator's note.--The Dictionary referred to was compiled by A. Lalis].</p>
