   <p>On last Sunday, February 14, actors of Branch 28 of the Lovers of the Father-land Society staged "Be Sulo" (A Stave Missing), a comedy, at Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and South Oakley Avenue. In addition to the play there were orations, recitations, a duet, and a monologue on the program. The program was sponsored by the Farmers of Lithuania Society.</p>
   <p>The cast of players in the comedy was as follows: "Dolieba", Mr. Balsevicius; "Sofia", Miss A. Ulkaitis; "Mare", Miss J. Tamusauskas; "Fabriko Savininkas", Mr. J. Kaminskas; "Jule", the servant girl, Miss J. Valaikis.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Biezis delivered a talk on the advantages of belonging to a benefit society. Miss A. Ulkaitis and Mr. A. Palionis recited a number of beautiful poems. The Zauris sisters sang a duet, Mr. S. Skudolskis playing the accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The popular Lithuanian humorist, Mr. V. Brusokas, and Mr. P. Sliogeris, staged <pb facs="5423970_2_0391.jpg" n="2"/>a one-act comedy entitled "Stepukas su Stepuku" (Stephen and Little Stephen). The former played the role of "Stephen"; the latter played the role of the former's son, "Little Stephen". In this play the father gives advice to his son, but the son does not accept the advice without criticism. The act created laughter to the point of tears among the audience.</p>
   <p>After the program the floor was cleared for dancing, which lasted till midnight. The large crowd which attended the affair behaved very nicely. The Lithuanian Youth of the West Side community are to be congratulated for presenting such a fine evening of entertainment.</p>
