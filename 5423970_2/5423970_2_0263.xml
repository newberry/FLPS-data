   <p>On Sunday, April 23, Branch No. 9 of the Progressive Lithuanian Women's Association gave a concert in Meldazis Hall, 2242 West 23rd Place. It was the first affair given by this Branch of the Association. The program was very interesting, and many people had the opportunity of hearing and enjoying the singing of Mrs. Nora Gugis (nee Pricevicius). A trio, consisting of P. V. Sarpalius, D. Paculat, and V. K. Sarpalius, sang very beautifully. The program included songs by a Lithuanian quartette and others. The most interesting number of the evening was the singing and dancing of three young Lithuanian girls. It is a great honor to parents who teach their children to perform so beautifully. The singing and dancing of a Russian balalaika orchestra was most enjoyable. Mr. A. Gubka sang a Russian solo. The balance of the program consisted of declamations, recitations, and a monologue entitled "Motina" (Mother).</p>
   <p>The affair was a success in every way. This concert will not only strengthen <pb facs="5423970_2_0264.jpg" n="2"/>the Branch financially, but will also add many new members to the organization.</p>
