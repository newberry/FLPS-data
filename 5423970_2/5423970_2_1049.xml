   <p>We have been receiving many letters from our readers, complaining to us that they have not received the copies of Katalikas for which they have subscribed. We are not making an alibi and we are not trying to cover up our mistakes; but in this particular case we are not responsible for those who have not received their copies of our paper. The people themselves are to blame for not sending us their correct address. Most addresses which we have received are wrong addresses and the names of streets are badly misspelled. This is the reason why you are not getting your paper, because you have not given us correct addresses. We have many copies of Katalikas returned to our office on account of wrong addresses. We, also, cannot blame the post office department for not delivering the copies of our paper to you if your address is wrong. What can we do in this case? The only thing we can do is wait and hold the paper until we get the correct addresses from the people. This, I believe, is the only solution to this problem, to correct the addresses which are wrong and the names of the streets must be spelled correctly as it is written on the street signs. If you have any difficulty in spelling the names of the streets correctly, I would advise you to go to the street corner, look at the street sign and copy the name correctly as it should be spelled. Hereafter we hope <pb facs="5423970_2_1050.jpg" n="2"/>that you will cooperate with us by sending the correct address, so that there will be no more mistakes in the future. Then you will receive the copies of our paper on time without any trouble.</p>
   <p>Up to this time our paper contained many errors which we could not correct on account of lack of experienced personnel and general help. But, now, we have increased our editorial staff and general help, in order to enlarge and improved our paper, Katalikas. Moreover this paper will publish the latest and the best news of the world. Our policy is to raise the standard of our newspaper by publishing clean and good news and to serve our people in the community. We request our correspondents not to send trifle or trivial news to the editor of Katalikas. Hereafter, we will only accept the news from our correspondents that are brief, concise, and has educational value.</p>
   <p>Our printing establishment has bought new machines and new type setters costing hundreds of dollars. Therefore we are asking our readers who have not paid up for their last years' subscription, to pay it new and renew their subscription for the coming year. We need lots of money for improving our printing establishment and the paper itself. We cannot publish our paper without your support. In order to have a better paper, first, we must have the support of our readers. No paper can exist in the community without the support of the people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1051.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have many enemies who call themselves fellow-countrymen and would like to drown us in a spoon of water. Some of them even tried to stop the circulation of our paper by making complaints to the U. S. Post office department; but they failed to carry out their scheme. The U. S. Post office department ignored their complaint against our paper. It is pitiful to think that we have such feeble-minded people in this world. Nobody can hurt our paper Katalikas, not even words of agitation. Our paper is growing bigger and stronger just as the Roman Catholic faith has spread throughout the world with no power stopping it.</p>
