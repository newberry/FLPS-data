   <p>Chicago, it can be said, is the center of Lithuanian activity in America. A large number of organizations, schools, clubs, choruses, and other groups are to be found here. They are all busy and active, preparing various seasonal affairs and entertainments.</p>
   <p>Not one of the better affairs does without music, without songs. Our people, who have loved song for ages, listen very willingly, for music calms and elates a person's soul. But it is regrettable that, because we do not have enough of our own musically-trained people, we can seldom hear the entrancing creations of our nation properly executed.</p>
   <p>Special training in music can best be obtained in special schools. The more <pb facs="5423970_2_1316.jpg" n="2"/>culturally developed nations for a long time have had such musical institutions, where their youth is trained in various branches of music.</p>
   <p>We, the Lithuanians of Chicago, do not yet have a similar institution. Realizing this need, we, upon frequent urgings, have dared to found the Lithuanian Music School this fall. Our aim is to attract selected teachers into one faculty, so that they could work more successfully in this field, and to provide our youth with a better opportunity to receive higher musical training and to receive a better acquaintance with the music of their own nation. It is much easier to attain these aims in a musical institution than by private lessons. Specialists in various branches who have credentials proving their training are being invited as teachers. For the time being at least, the school will teach piano, violin, organ, wind instruments, singing, theory, harmony, counterpoint, music history, orchestration, and composition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_2_1317.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The program of teaching will be so organized that those who graduate from this institution will receive credentials as teachers.</p>
