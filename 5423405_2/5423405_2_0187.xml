   <p>As in former years, the Sociedad Espanola is active this year in making preparations for its outdoor festivals. These affairs will take place in Brighton Park Grove, Kedzie Avenue and 36th Street. The first festival will be given Sunday, June 10th.</p>
   <p>One feature of this function will be a dance which will start at 2:30 P.M. in the afternoon on the above mentioned date. In order to make this dance a success the popular and well known Valencion Serenaders, have been engaged. This orchestra is a group of musicians who have received great ovations ever since they made their first public appearance.</p>
   <p>The ball is dedicated to the friends and sympathizers of the Sociedad Espanola. All the members of the Sociedad are requested to do everything in their power to make the affair worthy of the Sociedad's good name.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0188.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The price of admission has been put within reach of all, being fifty cents for gentlemen and twenty five cents for ladies.</p>
   <p>Those who have had occasion to follow the activities of the Sociedad Espanola are confident that the program will be of the highest merit. We feel sure that this picnic will be a grand social event and a pleasure to all.</p>
