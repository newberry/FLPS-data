   <p>The news of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> La Salle Hotel has been received with enthusiasm <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>-American youth of Chicago. That has been confirmed <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>our comrade and friend, Ramon <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>an organizer who together with <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>made the announcement to our friends who <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>the Fiesta last Saturday at the Red Lacquer Room of the Palmer House.</p>
   <p>The festival will be given in commemoration of the thirty-second anniversary of the Cuban Independence and will take place in the Hangar Room of the La Salle Hotel, a beautiful hall with capacity for 1,200 people. Perhaps our readers may remember that the Hangar Room was given a great publicity last year as being the only roof garden in the loop and, effectively it is the most ideal place for dancing during the month of May and the summer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0282.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program will consist of entertainment and dance, there being a great interest to present some very attractive numbers which will appeal to the general audience and the like of which never has been presented as yet. The admission for men is seventy-five cents, ladies sixty cents. Very soon we shall give you complete details about this wonderful event which will be a stupendous success, not to be compared with any of the past. In conclusion we wish to say that we have an astonishing surprise for you on that night and perhaps we can only maintain this secret a few more days.</p>
