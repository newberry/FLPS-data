  <body>
   <p>On Saturday of last week, the "Benito Juarez" (Educational Club), had their first meeting. It was given at the Gad's Hill Center, located at 1919 West Cullerton Street. This meeting begins a series of functions which the Club is inaugurating to promote cultural development among members of the Mexican Colony and the Spanish speaking people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting was featured by a program on which the artists of our Colony appeared, rendering well received song, dance and instrumental numbers. The second affair, according to plans of the club will eclipse the one given last Saturday in brilliancy and entertaining qualities.</p>
   <p>The festival ended with a beautiful dance to the accompaniment of a very lively orchestra conducted by the well known leader Ignacio C. Escobar. The "Benito Juarez" (Educational Club), which is headed by the aggressive and enthuiastic president, Victor J. Vera, has already started preparations for the next meeting.</p>
