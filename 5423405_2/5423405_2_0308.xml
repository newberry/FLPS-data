   <p>The official Independence celebration took place in the West Side Auditorium, the night of September the 15th. The Consul of Mexico, Mr. Rafael Aveleyra presided. More than four thousand persons attended the celebration.</p>
   <p>The official address was made by the Distinguished Mr. Consul, who was greatly applauded and complimented.</p>
   <p>After the "Independence" ceremony dancing took place. The celebration organized by El Nacional, at Pilsen Park on the night of the 16th was another great success.It had a musical program. The master of ceremonies of this affair, was our very good friend Dr. Meixneiro who gave a beautiful historical review. The dance hall of Pilsen Park was insufficuent to hold the crowd.</p>
   <p>After the musical program dancing began and lasted until the morning. On the same night of the 16th, another celebration took place at the West Side Auditorium. It too was a success.</p>

   <p>Blue Island, inspite of the small Mexican population, also had an Independence celebration with a literary-musical program.</p>
   <p>Some countrymen who took a few drinks to celebrate caused some disturbances, which however did not amount to much.</p>
