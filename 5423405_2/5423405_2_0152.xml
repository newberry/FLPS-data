   <p>The Club Recreativor 333, offered a dance to its large membership and friends, which took place at Mercy Center last Saturday, December 23rd, it resulted very gayful. The music was furnished by a group of young people. On the same night, a private enterprise effected a dance at the West Side Auditorium, the orchestra Los Mayas excelled in their talents with music on this occasion.</p>
   <p>For the night of December 30, the Cuauhtemoc Club, is preparing a dance which will take place at Hull House, Halsted and Polk Streets, which will begin at 8:00 o'clock P. M. "La Alianza Fraternal Mexicana" has organized a musical and artistic program, at that time Senor Carlos Palacios Roji, consul of Mexico will present a banner to the members of the society. The artistic part of the program is in charge of Paco Perafan, teacher of international dances, who for the first time will present to the public the new dancing couple, "Chelito Sevilla".</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0153.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This festival will take place at the Temple Hall, Ashland Avenue and Van Buren Street, December 30, 1933, at 8:00 P. M. sharp. The admission is absolutely free to all. Because of the large capacity of the hall many people will be able to find the proper accomodation.</p>
   <p>RELIGIOUS PLAY</p>
   <p>Last Saturday "El Princepe de Paz", was dramatized at the 'Iken Institute,' seat of the First Mexican Baptist Church. Many of the members of this religious institution acted in the play, and its presentation was of great educational value.</p>
   <p>TIE PAN-AMERICAN CLUB</p>
   <p>This organization has informed us, that on January 6, 1934, will give another festival at the Maryland Hotel, 900 Rush Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0154.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As you may recall, the Pan-American presented a spendid program recently at the same hotel with remarkable success, this of course has encouraged the organizers, Miss Hanna Barr and Dolores Garcia. Unquestionably, the enthusiasm created by the previous fiesta, has given the organizers assurance of a much greater success, thereby surpassing the one already mentioned. The Pan-American Club, is composed of prominent Spanish speaking people, and Americans who cultivate our language, art, customs, and work towards the indissoluble unity of the Spanish-and American people.</p>
   <p>El Nacional, now as whenever dealt with matters of this nature has offered its unconditional, cooperation to the end, on such occasions as the one scheduled to be carried out by this group</p>
