<title level="a">THE VISITING BASKETBALL TEAM "FAL" OF MEXICO PLAYS CHICAGO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The famous basketball team, "Fal," of Mexico, is here on a visit. During its stay here in Chicago, it will compete with two of our outstanding basketball teams, the Y.M.C.A. of Oak Park and the team of Loyola University. This gallant Mexican squad has been winning games on its various stops from Mexico to Chicago. But our boys are not discouraged by this news; they will try to defeat this powerful team and thereby take away some of the glory this unit brings along.</p>
   <p>As soon as the members of the famous team arrived with its coach, Mr. Leoncio Ochoa, the newspapers extended to them a sincere welcome.</p>
   <p>Last night, January 27th, the "Club Deportivo Cuauhtemoc," gave a dance entertainment in honor of the Fal Team, in Bowen Hall at "Hull House." Outstanding personilities of our colony attended the affair.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0488.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The members of the club joined in the preparations for the dance program. It is said that other receptions have been arranged by various groups of our colony, for the Fal Team and their outstanding coach, Mr. Leoncio Ochoa.</p>
