   <p>I am surprised very much, that in the last edition of your paper not one line was dedicated to the Conferences given in Chicago, during the 8th and the 10th of this month by the delegates of El Freute Popular Mexicano of Mexico. The conferences were liked very much by the people, and even the Mexican Consul was present on one occasion. Your newspaper failed completely to inform the colony of such development. If the work undertaken was contrary to the interest of the people, why not expose it? I did not think you could have overlooked such an occurrence, for it is unpardonable that a newspaper should give more emphasis to local news with relation to the groups who read them, principally the Mexicans who form the majority of the Spanish speaking people of the Middle West. What was said there generally, pertains to the organization of the Mexicans, the establishing of a Public Library, the problem of repatriation, and the need of an instructor to teach the Spanish language and to ask the Mexican Government for one if the Colony should consider it advisable, including several <pb facs="5423405_2_0110.jpg" n="2"/>other things which could be of collective benefit. I suggest the dedication of two columns on the editorial page of your paper to the organizations that may wish to express their views in regards to the unification of the Mexican people in Chicago.</p>
