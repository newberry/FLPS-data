  <body>
   <p>The festival which has been previously arranged by the Cuauhtemoc Club, will take place tonight, this has awakened considerable interest among the sporting elements of the Mexican colony in Chicago. Very few times the festivals which have been organized by the local basket ball teams have aroused such an interest as the one to take place tonight. It is because in these teams the most popular elements will take part, and who also form the base in the season's charter. Two games of basket ball will be played tonight between Hidalgo versus Necaxa, Mayas and Cuauthmoc, which will begin at 8:00 P. M. in the gymnasium of the Hull House, 819 West Polk Street. This is a very important event, because of the ability of these athletes and a large number of friends and sympathizers. The Cuauthemoc Club intends to exhibit its four of "spades" and the end of the games a sumptuous dance will begin, the orchestra is under the command of "Los Aztecas".</p>

   <p>The festival will be full of interest, color, and emotion. That is perhaps why the basket ball players have made it so attractive to the amateur player. The basket ball games this year shall begin worthily. Both games and the dance will make history in the annals of "Sports" among the Mexican Youth of Chicago.</p>
