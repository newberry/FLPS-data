   <p>Senator Harris, Democrat, and Senator Blane, Republican made a protest against what they call the flux of Mexican immigration to the United States. Senator Blane asked for prohibitionist forces to regulate the entry of Mexicans. Senator Reed said there will be opposition to Mr. Hoover's initiative which stipulates in his Immigration Bill that only 1,500 are to immigrate a year. At the present time from 3,000 to 6,000 are coming in every month.</p>
   <p>The recommendations from the land holders of Texas and California has been worthless, for the Senate is anxious to regulate the entry of the Mexican, because they say that the Mexican is taking the jobs of thousands of Americans.</p>
   <p>Should President Coolidge "veto" this Bill, it is feared Mr. Hoover and Mr. Curtis will make it part of their program.</p>

   <p>Secretary of State Kellog has declared that such restriction would tend to injure the relations which now exist with Mexico. In other circles it is said that the Mexican Government would be satisfied with this action since the Mexican Government is <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>everything possible to minimize the immigration of the Mexican into the United States.</p>
