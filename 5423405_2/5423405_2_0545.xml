   <p>The members of the "Aviacion Mexicana" of Chicago, feel quite satisfied with the success obtained by our pilot and countryman L. G. Herrera who advertised Mexican Aviation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Herrera left Chicago, February 13th, to visit many cities of the Southern States, on his flight to Mexico. Our pilot was well received by our countrymen wherever he landed. For instance at Kansas City, he spent two or three days in conference regarding aviation activities of our compatriots there. This city was selected for the meetings, because the local consul Mr. G. M. Gaxiola had promised his cooperation. This gentleman is an aviation fan and is sympathetic towards any constructive effort made in the interest of our mother-country.</p>
   <p>From this city Mr. Herrera continued his flight to Mexico, via Tulsa, Oklahoma, Ardmore, Fort North and also San Antonio, where he ran into a storm and was forced down.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0546.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thanks to his skill, however he was not injured. A broken wing on his plane was the only damage.</p>
   <p>In San Antonio, Mr. Herrera discussed plans, relative to his flight, with the General Consul. He was also entertained by Mr. Ignacio E. Lozano, director of La Prensa, and Mr. Ruiz, chief editor of the same paper.</p>
   <p>After remaining for some days in San Antonio, Mr. Herrera went to Laredo, Texas. As soon as he arrived there, our dear friend Consul Aveleyra, who was formerly stationed at Chicago, gave him a most hearty welcome.</p>
   <p>On the 23rd day at 9:00 A. M. the "Mexican Blue Bird" flew over the Bravo, landing a little later on the soil of the Aztecs.</p>
