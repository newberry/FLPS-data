   <p>We shall speak, in these columns, of something regarding the problems which confront Mexicans who live in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Now we discuss, though in a brief manner, educational subjects from the Mexican's point of view.</p>
   <p>We must declare at once, that Mexican people who for many reasons are settled out of their country, always live bounded to her by ties of language and customs, which are not extinguished at all, and by the help of special schools be developed further.</p>
   <p>We have known some fine fellows of Mexican origin, who because they were born in this country have made their studies in English, and speak it more or less perfectly, but these persons do not speak good Spanish.</p>
   <p>This fact is against our culture and is due to the cultural environment in which <pb facs="5423405_2_0051.jpg" n="2"/>they live.</p>
   <p>Now what would happen if Mexican descendants had an opportunity to study the Mexican history, the Spanish language and know more about Mexico's resources? To understand what the great future of our country is and that of other Spanish speaking countries.</p>
   <p>Everybody would be a living evidence of Mexican or Latin American culture.</p>
   <p>The deficiency which we point out, is well known to us, and we could remedy it by establishing special schools, where everybody could learn about the actual Mexico, in order to combat some offensive and perfidious information regarding our old country.</p>
   <p>These mendacious reports against Mexican culture are believed sometimes by</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0052.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>the Mexican descendants, and we must fight in order to destroy this bad work.</p>
   <p>Many Mexicans who are living in foreign countries do not know the resources of Mexico, but they hear talk of our country, and the result is a terrible paradox, that foreigners know Mexico better than themselves. Hence the proverb: "Somebody does not know what he possesses."</p>
   <p>La Lucha, intends to fight against the slanderous information regarding Mexico, and we shall always try to exert ourselves against such malicious intentions.</p>
   <p>We touch this subject superficially but very soon we shall give more suggestions.</p>
