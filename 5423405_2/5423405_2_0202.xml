   <p>Scarcely fifteen days have elapsed since the organization of the Chicago Cuban Association, but never-the-less its members find themselves in the midst of social activities. The first of these is to be a creole dinner. The Directing Committee has decided that this affair shall be typical of the members who make up this most worthy Association; namely, a genuine Cuban dinner. For this affair the members felt that no better setting could be had than the Cuban Restaurant, recently opened and located at 802 North Dearborn.</p>
   <p>It has been quite some time since the Cuban Colony has been able to come together as a body and enjoy themselves thru the activities of so novel an association. For many, the large attendance at this function will be a surprise since they have no idea of the true number of Cubans who live in this city, many more than was estimated, even by the worthy organizers of the Association.</p>

   <p>The idea of the honorable Consul is being crystalized and the day is not far away when we all will recognize the invaluableness of his efforts on behalf of his fellowmen. In this connection he has had splendid cooperation from a number of our friends who have been putting forth their best efforts in order to obtain the desired results.</p>
   <p>In our next edition we will publish additional details which we will not mention now, because of lack of space. Often we receive such pleasing news when our edition is on the press.</p>
