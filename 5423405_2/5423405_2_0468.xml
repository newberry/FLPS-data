   <p>For the purpose of initiating Sabino Sanchez and Jose Reyes into the Lodge "Lux In Umbra," Number fifty, the patrons Melesio Espinosa and Jose S. Rayes entertained a number of friends at a banquet in the elegant dining-room of Casa Alex.</p>
   <p>This gathering was the scene of much joy and happiness and all who attended the affair left highly satisfied.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silvano R. Ramos, an artist of great merit and truly the pride of the Mexican colony of Chicago, sang the popular song, "La Borrachita," for which he was loudly applauded by the compatriots who were present, as well as by a group of non-Mexicans who, in addition to applauding him, frequently exclaimed powerfully, "Bravo," "Bueno."</p>
   <p>The popular Alex Bazarra, with the beautiful and most graceful Miss Lupe <pb facs="5423405_2_0469.jpg" n="2"/>Sanchez as his partner, danced a Jota for which they were enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>There were not only leading gentlemen present at the banquet, but also ladies high in society.</p>
   <p>The orchestra, led by Mr. Reyes, was highly entertaining.</p>
   <p>This is the second fraternal feast of the Lodge "Lux In Umbra," Number fifty; the other one took place in South Chicago and it was attended by many families from Gary, Indiana Harbor, So. Chicago, and Chicago.</p>
