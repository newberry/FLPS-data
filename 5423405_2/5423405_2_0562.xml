  <body>
   <p>The Ortiz Bubio Committee, led by Mr. Rafael Correa, has succeeded in forming two sub-committees which will work among our countrymen in the interest of Ing. Ortiz Rubio's candidacy as the next president of Mexico.</p>
   <p>The said committees have been formed in Chicago and Gary, Indiana.</p>
   <p>In the near future another unit will be formed in Indiana Harbor.</p>
   <p>The committee over which Mr.Correa presides is sincerely grateful for the co-operation which our fellow-countrymen have given and request that they continue to do their part to secure the election of Ing. Ortiz Rubio as president of Mexico. His unlimited popularity and the fact that he is the only one who can <pb facs="5423405_2_0563.jpg" n="2"/>save Mexico are the reasons why we should work for his election.</p>
   <p>Those who sympathize with the movement to elect Ing. Ortiz Rubio should indicate their support by filling in the following coupon:</p>
   <p>Mr. Rafael Correa</p>
   <p>1135 W. Adams St.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Please register me as an adherent to the cause of Ortiz Rubio's candidacy as President of Mexico.</p>
