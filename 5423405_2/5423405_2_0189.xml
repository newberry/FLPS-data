   <p>The brilliant dance sponsored by the Sociedad Espanola, of Chicago, last Saturday, was a great success.</p>
   <p>As usual, the affair took place in the spacious hall of the Capitol Building, 4th floor, at 159 North State Street.</p>
   <p>For many years this well known society had not had such an interesting as well as, extraordinary success. Which evidently was the result of having a well formed organization.</p>
   <p>Without any doubt the young people enjoyed themselves. Paz Nagar, the celebrated composer and pianist and director of the united "Valencian Serenaders", arranged the dance program, having been aided by the other members of the orchestra. As usual Juanito Pineda a young man of talent received many compliments.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0190.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The hall was lavishly decorated. This social affair was said to have been one of the best events of the Spring Season. It ended at one o'clock in the morning.</p>
   <p>All the girls who took part in the function are outstanding celebrities in our colony. Other important performers were: Miss Eulalia Rodriguez, queen of the Mexican Aereo Club, Miss Josefina Anguiano, fiance of Alberto Garcia and Mrs. Consolacion Yrigoyen de Garriga, wife of the Vice-President.</p>
   <p>We extend our most sincere congratulations to the organization committee, as well as to our Master of Ceremonies, Juan Sedeno.</p>
   <p>Watch the next issue of this paper for a notice, relative to a picnic which is to be given, the tenth of July, by the Spanish Society.</p>
