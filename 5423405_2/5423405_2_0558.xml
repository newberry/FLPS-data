  <body>
   <p>The Mexican colony of Chicago is more than pleased at having been informed to-day by the Chicago Mexican Consulate that the president-elect of our motherland, Ingeniero Pascual Ortiz Rubio, will speak to members of the colony in the beautiful and spacious Ashland Auditorium, located on the northwest corner of Ashland and Van Buren.</p>
   <p>This kindness from the First Agent of the Republic is brought to us thru the efforts of the consul and vice-consul of Mexico in this city, who know of the great esteem in which the president-elect is held by our colonial element. They have not omitted anything in their effort to show our appreciation for this occasion.</p>
   <p>The Mexican colony will withdraw from all activities to-morrow in order to render homage to the First Agent of our motherland, who is visiting here in company with his honorable family and some prominent political persons from <pb facs="5423405_2_0559.jpg" n="2"/>Mexico and the United States.</p>
   <p>The function in honor of the president-elect will begin at 4:30 P. M. A group of Mexican artists, among them Paco Perafan, Herlinda Rodriquez, the Misses Maria and Herlinda de la Vega, Silvano Ramos, and possibly the Mexican Band of Chicago, will take part in the affair in order to give it great splendor and brilliance.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Mexican Consulate has distributed throughout the city and neighboring towns circulars which contain a cordial invitation to the colony.</p>
   <p>It is greatly desired that all Mexicans, from Chicago and surrounding towns, gather at the Ashland Auditorium to hear the speech.</p>
