   <p>The Mexican painter, Gallito, who left Chicago a few days ago for Mexico to help the cause of the Government in the Mexican Revolution fell into the hands of rebel spies on crossing the border.</p>
   <p>He was escorted to the headquarters of the rebels where in order to save himself he told the authorities that he had left Chicago in order to join the forces which were fighting the federal government.</p>
   <p>On the basis of this declaration, he was without further ado equipped as a soldier.</p>
   <p>"I did not like my position as a rebel soldier and began at once to plan an escape.</p>
   <p>I soon found myself in the company of three hundred other recruits. They called us "volunteers". The generals only wanted us to get through our training in a hurry so that we might relieve the soldiers at the front.</p>
   <p>I could observe that the situation was going from bad to worse and that at any moment we would meet the troops of Plutareo. Then would have to fight with my comrades, and await an opportunity to escape to the federal forces.</p>

   <p>This may appear to be a story but it is true.</p>
