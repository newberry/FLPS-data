   <p>The formation of purely Mexican Societies in the United States, besides being a duty, is an outstanding necessity. Unfortunately, we cannot deny the fact that there is an enormous number of us who completely ignore not only the wealth and greatness of our country, but even lack culture to the extent that there are many who have not had the most rudimentary teachings of our language. It is for this reason that I suggest the formation of societies as an outstanding necessity under whose bosom a real work in favor of our people may be accomplished. By teaching those who do not know how to read and write through special reunions, lectures, and libraries, let them know the immense resources that Mexico possesses and the incomparable beauties as well.</p>
   <p>With a similar program to be based and fully developed with energy and persistence, <pb facs="5423405_2_0060.jpg" n="2"/>there is no doubt that in the very near future changes would take place in the feeling and conduct of those who in spite of being Mexicans do not know their country.</p>
   <p>They feel ashamed of their origin and deny their country either by changing their citizenship or by making up their mind not to come back. A very sad thing, we should bring to each and everyone of the Mexicans who have not received the sacred light of wisdom, the knowledge of all the beauty, and great things the country of Mexico possesses, as well as the wonderful traditions of our race.</p>
   <p>Jesus E. Mora,</p>
