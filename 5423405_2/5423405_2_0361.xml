   <p>The living forces of the colony are preparing a grand celebration. As is usual every year the Mexican colony of Chicago, celebrates with patriotic festivity in order to commemorate the call of Independence! launched by that immortal clergyman Don. Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, on the memorable night of September 15, 1810. Great enthusiasm prevails while remembered with dignity the heroes who knew how to win a country with freedom for us.</p>
   <p>The Mexican residents of our Mexican colony in Chicago, and even many who are foreign to our nation, but who are in sympathy with us, have undertaken the task of cooperating with the Mexican organizations to commemorate the Day of Independence. On September 16th, this celebration will take place at Pilsen Park where year after year this festivity takes place and where Mexico and its Heroes will be honored.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0362.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The official program will be one of the best that We have ever presented. The stage in that large hall will be properly decorated, displaying our flag, and the flag of the United States, the country which gives us hospitality. The Mexican Band of Chicago will take over the main part of the program, because of larger number of musicians. On the official program for that night the "Orquesta Tipica Morales"(Morales Typical Orchestra) will follow the Mexican Band of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Miss Isabelita Reyna will give a number, "Charras Tapatias" (Female Wearing Showy Riding Costumes).Musical numbers by the "Classic Quartet" of the Mexican Band of Chicago; an Argentine tango by Juan Pineda and Miss Rosita McDermott; a comic duet by Leopoldo Reyna and the attractive Lupita Murrieta; a violin solo by Miss Mercedes Figueroz; a guitar duet by Mr. Pineda and Mr. Fernandez, and in general many other numbers which will be impossible to enumerate because of the variety will round out the formal program.</p>

   <p>Terminating the observance of the night happily dedicated to our country a splendid dance will begin and continue until 3:00 o'clock in the morning. We have been informed by the organizers of this beautiful festival that the admission will be 50c. Our colony knows full well all of the artists who will take a part on September 16th. Isabel Reyna (the little jewel), Lupe Murieta and Leopoldo Reyna who are members of the dramatic group headed by Joyita (little jewel) need no mention. The well known Mexican Band of Chicago during the last three years has given concerts and thus learned how to gain the sympathy of such intelligent connoisseurs as the Mexican public. As for the rest, they are studious young people who have put forth their best for the success of the program.</p>
   <p>The Morales Typical Orchestra, composed of a beautiful contingent of pretty women, representative of Mexican woman, will give a fresh and artistic note on the night of the 16th, of September.</p>
