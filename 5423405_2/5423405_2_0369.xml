   <p>The authorities have authorized us to announce that a committee for national holidays is being organized in this city. This committee will arrange the commemoration of our holidays especially of our Independence Day.</p>
   <p>The members of this committee can think of no better way for us to demonstrate our patriotism than to work for constructive organization.</p>
   <p>We can do nothing better to prove that our country comes first and to honor its memory than to promote and support the organization of such a committee. It is the duty of all Mexicans to take pride in the glorious past of their country. It is conceded that Mr. Luis Martinez will work as he has always done on similar occasions. To this gentleman as well <pb facs="5423405_2_0370.jpg" n="2"/>as to Don Rafael M. Trejo we owe a debt of gratitude for their cooperation in last year's celebration of this solemn occasion.</p>
   <p>We also are indebted to them for the splended function which they arranged for our illustrious aviator, Captain Emilio Carranza. It was at this affair that the members of our colony showed that they knew how to honor our heroes. To these gentlemen, and to others, we owe the organization of last year's September celebration at which time our colony proved its strong admiration for the heroes of our independence.</p>
   <p>We wish that, as soon as the committee has had sufficient time to make its plans, a program will be arranged worthy of our dear Mexico, our Mother Country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0371.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is especially desirable because we are now in a foreign country where we should display our national colors to the glory of the beautiful land where we were born.</p>
   <p>The program which is being arranged for the national holidays will include Mexican radio features, arranged with some of the stations of this city, songs characteristic of our distinct regions as well as numerous lectures for the benefit of thousands of American citizens and of foreigners who are interested in our beautiful Spansih language. We feel that the committee should begin at once to utilize all available material to push the program and to give publicity to it. We can state here, that the Mexican Consul, Mr. Rafael Aveleira, has promised his official sanction and cooperation. Now, only the cooperation of the Mexican <pb facs="5423405_2_0372.jpg" n="4"/>merchants is lacking to make this celebration a success. In the interest of our country, and to aid the committee in carrying out its program, we put the columns of this paper, the champion of Mexican ideals and at the same time of those of the Latin-Americans, at the disposal of that body.</p>
   <p>With the time which it has, from now until September, the committee, led by Mr. Luis Martinez, will no doubt be able to organize a beautiful celebration.</p>
