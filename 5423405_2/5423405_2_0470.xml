   <p>The respectable Masonic Lodge "Lux In Umbra" (Light in the Dark) No. 50 of South Chicago, division of the Rito Nacional Mexicano, held its summer festival last Saturday at the large and elegant West Side Auditorium.</p>
   <p>This Tenida Blanca (Honorable Meeting) was a gathering of the principal families of the Mexican colony and of a great number of prominent North American masons who are members of the Rito Yorkinc.</p>
   <p>We mention the Adopcion de Luvetones ceremony as being the outstanding feature of the program of this magnificent affair. We extend the most cordial felicitations to Mr. Luis Alvarez del Castillo, venerable master of Lux In Umbra, Lodge No. 50, for the splendid organization of the meeting and to the cooperative spirit of all the members of the group.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0471.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program was most select. Our representative Mr. Carlos Palacios Roji, Mexican Consul here, emphasized the high standards of the Lodge for which he received a great ovation.</p>
   <p>Other speeches which were well received were those of Messrs. Carlo Morales, Julio Oliva de Armas, Jose S. Reyes and that of the great orator of the Lodge, Mr. Carlos Gurrola who was loudly applauded for his speech "What is the Truth."</p>
   <p>The meeting ended at 1 a.m. when an exquisite lunch was served during which Mexican musical numbers were rendered by the children of Mr. Enciso.</p>
