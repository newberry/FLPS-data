   <p>The Mexican Methodist Church of Chicago, sponsored a Field Day, in the Forest Preserve, held last Saturday, July 30th. Approximately two hundred persons attended this affair. This number included many children and adults who are at present members of the church as well as many of its sympathizers and friends.</p>
   <p>There also was an interesting program, according to Mr. Janecken, who in cooperation with Reverend G. B. O'Neill, promoted this out-door festival.</p>
   <p>The celebrated tenor Leopoldo Escobarete and the well known baritone, J. Garcia, delighted us with beautiful songs. The mandolin and guitar duet, played by the Rivera children accompanied by the Marcias and Garcia orchestra, was an unusual treat. The songs and instrumental numbers were loudly applauded and comprised many others besides those mentioned.</p>

   <p>Another attraction of the affair was a Base-Ball game between our Mexican team and one made up of Americans. the latter being victorious by a score of 2 to O.</p>
   <p>At 7 P.M. all of the excursionists returned home, thus ending a meeting of true comradship which will be repeated next year.</p>
