   <p>With the formation of the "Patriotic Committee", it has been demonstrated what was said in many occasions: That in order to do something useful and have all the societies to participate without the appearance of discordant voices that there should be something materially important to all the groups involved and based upon mutual cooperation. To obtain such foundation and the goodwill it was imperative to secure the assistance of those who thought that actions could guided by good faith alone. This is what we would call a solid and constructive foundation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0277.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The argument brought to the front was the failures of the past. And to this, they called experiments in spite of the fact that some of these experts at no time participated in a crusade of harmony. Its suffice for them to know that some one had failed in order to accept the impossibility of success of any coordinated social work. Even though they admitted the importance of such enterprises and its usefulness should it be possible to effect a practicable materialization. The beginning of their chorus said: "The Colony does not answer". Now it seems very clear that it was through ignorance that they blamed the colony has given answer and lended its contingent to any undertaking of general interest. Unfortunately, not always have been carried to practice the promises made to the inculpable colony, not even when the necessary funds have been appropriated.</p>

   <p>This has happened so many times that faith has been completely lost. But let us show with faith that our promises will be fulfilled and then we shall notice the change. If we are in need of honest leaders and hard workers this is no sound reason to believe that we are destined to become a conglomeration of indifferent beingd ready to be exploited indefinitely. We are subject to evolution and we shall improve gradually in our social relations until we have reached a maximum degree in organizational development and be able to solve our problem mutually in a coordinated manner.</p>
