   <p>There are 5,700 Mexicans who are members of this Church. According to the census of 1935, we have 8,020 Mexicans including children who belong to our Church. We have religious services (masses) four times a day, every day of the week. We have six religious societies. 1. Sociedad de Guadalupe, with 360 members, 2. Sociedad del Santo Nombre, 420 members, 3. Archicofradia Society, 575 members, 4. Infants (children) 326 members, 5. Terciarios 360 members, Sagrado Corazon de Jesus 620 members. Society No. 1. Rosario Anaya, is the President, and has 12 officers. No. 2. Roberto Lopez, is the President, and has 15 officers. No. 3. Isabel de Gomez, is the President and has 25 officers. No. 4. Jesus Villa, is the President and has 8 officers, No. 5. Genaro Anaya, is the President and has 6 officers, No. 6. Rumaldo Perales, is the President and has 14, officers. We have classes in English and Spanish for adults of both sexes 4 evenings a week.</p>

   <p>About 80 adults attend the classes. Also, we teach the following: Singing, music, sewing, drawing, handicraft, arithmetic, physics, sociology, popular science an flower making.I cannot say how many people attend each class, however the attendance varies, because the people work different shifts, most every member attends to some of the classes above mentioned. All of the 8,020 Mexicans are catholics, and come to this Church, others non-catholics do not interest us. We have a school for children, five days a week and about 140 attend daily. We also have dramatic plays, almost every week. We have catholic charities. I can say that we benefit the City of Chicago by educating the people and making them good citizens; socially as well as morally, to be good workers and faithful to their jobs.</p>
