   <p>The day is very near in which the Mexican Catholic Youth of Chicago and surrounding vicinities will holds its Congress. This event of course, for the first time will unite the Catholic Spanish speaking youth from the states of the Middle-West. It is a great task to carry this work among the people who are really in need of it. Many problems of vital importance will be presented, particularly those which concern the Holy teachings of the great teacher of all times.</p>
   <p>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
   <p>The Youth of Chicago is very happy for the occurrence which is about to take place and because they are anxious to witness the work they love and fill their soul with joy.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0383.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The great fighter who has been more persistent perhaps is Padre de Diego, a man of a giant soul and golden heart. To him is due the honor for carrying out this magnificent work which we shall witness during the 12, 13,19 and 20 of September 1936.</p>
