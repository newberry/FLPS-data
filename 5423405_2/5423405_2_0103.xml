   <p>The 13th, of this month the Spanish Society offered a banquet as a farewell honor to the Spanish-American artists Mederano, Donna, and Villarino, the famous interpreters of the Spanish art who for several months performed at the Empire Room of the Palmer House in Chicago. It was about nine o'clock in the evening when the homaged artists made their appearance in the hall of the Spanish Society, and were vehemently applauded by the people present, who were anxious to shake hands with the renowned artists. This act resulted in full harmony. While at the table many orators made use of the speech expressing their appreciation to the artists for the brilliant Spanish work realized in Chicago by the trio.

   <p>Villarino, who accompanies them, he is undoubtedly a genius in the use of his guitar who also gathered many enthusiast and deserving applauses from the Spanish and American public, and whose critics commented his ability very highly. This festival took place in a very genuine atmosphere which lasted until 2:00 in the morning, at which time they retired to their respective homes. After a few days of retirement these famous artists will leave for Miami, Fla., where they have accepted a contract for the winter season. We wish you a new triumph besides a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year.</p>
