  <body>
   <p>Some leaflets appeared last Sunday in South Chicago, inviting with all due respect the Mexican Colony and especially the Catholic Mothers to attend a lecture given by Jose Reynoso, a so-called Catholic priest. Said priest is not known to the diocese of Chicago, neither appears to be registered on the Directory of Texas. They hypocritically said that Father Reynoso was originally from the State of Jalisco, Mexico, and had very high religious preparation. We have among us many friends who came from that state and we can prove that in no place in Jalisco was he ordained and probably in no other place of Mexico.</p>
   <p>But even if we were to assume the possibility of him being a priest,whoever places himself to the orders of the Peoples' Front, can not be but a miserable who has lost his senses and dignity. An apostate who would come to confirm the saying of a great educator from Guadalajara; the Catholic Church is like the ocean, it does not stand trash.</p>
   <p>A priest such as Luther, Jansenio and many others who by the inscrutable designation of God, their abominable rage and sensualism made then rebel against the Church. Luther was in fact an intelligent priest, nevertheless his anger and luxury turned him blind and dragged him to an abysm.</p>
