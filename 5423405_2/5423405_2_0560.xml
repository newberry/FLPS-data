   <p>Engineer Pascual Ortiz Rubio and his attendants were cordially received when they arrived in the city this morning. Thousands of sympathizers and partisans of the president-elect of our country gathered at the Michigan Central station, eager to do honor to the new chief Executive of Mexico.</p>
   <p>Among the attendants who accompanied the president-elect from Washington to Detroit and from Detroit to Chicago, were Federal District Governor, Jose Maria Puig Caussauranc; Lieutenant-Colonel Hernandez, private secretary to the president-elect, and Mr. Rafael Quintanilla, secretary of the Mexican embassy at Washington.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rafael Aveleyra, Mexican Consul in Chicago, and the consular staff were at the station to do honor to the illustrious official.</p>
   <p>The reception official had a full program for our visitor. In spite of this <pb facs="5423405_2_0561.jpg" n="2"/>the president-elect found time to visit this paper and take a long auto drive thru the city.</p>
   <p>To-day the president-elect and his attendants will be the honored guests at a luncheon given by the Union League Club on behalf of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, at which will attend thirty-five persons from the financial and commercial world. To-morrow will end the two-day visit in Chicago of Engineer Pascual Ortiz Rubio.</p>
