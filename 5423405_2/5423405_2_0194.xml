   <p>The magnificient ball given Saturday, May 7, by La Sociedad Espanola, one of the oldest and most enthusiastic groups in Chicago, was a brilliant success as we had hoped it would be.</p>
   <p>This splendid social affair took place in the spacious and elegant hall of the Capitol Building on the fourth floor, located at 159 North State Street, where this progressive society has met for a number of years.</p>
   <p>The choice of the various colors with which the hall was decorated was very attractive. The delight of those assembled was evident. As a whole the festival was an outstanding affair.</p>
   <p>It is certain that all those who love music danced a great deal. The fair sex, as usual, was there in large numbers and received many compliments from the opposite sex.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0195.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program consisted of ten numbers which were perfectly performed. Among the numbers the most pleasing was the song "La Gitana" in which the expressive and beautiful Miss Conchita Islas exhibited such grace and ease, that she obtained a great deal of applause and compliments.</p>
   <p>The dance began at ten o'clock and was made very lively by the well known and gay orchestra "The Valencia Serenaders".</p>
   <p>The jubilant fiesta extended until an early hour of the morning and as usual the compliments went to those who were the promoters of the affair.</p>
   <p>With frequency, "La Sociedad Espanola" gives a series of social events and is now announcing the coming dance which is to be held Saturday 28th, commencing at 8:30 P.M. and there will be interesting announcements made by the Vice-President of the society, Mr. Garriga.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_2_0196.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We also wish to mention the following numbers: The graceful Lucia Pando, Clara Winters, C. Click, Luisa Puig, the agreeable Olga and Libertad Fernadez sisters, the elegant and gracious Estela McLaughing, the expressive sisters Lillian and Mary Dapiran.</p>
   <p>A pleasing group, Isabel Borges, Transito Ferro, Rosario Garcia, Maria Ribado and Margot Islas.</p>
   <p>Another expressive group, the alluring Conchita Islas, Velia Garcia, Dolores Garcia, Irene de Carlo, Aida West, Conchita Olle, Mercedes Flores, Miss La Master, Ponsovella Pedroza and Miss Mowns.</p>
   <p>Among the ladies were Mrs. Consolacion Garriga, wife of the Vice-President; Nena Toribio was very elegant, Mrs. M. Serra, Maria Garcia, A. Rodriguez, Ramona Fernandez, Josefa Moreno, Mrs. de Ferro, Mrs. La Master and Maria Olle were also present.</p>
