      <p>Our church holds itself responsible for the spiritual welfare of its
members and insists that the same responsibility should be applied in
the religious relationship between Catholic parents and their children.
People are the children of the Catholic Church, and why should not the
church responsibility be followed in the case of parents and their off-
spring? We believe that everybody understands the value of religious
education for our children.</p>
      <p>If it is true that only parents brought up in the spirit of the Catholic
religion can educate their children rightly, it is also true that only
Catholic schools can give the children the right kind of education.</p>
      <p>The only objection against sending children to Catholic schools, as we
know, is the small fee of 50 cents a month which these schools charge.
This is the reason why Catholic parents send their children to public
schools instead of Catholic schools. Public sohools are good in every

respect, but they do not offer the Catholic discipline which is of so
great importance in building the child's character.</p>
      <p>There is no better place in the world to get religious education than
the Catholic schools.</p>
      <p>Parents. we warn you of your responsibilities
as members of the Catholic Church, and hope that our voice will be heard
 and the church rules obeyed.</p>
