      <p>Religious sentiment is not very deeply rooted in the human soul, but a certain
class of people is trying its best to develop this feeling in order to exploit
it. Often churches are built, religious customs invented, babies baptized, not
to create by all this a religious pious feeling, but in most cases to provide
a fine living for priests, popes, clerics, rabbis, etc.</p>
      <p>Clerics are using this pious sentiment as a means of gaining power over the
people's souls as well as a means of dominating their pocketbooks. An unholy
desire to live well, and a rebellion against progress is cleverly hidden under
the robes of the church attendants, by banners, a church press, tokens, ceremonies, 
observance of customs, etc.</p>
      <p>Clerics do not even hesitate to use political power by organizing, or supporting,
political organizations. To live well is the secret desire of clericalism, by
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0215.jpg" n="2"/>
now a most powerful organization. Anyone who feels deep down in his heart 
a cultural and moral responsibility must resist this unholy power.</p>
      <p>It is the fast growing and firm opinion of the thinking classes that clericalism
is nothing more than an open wound on the body of cultural and intellectual
life. This wound has become infected by now, and anybody serving the purpose
of clericalism is nothing but a parasite.</p>
      <p>We find a number of reasons cited by the anti-clerical front in its fight on
clericalism. Some of these are false pretenses of being pious by the clerics,
a strong but masked desire go achieve power over the souls of the people, with
the purpose of collecting for a comfortable living.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we find the argument advanced that Rome, together with the
rest of clericalism, is the worst enemy of our people's church.</p>
      <p>Finally, the worst misrepresentation of Christ's teachings is seen in the
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0216.jpg" n="3"/>
clerical life, customs, ceremonies, etc.</p>
      <p>There seems to be a strong fundamental truth in each one of these opinions.</p>
