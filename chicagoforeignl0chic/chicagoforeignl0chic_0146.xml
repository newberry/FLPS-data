    <body>
      <p>This year, 1926, is the 35th anniversary of the first Slovenian newspaper
in America. Our great joy is fully justified and we believe it will be
shared by all our friends in America.</p>
      <p>We know what help we all got from Amerikanski Slovenec during many years
of its existence. Friendly advice, interesting news concerning our life
here and the people in the old country, educational and religious guarding; 
moral, and in many cases, even financial help: all what we are
supposed to expect from a native publication we got, and got plenty of
it. There is no doubt in our mind that we could not live without our newspaper. 
Our newspaper is our history; its power cannot be easily overlooked.
Ask our old pioneers and leaders, our successful business people; all will
confess that Amerikanski Slovenec played an important part in their life's
struggles, in fights towards accomplishment.</p>
      <p>Our newspaper was the strong cement that united our divided opinion, our
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0147.jpg" n="2"/>
ideal of native unity.</p>
      <p>It is true that our newspaper fulfills the ideal of native apostles.
Thirty-five years ago the voice of a small newspaper told to our people the
first truth, that there is hope for all of us in America to become solid in our
ideas, economically powerful and a highly organized and respected nationality.
From the Atlantic to the Pacific this friendly voice announced great news.</p>
      <p>For years and years Amerikanski Slovenec has filled its pages with stories
illustrating our life and it will be the truth and nothing else if we claim
that this newspaper is a living history of our people in this country.</p>
      <p>Amerikanski Slovenec was established Sept. 3. 1891. The first issue of this
newspaper was printed on Racine Avenue, Chicago. The first issue and the
others which followed during six months were a thing looking paper of two
small pages. Even in this size Amerikanski Slovenec could not exist very
long on account of chronical lack of money. For non-payment of rent it was
evicted from its printing shop and forced to move to the Northside of Chicago.
The only way to save the paper was to find someone who would have enough
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0148.jpg" n="3"/>
money to finance it until subscriptions could cover the overhead. This
solution was found in a deal which brought about the sale of Amerikanski
Slovenec to an ex-priest from Tower, Minn., Father Buh, who paid $600
for it. The man who started it and owned it is our Chicago Slovenian
Mr. Anton Murnik.</p>
      <p>Success came very soon, not through the financial standing of Father Buh,

but through his hard work and influence. There never were enough subscribers 
to pay expenses, but Father Buh found the friendly support of

a few sympathizers. This fact is convincing that it is not money that

will keep a publication in existence, but the personal influence and 

energy of its managers.</p>
      <p>Amerikanski Slovenec moved to Tower. Minn., where Father Buh held a position

as pastor in St. Martin's Church.</p>
      <p>The worst problem in the existence ofâ€˜ this newspaper was lack of good

Slovenian writers. Reporters from small towns were not skilled in editorial

work. Translated articles sounded so funny in the Slovene language that

<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0149.jpg" n="4"/>

many readers complained that they could not understand clearly the meaning

of the articles.</p>
      <p>At that time Amerikanski Slovenec had already 600 subscribers and more than

200 copies were distributed free of charge. In spite of that, financial

difficulties were pressing so hard that Father Buh was forced to sell it.

This time, it seems, luck was on the side of Amerikanski Slovenec. The

new owner, Tiskovna Druzba, Joliet, Ill., put the publication on a paying

basis, but its normal existence came to an end on account of the transfer 
of its chief stockholder, Rev. Susterich, who went to Europe. Then

came the joke of a lifetime: the Slovenian newspaper passed into German

ownership. This period was fatal for the newspaper, but salvation came

again when Amerikanski Slovenec was bought by its present owner, Tiskovna

Druzba Edinost.</p>
      <p>We must repeat again that for over 35 years our Amerikanski Slovenec has

been the beginning of everything in Slovenian life in America. We simply

cannot imagine the existence of our social, cultural and benevolent societies 
without Amerikanski Slovenec. We are proud of being owners of

our own and oldest newspaper, and intend to support it to the end.</p>
