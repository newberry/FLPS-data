      <p>It is pleasant to know that Croats and Slovenes united together in reli-
gious and social work in South Chicago. As a result of this cooperation
we have a new church building with a school, which has over 250 children
already. Just a few blocks away we have another school of St. Patrick's
Church. This school has 320 children. There is also St. Jury's School, with
a large number of children enrolled. Our schools have, beside Slovenian
and Croatian children, also Polish, Slovak and Italian. All those nationalities heartily support our church and school. This just shows that great
work can be done if all our people get together and forget their misunderstandings. At least our school problem is solved to a certain extent,
so far as South Chicago is concerned.</p>
      <p>It was really hard for our children to walk or ride every day to the
Calumet Public School, and now when we have three schools of our own.
children will enjoy school work and save their energy.</p>
