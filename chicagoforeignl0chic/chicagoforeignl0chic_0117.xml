      <p>On the 15th of June the Catholic Printing Society "Edinost" held its regular
conference of priests and shareholders of this society, from Chicago and
vicinity.</p>
      <p>Rev. James Cerne, assisted by other priests, gave his blessing to the new
printing machinery and the premises occupied by the printing shop.</p>
      <p>After the blessing a banquet was given in honor of the guests and employees of
this shop. The premises had been decorated for this occasion. After supper
the president of the society, Mr. John Jerich, opened the program of music and
songs. Among the speakers we noticed a number of guests from Ohio, Wisconsin
and Illinois. All speakers pointed out the great need of a Catholic press,
and expressed the opinion that only through this press will the American
Slovenes be successful in the political and religious fields.</p>
      <pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0118.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>A comical interpretation of stories from Rev. Cerne's colorful life brought much
laughter. The speakers selected as their keynote the idea of propaganda for an
educational campaign. All suggestions were accepted by the audience with applause.</p>
      <p>On this occasion we had the pleasure of hearing the brilliant voice of our well
known singer, Miss Kosmach, who gave an artistic touch to this meeting.</p>
      <p>In God we trust, and with His blessing upon our education work we strongly
believe in our ability to carry on our national ideals with success, and
gain dutiful recognition for our people here and abroad. Support, sympathy
and recognition will be the best testimony that our ideals are accepted
and are bringing happiness to our people.</p>
      <p>We rightfully call our society "Edinost," which means "unity‚Äù, and it means
also that we must strive to preserve this unity if we expect success and victory
in our fight for existence as a Slovene nation. Such a noble goal as the
preservation of national ideals is worth all the suffering, struggle and
sacrifice in the world.</p>
      <p>Please do not refuse your support to our society, and the society will do its
share in building our national unity.</p>
