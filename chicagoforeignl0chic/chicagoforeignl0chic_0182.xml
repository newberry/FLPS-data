      <p>The SLOVENSKA NARODNA PODPORNA JEDNOTA (Slovenian National Benefit Union)
decided at its fifth Convention, which was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to
work for socialistic principles.  Delegates of 10,000 members, who are scattered
all over the United States will try to influence these Members to work for the
Socialist party and to join it or the Jugoslav Socialist branches or where such
do not exist to organize them.</p>
      <p>At the convention there were 130 delegates present, among them two from
Mexico. Out of them 80 were members of some Socialist organization, while the rest of them side with socialism.</p>
      <p>At the contention as the main speaker was Comrad ETRINKRISTAN. His speech
was well as of other Socialist speakers was received with great enthusiasm.</p>
