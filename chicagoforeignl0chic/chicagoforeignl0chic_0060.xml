    <body>
      <p>Unemployment nowadays is as bad with Slovenes as with a great many people
in America. We Slovenes, it seems, have been hit harder than people of
any other nationality for the simple reason that the majority of our 
people are employed in two major industries: steel and coal mines. Both
above named industries are suffering hard from lack of production, so
workers get laid off daily and (are) thrown on the streets.</p>
      <p>The coming winter surely will bring a lot of sorrow, and even tragedy, to
our people. Those who have been hit by the depression or suffer from
lack of employment must be helped, and that help must come first from 
us. Last Saturday St. Stjefan Society invited all Slovenes in Chicago 
to be present on a special meeting, where plans for relief to the unemployed
will be discussed.</p>
      <p>We Slovenes always have been known as a people with kind hearts, and 
we sincerely believe that on this occasion our help will come quickly and sufficiently.</p>
