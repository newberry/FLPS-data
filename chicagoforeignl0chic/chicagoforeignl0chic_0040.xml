      <p>We, Slovenes in America, do not have so many cultural institutions. Next
Sunday, June 14, we can consider as a day of great importance for all
Slovenes in America, and especially for our people living in the small
town of Lemont. Illinois.</p>
      <p>On this memorable day our people in this town will have a happy occasion
to witness the brilliant celebration of the opening of the institution,
the only one of its kind in America, the new Catholic College of St.
Francis. We have not enough words to describe fully the great importance
of this cultural institution, its role to be played in cultural life of
our people, not only in Lamont, but in all places of this country where
our people exist. We believe that the opening of this institution will
start a new era in our life.</p>
      <p>The main purpose of this college is to give our people highly educated
spiritual leaders and priests. Also to build a center from where culture
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0041.jpg" n="2"/>
will be radiating among our people. This institution has also other
noble ideals, as to guard our religious standard from our enemy, who
is doing its destructive work from its nest in Lawndale Street, Chicago.
Religion is a great power and necessity in our life, and everybody who
works against such power is really offering very bad service to our people.</p>
