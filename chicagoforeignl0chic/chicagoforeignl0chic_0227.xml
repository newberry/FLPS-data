      <p>On November 28, 1918 several of the Slovenian organizations, such as the Slovenes
Republican Organization and branches of Slovenian women organizations, called a
mass meeting at Pilsen Auditorium.</p>
      <p>The main purpose of this meeting was to protest against the Italian aspiration to
annex Jugoslavian sea-borders.</p>
      <p>The meeting was called to order by Frank Zaitz, who explained the purpose of the
meeting and read the resolution, which was signed by thirty thousand Slovenians
and will be transmitted to President Wilson.</p>
      <p>A few excellent speakers offered lectures on the question of Slovenian and Jugoslavian 
integrity and their right to decide the future of their people, living on
the Jugoslavian border, which the present Italian government is trying to occupy.
All speakers pointed out the strong wish of the Slovenian people abroad to keep
their independence. They expressed their hope that America, in accordance with the
<pb facs="chicagoforeignl0chic_0228.jpg" n="2"/>
Peace Conference Policy, will protect the minority.</p>
      <p>F. Zaitz also read an appeal, which has been transmitted to a number of administrative 
and political bodies, asking support in the Slovenian resistance to annexation.
The Slovenes from all political factions agreed to work shoulder to shoulder on this
important question of Slovene liberty.</p>
      <p>The Slovenes, who attended this meeting expressed their strong protest against the
London Pact, which permitted the Italians to occupy the Jugoslavian border.</p>
      <p>In order to cover expenses to transmit the appeals and pay rent for the hall, the
people collected the sum of $63.30.</p>
      <p>Great hope for President Wilson's intervention in this grave situation prevailed.</p>
