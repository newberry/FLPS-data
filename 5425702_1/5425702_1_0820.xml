   <p>The dean of Italian attorneys in Chicago, Rocco DeStefano, has reported another victory in a suit for damage.</p>
   <p>Attorney De Stefano was born in Chicago of Italian parents from the region of Campania and received his diploma from the University of Lake Forest, 32 years ago. Since 1897 he has been president of his class. He is president of the Justinian Socity of Advocates and Secretary of the Committee for the coming exposition of 1933 and a member of the executive council of the Knight Templar and Shriners. He won first prize from the Chicago Tribune for his treatise on the solution of the crime problem; he is also a music critic of note. He was the lawyer for the defense in the Nitti-Crudele case in which case the defendents after having been given a death sentence, were given their freedom. He is legal counsel for various prominent firms of this city.</p>
