   <p>President of the section James Ozello, and the members: Messrs. Maestro-Valerio, Mirando, Chiostri and Schmidt were present.</p>
   <p>The memorial sent to the Chamber by the representative of the Federal Government in regard to the colonization plan in the state of Texas. A plan which would be under the surveillance of the Government itself, giving the colonists full protection against any fraud or lapse in any promise made by the land owners.</p>
   <p>The plan was discussed in minute detail by Mr. Schmidt, who is an expert, and by a suggestion of the Secretary of the Section, Mr. Maestro-Valerio: it was approved to ask the Italian Ambassador at Washington for confirmation of the suggestion made by the Government's representative, and to have the approval of the Embassy before inducing Italians to settle on land for farms.</p>
   <p>Another colonization suggestion, made by Carl N. Baer was read, and it was decided to write to him, asking for the latest information concerning his territory selling conditions, etc., also to ask him to let us know if he would permit one <pb facs="5425702_1_0990.jpg" n="2"/>of our committees to visit his territory and investigate it.</p>
   <p>C.R. Schmidt and A. Maestro-Valerio were appointed to form the Commission which will visit and inspect the other colonization projects in the state of Missouri on the 24th of this month.</p>
