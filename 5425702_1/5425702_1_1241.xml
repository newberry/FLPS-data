   <p>The day set aside as Italian Day at A Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, July 15, will also be the first anniversary of the arrival in this city of the air squadron led by Air Marshal Italo Balboa. The order was officially announced by the Fair Administration, which is in accord with the Italian Consulate and the Italian-American Committee, presided over by Judge John Sbarbaro.</p>
   <p>On that day, the Roman column donated by His Excellency Benito Mussolini to the City of Chicago as a permanent record of the glorious and epic trans-Atlantic flight of the Italian air squadron will be dedicated.</p>
   <p>The column will be erected in front of the Italian pavilion at the Fair. Among those participating in the ceremony will be the Governor of Illinois, the Mayor of Chicago, the Royal Counsellor to the Italian Embassy in Washington, representing the Italian Ambassador, and the highest civic and military authorities of the city as well as Bishop Sheil.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1242.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His Excellency, Italo Balboa, will speak over the radio from Rome and his speech will be transmitted by the leading radio chains of America. The ceremony will take place at 2 P.M. of that day. It will be followed by a program of songs, dances, and speeches, in the Hall of States.</p>
   <p>We beg all Italians and Italian-Americans from Chicago and vicinity to attend. The larger the demonstration, the greater the honor to Balboa and his comrades.</p>
