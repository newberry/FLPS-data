   <p>La Parola Dei Socialisti eight pages, is an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>It is with sincere joy that we announce to our comrades and readers that not only will we issue our newspaper in eight pages but we will move up the date of its publication.</p>
   <p>Instead of February 14 or 21, the newspaper increased to eight pages, will be published February 7 beginning with the next issue.</p>
   <p>This important improvement in our newspaper was accomplished thanks to the enthusiasm and the dollars with which our comrades and friends answered our appeal.</p>
   <p>We asked for 100 in order to get fifty. We asked for $3,000, and already we have collected more than $600 through subscribers only, not counting the subscriptions not yet accounted (sic).</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1325.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is a victory for the Italian Socialists of America. No other newspaper could have accomplished so much in a period of crisis such as the one we are going through.</p>
   <p>But we beg our comrades not to cease their efforts because of the success gained.</p>
   <p>The eight page newspaper will cost us more than what it costs now, and to support it, it is necessary to have more money.</p>
   <p>We are confident that all of our comrades will now feel the necessity of circulating our newspaper, which thanks to this improvement, will be the best weekly publication in the Italian language in America.</p>
   <p>This, comrades, is another milestone toward a daily newspaper. Our next step will be a semi-weekly paper, and we hope that this will be accomplished in one years' time, when the machinery, of the co-operative will be paid for.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1326.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From a semi-weekly to a daily paper only one step is necessary. And we are dreaming already of seeing La Parola published daily by the beginning of the presidential campaign of 1916, when the Italian Socialists shall acquire strength and influence in the Socialistic movement of America.</p>
   <p>At the right time we will explain our program with which meanwhile without many sacrifices, we can start to raise the funds to make La Parola a daily. At present we think that it is the duty of every comrade to circulate our newspaper in the best way possible.</p>
   <p>We would like to advise our comrades and friends that the subscription lists which they still have can always be used, and we wish that they will be returned to us very soon, with the names of many new subscribers.</p>
   <p>We take this opportunity, as does the Executive Council, to thank every one of those that in any way have co-operated to increase the size and circulation of our newspaper, symbol and banner of proletarian vindication.</p>
