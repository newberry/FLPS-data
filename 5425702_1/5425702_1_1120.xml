   <p>The other day Prof. G. Vecchione had the satisfaction of knowing that he had been awarded the Diploma of Honor and the Gold Medal, for his composition entitled "Libia," and the Silver Medal for his intermezzo, "Sconforto." The prizes were given by the St. Cecilia Musical Academy of New York in a contest which it sponsored.</p>
   <p>The good news was given with the following letter:</p>
