   <p>On Sunday, May 23, a meeting was held in Rotis Hall in favor of war and in protest against Attorney De Stefano, accused of pro-Germanism and of anti-Italian propaganda.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a failure, in spite of its being advertised by a mob of pro-war fanatics, who had made an uproar in the streets and squares of the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Both the audience and their enthusiasm were scanty, while the speeches amounted to a veritable disaster.</p>
   <p>The chairman's appearance was ludicrous,-worthy, however, of such a mob.</p>
   <p>A wretched lawyer made one of those aimless speeches which have no foundation in common sense or reality.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0746.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In language that was Italian only in name other lawyers praised the war, Italy, the fatherland, etc. But after all, they could very well afford to talk in that way,- for it is so easy to make speeches about the European War, while remaining in Chicago!</p>
