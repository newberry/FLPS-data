   <p>On Saturday, May 22, under the auspices of the Italian Royal Consulate and Consul General Franco Fontana, the 131st Infantry Armory was the scene of a big demonstration in commemoration of the glorious events of April 21, May 9, and May 24.</p>
   <p>In attendance were: The Order of the Sons of Italy, headed by its grand venerable, J. Spatuzza, the Italo-American National Union, headed by its president general, Philip D'Andrea, the Riciglianesi Associations, headed by Paolo De Leonardi, the veterans, headed by M. Butera, and many other societies, as well as the most distinguished persons of our colony.</p>

   <p>The silver cup offered as prize for the best group was awarded to the Riciglianesi girls, who were coached by Dr. Aurelio Pagano. The other prizes offered by Dr. Quattrone, president of the Banco di Napoli Trust Company were awarded to Mrs. Pope of the Italian Women's club, and to Mrs. Zullo of the Sons of Italy group.</p>
   <p>The program was in charge of Mr. A. Ferme, vice-consul, G. Dell'Agnol, professor P. Pomante, and attorney O. Tocco. These gentlemen had much to do with organizing the demonstration.</p>
   <p>Great enthusiasm was around by the ballet performed by a group of girls led by the well-known dancer Ruth Pryor, and also by the musical program rendered by the orchestra, which was conducted by maestro Bruno Beghe.</p>

   <p>Among those responsible for the success of the special edition, which contained the printed program the following are worthy of mention: Messrs. L. Marcucci of the Gonnella Baking Company, Solitano, Mattucci, Santo Garofalo, and P. Colianni, and Dr. Zingrone.</p>
   <p>The only speaker of the evening was Consul General F. Fontana,who thanked all who had cooperated toward the success of the celebration. The net proceeds of the evening will be used for the teaching of the Italian language and to finance a trip to Italy for those students who excel in that study in public or parochial schools.</p>
