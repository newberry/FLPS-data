   <p>The Council read a letter from the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, which stated that the annual subsidy was being forwarded to the Chamber for 1915 - 1916.</p>
   <p>A report was read on the work of the Import and Export Commission, also on the telegram sent to the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce in Rome, in which he was asked to repeal or modify the order prohibiting the exporting of cheese. The Commission asked the Council to authorize the expense of the telegram which was $15.18, and this was granted. The same Commission then advised the Council to keep in the office information on current exchange rates, so that members could avail themselves of it.</p>

   <p>The report of the Commission on Commercial Information followed. The report gave an investigation by the Commission of stock sold to many Italians here, so that Italians could be rightly advised as to its soundness.</p>
   <p>The Propaganda Commission stated that it had received suggestions from the Union of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, to spread printed information as to why Italy had entered the war. After a discussion, the President of the Propaganda Commission was ordered to prepare the answer to be given.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned at 5:45 P. M.</p>
