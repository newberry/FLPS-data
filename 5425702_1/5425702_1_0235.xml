<title level="a">ANGRY ITALIANS DEMAND THE REMOVAL OF THE LOCAL CONSUL</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Such a strong and violent meeting as the one held last night at the hall of the Forward Club by the Italians in favor of the much persecuted editor, Oscar Durante, has not been equaled for a long time.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called by the President of the Italian Labor Union, Dominico Avallone.</p>
   <p>The Consul is accused of neglecting to display the Italian flag on September 20, although the Italian government ordered the representative to do so. The Italians here interpret it as an act of contempt against them.</p>
   <p>When Dr. Nicola Re tried to defend the Consul, a wild excitement took possession of the crowd, and a dozen Italians stormed the platform and forced Dr. Re's immediate retreat.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were made amidst the tumult, in which the conduct of the Consul September 20, and his attacks upon the Italian newspapers were severely criticised.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0236.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Re declared that the Consul had given orders to raise the flag on that particular date, but that his order was not carried out by mistake. The Italians demand the removal of the Consul.</p>
