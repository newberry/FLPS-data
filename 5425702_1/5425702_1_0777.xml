   <p>You certainly know that, thanks to a law passed in 1913, the women of Illinois have acquired the right to vote.</p>
   <p>This political victory for the women has aroused great enthusiasm throughout America as well as Europe, because it marks another step toward the emancipation of the women, the cause of many bitter struggles and sacrifices all over the world, by the more advanced feminine element.</p>
   <p>The women of all nationalities in Chicago are ready to vote at the next city election, which will be held April 7th. They want to prove to the men that women can occupy themselves intelligently in politics, and are able to give advice on how public affairs must be conducted in city, state, or nation.</p>
   <p>They want to prove that it is possible to be good housekeepers, good mothers, good nurses, and at the same time completely conscious of the troubles and disasters which may affect their families if one party is in power rather <pb facs="5425702_1_0778.jpg" n="2"/>than another.</p>
   <p>At the next election, about 300,000 women will vote in Chicago.</p>
   <p>What do the Italian women intend to do? Do they intend to remain at the end of the line, even on this occasion, and allow others to say that the Italian women are the laggards in Chicago?</p>
   <p>Several months ago, at the Hull House, a women's mass-meeting was held on the question of the right to vote.</p>
   <p>About thirty nationalities were represented--but not one Italian woman was present!</p>
   <p>Do you wish it to be said that since the Italian women do not show any interest in the question of the vote--they do not deserve it?</p>
   <p>We hope it is not true.</p>
   <p>In keeping yourselves on the same level as the women of other nationalities, <pb facs="5425702_1_0779.jpg" n="3"/>you can do honor to Italy and accomplish, if you wish, an act of real patriotism.</p>
   <p>Now is the opportunity to demonstrate the influence of Italy and what its women can do. If on this question of the right to vote you would display one hundredth part of the interest that you show in your church celebrations and parades, or in the selection of your stylish hats or dresses, etc., you would see how the Italian name would acquire honor and importance among the various racial groups in this country.</p>
   <p>It is necessary, then, that Italian women also avail themselves of the civic right of voters, and show to Chicago that Italy is not a backward nation.</p>
   <p>Above all, for the vital interests of your families, do not fail to vote for the Socialist candidates.</p>
