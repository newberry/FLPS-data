   <p>The Mineral waters are gaining in importance on the American market, and particularly on the Chicago market. In fact, while 117,313 dozens of bottles were imported in 1910, 158,812 dozens of bottles were unloaded in 1912. It is also known that in a proportionate measure, consumption of mineral waters have increased in Chicago. It is significant that this increase occurs in spite of an advertising campaign on the part of the American firms.</p>
   <p>The best known foreign mineral waters are the Apollinaris, (German) and the Vichy (French) (brands which are well known; and whose local agents are carrying on an extensive advertising campaign in newspapers and magazines).</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1008.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The importation of Italian mineral water in the United States is insignificant. In fact, it is calculated that during the year of 1912, 229 dozens of bottles were consumed in Chicago. Of that quantity, 63 dozens of bottles were directly imported by the Italian local firms and the others arrived from New York and other ports.</p>
   <p>It is known that the Italian importers have tried to introduce the Italian mineral water in the United States, but with no success because the Italian exporters are not willing to advertise their products. Those few dozen bottles cost the importers as much as the German and French waters cost the consumers.</p>
   <p>The Italian mineral waters will not be a success until the exporter is willing to make his products known through the medium of advertising.</p>
