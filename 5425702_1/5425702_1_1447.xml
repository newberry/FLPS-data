   <p>Countess Cipriani will give a lecture on Thursday night May 20, at Bowen Hall, in the Hull House, under the auspices of the Circolo Italiano. Countess Cipriani is in the United States as a representative of the Department of Foreign Propaganda and was sent here by the Italian Government.</p>
   <p>The speaker will talk on the preparation of Italy for the war, and on the great success in making Italy one of the greatest nations in the world. Countess Cipriani has a degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Chicago. She is a writer and poet, and is the author of a book called A Tuscan Child which has been much praised in the United States. She is the daughter and niece of two heroes of the Italian Rebirth(Risorgimento), and the sister of a man who died in action and was decorated for bravery at the personal wish of the king.</p>
   <p>The Italian women of our colony are invited to attend in large numbers the lecture of this woman who has devoted all of her time to the cause of Italian propaganda. Invitations have been sent out by Mrs. Dina Censotte who is connected with the Immigrants Commission.</p>
