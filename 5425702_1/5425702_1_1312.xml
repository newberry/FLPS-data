   <p>February 17, 1924, this newspaper's anniversary, is the right day for us to ask our comrades to intensify their activities in spreading its circulation.</p>
   <p>In comparison with last year, the financial condition of our paper is much better, but, still we need to erase entirely the existing deficit.</p>
   <p>The constructive work done by the Italian Socialists of America during last year is of considerable value.</p>
   <p>We proposed to build our own "House of the people" and what at first seemed visionary is now a fact. We paid out about $3,000 and cleared our paper's deficit.</p>
   <p>We proposed to buy a machine for our paper and it was done.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1313.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now that we have the house in which is installed our printing shop, we need only a rotating press to print our paper so that it may become biweekly.</p>
   <p>Comrades! We should be proud to have accomplished so much constructive work in this time of need and unemployment for the furtherance of an ideal that joins us into one class party which teaches us to struggle for our and the working class right, and leads us on the road to a new horizon. We must follow slowly but surely our task and from a small "house" build large reading rooms, cooperative stores, and from publishing a weekly newspaper to publishing it bi-weekly and, as soon as possible, daily.</p>
   <p>All may be accomplished with our good will. It is necessary only to have a perfect comprehension of Socialism, and propagate it among our brother workers or among our worst enemies.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1314.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Comrades! We must act so that every member of the Italian Socialist federation is able to do his duty.</p>
   <p>It is unjust that a small university only and always must assume the weight of supporting our newspaper, which deserves that help of all the oppressed.</p>
   <p>It is absurd to expect fiancial help from the unemployed, but it is logical to expect the unemployed brother to perform his duty by speaking propaganda and by circulating our newspaper so as to procure new subscribers.</p>
   <p>It is advisable for them, when they go seeking a job, to carry a few copies of La Parola, to distribute them among the other unemployed who are looking for work, so that they may understand how overproduction <pb facs="5425702_1_1315.jpg" n="4"/>is creating unemployment.</p>
   <p>In doing that he will sow in fertile soil, and he who sows will reap.</p>
   <p>We are very weak in comparsion to those who have the monopoly of power; we cannot remain in the stage in which we are; we must increase our strength by steady propaganda. We cannot hesitate any more; too long have we waited for others to do what we are supposed to do.</p>
   <p>It is time to show what we are able to do. With you, comrades, friends, and sympathizers, rests the task to break that thorny crown which is torturing the being of the proletarian class which produces everything and enjoys nothing.</p>
   <p>Help spread our press, which protects and enlightens the new horizon from which is breaking forth a more beautiful future, more just and more human for the future generation.</p>
