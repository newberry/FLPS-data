   <p>Various organizations are sponsoring the plan of teaching women, especially the foreigners, the exercise of that right which they have but recently acquired; the right to vote. For that purpose several American women, members of the City Club, organized and held a meeting last week, to which were invited representatives of all the foreign women's groups in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by women of Bohemian, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, German and Hebrew extraction; but women of our race were conspicuously absent. The invitation had been extended to them as well as the others.</p>
   <p>There was present, however, an American woman married to an Italian who had lived in Rome for thirty years. She was asked to say a few words in the name of the absent Italian women. She made this statement: "Every Italian woman when asked to interest herself in a program of betterment for her sex, invariably answers, "I must first ask my husband."</p>

   <p>The new law, as applied in the State of Illinois, is as follows: Widows and unmarried women who are not born of American parents, must naturalize themselves in order to acquire the right to vote. Women whose husbands are already citizens have the right to vote, as do their daughters.</p>
   <p>Any information desired on this question can be acquired at Hull House.</p>
