   <p>On January 26, at 108 East Chicago Avenue, a festival was held for the benefit of the branch of the Socialist Party of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dr. Galileo Albano, who was chosen as speaker for the occasion, failed to come because of illness. M. Palmiere, who spoke on the financial depression which we are going through, was substituted for him. He stated that laborers are unemployed because we have produced too much and we are starving because too much food is stored in the warehouses of the capitalists.</p>
   <p>Those blind to common reasons, those too lazy to organize, those who do not believe because of their stubbornness, and the capitalists, who have a very easy existence do not feel the enormous injustice. Only a step would be sufficient to break the horrible chain.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0523.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The vase is almost filled. One more drop and the angry laborers patience will be exhausted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Palmiere presented his speech with considerable vigor. A dance followed, and in spite of this financial distress of the laborers, the celebration was very profitable.</p>
