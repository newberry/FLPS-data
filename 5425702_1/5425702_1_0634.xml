   <p>The Republican organization of the First Ward, has celebrated the victory of Mr. Francis Brady, for his election as State Senator, with a banquet that took place at Central Hall at 22nd and Wabash Avenue. More than two hundred guests, among them many well known politicians, were present. Very expensive presents were given to Mr. Brady.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was the Judge Kavanaugh, who praised the political honesty of Mr. Brady. Then a first lieutenant, mutilated in the recent World War, spoke and he had words of great admiration for the Italians of the 19th Ward, that fought with him in the war, like lions. His speech received many cheers.</p>
   <p>Judge Barasa, delivered a great speech also, and he too, was applauded. His popularity is gaining ground every day. During the banquet, we had the opportunity to hear good music and songs through the generosity of Mr. James Colosimo.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0635.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Admired was the trio formed by the Cav. Isidore Prati, tenor; D. Giacobelli, baritone; and Mrs. D. Atta, soprano. They revealed themselves as true artists. Miss Dale winters, with her beautiful voice, sang a few songs and at the end, Mr. Piccolo, an expert amateur, sang two Neapolitan songs with much feeling. Everyone was praised and admired. At the piano, was the expert maestro, Minutolo.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we can say that the banquet was very successful, and very congenial, and we give our best congratulations and thanks to the organizers, Mr. Adolph Marx, Hector Durante, and John Rausau.</p>
