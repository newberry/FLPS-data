   <p>Dear Members:</p>
   <p>Here we are again to report to you the work done by the Chamber during this administration, which is about to end.</p>
   <p>If the Presidency is not in a condition to show a prosperous financial condition, however we call your attention to the fact, that the Chamber's work increased considerably this year, and you will be convinced after hearing the annual reports of the Commissions of Imports and Exports and Commercial Information. As I said before, I would like to show you a good financial condition in the Chamber, but we should congratulate ourselves on the really important results of our institution, if it wasn't for the European War, causing, at the present time, such unsettled conditions. The war has caused the loss of several of our members, produced considerable work for the Chamber, and we have not only increased the wages of our Secretary, but also <pb facs="5425702_1_0958.jpg" n="2"/>have taken on new personnel. Considering the extraordinary expenses for telegrams, cablegrams and stamps, I think that we should be rather pleased at our present condition.</p>
   <p>Never has the Chamber fulfilled its duty as it has during this year, never has the Chamber had such practical results as in 1915, and never has our institution been as useful as in this passing administration.</p>
   <p>As an example of our activities we like to state that when the dispatch from Italy arrived informing us of the seriousness of the earthquake, we promoted a popular subscription which produced $7,000.</p>
   <p>We have compiled for the members use, a complete and accurate list of all retail merchants of food products residing in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Nebraska.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0959.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We urged the Italians to buy bonds on the Italian Government Loan issued in the United States. We prepared reports on the silk market in the United States and made some translations for the members. We answered inquiries of Italians and Americans.</p>
   <p>The industrial section has accomplished some important work. The agriculture section met several times to discuss colonization problems, while Mr. Mastrovalerio, secretary, has always answered letters sent to him by agents of farm lands, and by persons who desire to dedicate themselves to farming. The Propaganda Commission took the initiative for the subscriptions in favor of the earthquake victims, and has compiled a long report for the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Italy, about a program of propaganda of Italianism in the United States, in defence of the reasons which forced Italy to enter the European conflict.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0960.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The commission which has accomplished a phenomenal piece of work and deserves loads of credit is the Commission on Exports and Imports. It would be enough to only glance at the volume of correspondence belonging to that commission to convince yourself of the useful results obtained.</p>
   <p>Since I am talking on this subject, I wish to repeat that according to my judgment the work of this Chamber of Commerce was of much benefit to industrial manufacturers and Italian exporters, and in appreciation of our efforts, our Government should increase the subsidy.</p>
   <p>Many Italian products are being appreciated here now, while a few years ago it was impossible to find anything of Italian manufacture, excepting certain articles which represent specialties of Italian make; now there is a market for straw or felt hats, silk handwork, art works and many other Italian products, and it really is good news to hear that Italians know how to produce things that are satisfactory.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0961.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The general development of the Chamber has been very pleasing. The Executive Council met regularly to handle the questions submitted to it, and after the resignation of the treasurer, Mr. Mastrogiovanni, Councilor Giovanni Rigali was elected.</p>
