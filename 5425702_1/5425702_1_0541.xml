<title level="a">ITALIAN COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE CROWE'S CANDIDACY</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>An Italian committee has been formed for the purpose of supporting the candidacy of Judge Crowe for State's Attorney of Illinois. This committee has sent an appeal to the Italian voter, as follows:</p>
   <p>Italian Voters -</p>
   <p>On the fifteenth day of the following month, the Republican Party of Cook County will nominate its candidate for State's Attorney.</p>
   <p>Only two of the candidates in the race for the nomination have any chance of winning. One is David Matchett, who has the backing of the News and the Tribune, and the other is Judge Crowe, who has the support of the Thompson organization. Unfortunately, a member of our race, Bernard Barasa, has declared himself in the race for the candidacy, running as an Independent, without the support of any newspaper or political organization. The only result of this move on the part of Barasa, in a county that carries 900,000 registered voters, will be to take away a large part of the Italian vote from Judge Crowe, who has always been a loyal and fervid friend of our people, who <pb facs="5425702_1_0542.jpg" n="2"/>married a woman of our race, who is raising an Italian family and has always shown himself in sympathy with the aspirations of our people.</p>
   <p>In this manner the success of Matchett, who has nothing in common with our race and is completely indifferent to our desires, is more than assured.</p>
   <p>A vote for Barasa is a vote for Matchett. Therefore, we beg of you not to allow yourselves to be misled; give all your support to our friend, Judge Robert E. Crowe; vote for him and in that way assure his nomination and election.</p>
