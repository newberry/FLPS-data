  <body>
   <p>Another encouraging manifestation of our Socialist movement in Chicago was the picnic held Sunday, June 17, at Riverview Park. It is the opinion of every comrade that the attendance this year was greater than that of preceeding years.</p>
   <p>This is a sure sign that our party is gaining the place it deserves among the masses. At an early hour Sunday morning, large numbers of comrades and their families entered the park to enjoy a day of relaxation, gaiety, and friendliness, in the beautiful Big Grove of Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>As usual, separate groups were formed by each nationality. The Italian group was very large. Besides the most active comrades, many sympathizers and friends were present.</p>
   <p>The songs and the musical program were much appreciated. They contributed, in large part, to the success and gaiety of the day.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1262.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many speeches were delivered in different languages. For the Italian group, the speakers were comrades Romualdi and Bellandi.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party may, with good reason, record this as a day well spent - from the standpoint of propaganda - and moral and financial success.</p>
