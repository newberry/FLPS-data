   <p>We are pleased to notify the entire colony of an event which was given last Thursday by the Italian Circle of the Hull House.</p>
   <p>Among the artists who tock part in the program was Guido Cian, tenor, who displayed the marvelous quality of his voice in three Italian melodies, and was very much applauded.</p>
   <p>For those who wish to know this young singer more intimately, his studio is located at 643 Jackson Blvd. (Lyon and Healy Bldg.), where he gives vocal lessons.</p>
   <p>Miss Rebecca Lemmle followed with three modern dances, which pleased the public very much. She is only ten years old and is considered a prodigy.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1204.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The public continuously applauded when Miss Josephine Rolla played classical Italian music at the piano.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank De Louise who sang in both Italian and English, won the admiration of the audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Amelio Colantoni, who came from Italy several months ago to complete social studies, spoke at the end, explaining the ideals which will form the new life of the circle. This young man, with rapid and sculptured strokes, gave a clear picture of actual conditions today, maintaining the necessity of culture and education to a high degree.</p>
