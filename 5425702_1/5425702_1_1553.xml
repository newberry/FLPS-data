   <p>Growth of the Italo-American National Union from a small group of immigrants from Sicily, to a society with nearly 5,000 members, including some of the leading citizens of Chicago, and with fraternal insurance of more than $5,000,000 in force, was described to the Journal today by Constantino Vitello, Supreme Vice-President of the organization and prominent jeweler.</p>
   <p>The Italo-American National Union was founded thirty-one years ago in Chicago by a small group of immigrants from Sicily for the purpose of mutual assistance in case of sickness, and for the payment of a mortuary benefit to the widows and orphans of a deceased member. The Italians in Chicago in the early days were counted only by the hundreds which made it imperative for them, as people of other nationalities have done in this country, to unite and form societies, where they could go occasionally to spend a few pleasant hours of their time with their kind, and with whom they had a common language and interest.</p>
   <p>Young Man Take Hold</p>
   <p>In 1922, after twenty-five years of life, during which time the organization <pb facs="5425702_1_1554.jpg" n="2"/>had had its ups and downs, like similar societies, but during which period it had contributed morally and materially to the upbuilding of the Italians of Chicago through its social and charitable activities, due to a lack of foresight in its officers, the society found itself with but 600 demoralized members and unable to meet its obligations. It was then that a group of the younger members. the more Americanized, asked to be given an opportunity to adopt the system and changes they had advocated to the older element. The younger men were given their opportunity and they made good since at the end of 1922 the members had risen from 600 to 2,000 and the assets to $32,000, after clearing a $3,000 deficit for 1921.</p>
   <p>Officers Held to Task</p>
   <p>Today, due to the good work of the officers elected in 192<gap unit="chars" extent="2" reason="illegible"/>, who are still in office, having been elected for five consecutive terms, the Italo-American National Union has a membership of  36 lodges thoroughly organized to spread the gospel of fraternalism among the Italians in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1555.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is the only Italian organization with a juvenile department, that has a deposit with the State of Illinois of $100,000, and the only scientifically managed fraternal insurance society among the Italians in the United States. This organization has never been second in extending help to unfortunates, and it gave generously to the fund for the Southern Illinois cyclone, and Florida hurricane sufferers, besides on many previous occasions.</p>
   <p>The Supreme officers are: Judge B. P. Barasa, president; Constantino Vitello, vice-president; P. Scaduto, secretary; V. E. Ferrara, treasurer; and T. H. Landise, and other successful professional and business men of this city, respected for their integrity and standing. Last, but not least, this society teaches and inculcates true Americanism to its members, through a monthly publication.</p>
