   <p>The vulgar demonstration of last Sunday, for the purpose of honoring Columbus and also to make known to Chicago the work of art that has been solidly planted in South Chicago, in spite of the efforts of the Knights of Columbus, has inspired the Chicago Tribune to an editorial which appeared in last Wednesday's issue, and which we are translating in the I'talia. But the Tribune, after justly reproving the one-hundred-fifty or so Italians, as not being examples of the Italian Colony as a whole, with which we are in agreement, goes on to make some inexact and inopportune statements. The article follows:</p>
   <p>The Italian Societies ask Mayor Busse to use his influence to have the Christopher Columbus Memorial Fountain now standing isolated in South Chicago, set free from uncongenial and sordid surroundings. They would like to have him set up in some pleasant public place, preferably Lincoln Park, where the Italians could go occasionally and pay their respects to a man who did so much for them. They are all agreed, that if he did not discover America, <pb facs="5425702_1_0216.jpg" n="2"/>they would not today be flourishing citizens of this free and independent republic. They would be working hard for a poor living in overcrowded Italy.</p>
   <p>Now there is a way in which the Italian societies get the whole souled support of Mayor Busse in this matter of the banished Columbus. They have come to Chicago as the result of his great discovery, many bad as well as many good Italians. The former give their fellow-countrymen and the public, infinite trouble. If the good Italians shall organize and give the police appreciative assistance in running down, bringing to justice, or driving out of town, their "Black Hand" nationals, they will benefit themselves and the community, and show themselves worthy compatriots of that great man "Christopher Columbus." If they were to do that and they can do it, they would have a right to demand the triumphant return of Columbus from his unsuitable quarters in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>He would willingly spend the winter there, though the weather and neighborhood <pb facs="5425702_1_0217.jpg" n="3"/>were disagreeable, if he knew that his countrymen were doing their best for the honor of Italy by exterminating the Italian kidnappers, blackmailers, and dynamiters of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The harsh words of Chicago's greatest newspaper were not sufficient to close the mouth or stay the pen of the Italian Chevalier, Dr. Camillo Violini, who is always ready to defend the Italians. He has replied with the following article, which appeared in Wednesday's issue of the Tribune:</p>
   <p>Italians Feel At Home Here: But in order to be fair to everybody, I will call the attention of your readers, if you will allow me, to a few facts that it might be well to remember if we really have the welfare of this great city at heart. First of all, it is useless for me to remark that the Italian people are not the only people that ought to be grateful to Columbus for his great discovery; perhaps people of different nationalities would be laboring under great or greater difficulties for a living in other crowded European countries, <pb facs="5425702_1_0218.jpg" n="4"/>were it not for this great genius. The fact that some may have derived benefits from his work, long before the Italians did, in so small a scale, does not conceal the truth, that we ought to feel at home here, at least as much as all the rest of the people who sailed from Europe a few generations ahead of us.</p>
   <p>It will not be out of place to state, at this moment, that Italy's merit in the discovery of America, does not lie in the simple fact that Christopher Columbus was born in Italy, but that his genius was the true product of the Italian progress and civilization of that period; because hundreds of thinking Italians from Brunetto Latini (12th century) to Toscanelli (15th century) had worked to find the fundamental principles on which the immortal Columbus founded his great discovery, while the great scientists of all Europe (England, France, Spain), were ridiculing his project.</p>
   <p>Full Payment for all Benefits.</p>
   <p>And this I state, simply because of the fact, that between the lines of your <pb facs="5425702_1_0219.jpg" n="5"/>esteemed editorial transpires, too prominently, the idea of the great benefits that we, remote and starved strangers, have derived from the discovery of Columbus. You, certainly, do not ignore the belief that the Italian laborers, since they have put foot in this country, have contributed their share to increase the wealth of this nation, and for every dollar received in payment for honest work, that they have made five or ten dollars richer, some more fortunate mortal who happened to land here ahead of them.</p>
   <p>But all this does not in any way destroy the fact that we are in a certain measure responsible for all the shortcomings of our immigration of today, and ought to cooperate with the authorities in general, to wipe out a certain kind of criminality that is a stain on our otherwise good name. At the same time that all the community, authorities, and newspapers as well, ought to strive also for the welfare of us all to put down the hundreds of holdup men, burglars, murderers, and allied criminals, that so abundantly flourish in this great city. Criminals do not wear the Italian stamp, but <pb facs="5425702_1_0220.jpg" n="6"/>the mark of some more civilized nationality; a fact that is so carefully concealed by some publications.</p>
   <p>I take this occasion, Mr. Editor, to extend to you my personal thanks for the support that your paper has given to the Italian White Hand Society, organized last year, for the very purpose that forms the patriotic appeal of your editorial.</p>
   <p>White Hand Works Much Good.</p>
   <p>I, and a good many of my countrymen, feel that we have demonstrated that the society has partly filled an empty space in the shortcomings of some of your political bodies that have the responsibility to insure to every citizen peaceful enjoyment of his domestic life and prosperity. As we have stated in our Treatise just published, our cooperation with the authorities will avail next to nothing unless certain degradingly low political influences, that keep open sone unnamable resorts where this criminality finds its best working ground, are wiped out of existence.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0221.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>I also agree with you that parades such as that of last Sunday, and for the matter of that, every Sunday, and many other days of the year, ought to be stamped out by the authorities which have the responsibility of seeing that the policemen who lead these ridiculous demonstrations are sent after criminals of all descriptions, (as that is what the policemen are paid for) regardless of what the complacent aldermen of this or that ward may give as his personal motives.</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Violini.</p>
   <p>Member of White Hand Society.</p>
