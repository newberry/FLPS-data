   <p>Political Gossip.</p>
   <p>De Stefano continues to be the main theme of discussion among the Italian politicians of the Colony.</p>
   <p>The Italian Republican Clubs in the wards filled with our compatriots, rebelled when they heard that G. S. De Stefano was trying for a place in the Probate Court under Mr. A. C. Cooper.</p>
   <p>The Societa Operaia Italo Americana of the 19th Ward held extraordinary meetings Friday and Saturday for the purpose of protesting against De Stefano's tactics. The vote was unanimously opposed to De Stefano, and a copy of the resolution was sent at once to Mr. Cooper.</p>
   <p>Another meeting was held Tuesday night in the 17th Ward also protesting against De Stefano. A committee of 60 Italians, representing that club brought the resolution protesting De Stefano's appointment to A. O. Cooper.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0592.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Cooper listened attentively to the energetic protest and agreed to give the matter his fullest consideration. He said, "You may rest assured, I shall not appoint any Italian unless it is in agreement with the various Italian Clubs of Chicago." The resolution presented to Mr. Cooper told also that G. S. De Stefano is politically a Democrat, and that he turned Republican when he saw that the Republican Party had won.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Stefano is the very same gentleman who tried to take away from Mr. Durante his position as School Inspector. The American newspapers have distinctly taken an interest in this affair, especially the Tribune.</p>
   <p>The action of the society and the ward club indicates that the Italians are on the right road, the road of true democracy for the Italians of both political parties.</p>
