<title level="a">BANQUET IN HONOR OF DEBS BY THE ITALIAN SOCIALISTS</title></bibl>

   <p>Sunday evening, March 18th, a banquet was held at the Filodramatico-Musicale Club, in honor of our comrade, Mr. Debs, and under the auspices of the Italian Socialists of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In honoring Mr. Debs, our intention was to give the banquet a familiar aspect.</p>
   <p>But our efforts were useless, because, besides the various Italian Socialist branches, many other outstanding personalities of the Socialist Party and of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America attended, and the banquet was transformed into a real Socialist event, one that we shall remember with pleasure.</p>
   <p>Comrade Joseph Schlorsberg, secretary-general of the A. C. W. A., was present with his colleague, A. Marinpietri, a member of the Board of the same union and Assistant Cashier of the Amalgamated Trust &amp; Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>Among our American friends worthy of mention are: Mrs. White, a member of the propaganda department of the National Socialist Party; Mr. Braustetter, <pb facs="5425702_1_0386.jpg" n="2"/>national secretary of the party, and Mrs. Braustetter; Mr. and Mrs. Barnes, members of the Socialist Party of Cook County; Mr. How, candidate for a city office, and Mrs. How; and others.</p>
   <p>The atmosphere was full of gaiety and friendliness throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>The service and food, supplied by our comrades of the 11th ward, were excellent. Comrade Valenti acted as toastmaster.</p>
   <p>Many speeches were delivered by various speakers who were glad because of the success of the banquet, and also glad because anybody and everything there was truly Socialist. The speakers also praised the efforts of Mr. Debs in support of the Socialist cause, and his other activities on behalf of the oppressed workers.</p>
   <p>At the end, Mr. Debs thanked the Italian Socialists for the splendid reception given him, and he also thanked all those that honored him with their presence. He said that never in his life would he forget that evening, which <pb facs="5425702_1_0387.jpg" n="3"/>still more strengthened his conviction to multiply his efforts in behalf of the Socialist Party until the goal is reached.</p>
   <p>At 11:00 P. M., Mr. Debs left for St. Louis.</p>
