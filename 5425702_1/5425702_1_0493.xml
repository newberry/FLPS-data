   <p>On Monday, August 10, the regular meeting of this section was most gratifying by reason of the large attendance, and the nature of the resolutions passed and for the orderliness of the discussion.</p>
   <p>New enrollments have increased the number of members to forty-eight.</p>
   <p>Because of the success of the open-air lectures it was resolved that Caroti should speak on Wednesday, August 12, at the corner of Polk and Sholto streets,on Saturday the 15th,at the corner of Ewing and Jefferson streets, and on Saturday the 22d, at the corner of Polk and Desplaines streets.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved that there should be two speakers in order to render the propaganda more effective. Although the name of Comrade Leoni was proposed for appointment as the second speaker, he was forced to decline for imperative family reasons.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0494.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Then Comrade Guglielmi's name was proposed, and he accepted the nomination.</p>
   <p>The announcement that the budget was almost balanced was welcomed.</p>
   <p>Finally, Caroti, pointed out how necessary it was for the Italian Socialist sections to participate vigorously in the political-economic activities of their American comrades in order to avoid stagnation and consequent disintegration.</p>
