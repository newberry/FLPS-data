   <p>A general meeting was held February 17th, and many members were present.</p>
   <p>The president made his report on the activities of the Chamber of Commerce during 1913.</p>
   <p>The president of the Industrial section, Mr. Spagiari reported that through the efforts of that section many firms in Italy became members of this Chamber. The councillor, Mr. Mastro-Valerio, secretary of the Agriculture section reported in detail all the work accomplished by his section during 1913.</p>
   <p>He talked about a new colonization project sent to this Chamber of Commerce by the "Reclamation Service" and he hoped that the Section would send a Committee to inspect the land for farms, the location, climate and productive value, and would make known their findings in a report on which the Chamber of Commerce will advise our countrymen before they buy. He condemned the practice of Italian farmers settling in the big cities, and he is of the opinion that it would be more profitable for them and for America to join the Agricultural colonies, such as those of Mississippi, the Allegheny Mountains, Florida, Arkansas, <pb facs="5425702_1_0977.jpg" n="2"/>Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, etc. Councillor Postorino reported on the accomplishments of the Imports and Exports Commission.</p>
