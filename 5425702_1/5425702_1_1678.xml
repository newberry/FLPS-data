   <p>Because of the devastating earthquake which has ruined the fertile regions of Avellino and Benevento, depriving of their homes and possessions thousands of families, the Italo-American National Union, as in the past, has decided to help the stricken people.</p>
   <p>Through the initative of C. Vitello, our Supreme President, a meeting of the Supreme Council was held and after a brief discussion it was unanimously resolved to go to the assistance of the earthquake sufferers with 100,000 lire. A form letter was sent to the 51 lodges of the Union, inviting all members to contribute $1 each for this humanitarian cause and, in less than one week, the amount requested was collected. The lodges, composed in most part by workingmen, responded to the appeal with patriotic and fraternal spirit. A check for 100,000 lire, issued by the Banco di Napoli, was made out in the name of the head of the Italian government to whom it will be given personally by C. Vitallo, our Supreme President, who is going to Italy.</p>
