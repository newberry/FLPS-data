   <p>An extremely effective and vigorous performance of "La Traviata," in four acts, was presented at the Amalgamated Auditorium on April 4. This performance fully merited the vehement applause of almost four thousand people. Added to the splendid production of the opera were the beauty and charm of the young soprano, Josephine La Placa, who as Violetta sang gorgeously a good share of the time.</p>
   <p>The spectators fully realized that they were hearing a traditional masterpiece well presented by the Berardinelli School of Opera and supremely conducted by Professor N. Berardinelli, assisted by a thirty-two piece orchestra provided by the Chicago Federation of Musicians.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berardinelli has been an important figure in local operatic work for several years. The performance of "La Traviata" was in line with his policy of giving opportunities to his students to gain experience under conditions comparable in every respect to performances by professional artists.</p>
