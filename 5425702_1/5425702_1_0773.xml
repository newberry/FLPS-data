   <p>Mrs. Eugene Palermo is the founder and president of the Columbus Women's Club. This club is part of the Women's Federation of Clubs of Chicago and Cook County. Organized about a year ago for the purpose of concentrating the efforts of Italian-American women in civic and charitable affairs, this club, with its sixteen members, is an example of what a few can accomplish when there is a concerted desire to benefit those less fortunate.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0774.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the recent drive for the Women's and Children's Hospital, the Columbus Women's Club obtained subscriptions amounting to two hundred ($200) dollars, of which twenty-five ($25) dollars has already been collected. The club has sent two patients to that hospital and paid all their expenses. It has contributed to Shelter House on West Adams Street and on Arbor Day, observed recently by the women's organizations of Chicago and Cook County, in Ryan's Woods, the club planted two trees. It is now bidding for the cooperation of the federation for the establishment of an infant welfare station, for which the club has promised to solicit the necessary funds.</p>
