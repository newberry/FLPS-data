   <p>Mr. M. Nardi will help the Italian families of Clark St. He opened a school at 505 S. Clark St. at his own expense, for both young and adults. Mr. Nardi has offered this free to the Italian people of that community. Mr. Nardi has two schools opened on his expense. The other school is at 17 W. Kinzie St. Because he is teaching at the school on Kinzie St. he cannot be at the school on Clark St. Therefore he is asking any Italian who is willing to do the teaching gratis to contribute his services.</p>
   <p>These schools are also opened on Saturdays and Sundays, and are used as a library. Any one who wishes to attend may do so free of charge. There are newspapers, magazines, romances and other books for people to read.</p>
   <p>There are also American families living among the poorest Italian families of the West Side, and are doing their utmost to help them. We <pb facs="5425702_1_1423.jpg" n="2"/>should thank them for their most appreciated help.</p>
   <p>With the help of Mr. Mastrovalerio, Italian teachers are teaching in evening schools, English to our Italians. Mr. Mastrovalerio is trying his best in getting more Italian teachers for evening schools, because there are an immense number of Italians enlisting in evening schools to learn English.</p>
