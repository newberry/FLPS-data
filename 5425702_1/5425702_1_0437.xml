   <p>Last Sunday, June 16, more than fifty thousand people took part in the picnic held at Riverview Park by the Socialists of Cook County.</p>
   <p>Americans, Italians, Irish, Germans, Austrians, English, Spaniards, French, Hungarians, Bohemians, Lithuanians, Dutch, Greeks, Bulgarians, Russians, Mexicans, etc., were gathered together for the purpose of spending a few merry hours away from the city; all of them bound together by a perpetual faith in international socialism.</p>
   <p>The immense crowd was thrilled by the speech on Soviet Russia by one of the first socialist ambassadors in the history of the United States, Santeri Nuoterva, Ambassador from Finland. Mr. Nouterva spoke from the International Pavillion.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0438.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Speeches in Italian were made from the Italian pavillion and heard by hundreds of our countrymen. Introduced by comrade Pellegrino of the nineteenth ward, comrade Bellandi spoke of the urgent need for socialism.</p>
   <p>Our chief editor, G. Valenti, also spoke to the many people of different nationalities who, attracted by the strength of internationalism, had assembled to pay homage to socialism, instead of slaughtering each other in war, as people are doing in Europe.</p>
   <p>Finally, our comrade Dr. Molinari began his speech by explaining the real causes of the World War. He pointed out that the people of the nations at war have no quarrel among themselves, and that they are cutting each others throats only because they are in the dark.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0439.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He compared the nations at war to those cowboys of the movies who, in the act of attacking the occupants of a barroom, shoot out the only lamp hanging from the ceiling, and then end up by accidentally killing each other in the dark.</p>
   <p>"When the enlightenment of the future takes place," he continued to say, the peoples of the earth will understand each other and know whom and where to attack.</p>
   <p>The speaker concluded by saying that he was in favor of that war which will begin at the end of the World War. This struggle will take place in every nation, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.</p>
   <p>At the end of the speech, shouts of "Long live our war" mingled with a hearty and general applause.</p>
   <p>At the close of the proceedings, $14.50 was collected from the Italians present: The money will be contributed to this newspaper.</p>
