   <p>Italo Volini, the son of Cav. Dr. Volini, has shown himself one of the most brilliant students during his years of study towards a medical career.</p>
   <p>Recently, he received the highest rating for an appointment to Cook County Hospital out of a field of 185 applicants. His passing marks established an all time record.</p>
   <p>He graduated from the University of Chicago with honorable mention. At Rush Medical College, besides being the only Italian in the school, he was elected president of his class of 126 students. He was made a member of the honorary medical fraternity, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which only five are elected every year.</p>
   <p>Dr. Judson, on hearing of the manner in which young Volini had again distinguished himself, was quick to send his sincerest congratulations.</p>
   <p>Dr. and Mrs. Volini can well be proud of son and their pride is shared by us.</p>
