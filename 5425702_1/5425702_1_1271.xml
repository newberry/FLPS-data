   <p>On last Sunday Chicago became aware that a Socialist party exists within its limits.</p>
   <p>From early morning long rows of street cars discharged their human loads of all races and languages.</p>
   <p>The attendance for the day was more than a hundred thousand. The proceeds of the picnic have not yet been computed, but they are expected to surpass those of any previous year.</p>
   <p>The number of Italians in attendance exceeded all expectations. It was at least five times as large this year as it had been in any year before. New faces moved among the crowds, sympathizers who took this occasion to show their desire to join our ranks.</p>
   <p>Toward 6 p. m. Comrade Morgari arrived from the South Side.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1272.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To facilitate his journey, he carried a map of the city with him. He made a short speech to the Italians gathered in our section of the park, after Comrade Corti had explained the purpose of the picnic.</p>
   <p>A group photograph was made, which may be printed in a future issue of La Parola.</p>
   <p>We are very well satisfied with the day, and when an accounting has been made, it will show that La Parola has profited financially.</p>
