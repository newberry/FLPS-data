   <p>The weekly journal I1 Movimento (The Movement) has been changed into the daily I1 Giornale di Chicago (The Chicago Journal).</p>
   <p>However, according to the Italian adage, it has changed its fur but not its bad habits.</p>
   <p>While it continues to exalt the war between Italy and the Central Powers, it turns pacifist when it supports Mr. Wilson's candidacy for President.</p>
   <p>This latter trend appears in one of its cuts, which portrays on one side the family of a laborer seated around a bountifully set table, and on the other side the poor widow of a soldier killed in war, surrounded by her equally sad children.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0740.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The whole picture is certainly inconsistent with the above mentioned war propaganda as applied to the Italians, who are purported to be happy, satisfied, and clamoring for a war to the end.</p>
   <p>Likewise, the illustration is inconsistent with the situation in the United States, because Mr. Hughes favors war and Mr. Wilson will wage war as soon as it is imposed upon him.</p>
   <p>President Wilson has not declared war, up to the present time, only because American Capitalism is fattening nicely on the European War, by supplying Europe with arms, ammunition, uniforms and other war material.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0741.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>However, while the American capitalists are reaping a harvest from the war, the poor workingmen are still destitute, in spite of President Wilson and of Chief Justice Hughes. And miserable they will remain under any president representing the interests of capitalism.</p>
