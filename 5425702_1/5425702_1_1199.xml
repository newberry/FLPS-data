   <p>These two operettas, given on Dec. 5th at the Meldazis Hall by the Italian Socialist Sections of the 11th Ward, were a real success.</p>
   <p>Maestro A. C. Ricordati has once again shown his intelligence and ability to adapt his small orchestra to the exigencies of the singers. The merit of his work was recognized and repeatedly applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>Maestro P. Pacin, as first violinist, contributed much to the success of the evening.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Santarseri, in the roles of Nannetta and Giacomina, showed that she possessed a sure and clear voice, in spite of her being new to the stage.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. Betti made his debut in the roles of Nardino and Prosdocimo, and sang excellently, particulary in "The Three Hunchbacks."</p>
   <p>T. Bellandi, in the roles of Martorello and the village teacher, was superior <pb facs="5425702_1_1200.jpg" n="2"/>in his singing and excellent in his acting.</p>
   <p>Serafino Lami, took care of the scenery and was also the prompter.</p>
   <p>All the actors performed better than was expected, and even the choruse's surpassed themselves.</p>
