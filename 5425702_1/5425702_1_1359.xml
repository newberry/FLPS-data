   <p>At last, here is a magazine that fills a void among Italian publications in America. The need, for a publication like this which treats of modern thought and culture in Italy, was becoming quite evident. Very welcome, then, is the newcomer Mens Italica. We wish it good luck and many years of existence.</p>
   <p>Intellectual Italians in America are invited to read and digest the valuable information which it contains. Every article has been written by an expert in his field and in a way to throw new light on the subject. Many problems of New Italy, which have been given a distorted interpretation, are here placed in their true light, sagely and competently, by the writers of Mens Italica.</p>
   <p>It is not our intention of making a diffuse critique of this magazine which owes much to its founder, a cultured and intelligent young Italian of our <pb facs="5425702_1_1360.jpg" n="2"/>colony, Vito La Sacco. We believe its best recommendation is in reading it. The second issue is to be improved and the rates lowered by fifty per cent.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Italian to support this good work of our countryman, Vito Lo Sacco. He is sacrificing much in order to accomplish this idealistic work. His aim he says, is to contribute to the betterment of the mass of Italian immigrants, by acquainting them with a deeper knowledge of our glories, past and present; to give the American public a clearer and more precise account of the rebirth of Italy; to acquaint the public, Italian and American, with the new voice and spirit of our great and blessed Italy, "an energetic and orderly, envied and feared Italy." The foregoing quotation was taken from the first issue of Mens Italica.</p>
