  <body>
   <p>Of all the ignorant and inconsistent accusations against the leader of the "New Italy" the one of Senator Heflin wins the grand prize. What a folly! What a mark of hypocrisy!</p>
   <p>Imagine this supposed-to-be cultured person, a senator, a man who should have diplomatic manners, arising before so illustrious a body as the United States Senate and saying: "It was a spy of Mussolini's who ordered the recent murder of seven men in Chicago because they would not swear allegiance to "Fascism."</p>
   <p>How well informed is this senator! What a genius! A paragon of all men! However, he is not so well informed because the men killed through gangland's uprising were not Italians. That should suffice; furthermore, it would be best for Heflin to read a little foreign history and exercise at the same time the rusted cells of his cerebrum so as to understand the full meaning of Fascism. The Tribune is correct in saving Heflin has "it," - but what? Not the "it" of the famous novel. But what? Surely not a solution to the recent slaughter in Chicago. Why! - that would be a sensation. It is odd that the authorities of Chicago hadn't discovered this super-detective before; <pb facs="5425702_1_0170.jpg" n="2"/>this Sherlock; this master-mind, who, so far away, is capable of telling the forces of law and order who committed the murder. Such a man belongs in the detective bureau of Chicago, and not in the United States Senate.</p>
   <p>Only a person with a very narrow mind and living in the realm of prejudice can create such a theory. Probably Heflin, or rather Senator Heflin, is a strong believer, a follower of Thrasymachos - who was heard to say time and time again: "For God is God and I am I."</p>
   <p>The senator should study conditions in Italy following the war, and conditions existing in Italy today. If this does not enlighten him, then he should absorb the constitution and during the process of absorption understand what is meant by "religious tolerance." If all this has no bearing upon the closed areas of his brain, then he is a total impossibility. Men like this lost soul from Alabama, who wish to become famous overnight with their ridiculous ideas and conceptions, are the antagonists of the prejudiced Socialists. Men like this diety, for such he must be, in order to be able to give his absolute knowledge upon so difficult a matter, are the destructive parasites of human civilization, of law and order, of international peace.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0171.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The senator has certainly lowered himself in all respects, in the eyes of his fellow countrymen, his fellow senators, and above all, in the eyes of the Supreme Ruler. Peculiar that such orations should be allowed in the Senate.</p>
   <p>Heflin! Your attacks are not considered by the broad-minded students, the struggling laborers, the voting masses; for they are nothing more than an outburst of hatred from a narrow prejudiced mind, which had the misfortune to be given to you. It seems that you are trying to destroy the principles of our forefathers; the principle of foreign diplomacy, by your radical and fantastic ideas. The new civilization has arrived. It is at the gates of tomorrow, and it will gaze upon your works and marvel how you ever became senator. It will never mention your name; you will be listed on their roll of "un-Americans," and you will never live down the disgrace which you have brought upon your state and upon yourself.</p>
   <p>This sudden outburst has caused much comment in the various Italo-American circles and a statement from our ambassador in Washington, concerning this matter is expected.</p>
