   <p>Monday, October 13, the temporary committee for the House of the People signed the deed and turned over to the building committee the sum of $4000 as first payment.</p>
   <p>We are proud to give this good news to our comrades, because it is an evident demonstration that the Italian Socialists of America are not forgetting the saying, "Where there is a will, there is a way."</p>
   <p>The first stage is accomplished, and it is the most important. But much more is yet to be accomplished. Without the spontaneous help of several comrades, such as Joseph Bertelli, who is worthy of praise, we could not overcome so many obstacles.</p>
   <p>It is up to the comrades, now, to preserve and intensify their efforts.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1633.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is necessary to buy more shares to help in the accomplishment of the present enterprise. Take advantages of any opportunity which may be useful to The House of the People.</p>
   <p>We appreciated very much the help given to us by the comrades of New York, who have bought ten shares.</p>
   <p>We hope that they will be imitated by comrades of other cities. comrades! Do not stand still; go forward, always forward!</p>
