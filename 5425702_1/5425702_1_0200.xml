   <p>Replying to the communication sent to us by the Chamber of Commerce of Brescia, Italy, through the union of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, concerning the attitude of the American press in regard to Italy's entrance into the World War as an ally of France and England, we are glad to report that in the main, it is favorable. The exceptions to this attitude are generally found in the Austrian and German papers of America.</p>
   <p>The leading local papers such as the Tribune, the Daily News, the Chicago American, the Examiner, etc., offer a special and accurate news service on the operations of the Italian armies. Several go to the extent of printing at least two columns of war news in Italian.</p>
   <p>All this nevertheless does not tend to mitigate the animosity of Germans and Austrians against Italians, in fact, it seems to be accentuated. Because of it the Italian worker suffers, as when seeking employment he finds that the majority of shops are managed or owned by Germans and Austrians. Because of his nationality he is denied employment. The German-American press accuses Italy of "betraying its ancient allies" meaning of course, Germany and Austria, <pb facs="5425702_1_0201.jpg" n="2"/>despite the fact that the American press has clearly explained the change in Italy's course of action. Germany and Austria have sold tons of literature in books and periodicals of all languages to convince the world of the validity of its reasons for being in the war. The Italian Government has printed one book, the famous "Libro Verde," (Green Book), on this point and to date few have had the opportunity of reading it.</p>
   <p>This Chamber therefore, recommends that the mother country, without further delay, act on the proposal of the Chamber of Commerce of Brescia, and vote a sum sufficient to cover the expenses of a propaganda campaign in foreign countries, for the duration of the war.</p>
   <p>Italian colonies throughout the world have generously given money and other assistance in times of disaster. Now they are passing through a lean period under conditions that are far from prosperous. At present as in the past, they are contributing with proof of the fine character, awakened natural talent and high sentiments of our race. They have contributed to the finances of the fatherland by continually sending money to their relatives in Italy; they have done their share in financing public buildings in their birth-places, as well as donating money to relieve victims of devastated areas.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0202.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With conditions in the colonies as stated, we feel that it is the duty of the Italian Government to appropriate a sum sufficient to popularize throughout the world the reasons for Italy's participation in this war.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Propaganda</p>
   <p>Italian Chamber of Commerce, Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>(Signed) Albert Gualano, President.</p>
