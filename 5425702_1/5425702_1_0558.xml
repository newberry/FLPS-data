   <p>Do you want jobs? Do you want your daily bread? Do you want to enjoy these and other benefits that America offers you?</p>
   <p>Then vote the entire Republican ticket. The victory of the Republican candidate for president is assured, now we must unite and assure the election of Fifer for governor of Illinois. The candidate has in the past favored the Italians in word and deed. You must vote for him and assure yourselves of having in this important public office one who has proven himself a sincere and devoted friend of the Italian.</p>
   <p>Benjamin Harrison, the Republican presidential candidate, who is up for re-election has proven his ability to do for the good of the nation by record of the past four years. During his presidency we have seen industry booming and commerce advancing.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0559.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>You cannot deny that there are jobs for all who cared to work. Italians there is only one way to protect your jobs. Vote for Harrison, and don't forget Fifer for governor.</p>
