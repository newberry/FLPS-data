   <p>In order to have Co-operative Publishing House on a sound financial basis, it is necessary to sell four hundred shares more. This was the conclusion reached by the Administrative Council at its last session, after a detailed and exhaustive discussion.</p>
   <p>To have the existence of the Co-operative imperiled? That must never be. The iron will of the Italo-America Socialists planted it, and the same tenacity will make it solid. He who doubts can go to Hades.</p>
   <p>Every month we pay seventy dollars for our material and equipment. These payments will last for twenty months more, after which, that money will be used in support of the Parola, that is, the Parola will be printed for seventy dollars less each month. But the deficit of the Parola in the past, even at its worst, did not reach that sum. What does that signify? It signifies that when we can use that $70 monthly for the Parola, the deficit <pb facs="5425702_1_0328.jpg" n="2"/>on the Parola will be forever cancelled. Therefore the sooner we pay that bill for the equipment, the sooner the Co-operative will be of valid use to the newspaper. For this reason, we insist that our comrades, sympathizers and branches put themselves seriously to the task of selling the required number of shares. To arms! and no rest until our quota is sold. To date we have sold <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. Our comrades in Barre, Vermont, and Cicero, Illinois, delight in buying them.</p>
