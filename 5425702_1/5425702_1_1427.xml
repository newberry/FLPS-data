   <p>The "Justinian Society of Advocates" composed of American lawyers of Italian origin, has arranged to have a lecture at its regular monthly meetings, which are usually held in one of the club rooms of the Chicago Bar Association, 160 N. La Salle St., Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>At the next meeting which will be held on March 3, 1934, Thomas Landise of the Illinois Bar, one of the founders and former president of this society, will lecture on the subject of "Court Practice under the Civil Practice Act of Illinois," which went into effect on January 1, 1934.</p>
   <p>Heretofore, at the January meeting of the society, Mr. Landise lectured on the subject of "Process, Service, and Parties"; on February 3, he lectured on the subject of "Pleading under the Illinois Civil Practice Act" already mentioned. Mr. Landise draws attention to the fact that one of the outstanding innovations under the Act is, that any one of the parties to any cause may file a counter-claim against any other party thereto, whether plaintiff or defendant.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1428.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is hoped by the society of which Joseph R. Orrico, former Assistant State's Attorney, is president, that the lectures will further stimulate the interest of its members in the science of the law.</p>
