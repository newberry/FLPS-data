   <p>It is necessary to remember the importance of the meetings of the Italian Socialist branches of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Socialist federation lately has shown itself to be suffering from lethargy.</p>
   <p>Only a few branches have demonstrated some activity, but others, the most important from the stand point of existence, do not give any sign of it.</p>
   <p>Such conditions cannot last much longer. It is the duty of the branches to participate in public life with greater familiarity towards our party and the federations of other foreign languages.</p>
   <p>We have been and still are too much of a stranger to public life.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0380.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The importance of a federation must be judged, not by its numerical strength, but by the activities accomplished by each branch.</p>
   <p>A large number of them are holding meetings only to read minutes and elect officers, without taking any real interest in social affairs and without taking any important initiative.</p>
   <p>Can we go forward under such conditions?</p>
   <p>Other branches, with commendable initiative are instead organizing festivals, dances and educational and recreational clubs, thus spreading our propaganda and showing the commendable intentions of some comrades in making themselves useful to our party.</p>
   <p>The Socialist branches of Chicago, in approving the resolution introduced by Comrade Pippan, are appealing to the out-of-town branches to awake and rebel against present oppressive conditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0381.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Cooperation and culture are two elements very easy to acquire.</p>
   <p>Certainly, it is necessary to possess some of the spirit of sacrifice if we are to lay out a firm basis, and Socialism can be developed in a capitalistic regime only through the sacrifices of the comrades.</p>
   <p>We intend to build a new society of justice, liberty, and equality, free from any idea of individual or collective abuse.</p>
   <p>This may be accomplished in one or ten years. We do not consider the question of time. It is necessary to get on the way and not to lose courage at the first failure.</p>
   <p>We must have confidence in ourselves and in the success of Socialism.</p>
   <p>Will power, confidence in ourselves and in our own idealism, are the only requirements that can elevate a humble worker to a top position, <pb facs="5425702_1_0382.jpg" n="4"/>inaccessible to the weakest.</p>
   <p>We admit the existence of many difficulties offered by the ruling capitalistic regime. To contend with and subdue them must be our great satisfaction. The Socialist ideal, cultivated with faith and passion, must urge the comrades to act in the large social field.</p>
   <p>Cooperation and a knowledge of the problem of syndicalism must absorb all the activities of the comrades. They are the economical organism which must go side by side with political action in our advanced party.</p>
   <p>They will point to the road to recovery.</p>
