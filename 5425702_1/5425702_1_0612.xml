<title level="a">REASONS WHY THE ITALIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR SWEITZER RATHER THAN HARRISON ARE GIVEN BY THE ITALIAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Italian-American Democratic Party, which supports Robert M. Sweitzer's candidacy for Mayor of Chicago in the primaries, has appealed to the colony for its support, and gives some reasons why the Italians who are fighting in the ranks of the Democratic Party should vote for Sweitzer rather than for Harrison.</p>
   <p>The main reasons given by the Italian-American Democratic Party are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Because the present Mayor Harrison in the long period of his administration has never mentioned an Italian for public office;</p>
   <p>2. Because Harrison has never taken into consideration the choice of an Italian as a member of the Board of Education, although there are more than fifty thousand children of Italian parents attending public schools;</p>
   <p>3. Because in the last election Harrison was instrumental in defeating the candidacy of Rocco De Stefano, for Judge of the Municipal Court;</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0613.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>4. Because of any Italian delegation that presented itself to him, to obtain some concession, was never received with the respect deserved by our colony.</p>
   <p>5. The investigation conducted by the Italian American-Democratic Party in the various Italian wards, shows the Italians inclined to support Sweitzer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rocco De Stefano, who is head of the Italian Democratic forces in the 19th Ward, assures us that the majority of Italian votes in that ward is for Sweitzer.</p>
