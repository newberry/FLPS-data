   <p>The race riots of Chicago were brought to the attention of the Senate in yesterday's session, when Senator MacKellar, of Tennessee, started to read various newspaper reports, concerning the killing of a negro in the Italian district of the West Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Senator MacKellar said: "Mr. President, we must remember that the negro was assaulted without having committed any crime. This happened in the state of Abraham Lincoln; any other comment is superfluous."</p>
   <p>We disagree with the viewpoint of the zealous Senator from Tennessee, because it was not proved that the Italians committed such an atrocity. The senator should recall not only this incident, but the fact that more than thirty negroes have been killed in Chicago by Americans. He should recall that the lynchings in the states of the South are a daily occurrence. Mentioning only the incident of the West Side of Chicago, dear senator, means to instigate more race hatred against the Italians <pb facs="5425702_1_0199.jpg" n="2"/>or try to make them responsible for the massacres that are being committed in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Senator MacKellar, in his address to the Senate, does not mention that it was the Italians that killed the negro. He can't do that because he has no proof, as no one else has; so, why slander the Italians?</p>
   <p>Such insinuations delay the amalgamation of the Italians with the people of other countries living in this great nation for which the Italians are ready to fight and die as they have already demonstrated.</p>
