   <p>Brothers: Never before in the history of humanity has there been such need that workers compelled to live in a foreign land to gain a better living should come to an understanding and form a frank, fraternal, and real union.</p>
   <p>In view of the situation of the workers living in this metropolis we believe that every one feels the necessity of uniting with others for mutual protection. This union has been partially realized by the organization of societies, clubs, etc. Our fellow-Italians join mutual benefit societies not because they are amusement enterprises but in order to have some help in time of need or sickness.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, we workers, with the modest wages that we receive for our labor, cannot save money. We are therefore compelled to affiliate ourselves with some benefit society. But the mutual societies in operation at the present time, even if all possible assistance is given to them,still cannot accomplish all that they wish for lack of cohesion and unification.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1549.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Not only in extending material and financial help are such organizations valuable; they may assist in the moral and social elevation of thousands and thousands of Italians.</p>
   <p>Our social and political standing is much inferior to that enjoyed by the workers of some other nationalities; the lack of unity among us does not permit us to progress and keeps us from speaking out and showing our strength when our good name and our reputation are involved.</p>
   <p>We therefore firmly believe that it is necessary to realize the unification of all the Italian mutual benefit societies of Chicago.</p>
   <p>By so doing we shall become the equals of workers of other nationalities and better appreciated and respected, especially by the local press, which continually tries to depreciate our good name. Italians! Help us with your cooperation to realize our dream; help us to organize this new institution!</p>
   <p>Vis Unita Fortior - in union there is strength - and we can achieve our objects only with the federation of Italian societies.</p>
