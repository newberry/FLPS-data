   <p>Ten years have gone by since the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order of Sons of Italy In America, was organized in Chicago. The date of November 9, 1924, will remain as a memorable one in the history of our Order in this state, and as the Order grows in its power for good, its activating spirit spreads through this state of ours the importance of what took place on that date.</p>
   <p>Our Order has been, and is, an organization of everyday laborers and being so, it could not ignore the interests of the working-men, either as individuals or to a certain extent, as a class. During these ten years it has striven to make the Italian immigrant conscious of his duties and of his rights as an American citizen.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1543.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It has advised him to use cool wisdom instead of hot reasoning for the protection of his own interests and the welfare of the society; has advised him to keep off demagogy and extreme methods, harmful to his progress and welfare, and has tried to convince him that his own success, his own physical and moral welfare, could be attained only by honesty, hard work, and obedience to the laws of this country.</p>
   <p>What purpose more noble, what reason for existence more important could the Order have than that of perpetuating Italian culture and the Italian spirit and geniality in our descendants, to be the means by which such qualities should become, in due time, a part of the spiritual patrimony of the future American race.</p>
