   <p>Tomorrow night, Sunday, July 31, 1904, at the Steinway Theater on Van Buren Street, between Wabash &amp; Michigan Ave., the Italian Dramatic Company will present the drama I1 Figlio di Tato, written by the genuine poet and author, Mr. Silvio Picchianti, and the comedy Lui o Lei (?) by Emilio Taddeil.</p>
   <p>In the intermission the orchestra of Maestro Enrico Sansone will play selections of classical music. We are sure that the Italian colony of Chicago will not miss such opportunity and will be present to encourage the efforts made by the Italian Dramatic Company in the interest of the Italians and of Italian arts.</p>
   <p>The comedy Tra Un'Ora, by the same author, Mr. Hicchianti, which was presented to the public, three months ago, was well accepted by the Italians, and we hope that the drama I1 Figlio di Tato will have the same or better success.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1185.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our colony must be glad to have an author as Mr. Picchianti, well known in the literary circles of Italy.</p>
   <p>Italians, remember that history is the school of humanity; and the theater and his art is the school of life.</p>
