   <p>At the Chicago Architectural League Exposition held at the Art Institute, the attention of the visitors was attracted to a sketch reproducing a pavilian of the city of Chicago for the Centennial Exposition of 1933, of which Mr. Luigi Pirola is the creator.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pirola's sketch was awarded the first prize, among eleven competitors, consisting of scholarship valued at $1000 for a trip to the most important artistic centers of Europe. Mr. Pirola is a young architect, son of Italian parents, born in Chicago. He began the study of art in Chicago and has worked at his profession in New York and elsewhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1164.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In 1925, he won a scholarship offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; at present he is employed as designer by the Armstrong, Furst &amp; Titan firm of this city.</p>
   <p>His sketch was favorably commented upon by the Chicago papers such as the Tribune and the Daily News.</p>
   <p>To Mr. Pirola is opened a brilliant career. Thus are the Italians bringing to every corner of the United States the contribution of their intellect, skill, talent, and the artistic genius of our race.</p>
