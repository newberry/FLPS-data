   <p>James Jeffry Roche, the Irish editor of the ultra-Catholic newspaper, The Pilot of Boston, was nominated by President Roosevelt as Consul to Geneva, and William H. Bishop, another rabid Catholic, as Consul to Palermo.</p>
   <p>As for Mr. Roche, an intransigent Irishman, he never recognized in his newspaper the glorious events which occurred in Italy, he always had a violent attitude towards them, and yet he was not ashame to ask for the position of Consul to Italy.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0224.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the question of the Phillipines the Republican administration favored the Catholics, who have voted Republican in the last elections, and now the Administration is trying to infect Italy with a consul, known to be an enemy of our country.</p>
   <p>In 1884 President Cleveland sent a certain Mr. Kelly, who was much like Roche, as an ambassador to Rome, but Italy absolutely refused to accept him.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Italian Government will do the same thing to Roche.</p>
