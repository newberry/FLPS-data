   <p>On Saturday, July 11, in behalf of the West Side section (of the 12th ward), Arturo Caroti spoke for about two hours on the corner of Twenty-fourth street and Oakley boulevard.</p>
   <p>He was cheered by a good-sized crowd, which also purchased a large quantity of Socialistic publications.</p>
   <p>Comrade Vincenzo Carnevali, of the nineteenth ward section, has left for Seattle, Washington. He has left a good record behind him and is accompanied by the good wishes of all those comrades of Chicago who have had the good fortune to know him and associate with him.</p>
   <p>We wish to inform our comrades of Seattle that Mr. Carnevali is authorized to take subscriptions and payments for this newspaper.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0503.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the entire city of Chicago one notices wonderful progress in socialistic propaganda. The excursion to Milwaukee was very successful.</p>
   <p>Fourteen hundred Socialists from Chicago participated. The number of people who attended the picnic in Milwaukee at which Debs made one of his marvelous speeches, was twenty five thousand.</p>
