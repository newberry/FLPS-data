   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce was requested lately by the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and by many sister Chambers of Commerce of Italy, to issue some information about the discovery of a new species of maize, made by Prof. Garnett of the University of Chicago. An article dealing with this subject appeared in a magazine which the solicitors called the Review.</p>
   <p>To answer the requests satisfactorily, the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, proceeding with the regular investigation, acquired the following information:</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0996.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Prof. Garnett is a member of the staff of the Agricultural Experimental Station, connected with the University of Chicago and he is the real discoverer of thenew maize in question called (Zea Mays L.) or (Zea Romosa) from the latin word ( Ramosus).</p>
   <p>At present the production is very small. It is still in experimental stage, and does not permit the distribution to farmers of the seeds.</p>
   <p>Prof. Garnett has not mentioned yet the protein quality, but we have reason to believe that it is the same as in ordinary maize. The Chamber of Commerce will follow the experiments made by Prof. Garnett of this new maize, and will give out information any time there are new developments.</p>
