   <p>Our friend, Chas. G. Brune writes to us from Savanna, Ill.:</p>
   <p>"Friday morning, Frank Kerney, town marshall and a good friend of the Italians in this town, called me to the town lock-up to see two Italians, brothers, who had been picked up on the streets without a shirt to their backs.</p>
   <p>In answer to my question they told me they were from Chicago, that they lived with their parents at 702 Indiana St. and their names were Pasquale and Raffaele Caraccia, ten and six years of age respectively. Their parents had given them an organ and sent them out to play and beg from town to town. Everything had gone fairly well until they arrived in Dubuque, Iowa, where they were set upon by a gang of older boys who smashed the organ and stripped their shirts off their backs and in that condition they were driven out of town.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0134.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Because of their appearance, they could not convince trainmen of their desperate need, and so they had taken to walking back to Chicago.</p>
   <p>I bought them some much needed clothing and the town marshall paid their way to Chicago and by new I hope that they are safely at home with their family."</p>
   <p>When will Italian parents stop making such a disgraceful show of themselves for the American's amusement and condemnation?</p>
