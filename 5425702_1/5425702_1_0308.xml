   </div>

   <p>The contract between the Printers' Union and the press trust, which included all the Chicago dailies, expired at the end of April.</p>
   <p>Only the Socialist does not belong to the trust and did not break the contract with the Union.</p>
   <p>The trouble originated with the Hearst papers when on May 2, Hearst notified his printers that he would not recognize their union. Not only was this a serious threat to the Printers' Union but sooner or later it would affect printers of all classes and all other laborers.</p>
   <p>The Hearst printers replied to this act of imposition by walking out. With the spirit of solidarity, all the other dailies locked out their printers. For a few days hardly any bourgeois newspapers appeared.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0309.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later, however, scabs were found and imported, and the Hearst papers were able to circulate.</p>
   <p>However, the stereotypists went on strike in their turn and also the newsvendors, who refused to sell papers produced by scabs. Moreover, a great percentage of citizens are boycotting the paper trust and are disgusted with it, for it is the enemy of organized labor.</p>
   <p>The machinery of the Chicago Daily Socialist and of the World (the morning edition of the Socialist) could not print fast enough to supply the public demand.</p>
   <p>The democratic (?) administration of Chicago has been true to itself. As it did during the strikes of the surface-line men, the garment-workers, the teamsters, etc., the city hall has placed the police at the disposal of the greedy magnates of the paper trust.</p>
   <p>The police, supported entirely by the taxpayers, have been instructed to protect capitalism and the shameless class of scabs.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0310.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Thus the Chicago police are protecting the scab news-vendors; policemen placed on news-trucks are protecting the drivers; policemen are clubbing innocent boys, who through self-denial refuse to sell newspapers smeared with human blood; and still other policemen are clubbing private citizens who permit themselves the luxury of reading the World, the Socialist, or La Parola on public streets or vehicles.</p>
   <p>The Printers' Union has voted 1099 to 655 against a sympathetic strike with the other unions.</p>
   <p>Nor are betrayals lacking among labor's leaders. Freel, the president of the International Union of Stereotypists, has expelled the Chicago union because it refused to return to work and so betray the Printers' Union.</p>
   <p>Lynch, the president of the International Typographical Union, is also pouring water on the fire by using his influence against any sympathetic strike.</p>
