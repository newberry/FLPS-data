   <p>Sunday, April 25th, the Studebaker Theater was filled to capacity for the concert given by the dramatic tenor Enrico Servillo.</p>
   <p>Mr. Servillo is a singer of the old classical Italian school and he makes a cult of his art.</p>
   <p>His vocal and artistic qualities place him among the stars of the musical world.</p>
   <p>He sang selections from the operas "Martha," "Aida," "Pigliacci," and "Lucia." The rendition of the operatic selections by Servillo was great and he was applauded enthusiastically.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1094.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Miss Antonietta Palumbo and Miss Idele Stenfield, pupils of Mr. Servillo, also on the program, sang selections from "Tosca" and "Lucia" and revealed themselves as having good prospects for brilliant careers.</p>
   <p>At the piano was Miss Rosoline Malone who accompanied the singers competently. Miss Hayes and Miss Giltner played the harp, the magic instrument, electrifying the public with harmonious melody. In all, the concert was very successful and Mr. Servillo affirmed himself to be a singer and teacher of note.</p>
