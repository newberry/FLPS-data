   <p>The monthly paper, Il Ficcanaso in its February issue, calls attention to a question that is very old and yet very new. It wonders what has become of the money raised by the Garibaldi Monument Association (formed for the purpose of erecting a statue to the Italian Liberator), in Chicago.</p>
   <p>If by chance one wonders volubly, he is told that it is being well cared for, that it is being loaned to reputable business men at four per cent, and we wonder whether the said monies were raised for the purpose of erecting a statue or to help out financially embarassed business men.</p>
   <p>Three long years ago, patriotic Italians met and formed this association. The administration of all funds raised was placed in the hands of Giovanni Ginocchio, president, Giovanni Raggio, treasurer, and C. E. Antognini. This <pb facs="5425702_1_1531.jpg" n="2"/>trio, with twelve vice-presidents, was given full power to handle all funds raised.</p>
   <p>A benefit dance was given and then no more heard from them. They even failed to acknowledge the receipt of money subscribed by individuals. Incidentally, the secretary, Antognini has left Chicago, some say, for very good reasons.</p>
   <p>So now the trio has lost its Son. Only the Father and Holy Ghost remain and the administrative council of the association is incomplete and out of order.</p>
