   <p>We do not know any other name by which to call the capitalists of America.</p>
   <p>They are the real "Jackals."</p>
   <p>We know of their avarice and cruelty in draining money from the living.</p>
   <p>Now these "Jackals" are feeding themselves on corpses.</p>
   <p>The war, for them, is a Fair. They say: Ah! In Europe they are killing each other? Well, we want the workers of America to pay in order to enjoy peace, thus they will appreciate it more.</p>
   <p>They said so, and already they have raised the cost of all staples from meat to sugar.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0239.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If the American people were not like sheep, and if the aliens who immigrated here, were not becoming like sheep themselves, we would see the streets and the squares of the American cities crowded with mobs protesting and asking for the hanging of the "Jackals."</p>
   <p>Well, this year the crop was abundant; the pastures rich, the cereals and wheat super-abundant; exports to Europe have almost stopped; everything is abundant in fantastic proportions, and the capitalists, 100 times thieves, are raising the cost of living with the excuse that there is a war in Europe.</p>
   <p>The newspapers make a little noise, women's clubs raise their voices, but there is not a single protest in an energetic effective manner.</p>
   <p>At Milan, in Italy, the Socialistic Administration has reduced the cost of bread and will also reduce the cost of milk, meat, and other necessities of life.</p>
   <p>But in America, cities, states, and the Federal Government are in the hands <pb facs="5425702_1_0240.jpg" n="3"/>of the capitalist-democrat-republican party, which is helping the trusts though it pretends to be against them.</p>
   <p>Well, everything that is happening suits me! When a people is tolerant to such an extent and it supports, without protest, anything - and then on election day it votes for those who starve it - that people, we say, deserves to be treated and ruled even in the worst way.</p>
   <p>Dear "Jackals," squeeze and suck still more; the foolish imbecilic people will stand for it, and will thank you, because when a man is starving, he will blame - the socialists.</p>
