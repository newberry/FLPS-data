   <p>It is worthy of notice that the Order Sons of Italy, a national organization, although established for only three years in Illinois, has planted its roots very deeply, and less than four months ago installed a regular grand lodge.</p>
   <p>This immense and beneficent organization has no need of advertising because it advertises itself with its magnificent work and its program of brotherhood. The Grand Venerable of the Lodge, Dr. Franceso La Piana, and the member of the executive council, have completed the first basic operation, that is, they have constituted an insurance fund for the members of the organization that is now functioning admirably. Three insurance policies are issued: one for $1000, one for $600, and one for $300.</p>
   <p>In the meantime Attorney Vito Cuttone, Grand Orator of the Order in Illinois, has obtained the proper authorization to proceed in this state, in a letter from the head of the department of Commerce.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1560.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The letter follows:</p>
   <p>Mr. Vito Cuttone</p>
   <p>Attorney at Law</p>
   <p>140 N. Dearborn St.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>With further reference to the organization of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois of Order Sons of Italy in America, we wish to advise that all documents in connection therewith have been approved and filed. I hand you the certificate of incorporation of this society. This document <pb facs="5425702_1_1561.jpg" n="3"/>constitutes full authority for this organization to operate as a fraternal beneficiary society under the laws of this state.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE</p>
   <p>(By) A. J. Johnson, Supt. of Ins.</p>
