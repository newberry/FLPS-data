   <p>Colored costume points of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; portraits of popes, cardinals, emperors, and other dignitaries of the church and state; and views of cities and buildings associated with Dante, are included in the Newberry Library's exhibition on Dante, which has been opened to the public, in connection with the commemoration of the six-hundredth anniversary of the poet's death. The exhibit also contains old and rare editions of Dante's works, including a copy of the "Divine Comedy," printed in Florence in 1481, with copper plate engraving by Boticelli; and illuminated manuscripts wrought in the monasteries of Italy and France in Dante's day. One of these, of Italian workmanship, bears the date 1316, six years before Dante's death. The exhibit was prepared by Mary L. Watson and Cora D. Durkee, of the staff of the Newberry Library, and is open to the public daily except Sunday, from nine till five during September and October.</p>
