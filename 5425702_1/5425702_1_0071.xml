   <p>The future of the children is the one most important problem in every family. The parents might acquire wealth, social position, power, but if their children should fail in life, their own success is nothing to them but bitterness and gall. The upbringing, the education of the children is, and has been, since the dawn of civilization, the fundamental problem of the human race.</p>
   <p>The parents rightly feel that giving life and supporting them during infancy and childhood does not fulfill their obligation to their children. Besides animal life, it is their duty to transmitto them, and through them to future generations, their language, traditions, beliefs, customs, all of which constitute the social strata into which the individual is born.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0072.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Naturally language, being the easiest means of communication, comes first. Consequently we see that one of the earliest efforts of every Italian mother is to teach to her child the use of Italian words, her own language. But the infant grows, he becomes a child, he comes in contact with other children, with other people, who express themselves in the English language and which he learns readily. Gradually this language becomes predominant in the conscience of the child, who uses it at home forgetting the language of his mother. Anomaly has been created, a condition which is absurd in itself; thousands and thousands of young Italian-Americans proud of their race, of their fathers and mothers, of the country of their origin, but ignorant of their language.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0073.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A small group of men of faith and action has in the last few years undertaken the teaching of the Italian language in the United States. Some results have already been obtained but there is more work yet to be done. It is you dear boys and girls, who must determine the success of this campaign by attending the classes in Italian, in the junior and senior high schools.</p>
   <p>A few years ago the students of the Italian language in the United States were few, today, there are more than 15,000. There is a great improvement but if we take into consideration that there are five millions Italians residing in this country, figuring at least fifteen thousand for each million, there should be no less than 75,000 students.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0074.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We admire the other racial groups who are successfully fighting for recognition. Why should we then stand still, we, who have been the teachers to humanity for the last twenty centuries.</p>
   <p>We appeal to you, our boys and girls, for your own good, for your future success, to study the Italian language, to become proficient in its use and for such knowledge you may rest assured that you will receive, not only moral, but even financial returns. The Italian element is this country is forging ahead every day, assuring the continuity of the language, which should be known to you so that you could converse with your own parents, transact business with your clients, interchange ideas with your friends.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0075.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>In this land every one is appraised according to his personal worth, for his knowledge, for his activity, for his ability to succeed. Here the different racial groups entering into the formation of this nation are undergoing a process of fusion, of amalgamation, and, in time, there will be only one American race. Each element is contributing some of its best qualities to the product as it will finally evolve.</p>
   <p>Shakespeare, Dante, Goeth, Pasteur, belong to all humanity, their works do not belong to a single group, but they are the property of all civilized people. But who can understand and appreciate Goethe better than the student of the German language? Who can understand Dante better than those having a good knowledge of the Italian idioms?</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0076.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>After all, the roots of the Italian language are not in the works of Dante, or Francis of Assisi, or in the thousands of writers in all the branches of human knowledge; they are in the home, in the warm breath of the mother cheering her son, of the father undergoing hardships for his beloved, of the young man looking at his future with faith and hope.</p>
   <p>The Italian language is in every word a caress that goes to the heart to awaken life there; the sound of the voice is music that renders this land hospitable. Those families that have failed to teach their children the mother language have tragedies of misunderstandings, scission, ruin.</p>
   <p>How many times a single word uttered in a sweet language by a humble mother has brought light in the darkness, peace to a troubled heart, faith in discouragement, vision and courage for action?</p>
