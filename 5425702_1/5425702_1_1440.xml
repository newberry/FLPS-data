<title level="a">THE LECTURE BY BERTELLI ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY</title></bibl>

   <p>Comrade Prof. Joseph Bertelli gave a lecture on Einstein's theory of Relativity, on Wednesday evening, Sept. 12, in the Smith Room at Hull House. A large number of the more intelligent workers, as well as professional people and intellectuals, attended.</p>
   <p>The lecturer is deserving of credit for the simple manner in which he explained the fundamental elements of this difficult and abstruse theory.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Bertelli, Einstein is claiming that: "Space is curved; light is moving in a zig-zag direction; a straight line does not exist; that parallel lines may meet; that bodies are changing direction in accordance with their velocity; that nothing on the earth is standing still; one hour can be more or less than sixty minutes; and that the weight of bodies varies, etc."</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1441.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These theories, which until some time ago were received circumspectly by science, today stand proven by well known astronomers and mathematicians.</p>
   <p>One of these men, from Lick's Observatory, England, has recently stated that the validity of the fundamentals of the new gravitational theory is without a doubt proven - and is revolutionizing the standard set by conservative scientists.</p>
   <p>To prove the statements of the German scientist, the lecturer used the black-board, on which he illustrated his theories, citing examples and comparisons which attracted the attention of even the lay people in the audience.</p>
   <p>Einstein's theory has overturned the world. It is hard for us to give a "relative" account of the lecture given by Bertelli. He was complimented by the audience, and by the press, all of which gave the lecture the credit it deserved as an intellectual event of our colony.</p>
