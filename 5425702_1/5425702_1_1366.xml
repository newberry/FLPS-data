   <p>The book entitled Personal Reminiscences written by Professor Ventresca, besides disclosing his knowledge, evidences the strong character and the indomitable courage of a man who adopted the motto: "Perseverando Vinces." The achievement of Professor Ventresca in acquiring such a complete education at the cost of such continued sacrifices and in the face of tremendous handicaps, should serve as an inspiration to many Italo-American young men and prove that for those who will, there is a way.</p>
   <p>We have read the book and recommend it highly for its literary value and for the refreshing tonic effect it will undoubtedly have on those who might feel handicapped in the quest of an education.</p>
   <p>We feel that Professor Ventresca's Personal Reminiscences should be in the library of every Italian home in America, if for no other reason than the one describing the unusual life of an unusually courageous and optimistic man.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1367.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We feel that the following letter sent Professor Ventresca by Prof. J. C. Fucilla of Northwestern University, carries a strong message and for that reason we quote it in its entirety.</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Ventresca:</p>
   <p>"With our mutual acquaintance acting as a spur I sat down to read your Personal Reminiscences almost as soon as I received it. That I have read them from beginning to end at one sitting is more than sufficient evidence of my interest and enjoyment in them.</p>
   <p>"Your triumph over tremendous handicaps, the consequences of an indomitable will and an unquenchable optimism, should prove to be an inspiration to all, Italians and non-Italians, in their own struggle for success.</p>
   <p>"Among the other admirable traits that you display, I have been struck by your militant idealism and your patriotism. You have demonstrated to a skeptical world that it is possible to be at once a good American <pb facs="5425702_1_1368.jpg" n="3"/>citizen and a lover of the land of glorious achievements of your forefathers. Far too many young people of Italian extraction, especially in their misguided zeal to become assimilated, have not only deliberately blotted out the brilliant tradition which belongs to them, but what is worse, they have come, in some cases, to nourish a strange and implacable hatred towards it. Gaining nothing tangible by such an attitude, they have deprived themselves at the same time of that element that would contribute most to make their cultural lives richer and more worthwhile.</p>
   <p>"Together with my congratulations accept my sincere thanks for the autographed copy of your book which, I assure you, I shall dearly treasure.</p>
   <p>"Under separate cover I am sending you a small Leopardi "omaggio," which I just received from Italy.</p>
   <p>( Signed ) J. C. Fucilla."</p>
