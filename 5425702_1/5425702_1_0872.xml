<title level="a">INAUGURATION OF NEW BUILDING OF BANK DI NAPOLI TRUST CO</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Banco di Napoli Trust Co. of Chicago transferred its offices on April 20 to its newly-acquired building, which is located at Roosevelt Rd. and Ashland Ave., on the Southwest corner.</p>
   <p>The steady growth of its clientele and the increase business, due mainly to the efforts of its director Dr. G. Quattrone, forced them to vacate their old offices at Halsted and Forquer Streets.</p>
   <p>The new building is truly suited to the dignity and traditions of the large financial institution of which the Banco di Napoli Trust Company of Chicago is and autonomous branch. The offices are roomy and fully adequate for the needs of a modern bank which offers its clientele efficient, complete service.</p>
   <p>Even its locality is an advantage, for the bank in more accessible to those who live far from "Little Italy."</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0873.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>With the inauguration of the new offices, a new era for the Banco di Napoli Trust Co.; an era that will add to the prestige and welfare of our community.</p>
   <p>The Italians of Chicago today can proudly point to their own bank as being second to no other institution of its kind among other nationalities. It stands in first place because of its decorative building and offices, its wise administration, the efficiency of its service, the honesty of its transactions, and above all, the absolute safety guaranteed depositors.</p>
   <p>The guarantee for the money entrusted to the Banco di Napoli is and always has been and outstanding feature of the integrity which has distinguished this old and glorious Italian financial institution. In fact, during the unfortunate period when dozens of Chicago banks were closing every day, leaving the depositors on the street, the Banco di Napoli stood calm and safe, and did not suffer any loss.</p>
   <p>The agencies of the Banco di Napoli, which has centuries of experience behind it, are autonomously administered. They instituted in America to protect the interests of the Italian immigrants and their hard-earned savings.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0874.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Following the moratorium imposed by President Roosevelt on the banks, the Banco di Napoli Trust Co. was the first bank in Chicago authorized to resume business without any restrictions. </p>
   <p>The inauguration of the new offices was carried out successfully. Many new accounts were opened.</p>
   <p>The floor open to the public, and the president's office were packed with flowers sent by clients and other banks.</p>
   <p>The Consular authorities were present as were the officers of other financial institutions. Chev. A. Corigliano, president of the New York branch of the Banco di Napoli, was present to congratulate Dr. Quattrone, who is deserving of high praise for having done so much for our community. We are very proud of the Banco di Napoli Trust Co.</p>
