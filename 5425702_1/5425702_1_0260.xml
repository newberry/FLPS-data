   <p>On February 14, 1922, for the first time in the history of Chicago, representatives of the barons of the tailoring industry met a committee from the A. C. W. A. [Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]. They were the first to make such a concession to the demands of the A. C. W. A., which is a strong, feared organization.</p>
   <p>The bosses presented twelve demands. Among the most important were the following:</p>
   <p>1. The absolute right to fire employes and to discipline them as they so desire.</p>
   <p>2. Restoration of the right to seek workers necessary to industry, from the open shop. This would mean a return to the old system which forced the worker to go begging for work from shop to shop.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0261.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. Abolition of the system of equal distribution of work among the tailors.</p>
   <p>4. Elimination of all rules and regulations which prevail among the cutters.</p>
   <p>5. Extension of the work week from 44 to 48 hours a week, and a general reduction [in wages] of 25 per cent.</p>
   <p>The negotiations lasted seven long weeks; the procedure was arduous and required much patience; almost to the last hour it was impossible to predict an accord between the committees capital and labor, and each time they met, a new aspect was given the situation. One day promised peace, another strife. The water was so turbid, it was impossible to give inquiring workers concrete and clear information.</p>
   <p>It is to be noted, however, that the workers knew, as we did, that the position of the organization was immovable, and that the only point which could be discussed with the intention of making some concession was that of the pay reduction. Not because we believe that the tailors are overpaid, <pb facs="5425702_1_0262.jpg" n="3"/>but because, from one end of the country to the other, wages are being reduced without pity, and therefore, the organization had taken the position that if a small reduction was the only obstacle to agreement, it was best to accept it. A ten per cent reduction was agreed upon.</p>
   <p>But the other demands of the employers were rejected, and the strength of the organization has remained intact. The voice of the worker will continue to make itself heard in the tailoring industry. The bosses knew that the organization was, and is, well prepared-morally and financially. In fact they admitted that a strike by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers would throw the majority of the tailoring firms into bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>The contract was finally drawn up on April 3. It was immediately submitted to the Chicago Joint Board, to the conference delegates, and the Shop Chairmen. All unanimously accepted it.</p>
   <p>Tuesday, April 4, the contract was presented to the members in general session at four mass meetings in different parts of the city. Their ratification was the authorization for the representatives of the union to <pb facs="5425702_1_0263.jpg" n="4"/>sign the contract, which will last for three years: from May 1, 1922 to April 30, 1925.</p>
   <p>The rights of the workers remain sacred and inviolate. When the bosses are ready to hire they must apply to the office of the organization, and only in the event of a shortage of union tailors is it permissible for the bosses to go into the open market.</p>
   <p>The power to discharge shall be exercised only by an authorized and responsible representative of the employer, so that it will be impossible for the strutters and ambitious little straw-bosses to punish arbitrarily, as they did in the past. Any time the union feels that an employe has been unjustly treated, and an adjustment cannot be arrived at with the company representatives, the case goes before a board of arbitration for a decision. It is also specifically recognized that during a slack period in the industry, when the amount of work is insufficient to keep all busy, the work must be pro-rated. The Chairman is definitely recognized as the accredited representative of the organization, functioning in the factory for the purpose of safeguarding the rights of the workers.</p>
