   <p>The Italian Consul in Chicago has sent us the following letter:</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Director:</p>
   <p>Because of the continual influx of workers and, in general, Italian workers, from the East and Middle west to California and the rest of the Pacific Coast, and the grave difficulties which are met in trying to place these workers, I would be very grateful to you if you would publish in your accredited newspaper that:</p>
   <p>With the approach of winter there is a lessening of employment for the agricultural and construction workers on the West Coast.</p>
   <p>The Canadian Government, concerned with the unemployment situation in British Columbia, has prohibited unemployed workers from entering that province until March 31. This action aggravates to a further degree the problem of unemployment in the West Coast states of America. The newspapers <pb facs="5425702_1_0354.jpg" n="2"/>have remarked on the conglomeration of unemployed in northern California.</p>
   <p>For the present, in view of the impossibilty of workers finding employment, let us dissuade Italian workers from going to California and other parts of the Pacific coast, unless they are first assured of jobs; also let us advise them to come to this office for information or from the Royal Consulate in San Francisco.</p>
   <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
   <p>Royal Consul Bolognesi</p>
  </body>
