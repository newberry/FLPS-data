   <p>Countess Lisi Cipriani has just issued the fifth edition of the Selected Directory of the Italians in Chicago, preceded by about sixty biographical studies that give the little volume the main title.</p>
   <p>While the Selected Directory listing 4,500 business addresses gave the first comprehensive information about professional and industrial activities of the Italian group, the studies now published supplement our knowledge of our people and are impressive because they offer a constant record of a typically American effort to succeed, either in founding a business, or securing the education indispensable to a professional career. The simplicity of the narrative carries conviction.</p>
   <p>The Italians have been particularly successful in the business of handling food products. They predominate among the produce merchants, and in proportion to their number as a whole, predominate in the grocery and restaurant business. They excel in the production of fine pastry and make excellent bread.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1374.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Countess Cipriani points with special pride to the fact, that in the tailoring business, designers of the leading houses are almost exclusively Italian and that the transformation for the better in the clothing of the masses, is due to our countrymen. They have been instrumental in levelling class differences in the United States, for it is they who have brought it about that well-cut trim looking garments are no longer the perogative of the well-to-do.</p>
   <p>The Selected Directory does not however pretend to list all Italians engaged in business. The biographical studies show that of the firms belonging to several members, some Italians have taken over American firms and these firms, founded by Americans, could not be listed. As Italian there finally remains to be listed the great number of Italians who hold important executive offices in Italian and in American firms.</p>
   <p>The group has done remarkably well and has withstood the present financial crisis better than could be expected.</p>
   <p>Copies of the Selected Directory of the Italians in Chicago would be of particular value to firms and individuals who wish to do business with the Italian people.</p>
