   <p>The strike presents no change. The fight is being continued, not only by the strikers but also by the entire laboring class, which is boycotting to the finish the dailies belonging to the paper trust. The weakest among these papers, such as the Inter-Ocean and the Journal, are beginning to feel the slackness of their output and to fear that after the strike the number of their readers will be reduced by half.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the Socialist and the World have attained an unexpectedly large circulation, for they are the only papers manufactured and read by unionists.</p>
   <p>So great has become the demand for these newspapers that modern rotary presses have had to be installed, and we are thus competing with the bourgeois papers of large circulation.</p>
   <p>The resolutions which are being passed daily by the numerous unions are comforting.</p>

   <p>They have decreed fines varying from $10 to $50 against those members who purchase newspapers issued by the paper trust.</p>
