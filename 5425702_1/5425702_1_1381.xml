   <p>After long, constant and diligent efforts a new book has been published in attractive print which has aroused great interest in the Italian colony. This new publication demonstrates to the Americans that the calumnies against Sicily and the Sicilians are groundless. The printing shop which produced this beautiful volume is one of the largest and best known in America, the Italian-American Publishing Company.</p>
   <p>In the book are some illustrations by Rocco Navigato which constituted an interesting piece of art and style. The book is prefaced by Miss Jane Addams who is very well known and appreciated by Italians as well as by all the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1382.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are sure that the book, written with much consideration and diligence, will erase the bad habit of slandering our race and will reveal the value of our countrymen for what they have accomplished in this country in every field, industrial, economic, artistic and civic.</p>
   <p>The book in part gives an ethnographic description of our race, revealing the achievements of the Italians. For example it deals with Italian labor conditions, organizations, professional men, religious ministers of every creed, music, and artistic patrimony, and closes with a section which contains the photographs, each with a biographical sketch, of the outstanding persons of our community.</p>
   <p>Our best wishes to Schiavo for his interesting work.</p>
