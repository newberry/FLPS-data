   <p>Congresswoman Ruth Hanna McCormick, Senatorial candidate for Illinois, was guest of honor at a banquet given by the foreign press of Chicago.</p>
   <p>John R. Palandech, dean of foreign journalists in our city, was the motivating spirit. He officiated as toastmaster. Mrs. McCormick was surrounded by a group dressed in costumes representing the leading racial groups of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Miss Nina Martini of San Quista wore a gown which had the tricolor of the Italian flag and the emblem of Savoy embroidered on the breast and Miss Laura Caponigni wore the Roman peasant dress.</p>
   <p>The Italian press was represented by our director, the Rev. P. R. De Carlo, <pb facs="5425702_1_1309.jpg" n="2"/>accompanied by Mrs. De Carlo; Chevalier Mastrovalerio and Mrs. Mastrovalerio; Count Carlo Meola of the newspaper L'Italia; attorney De Grazia, and our editor, Charles Bellavia.</p>
   <p>The Italian representatives who spoke at the banquet were Chevalier Mastrovalerio, Rev. De Carlo and Attorney De Grazia. All spoke of the high esteem in which Mrs. McCormick was held among Italian voters and assured her of their unqualified support.</p>
   <p>The evening closed with a speech by Mrs. McCormick in which she discussed her political program.</p>
   <p>All the guests personally met Mrs. McCormick who had words of sympathy for the Italian press and representatives.</p>
