</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The number of the strikers is now forty-five thousand, of which three thousand are Italians.</p>
   <p>This struggle between operators and workers engages all our interest and all our sympathy. We are sure that the workers will finally win, since right is on their side, and that the operators will be forced to surrender as they did in New York.</p>
   <p>Victory would be much nearer if it were not for the shameless behavior of the police, aided by a mob of cut-throats hired by the employers.</p>
   <p>After the Chicago policemen had filled out a questionnaire in which it was found that ninety per cent of them sympathized with the strikers, the smart commissioner of police, Schuttler, selected the most ferocious hounds among the non-sympathizers and armed them with clubs and revolvers, placing them at the disposal of the employers.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0323.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Not even women have been protected against the brutality of this scum of humanity.</p>
   <p>If a working-man even approaches one of the factories with the union badge in his buttonhole, he is attacked with clubs.</p>
   <p>Countless victims have been wounded, or arrested, and they all bear visible signs of maltreatment.</p>
   <p>Four meetings of protest were held on October 21 in various parts of the city.</p>
   <p>The attendance was so large that hundreds of people were obliged to remain outside the four halls.</p>
   <p>There were numerous speakers, and they spoke in various languages.</p>
   <p>V. Verde spoke in Italian.</p>
