<title level="a">MUSICAL WORLD MOURNS - CLEOFONTE CAMPANINI DEAD</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The death of Cleofonte Campanini after a long and painful heart disease, has brought sorrow not only to the Italian colony, but to the entire city as well.</p>
   <p>Maestro Campanini, Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was born in Parma, [Italy] in 1860. He studied music at the conservatory in Parma, and became ever more proficient and distinguished throughout Italy and other countries. This was particularly true here in Chicago, where he gained the good will of all classes of citizens - amateurs or professionals - because of his talent and his pleasant disposition.</p>
   <p>The prominent citizens of Chicago were proud of, and confident in,a maestro who was able to attract the best operas and the best artists to the Auditorium, so that Chicago could take the foremost place in the theatrical <pb facs="5425702_1_1097.jpg" n="2"/>world.</p>
   <p>These operas were lavishly promoted by the same prominent citizens, who invested and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, far more than they ever donated to so-called philanthropic agencies.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, the composer's remains, covered with flowers, were carried to the Auditorium, where an immense gathering of people attended a magnificent vocal and instrumental program. The prelude to the "Deluge" was played, and A. Bonci, tenor, sang Verdi's "Requiem," the "Stabat Mater," and other arias.</p>
   <p>Although many artists live beyond the pale of society, politics, and religion, they invariably revert to tradition at the time of their death. Consequently, on the following Monday, our composer-conductor received Catholic funeral services at the Holy [Name] Cathedral.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1098.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Temporarily, the remains were deposited at Calvary, but eventually they will be sent to the cemetery of the maestro's birthplace.</p>
