  <body>
   <p>This year also, the picnic held at Riverview Park by the Socialist press of Chicago, was a great success.</p>
   <p>A cosmopolitan crowd assembled at the park and the affair was more than just a picnic. It looked like a convention of all different races of the world: the Slavs, Semites, Teutons and Latins, together with all of their ethnical and language varieties.</p>
   <p>Everyone had a good time until the time came for speeches to be delivered by representatives of each group, in the native language.</p>
   <p>Thus the Jews, Germans, Russians, Scandinavians, Serbians, Poles, Italians, etc. held their own meetings.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1270.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The largest meeting was that held in the English language. It was addressed by Messrs. Cunnea, Moyer, and Stateman.</p>
   <p>The Italian meeting had a much larger attendance than meetings of preceding years.</p>
   <p>Dr. Alberico Molinari opened the meeting and acted as chairman.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. V. Vacirca and Mr. Carlo Molinari delivered speeches protesting against the massacres committed by Rockefeller in Colorado, and those in Italy committed by the Government against the striking workers.</p>
   <p>They praised the Socialist organizations and urged every one to join the Party in [support] of its cause.</p>
   <p>The picnic was very successful,and plans were laid for a second one, to be held next September.</p>
