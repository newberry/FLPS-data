   <p>In honor of their golden wedding anniversary, a banquet, followed by a dance, is being given September 6, at the Masonic Temple in Austin for Mr. and Mrs. Pietro Antonio Dasso.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. A. Dasso carries his 71 years, well as does Mrs. Dasso, her 67 years. They were married in 1869, in the church of St. Stephen, which was located at the corner of Sangamon and Ohio Streets, and the ceremony was performed by the Rev. Barrett.</p>
   <p>Witnesses to the ceremony were, the first Italian Consular representative in Chicago, Mr. A. Sciutti, and Mrs. A. Diregiles. The nuptials were followed by a sumptuous dinner given in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Giovanni Battista Dasso, in their home located at Halsted Street and Indiana Ave., which was attended by more than fifty guests.</p>

   <p>Among those present at that memorable time when the Italian colony in Chicago and Chicago itself, were still in the growing stage, were to be found L. Arado, Franceschini, Gazzolo, the two Botto brothers, Dominick and Carlo, Andrea Querolli, first president of the old Societa Unione e Frantellanza, of which Dasso and Riboni were secretaries, G. Gallina, Ribolla, A. Sciutti, G. B. Cuneo, A. Rafio, father of C. Raffio, C. Fabbri, G. Cella, R. Lino, and the Lagorio brothers, Francesco, Guiseppe and Agostino, in fact, all the pioneers of the colony, persons who with zeal and industry created for themselves worthy positions and showed themselves on various occasions worthy members of the Italian colony.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. A. Dasso was born in Chiavari, Province of Genoa, and Mrs. Dasso in Sareta Margherita, a few miles from Chiavari. The Dasso family emigrated from Italy in 1856, and the deceased father of the septuagenarian P. A. Dasso, was one of the first to set up a spaghetti factory in Chicago and at the same time to introduce spaghetti on the menu in this town.</p>
