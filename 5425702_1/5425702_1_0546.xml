  <body>
   <p>The Alleanzra Riciglianese is exploiting every means to facilitate the victory of the Italian candidates in the primary election of September 11. The officers of the organization deserve much credit for their activity in favor of every initiative that will hold high and respected the prestige of our nationality in America.</p>
   <p>The president sent the following appeal to every member of the Alleanzra Riciglianese:</p>
   <p>Brother: We wish to notify you that our society, at its last regular meeting, unanimously resolved to give its official support to every Italian candidate, running for a public office in Chicago, either Republican or Democratic, in the primary election of September 11. It was also resolved to notify, by letter, every member and urge them to vote for the following candidates -</p>
   <p>(Republican Ballot)</p>
   <p>Honorable Bernard P. Barasa - for Judge</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0547.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Michale Libonati - for Judge</p>
   <p>Hector Durante - for County Commissioner</p>
   <p>Rocco De Stefano - for Judge- (Democratic Ballot)</p>
   <p>Anthony D'Andrea - for County Commissioner - (Democratic Ballot)</p>
   <p>We have more Italian candidates on the Republican and Democratic ticket - Everyone deserves our support - It is our duty to show our solidarity in order to assure the victory of the Italian candidates.</p>
   <p>Our generous nation is contributing, in this World War, the blood of her best sons and many other sacrifices. It is our duty to protect her interest. Remember that September 11, is the only day when we can perform this duty.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Vito Mescia, president.</p>
