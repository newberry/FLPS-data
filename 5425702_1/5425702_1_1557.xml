   <p>At a special meeting of the board of directors of the Italo-American National Union, of Mutual Benefit, held at its home offices in Chicago on the evening of June 16, a resolution was passed instructing its president and secretary to inform the general public as to the true character of this organization.</p>
   <p>This society was incorporated under the laws of this state thirty years ago by God fearing, law abiding successful Italian business men, who may yet be pointed out with pride.</p>
   <p>This organization consists of thirty-two lodges with a membership of nearly 4,000 and is composed of and open to all Italians and is carrying on a strictly fraternal insurance business in a law abiding manner, having a guaranty reserve fund of $100,000 on deposit at Springfield.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1558.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For the last four years this organization has had for its only and real supreme president former Judge Benard P. Barasa; the board of directors is made up of business and professional men of the highest character and integrity.</p>
   <p>This organization is non-partisan, non-sectarian, and is engaged in no other business than that of insuring the lives of its members offering charity and good will, and may point with pride to that part of the oath taken by our members "to uphold the American institutions and ideals and to respect the laws."</p>
   <p>This organization wishes it to be known and published that the person referred to in the newspapers recently in connection with certain lawless acts are not officers, nor even members of this organization. That the Executive officers of the organization are its real, and not in name only, officers, and that there never existed, nor is there now, any power behind the chair other than its duly elected officers.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Benard P. Barasa, Supreme</p>
   <p>President.</p>
