   <p>Mr. Consul:</p>
   <p>I am keeping the promise made to you in my last letter, which was to write about the Dante Alighieri Society, an organization which has failed in its purpose.</p>
   <p>This society, founded ten years ago for the purpose of spreading the Italian language and culture throughout the world and to guard the interests of Italians in foreign countries, cannot point to one instance in which it has done these things. There are several reasons for this, the first of which is the enormous expense of establishing schools for that purpose. Another obstacle is the fact that those intrusted with the spreading of Italian culture are lacking in culture themselves. It is an insult to the genius of Dante that such fools are charged with honoring his great name.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1290.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Four honest men of our colony decided to attend one meeting of the society and to express their opinions at the seat of its operations in the Masonic Temple. But the president, that marvelous example of intellectuality, A. N. Gualano, threatened to have sixty police officers in attendance.</p>
   <p>And yet these men were real gentlemen.</p>
   <p>Giuseppe Orrico.</p>
