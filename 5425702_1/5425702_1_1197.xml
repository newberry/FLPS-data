   <p>Giuseppe Sirignano conducted the third band concert of the series sponsored by the Chicago Daily News, yesterday evening, on the Daily News Plaza, and provided a program of unusual variety and interest. It included selections from"Lohengrin"; the "Rienzi Overture," by Wagner; a suite, from "Bizet"; the setting of an act, from "Andrea Chenier," by Giordana; "Waldteufel" waltzes; numbers by Herbert and Battiste, and two compositions by Siriguano, conductor.</p>
   <p>Such a program, of course, cannot fail to display versatility and a steady grasp of the essentials of ensemble. There was the complete co-ordination of tone and exactness of rhythm that is expected of a high-grade band, but there was more. There was brilliance in conception and performance, notably in the Andrea Chenier number, where the wood winds saw their chance and took it with the freedom that belongs to skill. The "Bizet" suite was perforce omitted because of the rule that the concerts must close at 10 o'clock, and that was a pity.</p>
   <p>It might have been prevented had encores been taboo.</p>
