   <p>In Chicago - as is true more or less everywhere - are to be found the so called "prominent colonials," despicable beings who stop at nothing in order to evoke the worship of the multitude of fools. They become presidents of Mutual Benefit societies, or of the congregations of Christ, and will push themselves into every place.</p>
   <p>First of all, I want to describe what those "gentlemen" do at election time. They visit the homes in the colony and say, "Brothers, help me with and you'll not be sorry. You know that I have much influence with the bosses. Very well, any time that you should happen to be out of work, come to me and I'll take care of you." I must admit they do "take care" of some, but only their favored ones, a dozen or so "cossacks." I say cossacks, <pb facs="5425702_1_0711.jpg" n="2"/>because at a sign from their commander they fall to, like the cossacks of the Czar. And further, I wish to add that they receive these benefits not because they merited reward but because they are responsible for base deeds and vile calumnies set in motion against honest workers who are replaced by these "cossacks." This happens even in cases where the worker has been on the job for ten years or more and has never given cause for complaint except to rebel against injustices.</p>
   <p>Now I would like to ask whether this is the "good" done by these "thieves of consciences," and whether there may not be methods other than those of calumny and dishonesty. Let us understand each other: I am not saying this with a feeling of resentment against those who have jobs, but [I do condemn] those who use dishonest methods, and I shout to the workers: Guard against those who are vile and dishonest.</p>
