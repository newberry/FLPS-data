   <p>Another Italian Bank, the Mastrogiovanni Bank, 2252 Wentworth Ave., was forced to close its doors because of the depression. At the instance of the three depositors, D.D. Onofrio, L. Manrellio, and T. Sullivano, who could not meet their payment on a loan they borrowed from the Mastrogiovanni Bank, of $2,500. each, Judge Landis appointed the Central Trust Company as Receiver for the length of time the bank is closed.</p>
   <p>When notice of the foreclosure of the Mastrogiovanni Bank reached the Italian district on the South Side, the depositors ran to the bank to withdraw their savings.</p>
   <p>Many policemen were on hand to prevent the angry depositors from starting a riot.</p>
   <p>The control of the bank was assumed by R. C. Goldback in the name of the Central Trust Co., and Mr. Mastrogiovanni had charge of all the records of the bank.</p>
   <p>The amount of deposits in the Mastrogiovanni Bank were between $40,000. and $50,000.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0971.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The assets of the bank are as follows:</p>
   <p>One-third ownership in the building in which the bank is located, 2252 Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <p>The value for its construction is $25,000. and it carries two mortgages, of $10,500. and $2,000.</p>
   <p>One-third interest in the building located at 108 W. 22nd St., valued at $30,000.</p>
   <p>Three hundred and forty acres of farm land in Florida, valued at $50. per acre.</p>
   <p>Residence of the Mastrogiovanni family, 3710 Grand Blvd., valued at $9,000. and mortgaged for $4,000.</p>
   <p>Assets of the bank, $2,200.</p>
   <p>Safety deposit vaults $2,000.</p>
   <p>An automobile owned by the Bank, valued at $1,000.</p>
