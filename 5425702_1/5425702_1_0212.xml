   <p>During the hot days of Summer, the Italians residing on the North Side, not far from the Lake shore, have found a way to keep cool in the hot Summer days, through drinking, eating, and resting, on the grass by the Lake. This annoyed the rich people who wrote a letter of protest to be published in the Tribune. But the Tribune favored the Italians instead of being against them. The following article appeared in the Tribune, July 10:</p>
   <p>A subscriber tells us that there are too many bums, and writes to the Tribune complaining because too many Italians come over to occupy the green grass on the Lake shore, between Oak street and North avenue. He says they are so numerous that he can not find a seat upon the benches, or even on the grass. He adds that they drink beer, and eat food there, and are not careful as to how they dispose of the bottles and remnants. They are neglectful of their children, letting them go about half-clothed, at times.</p>
   <p>We would like to ask the correspondent if he has ever been in "Little Italy" a mile west of the place he mentions, on a hot night? Furthermore, for whom <pb facs="5425702_1_0213.jpg" n="2"/>were the parks established?</p>
   <p>Also, if he did not envy the little, half-clothed Italians? As to eating their suppers there, the idea is a capital one. We advise this person to try it himself, sometime. But he and the rest should take away the remains of the feast. We are with him in that, and they should have their beer at home.</p>
