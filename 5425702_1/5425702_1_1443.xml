   <p>The Italian Socialists, meeting in general assembly at the hall of the 17th Ward Branch, Saturday, June 17, were happy to greet Comrade Giuseppe Bertelli, who, at the invitation of the Secretariat of the Federation, had consented to come among us for a week of propagandizing.</p>
   <p>Our beloved comrade knew how to satisfy our desire by delivering a powerful discourse on the duties of militant Socialists. Taking his own experiences as an example, a lengthy career as a propagandist and writer, he illustrated to those present the many difficulties which our movement is encountering in its disputed ascendancy and the best method of overcoming them. He treated of the insidious crises which periodically afflict the workers' movement, merely to embarass it for the benefit of the middle class; he ended his talk to the enthusiastic applause of those <pb facs="5425702_1_1444.jpg" n="2"/>present, proclaiming as assured the death of modern confusing tendencies, fruit of the aberration of war, and the triumph of true Socialism to which he has held faithfully, the only living force capable of resisting social sterms.</p>
   <p>The applause accelerated when the chairman of the assembly, Comrade John La Duca, in the name of all present, expressed a vote of thanks to the orator for his beautiful and encouraging talk.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, also, Bertelli spoke at the International Picnic, where an inmense crowd of Socialists, sympathizers, and friends, gathered to hear his brilliant word.</p>
   <p>The out-door celebration was a success. The Italians in attendance were the third largest group present, the first having been the Americans, and the second the Lithuanian. Besides Bertelli, other speakers were La Duca, <pb facs="5425702_1_1445.jpg" n="3"/>and Valenti. Instead of the usual collection from the public, a chosen committee, headed by Comrade Bellandi, appealed to the crowd for voluntary contributions, which amounted to $83.90.</p>
