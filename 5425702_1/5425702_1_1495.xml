   <p>Proclamation of the President of the United States.</p>
   <p>The annual celebration of Columbus Day serves not only to commemorate the glorious achievement of the great discoverer but also to remind the millions of his compatriots who have followed him to these shores of the blessing they have found in this land of hope and opportunity.</p>
   <p>They on their part have enriched our national life in terms of art, letters, and many of the most useful constructive occupations. I send them my cordial greetings.</p>
   <p>Herbert Hoover.</p>

   <p>COLUMBUS DAY WAS SOME YEARS BACK, DECLARED A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.....</p>
   <p>On Wednesday, October 12, Anniversary of the Discovery of America, the Italian colony of Chicago was present at an imposing and solemn ceremony the laying of the corner-stone for the gigantic monument that will be erected in Grant Park at the start of Columbus Drive in honor of Christopher Columbus.</p>
   <p>The monument, work of the sculptor, Carlo Brioschi, will be solemnly dedicated on August 3, 1933, which day has been designated as Italian Day at the coming World's Fair. It is the day on which, in 1492 Columbus sailed from the Port of Palos, Spain.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1497.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The grandeur of the ceremony was a proof of Italian devotion to the greatness of things Italian. Despite of the inclemency of the weather more than 100 Italian societies, the Knights of Columbus in uniform, soldiers from Fort Sheridan, Mayor Cermak with many city officials, judges and the Columbian committee participated in the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Judge Francis Borrelli, president of the Monument Committee spoke on the nobility of purpose in the celebration. Bishop Sheil blessed the corner-stone and in a short talk spoke of the greatness of Italy and her sons.</p>
   <p>Other speakers the Honorable Anton Cermak, Edward J. Kelly, president of South Park Commissioners, Chev. Antonio Ferme, acting Italian Consul in Chicago and Everett Jennings.</p>
