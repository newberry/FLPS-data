   <p>The bourgeois press and the political bosses are worrying about the course which the Socialist Party propaganda is taking in the present political campaign for mayor.</p>
   <p>They cannot explain how it is possible that the Socialist meetings, which the people pay to attend, are crowded, while the Republican and Democrat meetings, which are free, have a very light attendance.</p>
   <p>They are aware that the presence in Chicago of our comrade, Eugene V. Debs, has contributed much to the development and growth of the Socialist movement.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the F. S. I. is appealing to the Italian comrades who are voters, to take more interest in our common cause-- and to not only vote themselves, but to urge their friends and sympathizers to vote for our candidates and to work as watchers at the polls.</p>
   <p>The central office of the Socialist Party of Cook County is in great need of watchers, because the bourgeoisie are accustomed to defrauding and annulling the Socialist ballots when no one is watching them.</p>
