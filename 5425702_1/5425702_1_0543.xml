   <p>The prevalent issue of today, in the opinion of the Chicago public, is the election of the new mayor and part of the municipal council. The election of this year is more important than the preceding ones on account of the hatred existing between the different parties and the peculiar civic situation raised by the recent war.</p>
   <p>A great era of reconstruction is waiting for the new administrator of "res publica." Therefore, it is very important that men of great ability be chosen to protect the interests of the community. Besides every local election will be considered as an experimental trial that will have its reflection on the presidential campaign of 1920.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Consequently both parties try very hard to gain the most convenient position that will facilitate the conquest of the control of the national administration. It is for these reasons and considerations that we exhort the voters of Italian origin to vote for the Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>Great blunders were made by the party that is now in power. The war has raised such condition as to impose the necessity of having a sound and strong mind at the head of our administration to avoid the danger that menace Europe as we see in the condition of anarchy existing in Russia and in the revolution of Hungary.</p>
   <p>Under the administration of the Republican Party, the United States has became one of the greatest of all nations and only the Republican Party can restore the prosperity that we enjoyed before the war.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0545.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We earnestly urge the Italians, therefore, to vote for the Republican Mayor William Hale Thompson, in the Municipal elections of April 1.</p>
   <p>We also urge the Italians, for the spirit of solidarity, to vote for every Italian candidate for one office, running in any party and for that consideration we recommend a vote for Mr. Francio Borrelli, running for judge of the Municipal Court, on the Democratic ticket. The voters of Chicago must vote also on the prohibition question. The Italians are temperate, but not abstinent. They like to drink moderately and are not drunkards and for that reason, they are against prohibition, which is an offense to individual liberty. Italians, vote against the prohibition proposition.</p>
