   <p>Chicago and other cities and towns of Illinois are ready to hold their primary elections. It is the duty of all Italian-American voters to draw attention to themselves as a group regardless of party affiliation. The task is a double one; to affiliate themselves with the right political faction and, the more important one of unconditionally supporting all candidates of Italian birth or origin.</p>
   <p>The Order Sons of Italy is non-political, but that does not bar its members from belonging to a political party as long as it is constructive and not destructive. On the other hand, our Order, which loves and wants our countrymen in America to become American citizens, desires in the same way that they maintain for the honor of the country and race which gave them birth, a spirit of Italianism.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0533.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Order explains this Italianism as a desire and willingness to fight for the place which is the Italian's right in the political life of this great Republic.</p>
   <p>Our Italianism, therefore, must be a beacon by whose light we may find our way to the highest offices in Councils, Legislature and Congress where the destinies of this nation are decided.</p>
   <p>In order to arrive at that place, it is necessary for Italian-American voters to do that which the Jews, Poles, Hungarians, Germans, and Negroes are doing, that is to unite in an aggressiveness of thought and action for the election of candidates of Italian origin.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0534.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The fact that our Order is non-political and that our members are one hundred or more per cent American citizens, does not weaken the tie that binds us to the mother-country. That is an impossibility. An Italian by birth or by extraction will always have Italian ideals, Italian visions, and Italian ways. The oak tree cannot change itself into a poplar nor a poplar into a pear-tree.</p>
   <p>The American citizen of Italian origin has but one task, that of making his own and his countrymen's Italianism constructive.</p>
   <p>It does not matter whether you change your name, or renounce the language of your mother-country, or segregate yourself from Italian communities; you are Italian now and forever.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0535.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And now to all Italians in Illinois, who understand the high significance of the word, Italianism; we offer in the coming primary elections a splendid opportunity for doing your duty by voting in favor of candidates of Italian origin. In Chicago and other cities and towns of Illinois, many Italians are running for public office.</p>
   <p>Members of our beloved Order in Illinois are reminded of their sacred duty which is to vote for candidates who are brother members. Our members on the ballot in Chicago are:- Attorney Vito B. Cuttone, candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court. Attorney Muzio G. Bonnelli, candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court. Attorney Louis J. Leo, candidate for Committeeman of the 9th Ward. Dr. Salvatore Vella, candidate for Senatorial Committeeman of the Republican Party in the First District. In Joliet, the following Italians are on the ballot:- Dr. Francis La Piana, for School Trustee. Chevalier Munzio Di Lorenao, candidate for Delegate to the National Republican Convention. The reputation which these men enjoy makes it superfluous for us to enlarge on the subject.</p>
