   <p>Ten Years. (An Editorial).</p>
   <p>Ten Years! Much is the work we have accomplished, many the victories won, many the defeats experienced. Ten Years! An epoch of change in ideas and customs; but for this paper an epoch at the end of which it finds itself in the fore-front fighting the fight of the oppressed without a thought to any reward.</p>
   <p>During these ten years, we have had to change our tactics to meet the change in those of our opponents, but we still adhere to our program of liberty and justice with which we began our fight, a program which we shall continue to follow as a star that guides the lone traveler on his way.</p>
   <p>We have been the recipients of threats, but we have laughed them down, to persecutions we shrugged our shoulders, and temptations when they came too close, were made to feel the flame of our wrath, and fled like birds of the night at the appearance of dawn.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_1341.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To do battle in a good cause, we were never too tired or unprepared. When the issue involved the integrity of the colony, when impostors and charlatans tried to impose their will to the detriment of the many, we have fought serenely on the field of battle knowing that we were fighting for the best interests of the independent and honest majority.</p>
   <p>We have gone into the field against the "bosses", political and industrial, to protect the interests of the Italian worker. We have unveiled the shameful corruption existing on the West Side, carried by a clique with utter disregard for law and order. We have not allowed old and tried friendships to deviate us from the path of what we considered our duty, and there is now one of the Italian colony's most corrupt members on trial, criminally accused of having attempted to railroad a poor cripple to jail.</p>
   <p>Although we could go on indefinitely speaking on the merits of this newspaper, the special features, our foreign and up to the minute correspondence, we need only point to our large and growing circulation as our best advertisement. And so we wish you all a Happy New Year.</p>
