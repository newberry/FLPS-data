   <p>Mr. E. Bambara, president of the Agricultural Section of this Chamber, read the following report of the Section's activities:</p>
   <p>The Agricultural Section during the last three months has met three times, on April 26, May 3, and May 13, to consider various suggestions for Italian colonization of farming communities in various states of the Union.</p>
   <p>At present we are considering the following project:- The Muscle Shoal Service Association, with offices at 116 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and a vast tract of land at Muscle Shoals, Alabama; the Yuma Mesa Land &amp; Archard Company of Arizona, with offices at 332 S. Michigan Avenue, and the Barney Land Company of Cook County with offices in the Tacoma Building.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0792.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Following the order in which these projects were offered, the Section has under consideration that of the Muscle Shoals Association which wants to establish a colony of Italians. One of our Commission was invited to examine the land and investigate the benefits which can be derived from such colonization.</p>
   <p>The Muscle Shoals Association is ready to finance the tour of the Commission. In a preliminary investigation we found that the Muscle Shoals Service Association is managed by Mr. Willard J. Phinn and is not incorporated. The land offered for colonization is the property of Mr. Phinn. His idea is to sell said property subdivided by lots. The Association also promises a well paying job to everyone who buys a lot as well as helping him in the construction of his home. The prices are from $300 to $500 for a residence lot, and from $700 and up for business lots.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0793.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Phinn owns about 200 acres of land one mile away from the Tuscumia Court House. The Agriculture Section has decided to send a Commission of investigation which will make its final report to the Assembly of the Chamber.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ferrara, from his own observation, stated that Muscle Shoals is not primarily farming land and that Mr. Phinn intends to sell lots on which to build homes.</p>
   <p>The assembly in a general way approved the act of the Agricultural Section and agreed to send a Commission for the investigation and for all the necessary informations.</p>
