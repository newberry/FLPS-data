   <p>Bragno &amp; Mustari, well known Importers and Wholesalers of Italian and other foreign food products, are now located in their new four story and basement building at South Halsted &amp; Forquer Streets. Their business is increasing rapidly.</p>
   <p>Much favorable comment was occasioned some three or four months ago in local wholesale grocery circles, by the announcement that Bragno &amp; Mustari, of this city, were soon to have a new business home, several times larger than their old quarters at 718 South Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>It is therefore interesting to note, that they are now comfortably installed in the new building erected by them, which they have occupied since February 15, and which is a fine new four story and basement structure at 906-910 South Halsted Street, south west corner, Forquer Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0924.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is one of the finest and most pretentious business structures in that part of the city. It has a frontage of 50 feet on Halsted Street and 120 feet on Forquer Street. The firm is occupying a part of the first floor and all of the upper three floors, in this way giving themselves several times the floor space available at the old Halsted Street premises, resulting in a sweeping improvement of service. The large corner section of the ground floor is now occupied by the Chicago branch of the Banco di Napoli (Bank of Italy), which is the oldest banking institution in the world.</p>
   <p>The firm of Bragno &amp; Mustari is among the largest and best in the West of importers and wholesalers in foods from the Mediterranean countries, particularly Italy and Greece. Its business has been established for upwards of a quarter of a century. By careful attention to the details of the business the management has, by up-to-date and efficient methods, honorable dealing, and by handling only quality products, made their concern one of the <pb facs="5425702_1_0925.jpg" n="3"/>most successful and prosperous firms in the country handling the same class of products. It has a reputation second-to-none for fair dealing and high quality, as well as for the excellent service dispensed to the trade. The firm's trade, which has been increasing at a rapid rate during recent years, is not limited to the local field by any means, for it carries on a large shipping business with points far from this city, supplying many large grocers, delicatessen stores and dealers.</p>
   <p>This concern is one of the best examples of the energetic foreign-born merchants enterprise, for F. Bragno &amp; C. Mustari, members of the firm, are of that class of Italian born citizen and business man which demonstrates to the American public the fact that if men have it in them they can make a decided success, whether in their native land or not. To say that Messrs. Bragno &amp; Mustari are typically successful Chicago business men is sufficient to convey the impression of aggressive methods, integrity and fair dealing.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0926.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In its business home made necessary by rapidly increasing business, the firm has entered upon a new epoch in its successful career and one that will intrench it even more strongly in the American foreign goods market. At any rate, it promises even greater achievements in the future.</p>
   <p>We have reprinted this article published in the review, Banker, Merchant and Manufacturer, to prove that the American press is beginning to notice the Italians who honorably distinguish themselves in the commercial field.</p>
