   <p>Let us help to clear certain Americam impressions of Italy that are not always impersonal and that many times are false and unjust. A conception raised beyond its own reasons forces the Americans in general to look at the European immigrants especially by the Italians as being representative of the culture of their Fatherland. This conception, false and exaggerated when applied individually, is no less false when applied to the individual's Fatherland. The American's childish disclaiming can only be based on an echo of our unfortunate vicissitudes.</p>
   <p>For these people, who so highly value the almighty dollar to the end that all else is made subordinate to it, the news of the critical financial situation of our country is sufficient for them to conceive of us as a large uprooted family whose only satisfaction is in the remembrance of past grandeur.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_1_0231.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In spite of America's vaunting of its own progress, a study of the old world - its civic and intellectual life, its political and economic life - would show America what a small thing its progress is in comparison. Taking the despised Italy as an example, the Americans of today could find much in her culture that would serve as a guiding post on the road to civilization.</p>
   <p>Experiments have been initiated in Italy in all branches of science, in the field of engineering and of medicine. In the judiciary, its doctrines are today a part of the civil code in many countries. In the world of art and music, it has some of the foremost exponents of our times. Where the progress of Italy is slow, is in the commercial field, where ingenuity and the will to do are not enough; what it needs is a reputation and that can only be built up slowly. A more thorough study of Europe and Italy by the Americans would be all that is needed for a more favorable conception of European culture.</p>
