   <p>The strikers continue tenaciously and with praiseworthy solidarity.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the companies are still most contemptibly attempting to break the strike. For instance, they called the working men to the factories for their tools. But when the workers arrived, the managers avoided the subject of tools, and reverted to their usual talk on the generous and important concessions they would grant whenever the workers returned to their jobs.</p>
   <p>This ruse, however, failed utterly, because the workers, in a firm and compact front, replied that they would return to work only when a regular contract was signed between the Union and the employers.</p>

   <p>We know of only one scab, a most fervent syndicalist, by the name of Emilo Sassetti. He and his father went to work escorted by the police.</p>
