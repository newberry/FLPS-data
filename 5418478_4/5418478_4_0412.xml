  <body>
   <p>The active Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek V Cicero (Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers Association of Cicero, Illinois) which has always been conscious of its civic duties, has in one of its recent meetings decided to organize a school for aliens in which such subjects as are required [by the naturalization authorities] will be taught, and where those men and women who desire to become citizens of the United States may receive the necessary instruction. Because the examinations given by the [naturalization] officials are very complex, it is necessary that every applicant for citizenship be thoroughly prepared for them, and we hope that all of our countrymen who live in Cicero and who desire to become citizens will take advantage of the opportunity offered them by the Spolek. The expenses connected with the instruction are slight. No tuition will be charged, but a nominal fee of one dollar for light, heat, and rent is payable to the Spolek. Lectures and preliminary examinations for the citizenship candidates will be held later in the T. G. Masaryk School in Cicero. The best teachers have been secured for this school. They are the <pb facs="5418478_4_0413.jpg" n="2"/>former judge, Mr. Josef Langer, and Mr. Frank A. Svoboda. Applications for enrollment in the course must be filed before May 15, 1922, and are to be made either at Mr. Langer's residence, 2526 South 57th Court, or in the office of Mr. Frank A. Svoboda, 5544 West 25th Street, Cicero, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Countrymen and countrywomen! You who have not yet become citizens of the United States; do not overlook this opportunity for there are many disadvantages connected with your present condition, and inimical forces look with disfavor upon you. On the other hand, if you with to take part in the political life and destinies of this, our new home, which participation will be fully possible to you after having become citizens, take advantage of the offer made by the Spolek. Only in this way will you be able to use your political rights of voting and combatting those unfriendly factors which oppose immigrants and make it impossible for them to be elected to offices in which they would use their official powers to their own advantage.</p>
