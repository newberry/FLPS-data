   <p>We have before us the ninth annual report of the Librarian of the Chicago Public Library, William F. Poole, the report is of extraordinary interest to us Bohemians. It is shown in the report that among the directors is a countryman of ours, Mr. L.W. Kadlec, his term of office expires in 1883. To Mr. Kadlec was given the supervision of the finance committee.</p>
   <p>In addition there are employed under the supervision of the Librarians, Mr. W.A. Purer and Mr. L. Meilbek. Mr. F. Novy is employed as night attendant. We have in the Public Library service four Bohemians. In the reading room the following Bohemian Newspapers can be obtained: "Svornost," daily, "Delnicke Listy", daily, "Dennice Novoveku", "Slavie", "Diblik" and "Volnost," all of which are donated. The Library now has 939 volumes of Bohemian books which is an increase of 838 volumes over previous years, however, this number of volumes will be doubled as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>For any success that we Bohemians were able to realize in the Public Library during the past year, thanks should be given primarily to Mr. Kadlec, for his energetic action and intelligence. No one can deny him this, not even his enemies, if he has any.</p>
