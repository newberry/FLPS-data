  <body>
   <p>Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal, principal of the Herzl Public School, delivered a most interesting lecture on the topic, "Bohemia and the Bohemians," in the Young Men's Christian Association at the corner of Kedzie Avenue and Arthington Street last Tuesday night. His lecture was illustrated by colored stereopticon slides, and was attended not only by many members of the Association but also by a very large number of their guests, all of whom listened to Mr. Zmrhal's words with keen interest.</p>
   <p>The Young Men's Christian Association at Kedzie Avenue and Arthington Street has a lecture of some kind every week. Some of them are of local, some of international interest, while others pertain to scientific matters and topics of public import, and all the lectures are open, free of charge, to anyone who wishes to come and hear them. Some of these lectures are arranged by the Cosmopolitan Club, an organization composed of members of many nationalities, some <pb facs="5418478_4_0883.jpg" n="2"/>of them being Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The Club has premises in the school section of the Young Men's Christian Association building, because the school is frequented by many non-Americans who like to take advantage of its generally educational, business, and technical courses. There are day and night classes in which many of our countrymen could improve their minds and get a foundation for more profitable, better-paid employment. The members of the Young Men's Christian Association make no distinction between persons of different religions and nationalities.</p>
