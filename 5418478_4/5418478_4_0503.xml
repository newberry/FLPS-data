   <p>A great number of children attend the Bohemian classes which at present are held in Cicero public schools, and the trustees of the Bohemian Free-Thought Schools is hopeful that, when a new Bohemian school building is erected, interest in Bohemian schools will be still greater. After six Bohemian classes had been opened in the Woodrow Wilson Public School, so many applications were received that three additional classes were opened in the Burnham Public School at 18th Street and 59th Avenue to accommodate children of the Warren Park district.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the collection previously undertaken for the benefit of a Bohemian school totalled seven thousand dollars; therefore the trustees of the Bohemian Free-Thought School decided to begin with the erection of a new Bohemian school building immediately. Lots on 57th Avenue and 22nd Place have been purchased, thus assuring that the new school building will be situated in the center of Cicero's Bohemian community.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0504.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>According to preliminary plans already outlined, the building will consist of six large classrooms and one larger hall, which will be divided by a special solid curtain instead of a partition in order to provide additional classrooms. Work on the new building will begin as soon as final estimates are received. To begin construction work in winter time is considered especially advantageous because of the fact that many generous Bohemian bricklayers and carpenters are expected to offer their services free of charge. The chairman of the building committee, Mr. Jan Sebek, announces that about twenty offers of this nature have already been received.....</p>
