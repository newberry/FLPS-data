   <p>The sixth issue of the Bohemian Review has just come from the press. This monthly, which represents the Czech National Alliance, is doing valuable service to the cause of the Czechs for the liberation of the old homeland. It also stands for the interests of the Czechs of Chicago and those of the entire United States as well. Letters of recognition and favorable comment are arriving at the headquarters of this publication. They come from Czechs of immigrant stock, and also from native Americans, who are interested in our strife for the liberation of the old homeland.</p>
   <p>One article which Joseph Tvrzický captioned "The Ramshackle Empire," treats with conditions in Austria-Hungary. The revolutionary mood of the leaders of the Czech nation is depicted in a manifestation by the community of Czech writers which is presented to the readers of the Bohemian Review in an excellent English translation by Doctor Smetanka. There are several other excellent articles in this issue, It also contains a photograph of <pb facs="5418478_4_0277.jpg" n="2"/>Klofáč, Czech representative in the Austrian parliament, one of the martyrs of our cause.</p>
   <p>This monthly is being sent to the American libraries, the expenses being defrayed by patriotic fellow-countrymen.</p>
   <p>The subscription is $1 per year; a single number costs ten cents. The offices are located at 2627 South Ridgeway Avenue.</p>
