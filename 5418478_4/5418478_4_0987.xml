Both of these cups will be presented to the Club next Saturday night in the hall of the Vojta Naprstek School. On this occasion there will also be an entertainment in honor of the successful season. The members of the team Sparta Union I will receive gold medals; the members of the Sparta Union II, who won second place, will receive silver medals. All friends of the Club are invited to attend <pb facs="5418478_4_0988.jpg" n="2"/>the entertainment....In a meeting held last week, Mr. Padour was elected chairman; Mr. Mazac, senior, vice-president; Mr. Fencl, secretary; Mr. Piskule, treasurer; Mr. Janeb, financial secretary.
