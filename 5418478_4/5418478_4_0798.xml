<title level="a">FREE THOUGHT LECTURES IN THE CREMATORY HALL OF THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In response to the generous permit given to the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) by the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery), the Federation is making preparations for a series of lectures to be given during the summer months in the large auditorium hall of the crematory. The first lecture of the series will discuss cremation and its hygienic significance. This lecture will be delivered by Mr. J. J. Jelinek, editor of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason). There are still many prejudices even among our own freethinkers against this manner of disposing of the dead, and it will, therefore, be quite appropriate to touch upon this theme. It is desirable that everyone, both supporters and opponents of the idea of cremation, come to listen to this first lecture of the series. The lecture will begin at 3 P. M. and admission is free.</p>
   <p>The lecture will be preceded by an organ concert. The organ used for this is <pb facs="5418478_4_0799.jpg" n="2"/>one of the finest available. Since the ventilation in the hall is very fine, making a sojourn in it pleasant even during the hot summer afternoons, it is anticipated that a great many of our countrymen will avail themselves of this opportunity and attend the lectures. The Svaz intends by this means to propagate the Free Thought movement among our Czechoslovak freethinkers in Chicago, and everyone who will call this venture to the attention of his friends and acquaintances, will thus help to promote a good cause.</p>
