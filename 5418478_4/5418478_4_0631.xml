   <p>The meeting was called to order by the president, Mr. K. Kopecký. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Societies which are members of the Sdružení Ceských Svobodomýslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Czech Free Thought Schools in Chicago) announced the names of their representatives for the year 1912.</p>
   <p>The Sdružení Ceských Svobodomýslnych Skol v Chicagu is being joined by a new organization, the Kruh Dobrovolnych Prispivatelu Svobodomsyslných Skol v Chicagu (Circle of Voluntary Contributors to the Free Thought Schools in Chicago).</p>
   <p>Mrs. F. Stanek-Bujarek turned over to the financial secretary $28.50, which <pb facs="5418478_4_0632.jpg" n="2"/>was the amount of the first contribution. At the same time she mentioned that the list of members and the amounts of the contributions received is available for inspection by the members. The idea of creating such an organization was first advanced by an earnest and unselfish worker for free thought schools, Mr. Svoboda. There are many, many of our countrymen in Chicago, who live in prosperity, and whom it would not hurt if they voluntarily contributed a sum toward the maintenance of the free thought schools. All that is necessary is for some one to call on them and to ask them to contribute. Mrs. F. Stanek-Bujarek convinced herself of the willingness of our countrymen to contribute to this cause. A true freethinker is not he who profits from free thought, not he who constantly speaks about it, but he who without claiming any reward, works and voluntarily reaches down into his pocket and gives. Mr. F. Benes turned in five dollars for the benefit of the free thought schools. This sum was contributed by the Tabdrity (Taborites) in honor <pb facs="5418478_4_0633.jpg" n="3"/>of the memory of Mr. E. Pajer, a former member, who died recently in Cleveland. This is an example worthy of imitation.</p>
   <p>In Town of Lake, the Saturday and Sunday morning school will be tried out for another month. The sub-committee's report was accepted. The meeting proceeded to the election of officers. All officers were unanimously re-elected with the exception of those who did not accept the nomination or of representatives who had withdrawn. A debate developed in regard to the improvement and expansion of the journal. Svobodna Skola (Free School). Each quarter in the year, this journal shows a considerable loss, although Mr. Jirak, its energetic manager does everything possible to extend its circulation. It was decided to widen the scope of the journal to meet the needs of mature readers. A special press committee was elected to work out a plan for the expansion and management of the journal. Because of the late hour, the meeting was adjourned until January 27, at 8 P. M......</p>

   <p>January 27, Continuation of Previous Meeting</p>
   <p>The report of the Committee on Education was accepted. It was decided to purchase maps of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. A distinguished friend of free thought education, Mr. Voborsky, donated many fine books to the schools.</p>
   <p>A motion was made that Mr. Voborsky be given a vote of thanks.....</p>
   <p>The secretary and financial secretary are paid the sum of $25 per year for their services, and a motion was made that the secretary of the subcommittee, Mr. V. Kyml, who has even more duties, be paid for his services. Mr. Kyml objected, saying that he does not want any compensation for his services and that he will continue to work for the good of the schools to the best of his ability.....</p>
   <p>Receipts for the past quarter were $3,039.52; disbursements, $1,919.21; <pb facs="5418478_4_0635.jpg" n="5"/>balance on hand in the treasury $3,004.04. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>(Mrs.) F. Stanek-Bujarek.</p>
