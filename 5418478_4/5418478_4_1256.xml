   <p>The Slovanska Sokolska Gymnasticka Unie (The Slavonic Sokol Gymnastic Union) in which twenty-two Slovak Sokal units are organized, gave its annual account of its educational activity in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs last Saturday evening. It put on a public exhibition ending a year of most outstanding activity. It commemorated the successful termination of a Sokol instructors' course, and provided an opportunity for the presentation of a trophy won by our Sokols at the Olympic games last June.</p>
   <p>There is a scarcity of trained instructors in Sokol because gymnastics cannot now be taught by dilettantes, and teachers must have not only technical ability, but also a good training in anatomy and physiology. For that reason the teachers' course was instituted, and the graduates of that school will be in a position to put new life into our gymnasiums.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1257.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The course lasted seven months. It started with fifty students, of whom eighteen received their diplomas last Saturday. The diplomas were presented to the graduates of Brother Jaroslav Kosar, a hard worker in Sokol circles, who, with Brother Stibr, was the leader of the recently terminated course.</p>
   <p>The presentation of the cup which the Unie won at the Olympic Games for its achievements in gymnastics and singing was delegated to the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), Mr. Jaromir R. Psenka, who made the presentation with a few well chosen words.</p>
   <p>The students of the course for Sokol instructors gave the audience a treat by presenting three very difficult routines of calisthenics and an exhibition of drill on the broad horse which the performers seemed to enjoy as much as the spectators.</p>
   <p>The first group of graduates of this course presented three elegant demonstrations of the French way of boxing.</p>

   <p>The teachers' class showed excercises on high parallel bars, and their daring stunts brought forth bursts of applause.</p>
   <p>The Men's chorus of the Ustredni Pevecla Jednota (The Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies), under the direction of its teacher, Mr. K. M. Coufal, sang a few beautiful songs; Mrs. Cervenka offered a recitation; Dr. J. D. Novak and Miss Kamilla Kosar played Dvorak's Slavonic Dance Number 4, a piano composition for four hands. Miss Kosar further ingratiated herself to those present by playing three other compositions for piano, one by Mendelssohn, one by Sinding and one by Chopin.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hus's orchestra supplied the accompaniment to the calisthenics.</p>
   <p>The attendance was fair and the festival turned out to be a complete success.</p>
