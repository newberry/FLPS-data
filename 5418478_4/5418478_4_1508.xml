<title level="a">REPORT FROM FIRST MEETING FOR THE JAN HUS MEMORIAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday the first consultation of the delegates elected from the Svobodna Obec (Congregation of Bohemian Freethinkers), lodges, and societies of Chicago took place. The meeting was held to discuss the Jan Hus Memorial which is to be erected in Chicago in the year 1915 in commemoration of the five hundredth anniversary of the death of the Master, Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake on July 6, 1415.</p>
   <p>Dr. Frantisek Iska was elected chairman of this meeting and Mr. Leopold Ruzicka was elected secretary. Doctor Iska, who called the meeting, presented a brief report and added that of fifty-one lodges and societies having headquarters in Chicago, only eleven had thus far sent him the names of their delegates. Because elections have been held by some organizations but the names and addresses of the committee members have not as yet been sent in, and because in some societies delegates are yet to be selected, he recommended that this meeting be considered as preliminary, and that the regular advisory propaganda committee be created at the next meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1509.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the proclamation which he previously sent to the lodges and societies, it was promised that the building committee would not be created until June, 1913, and that the number of votes would be distributed according to the amount contributed by the organization represented. For out-of-town societies, votes will be cast either in writing or by proxies selected by said organizations to represent them in the local consultation meetings in Chicago. Absolute impartiality will thereby be assured, and at the same time, any possibility of delay by those who contributed nothing and have no real interest in the success of the enterprise will be avoided. Applications have been received from almost one hundred out-of-town lodges and societies expressing a willingness to co-operate. Most of these have already set up special funds which are growing satisfactorily. The creation of an advisory committee which we now want to set up will in no way be detrimental to the out-of-town friends of this idea, because the advisory committee will confine itself purely to propaganda and preliminary work. The meeting adhered to the original idea that the legally-appointed building committee will be formed later and will include delegates from the out-of-town lodges. Then there followed a lively debate which showed the enthusiasm for the Jan Hus <pb facs="5418478_4_1510.jpg" n="3"/>Memorial. A motion was made and passed that the secretary of today's meeting, together with Doctor Iska, ask all local lodges which indicated their assent but have not as yet elected delegates, to do so and submit their names to Dr. Frantisek Iska, 1510 West 18th Street. It was resolved that on Sunday, March 24, 1912, there be held another meeting which will be considered the organization meeting for the advisory committee and at which officers will be elected. The hope was expressed that at this meeting new and favorable reports will be received from out-of-town groups about the progress of collections being held by various lodges.</p>
   <p>Dr. Frantisek Iska, chairman.</p>
   <p>Leopold Ruzicka, secretary.</p>
