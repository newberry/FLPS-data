<title level="a">MEETING OF THE HAVLICEK MONUMENT COMMITTEE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held Wednesday evening at Mr. E. Welky's on Blue Island Avenue at 18th street, in which matters were discussed pertaining to the unveiling of the Karel Havlicek monument, which now stands in Douglas Park. The attendance at the meeting was large. It was plainly seen that interest in the celebration is spreading in the broadest circles. Even those who were first concerned with the idea of erecting a monument to the memory of Havlicek in Chicago were present.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Vojta Sedlacek. Several motions were made during the meeting, which were accepted by those present. The first was that at the unveiling ceremonies casts of Havlicek's bust be sold, so that the memory of Havlicek would be better impressed in the minds of Bohemians. A motion <pb facs="5418478_4_1563.jpg" n="2"/>was also made by Mr. Kolacek that Governor Deneen and other leading men of Chicago be requested to address the English speaking people at the ceremony. The gift of $1500, from the Bohemian National Cemetery Association, was turned over to the committees during this meeting, whereupon the heartfelt thanks of all those present were extended to the representatives of the Cemetery Association.</p>
   <p>To the enlargement of the festive occasion, a parade is to be sponsored by the Taborite Society in which several beautiful and allegorical floats will appear. The next meeting will be held on May 24, at 9 P. M.</p>
