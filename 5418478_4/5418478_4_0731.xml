   <p>Minutes of the meeting of Patronat Skoly C. S. P. S., (Patronage of the Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society School), were read at a meeting held May 27, 1901. Bills against the organization were read, accepted and ordered paid. The committee on accounts announced, that it had examined the old books, and that at the next meeting receipts would be $21.50 greater. The financial committee announced, it had more money pledged for the time when actual construction begins. The building committee announced that the plans and specifications were completed, with the exceptions of the necessary signatures, and at the same time that it had visited several banks, and one will make a loan under certain conditions.</p>
   <p>The report was accepted and a resolution adopted that, the financial committee make the proper arrangement with a bank and report the result to the secretary, who would then call a special meeting and the Patronage <pb facs="5418478_4_0732.jpg" n="2"/>would decide whether or not to accept the conditions. Former representative, Tomas Vonasek, announced that we would receive our charter before the next meeting. One representative and one former representative notified us that if it became necessary, they would place their clear properties as surety for the Patronage. Accepted, and the representatives were thanked for their willingness, but the Patronage has sufficient assets to guarantee the loan. Representatives absent at this meeting were: Ant. Hemzacek, F. Paul, Vaclav Soukop, Jan Basta. Receipts this meeting: none. Disbursements $26.60. Balance on Hand $269.21.</p>
   <p>Meeting adjourned and the next meeting was set for June 10, 1901.</p>
   <p>Jindrich Slezak, secretary.</p>
