   <p>A ceremony to honor the memory of Fr. B. Zdrubek, during which a memorial plate donated by the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov(Czech National Cemetery) was unveiled, took place at that cemetery yesterday afternoon. The celebration was arranged by the Ceskoslovenska Svobodna Obec (Congregation of Czechoslovak Freethinkers) and the board of representatives of the Cemetery in co-operation with the Grand Lodge of the Ceskoslovenske Podporujici Spolky (Czechoslovak Benevolent Societies) of Illinois and the Sokol unit of which Zdrubek was a member.....</p>
   <p>The ceremonies started at two o'clock in the great hall of the Crematorium with an organ interlude played by Mr. Stepan Erst, who also played between the several sections of the program. The chairman of the board of the Narodni Hrbitov, John Pecha welcomed the participants, who arrived in numbers fully adequate to the importance of the ceremony, and introduced the speakers, Dr. Anton Mueller and Jos. Lang.....</p>

   <p>....Mr. Lang, a Sokol and an ardent worker in all of our loftiest causes, especially the pursuit of the principles of the founders of our Sokol movement, Fuegner and Tyrs, after an appraisal of Zdrubek's activities, bitterly complained that the delegation from Czechoslovakia which came to attend our Slet (Sokol mass convention) advocated a change in the constitution of our Sokolska Obec (Sokol Community) which has resulted in the throwing overboard of all that our Sokols have been preaching for fifty years, and for which they are still fighting. Mr. Lang's speech met with the approval of the public, who evidently agreed with him. No doubt this matter will be considered in due time and at the proper places.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav J. Petrzelka, speaker of the Svobodna Obec, talked about the credit that is due to Zdrubek for his initiative in the founding of the Narodni Hrbitov, and for his efforts toward the propagation of the ideals of the Free Thought movement.....</p>
