   <p>Chicago's old settlers held, yesterday, a festival in Ogden Grove. Between 7,000 and 8,000 people enjoyed all kinds of entertainment during the day and in the evening, when the prizes were distributed, the attendance was over 10,000 people. Around 2 P.M. the festival commenced with the writing of the signatures in the "Memorial Book." Only those settlers were allowed this privilege, who have lived in Chicago not less than twenty years, and who are over thirty-five years of age. This being done Em. Hochster, then introduced a very old judge, white-haired J. D. Caton, who came to Chicago fifty years ago in 1833. Chicago was incorporated in July, 1833, and Mr. Caton and Bill Carpenter are the only two Bohemians who participated in the ceremony of incorporation.</p>
   <p>Old Judge Caton gave a short review of the history of Chicago and its first years of development. His narration was interwoven with many very interesting and humorous episodes. At the time of the incorporation of Chicago there were only three girls in town. One of them is still living, her name was Miss Gray, but she has been grandma for a long time and is always merry.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0051.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In 1834 Mr. Caton was elected Justice of the Peace, although he had never held that office before that time. He performed his first weddings on the North Side and twenty years later he untied some of these couples. Ordinarily he charged only three dollars ($3) for the certificate of marriage and it was so reasonable that all couples wanted to be married by him. In 1837 he was elected an alderman of the 3rd Ward and because of that, he became a member of the first City Council. Following are the names of the oldest settlers, who participated in the festival:</p>
   <p>D. Schmitz (1827), T. T. Kennall (1832), Jan D. Caton, Dr. V. A. Boyer, J. B. Allen, Ratchel Clom, F. Engelhardt (1833), Leo Meiers, A. Berg, T. Lyle Dickey, Barbora Gerber, J. Miller, D. M. Ford, Delphine Rasinot (1834), Jiri Sinclair Marghall, Jiri W. Blair, J. Chackfield, Peter Casey, Kat. Miller (1835).</p>
