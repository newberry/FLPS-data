   <p>The other day there was issued by the printinghouse of August Geringer a very valuable publication, which certainly will surprise the Bohemian public.</p>
   <p>The publication describes the history of the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and so long as it describes the Bohemian lifeit is, undoubtedly, a wonderful contribution to the history of American Bohemians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This publication entitled "The Memoirs of the Bohemian Doctor," discusses the history of the Bohemians in America, generally, and in Chicago, particularly and is written by the oldest Bohemian physician in Chicago, Dr. Jan Habenicht. A beautiful preface adorns the first pages of this book. The annals of the Bohemian life in Chicago are the most important part of the book and you will find there a complete description of the private, public, and social life of the Bohemians, and it will be really a truly cherished remembrance for everybody; so much the more as the details are described correctly, completely and impartially.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0343.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The price of this book is 25 cents, which makes it accessible to everybody. It is even possible for the poor people to buy this book for their household. There are innumerable perfect and original illustrations. Generally speaking, the book, "Memoirs of the Bohemian Doctor," is very meritorious and worthy to be acquired by every Bohemian, because it is a chronicle of our life on the soil of our new fatherland.</p>
