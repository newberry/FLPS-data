   <p>The ceremony of laying the cornerstone of the joint headquarters for the societies of Irving Park, the Czech school and the gymnasium was held at four o'clock yesterday afternoon--shortly after the funeral of the estimable Czech journalist, Mr. Frantisek B. Zdrubek. The gala parade started from the Old People's Home and Orphanage with Mr. Povolny's band in the lead. The participants in the parade marched along Fortieth Avenue toward the building site between Nilson and Eastwood Avenues. Mr. Vaclav Scheiner, the oldest settler in this community, and his wife Aloisia Scheiner marched in the parade. The following societies marched in columns: members of the Joint Committee and guests, the children from the Orphanage in charge of their governess, Miss Vilim; Women Sokols (gymnasts) in uniform; Lodge Josephine Havlicek, Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Women's Unity); The <pb facs="5418478_4_0663.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian Liberal (Free thought) School Association of Irving Park; The Women's Club; Lodge Svobodomyslnost, Ceskoslovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society); and Sokol "Rozvoj." When the parade arrived at the building site, the ceremony was begun with the singing of the Czech national anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where is my homeland ....).</p>
   <p>Those present were then welcomed in the Czech and English languages by the chairman of the Joint Committee, Mr. J. Ringl who at the same time thanked everyone for their participation in this great and significant celebration. He then introduced Mr. and Mrs. Scheiner. Mr. Scheiner thanked the committee, wishing it success, and placed into the hands of the chairman a contribution of one hundred dollars toward the completion of the school and gymnasium. The chairman thanked him for his patriotic contribution and the generosity with which he showed his love for this patriotic project. Mr. Ringl then spoke to the public .....</p>

   <p>After Mr. Ringl had concluded his speech the band played the American anthem and "Hej, Slovane" (Hey, Slav) which was followed by shouts of Na Zdar! (Success). Those present were then addressed by Congressman Frank Buchanan who expressed his wish that the society might rapidly achieve its goal. Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan addressed the assembly with moving and deeply significant words ..... Representing the Twenty-seventh Ward, Messrs. Wilson and Heydal wished the committee all success and promised to help in every way possible.</p>
   <p>A communication received from Mr. J. Cervenka was read. Enclosed was a contribution of ten dollars. Mr. F. Ort thanked the participants and briefly urged the young people present to further patriotic endeavors. Following him, the representatives of several societies spoke, expressing their wish for much success and contributing monetary assistance of:</p>
   <p>Lodge Josephine Havlicek No. 129, Bohemian Women's Unity--fifty dollars; <pb facs="5418478_4_0665.jpg" n="4"/>The president of Lodge No. 170, C. S. P. S. Mr. Bastyr, in the name of sixty-seven brothers--sixty-seven dollars;</p>
   <p>Miss Anna Kral, president of Sokol Rozvoj, turned in five dollars.</p>
   <p>For the Bohemian Women's Club of Irving Park, Mrs. Skala turned in ten dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Urban donated five dollars.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Suchman, representing the Association of Bohemian Liberal Schools of Irving Park, thanked all the donors and wished the enterprise much success. This Association loaned and placed at the disposal of the Committee all of its cash which amounted to $500.</p>
   <p>Mr. Laznovsky informed the people present that the sum of $1,000 was still needed for the construction of the school, and for that purpose the Joint <pb facs="5418478_4_0666.jpg" n="5"/>Committee of the Czech societies of Irving Park has issued shares of five dollar denomination, paying four per cent interest and payable in six years. Everyone may purchase them. Following this announcement, an active interest among those present seemed to be aroused, and shares were subscribed for, collectively. Many contributors appeared and turned their donations over to Mr. Ringl. The chairman thanked the donors for their contributions, pointing out once more the purpose of the fund, and announced that the cornerstone would have placed within it mementoes of the day to preserve the history of the occasion and asked those present to participate in these rites. At the same time the chairman invited those present to participate in the various informal entertainments in the gardens of the Old People's Home and Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Everybody then marched to the grounds of the Old People's Home and Orphanage, accompanied by the band. Here by lamplight a program of entertainment was given.</p>
