   <p>Patriotism, expressed in words and attested to by contributions, was manifested last night in the hall of Sokol Chicago, 24th Street and Kedzie Avenue. The carnival of sport was given to provide aid for our young men who offered their services to Uncle Sam and were accepted by the Twenty-seventh Recruiting Commission.</p>
   <p>The hall was overcrowded. Very seldom has the Sokol hall witnessed such a multitude of our enthusiastic fellow citizens. The program was carefully prepared and successfully executed, so that everyone liked it very much.</p>
   <p>The main attraction was the match between the Czech wrestler, Tokuff, and his equally able opponent, Martinson. It resulted in a draw. There were also several vaudeville numbers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1171.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Alderman Otto Kerner, Judges Scully and J. Uhlir, and Mr. Rainey, clerk of the circuit court of Cook County, delivered patriotic addresses. They pointed out that the soldiers who took up arms to help crush the foe threatening the United States and all of mankind, are sacrificing their dearest possessions--their lifes--upon the altar of the fatherland and for the ideals of humanity. Those men who stay at home are under an obligation to show their recognition of soldiers' merits by sacrificing to the utmost degree.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee may well be satisfied with the success achieved at Sokol Chicago, which will inspire them to further efforts for the benefit of our soldier boys. The affair was sponsored by the Twelfth Ward branch of the National Army League, with Anton J. Cermak as chairman.</p>
