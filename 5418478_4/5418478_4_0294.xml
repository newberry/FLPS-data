   <p>The need for discussing the Bohemian question in the English language has been felt for a long time, because only in that way can the general American public become acquainted with our desires and with our work in this country. This aim has been followed for years by some American newspapers which carry articles dealing with Bohemian problems and no unbiased observer of the five years of activity of the Cesko-America Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) can deny that a great deal of good has been accomplished in this way, that the work done by the Kancelar is of great importance for our cause during these times, and that the Kancelar may justly be proud in stating without possible reproach of exaggeration that in many cases, the Kancelar was the only agency that knew how to and did put up a timely and able defense when the Bohemian nation was being attacked or its interests damaged by the English language press <pb facs="5418478_4_0295.jpg" n="2"/>in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>We have all felt that this activity should be supported by a well edited, tastfully set-up periodical run in the Bohemian spirit but printed in the English language. The publication of such a periodical has just started. It is The American Bi-Monthly (sic), edited by Mr. A. G. Melichar of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar and by the English language secretary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni V Chicagu (Bohemian National Alliance of Chicago), Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal.</p>
   <p>The cover of the magazine is purely Slavic in design, printed in three colors, and its unusual appearance is bound to arouse general interest by its attractiveness. The reading matter is well selected, composed of articles accessible to various classes of readers. Thus, the first issue contains an article by the well-known friend of the Bohemian nation, Professor Monroe, under the title, "Bulgarians' Attitude and its Justification". There are also these articles: "The Coming of the Slav," "A Christmas Story," "Austria Nearing Bankruptcy," <pb facs="5418478_4_0296.jpg" n="3"/>"Ashy," and "Century of Opera in Chicago," by Dr. J. S. Vojan, in addition to many valuable short items, a glossary of Slavic matters, several essays and other works dealing with our national life. Anybody who is interested in this unusual fortnightly review may receive additional information by addressing The American Bi-Monthly, 2340 South Lawndale Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
