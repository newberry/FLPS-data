   <p>To the numerous gymnastic associations in Chicago, there was added another unit, namely the Tel. Jed. Sokol Tabor (Gymnastic Union Sokol Tabor) located in New Tabor, in the Merigold Subdivion. The organization of a Gymnastic Society, in which would center the patriotic efforts of Bohemian men and Bohemian youth, has been the subject of discussion for some time in New Tabor. Last Sunday this idea was fulfilled. A meeting was announced, to take place in Pertl's hall on 12th St. and 41st. Ave., for the purpose of organizing a Gymnastic Society, and this was actually accomplished; taking the name Tel. Jed. Sokol Tabor, (Gymnastic Union Sokol Tabor). Eighteen members joined the new organization at once and from among themselves they chose temporary officers. It was resolved to hold a meeting next Sunday at 2 P. M., at which time regular officers are to be elected.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1378.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The membership fee, for the time being is to be $1.00. Bohemians of New Tabor, should show by joinging the newly organized Sokols, that they are not indifferent to the patriotic efforts that our Gymnastic Societies are supposed to cultivate.</p>
