   <p>It seems that the recently adopted name "Komensky Avenue" does not please some Irishmen living on that street, because they are trying to have it changed to "Kenneth Avenue". For that reason they are making a canvass of the people living on Komensky Avenue, especially those located between 22nd Street and Ogden Avenue, in an attempt to persuade them to sign a petition which would soon be submitted to the city council. Thus, many Bohemian residents have also been approached and asked to sign this petition, and we are told that some of them have done so. It would appear almost unbelievable that any of our countrymen could be persuaded to do anything of the kind, but the canvassers themselves boast that they have secured many signatures, among them those of Bohemian people. The Bohemian population should be proud of the fact that their street carries the name of the great Teacher of Nations, Komensky, and it would certainly be a disgrace for any Bohemian to give his name and consent to the proposed change. The city council has given the name "Komensky" to this street in order to honor the memory of a great Bohemian.</p>

   <p>Our countrymen should therefore do all in their power to make certain that the street will keep this Bohemian name.</p>
