   <p>The name of Frantíšek B. Zdrubek, journalist and noted freethinker (free religionist), who passed away just recently, was honored in a most dignified manner in a special meeting held by the delegates of the United Czech Societies of Irving Park in the lodge headquarters on the premises of Mr. V. Matas, on North 40th Avenue, last Sunday. Mr. Matas extolled the merits of the deceased in regard to Czech schools in Chicago, and also in regard to the work done by him for the spreading of liberal thought. The speaker moved that the Czech Liberal school in Irving Park be named Czech Liberal School F. B. Zdrubek; the words to be engraved on a stone panel on a wall of the school building. The motion evoked great enthusiasm, and was passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>Though the school building is still under construction, the memorial tablet was ordered immediately and set in, so that it can be seen on the partly finished building, proclaiming to all who pass by that the <pb facs="5418478_4_1512.jpg" n="2"/>liberal-thinking Czechs know how to honor the memories of their foremost workers.</p>
