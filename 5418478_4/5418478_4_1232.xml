   <p>The annual competition of the Cook County Amateur Athletic Federation, which includes a large percentage of the athletic and gymnastic bodies of the county, was held in the Young Men's Christian Association Building on LaSalle Street, last Saturday night.</p>
   <p>The participation in the contest was by no means as large as it has been in past years. Had it not been for two teams of the Sokol Plzen, the whole tournament would have given the impression of a turner affair.</p>
   <p>The best man, and, therefore, the champion of the Federation this year, our Jiri Vesely who won 91.25 points out of a possible one hundred. The second place was contested by Frantisek Paul and Vaclav Stransky, both having won 89 points; but Paul graciously took the third place, and, with it, the bronze <pb facs="5418478_4_1233.jpg" n="2"/>medal. Jacob Kraft of the German Turnverein Vorwaerts made 84.25 points.....</p>
   <p>As a team, our Sokols made 482.25 points.....</p>
   <p>The results of the competition insure again to the Sokol Plzen--for the third time in succession--both the individual and the group (team) championship of the Federation.</p>
