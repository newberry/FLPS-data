   <p>That friend of labor, darling and patron of Bohemian Socialist Democrats, Mr. August Geringer, has been shown in his true colors. With deceptive pretense he acquired the union label, thought he had no intention to abide by union conditions and never did abide by them - but he could permit him-self anything. Finally, however, his time has come. The officers of the Bohemian Typographical Union, together with representatives of the Allied Printing Trades Council, investigated conditions in the printing plant of Svomost and were convinced that union wages were not paid nor were union hours observed there, for that reason a strike has been called in that establishment and the union label taken away.</p>
   <p>Svornost appeared without the union label yesterday.</p>
   <p>The hypocrisy of "Geringer" is astonishing. When several of our typesetters quit working, because their unreasonable demands, to be made shareholders in the business, as those are, who started the business and with great sacrifices worked through from bitter beginnings, were not granted, Svornost wrote maliciously that there is a strike in our plant.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0235.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The day before yesterday a strike was declared against Svornost in accordance with union rules and the union label was removed.</p>
   <p>"Geringer" is as silent as the grave about this, for he wants to keep the public in the mistaken belief that his plant is a unionshop.</p>
   <p>Whoever still believed there was a little sincerity in that old fox, probably will have his eyes opened now.</p>
