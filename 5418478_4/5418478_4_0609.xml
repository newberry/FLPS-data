<title level="a">PUBLIC NOTICE OF THE PATRONAT SVOBODOMYSLNE SKOLY VOJTA NAPRSTEK</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Patronat Svobodomyslne Skoly Vojta Naprstek (Trustees of the Free Thought School Vojta Naprstek), against its wishes and inclinations, feels obliged to address the following notice to the Bohemian public and to all Freethinking individuals and organizations contributing to the upkeep of Bohemian Free Thought schools:</p>
   <p>A very important and most desirable step has been taken in forming the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools in Chicago), because by this a uniformity in the instruction and in the payment of teachers in all schools has been achieved. It is a well-known fact that the teachers are being paid out of the contributions made by the members of various Free Thought organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0610.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After due deliberation, our Patronat agreed to join the Federation on the condition (which has been properly put on record) that it will be free to select its own teachers and administer its school according to its own best judgment. By a recent decision passed by the Sdruzeni, our Patronat is being deprived of this privilege. To our sorrow, this decision was passed with the consenting vote of our own representatives in the Sdruzeni--men whose former activities had been subject to criticism and who had been denied the right to speak on behalf of the Patronat. In retaliation, these men are now trying to disturb the harmonious relations in our school and to alienate the good will of friends. A thorough study of the possible results of the decision has convinced the Patronat that the decision is detrimental to the progress and proper conduct of our school. The Patronat tried to negotiate some kind of compromise with the Sdruzeni and, after all such efforts had failed, arranged to obtain the opinion of all its members and bodies whose support it enjoys. A vote was taken on the question of whether the Patronat should submit to the decision of the Sdruzeni or whether it should act in accordance with its original agreement with the Sdruzeni. of <pb facs="5418478_4_0611.jpg" n="3"/>the fifty-four votes, three fourths upheld the Patronat.</p>
   <p>Now, what did the Sdruzeni do? It went so far as to stop the payment of wages to the teachers of the Vojta Naprstek school, thus forcing the Patronat to take up this burden, in spite of the fact that the Patronat has to foot the bills for the maintenance of the school building and pay the interest on a $12,000 mortgage which is on the building. It is our considered opinion that the action of the Sdruzeni is unjust and wrong, because the Sdruzeni is nothing more than an agency for the disbursement of wages to the teachers out of money contributed by its members. Consequently it should also pay the teachers of the Vojta Naprstek school, and it is our right to claim this payment.</p>
   <p>The whole Bohemian public knows that the Vojta Naprstek school has been in existence for the last sixteen years. That it is run efficiently and successfully is proved by the fact that it started with one class and now has six classes with four hundred pupils. The school is popular with the <pb facs="5418478_4_0612.jpg" n="4"/>teachers it employs; they are happy to be connected with it. Some of them have taught at the Vojta Naprstek school for ten, some even for fifteen years. They have learned to love the school and to love the pupils entrusted to their care, and it is principally due to their efforts that our school is a success.</p>
   <p>That these teachers have inculcated the love of the Bohemian language into the hearts of their pupils is shown by the fact that these pupils have formed the Club of Graduates of the Vojta Naprstek school, and it is now among the most active of our smaller national organizations. All of the school's alumni are members, and many of them hold offices in our important national bodies.</p>
   <p>In addition to maintaining six classes, the Patronat succeeded in erecting a school building of its own--a building of which Chicago Bohemians may justly be proud. The main purpose of this public notice is to call to the attention <pb facs="5418478_4_0613.jpg" n="5"/>of all Free Thought organizations supporting our schools the fact that so far no provisions are in existence which would definitely regulate the relations between the Sdruzeni and the various Patronats. Without such provisions no harmonious co-operation between the Sdruzeni and the schools will be possible. But as long as the offices in the Sdruzeni will continue to be held by men who are antagonistic to our school, no such provisions can be agreed upon.</p>
   <p>For the Patronat Skoly Vojta Naprstek,</p>
   <p>Rudolf Mulac, president,</p>
   <p>Boh. Hladky secretary.</p>
