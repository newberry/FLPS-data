   <p>The Sokol Chicago (Sokol gymnastic association) is justly known as one of the most important and largest Czech associations of its kind in America. It has been successfully active for twenty-five years. With its seat in Chicago, it has allowed no opportunity to pass at which it could prove that it treads the path of the great founders of the Sokol societies, Fuegner and Tyrs.</p>
   <p>The annual exhibitions that attest to the spirit that pervades this organization, and the one held last night was one of the most outstanding.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1193.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The large number of active members made it necessary to divide the affair into two parts; both were performed in the halls of the organization at 24th Street and Kedzie Avenue under the direction of the coach, Brother J. Paskovsky, who made every effort to render the exhibition a signal success.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of thirteen numbers. The assembled Sokols appeared at the beginning of the performance, creating the impression of a small army. There was an address delivered by Brother Josef Placek, president of the association. The individual numbers of the program were performed by children in light physical culture exercises, whereas the more mature pupils gave exhibitions of their dexterity on the apparatus. Many of them performed veritable acrobatic acts. The music was under the baton of Mr. Brousek, who timed it with the movements with admirable skill. The success <pb facs="5418478_4_1194.jpg" n="3"/>of the exhibition may well fill Mr. Paskovsky with satisfaction; he received many tokens of recognition which will, we hope, induce him to further devote his abilities to the Sokol Chicago.</p>
   <p>After the official program, Sergeant Vosatko, of the United States Army, of the Chicago district recruiting office, outlined to the assembly the advantages accruing to those who enlist as volunteers for service in the Army. He urged them not to wait until compulsory service is introduced; but they should do their duty and join their Czech fellow-countrymen already enlisted in the diverse Czech companies. His speech brought peals of applause which were silenced when the music intoned "The Star-Spangled Banner," sung by the audience and followed by fervid acclaim.</p>
