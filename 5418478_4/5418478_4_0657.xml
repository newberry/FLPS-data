   <p>The chairman, Mr. Karel Kopecky, opened the meeting of the Associated Czech Liberal Schools of Chicago, which was postponed because of the funeral of one of our most energetic Bohemian-American workers, Mr. Frantisek Zdrubek. The date had been set for September 22. In a lengthy speech about the merits of the deceased, Mr. Kopecky mentioned among other things what the deceased had done for our liberal-minded [freethinking] youth, and asked those assembled to pay their last respects to the deceased by rising.</p>
   <p>After the completion of this act of mourning, the discussion of correspondence was taken up. The first piece of correspondence up for consideration was a letter from the assembly of the Czech Liberal [free thought] schools of New York, advising that the textbooks ordered in the last meeting had been sent, and enclosed a bill for $109.35. The supervisory committee reports, as an addition to this communication, that the books were received <pb facs="5418478_4_0658.jpg" n="2"/>in good order, all of which was noted.</p>
   <p>The trustees of the Karel Jonas school request the assignment of a new teacher, because the former teacher resigned just before the school term began. The trustees bitterly complained about this action. The school committee investigated this case, and appointed another teacher in the person of Mr. J. Fiala. The opinion was voiced in this meeting that in the future the Association should act energetically in such cases in order to avoid chaos. The delegate from the Vojta Naprstek school which hired this teacher explained that the trustees of said school did not know that the teacher was engaged elsewhere at the time.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian-American Foresters' Society complain in regard to assessments unjustly required of them. An investigation showed that it was a mistake on their part, since the financial secretary made no such request of them in writing.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0659.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In a letter, the Grand lodge of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Mutual Benevolent Sisterhood) requests that all financial reports be signed by the auditing committee. This will be done in the future. The trustees of three schools handed in their bills for tuition for the month of August, which the Association was unable to take care of at this time. The reasons for this action were explained to their delegates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Topinka was elected to the auditing committee in place of Mrs. L. Benes, who resigned from the committee because she is already filling another similar office. The trustees of the school in the Town of Lake elected a new delegate, Mr. J. Zacha.</p>
   <p>The subcommittee on schools recommends that the position resigned by Mr. J. J. Rezabek, teacher at the Town of Lake school, be given to Mr. J. B. Jonas; that the position in the morning school in Irving Park be assigned to Mr. J. Redl, and the position in the Karel Jonas school be assigned to Mr. J. F. Fiala. All were approved. The committee was notified <pb facs="5418478_4_0660.jpg" n="4"/>to pay special attention to the Sunday afternoon schools which are under the jurisdiction of the Association, exclusively. The committee is to secure the names and addresses of all children attending Czech liberal (free thought) schools so that it will have an actual survey of the existing conditions.</p>
   <p>The motion of the subcommittee on education for the provision of a kindergarten in the school on Throop Street, for the teachers' association seeking bids for the compilation of a liberal moral philosophy, and the purchase of a special teachers' library were postponed until next year. The association must wait at least one year, and then according to its receipts and disbursements in that period, before making provisions for further improvements.</p>
   <p>During the discussion of matters which tend for the good of the Association, the tactless actions of Mr. Kramer Tvrzicky were bitterly regretted. He attended the last convention of the United Liberal Societies which was held <pb facs="5418478_4_0661.jpg" n="5"/>in New York. He was a delegate from the societies which also belong to the Associated Czech Liberal Schools of Chicago. Mr. Kramer Tvrzicky did not deem it wise to mention, even in a few words, the activities of the Associated Czech Liberal Schools, which under their management, they concentrate the largest number of Czech liberal schools in any town in America. The Associated Czech Liberal Schools of Chicago merit at least to be mentioned when Czech schools are being discussed.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, a resolutions committee was also appointed which is to draft a resolution of condolence upon the death of the Czech-American author and enthusiastic freethinker, Mr. Frantisek Boleslav Zdrubek.</p>
