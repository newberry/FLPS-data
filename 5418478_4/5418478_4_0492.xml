   <p>As it is generally known to the Bohemian people of Cicero and vicinity, the Patronat Svobodomyslne Skoly Tomas Masaryk (the board of trustees of the Tomas Masaryk Free Thought School) erected a new school building. Thereby a very good opportunity is given to every enlightened Bohemian to buy bonds which the Patronat is offering for sale in $50, $100, and $500 denominations. These bonds are secured by a first mortgage on the school building; they pay five per cent interest and will be liquidated in 1926. All the Bohemian free thought societies guarantee these bonds and, therefore, no loss may occur to the holders. It is also necessary to mention that your bank account brings three per cent interest only and here is a chance to get five per cent. Besides that the bonds are just as good as cash money and in case of necessity any bank will cash them. A beautiful patriotic duty toward the Bohemian free thought schools will be performed by everyone who buys these bonds.</p>

   <p>Applications may be made every last Monday of the month at the Patronat, 5504 West 23rd Street, or any day at the following members of the bond committee: Mr. Vaclav Cibulka, 5619 West 23rd Street; Mr. V. Sichrovsky, 5226 West 25th Place, and Mr. V. Horak, 2508 South 58th Avenue, all of Cicero, Illinois.</p>
