   <p>The interest of the American public has been greatly stimulated by Professor T. G. Masaryk's visit to this country, as well as through the vigorous efforts of our heroes of the Czechoslovak Army fighting in Siberia and Russia. This interest is widespread and manifold. Of course we cannot expect to remain the center of interest to the press of the whole world for the entire duration of the war, for naturally the attention of the people is constantly shifting from one front to the other, according to its momentary importance.</p>
   <p>And for just this reason, it is obvious that we will have to nourish the interest evoked for our cause thus far. We will have to try to deepen this sympathy and render it stable, lasting. This can be done not only by news items and daily reports, but by systematic information and instruction.</p>
   <p>In the first place, it is advisable to point to items which the American press is wont to omit from their columns. And right there, the Bohemian Review, <pb facs="5418478_4_0269.jpg" n="2"/>official organ of the Czech National Alliance, may be of great service to those of us who would like to co-operate. The Bohemian Review comes in very handy, especially for our second and third generations, for it serves to acquaint them thoroughly with our political program. It pictures to them the sufferings of our nation, and explains its actions.</p>
   <p>Everyone should avail himself of the opportunity to read this, the only Czechosolovak monthly in America, and to help further its reading among his children and native Americans.</p>
   <p>No one will be deterred from subscribing to it for a mere dollar per year. Send the price to the Bohemian Review, 2334 South Central Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
