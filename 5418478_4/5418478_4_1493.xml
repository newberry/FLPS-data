   <p>Some time ago we mentioned the fact that a certain part of the non-Bohemian population in the west part of the city had protested against changing the name of 40th Street to "Komensky Avenue". The Irish, especially, are trying to have the name changed to "Kenneth Avenue". This latter alteration found particularly strong support among the aldermen of the Thirty-fifth Ward who were under pressure from some of their constituents. These aldermen, however, were strenuously opposed by Bohemian members of the Council.</p>
   <p>The controversy was straightened out by a compromise reached at yesterday's meeting of the Council. This compromise was agreed to by Aldermen John Toman and Held, and according to it, our aldermen agreed to give the name "Kenneth Avenue" to 44th Court, and their opponents withdrew their objections to the name "Komensky Avenue" for 40th Court, which until now carried the name "Kaskaskia Avenue".</p>

   <p>The Thirty-fourth Ward scored another important point in yesterday's meeting. The wooden posts on 40th (Crawford) Avenue carrying electric wires will be removed, and the telephone and the telegraph companies will install their wires underground, while the streetcar company will build iron posts for its wiring. This order was given to the Commissioner of Public Works upon the initiative of Alderman Toman.</p>
