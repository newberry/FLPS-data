   <p>An old adage very aptly says that a prophet is without honor in his own country. This saying is everywhere applicable even among us. We have many societies, associations, and clubs in which individual members strive to promote the common interest and the common good, not only with diligence and conscientiousness but with the highest ability, sometimes even at the cost of their health; and yet not all receive recognition for the work which they have performed. Personal jealousy stamps out such recognition from the very beginning, regardless of the harm done to the whole organization by such petty selfishness, thereby building a barrier of bitter disappointment, through which a worthy individual must often pass if he wishes to do his duty as a member both honest and brave. You are never a prophet in your own country. If the opposite should happen, it would be exceptional, and among us it is very rare and almost accidental. For such an unrecognized prophet, it is a solace and a great and <pb facs="5418478_4_1273.jpg" n="2"/>pleasant help if he receives the recognition denied him at home from people standing outside of his sphere of activity, especially if the recognition comes from a foreign source. Foreign recognition is usually the beginning of the proper recognition, that is, of local recognition. Think only of the country of our origin, and you must admit that this is really true.</p>
   <p>Brother Rudolph Styblo is the present chief of the National Sokol Society. Any one who knows him knows that he is an unusually modest and democratic man, a true Sokol. Within his narrow circle, not in the whole organization, the ground under his feet is being undermined. [So far are others from displaying that] brotherly love and courtesy due to one who in all that he attempts acts with the design of promoting the interests and the good of all, always oblivious of himself. There are some who avoid by all possible means giving him due recognition, and they do it in a way which is far from brotherly. Brother Styblo should therefore be happy at the recognition which he is gaining <pb facs="5418478_4_1274.jpg" n="3"/>elsewhere. Recently he received two letters of which he can justly be proud. One of them reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Styblo:</p>
   <p>"Allow me to offer on behalf of the Social Turnverein not only sincere thanks but also the highest recognition of your classes' beautiful drills at the Olympic Games and at the festival of the International Gymnastic Union. Permit me to congratulate you on my own behalf on your exceptional abilities and excellent leadership. I have noted that you have selected your drills with good taste and brilliance, and I have especially remarked that these exercises were chosen to display a high standard of all-around training. It would be of great benefit to the International Gymnastic Union if many more instructors of your capability were available.</p>
   <p>"Yours with all good wishes,</p>
   <p>"Max Strass,</p>
   <p>"1700 School Street."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1275.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The second letter is still more interesting and valuable. We quote verbatim:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"In Chicago the American Sports Club was recently organized, and its temporary office is Room 944 in the First National Bank Building. The purpose of this club is to secure a membership of 40,000 or 50,000 men who will interest themselves in sports of all kinds. The idea is to build and service in the downtown district a comfortable clubhouse so equipped, that members may participate in sports of all kinds.</p>
   <p>"The members would pay yearly dues of five dollars. Already the vice-chairmen have been elected; each of them will act as chairman for one particular sport, such as swimming, athletics, gymnastics, or baseball. I myself was named chairman of gymnastics, and my task is the organization of the gymnastics committee; this is to be composed of twelve men distinguished in the field of gymnastics. On that committee I should very much like to have you as the <pb facs="5418478_4_1276.jpg" n="5"/>representative of Bohemian Sokols. I have observed with pleasure on various occasions your splendid work in gymnastics, and therefore I should be glad to get the co-operation of a worker of so much experience as I have discovered you to be. I hope that it will be possible for you to attend the meeting of this committee, which will be called later, and at which I will give you more information concerning the proposed club. This action is simply a compliment and an acknowledgment of the success which your classes achieved at the recent Olympic Games in Chicago and also an expression of gratitude for your help. Trusting that I shall succeed in securing your help and advice in this new venture also, I thank you in advance...(signed) "Chairman of gymnastics of the American Sports Club."</p>
   <p>Both letters speak for themselves, and therefore it is not necessary to add any further comments.</p>
   <p>The above enterprise is backed by the Amateur Athletic Federation of Cook County, <pb facs="5418478_4_1277.jpg" n="6"/>the members of which are the International Gymnastic Union, the League of Chicago High Schools, the Chicago Suburban Conference, the Association of Sunday Schools of Cook County, the Y.M.C.A.of Cook County, the International League, the Chicago Scouts, and all the municipal playgrounds on the West, North, and South Sides. Its chairman is G. A. Seelar, and the other officers are G. A. Martin, G. W. Steffens, J. J. Richards, T. A. Grasse, O. Berndt, Jr. and Dr. H. F. Kallenburger, who are considered the best workers in local sporting circles.</p>
