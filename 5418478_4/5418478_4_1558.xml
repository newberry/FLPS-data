   <p>The Olympic Trio composed of the well-known Sokols, Messrs. A. Heida, G. W. Vesely, and J. Kristufek, who, four months ago, set out upon a theatrical tour of the west, has recently returned to Chicago. They are performing in the Linden theatre at 63rd and Halsted Streets for the final appearance of their four months engagement. The members of the trio appeared in various theatres as athletes, and gained new laurels wherever they appeared. Several town in western Canada were visited, also many west coast towns of the United States, among them were: Portland, Ore., Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; returning by way of St. Joseph, Mo., to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Because of the success with which they met by reason of their gymnastic ability, it is very likely that they will again be engaged <pb facs="5418478_4_1559.jpg" n="2"/>next season. Upon their return, the gymnasts were given an enthusiastic welcome by their friends, who prepared several surprises in their honor. Messrs. Heida and Kristufek are members of Sokol Chicago; they are former members of Sokol Pilsen. Mr. G. W. Vesely, a member of Pilsen Sokol, is the son of the prominent lawyer, Karel Vesely.</p>
