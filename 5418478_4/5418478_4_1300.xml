   <p>This is the ninth summer during which the members of Sokol Plzen (Pilsen gymnastic unit) and their friends have been camping in a neat little forest on Lake Michigan near New Buffalo, Michigan. To our knowledge this is the only camp of its kind in the United States, and that it is a success is proved by the large number of men, women, and children who spend days and weeks in the camp every summer.</p>
   <p>Camp Sokol is also well known to the non-Bohemian residents of the surrounding territory and is generally admired because of its orderliness, cleanliness, and practical equipment. The camp is right on the lake shore and offers the finest opportunity to swimmers and sun-bathers to enjoy their hobbies.....It is composed of a number of large and small tents, all comfortably furnished, one of which houses a kitchen and one serves as dining room.....</p>
