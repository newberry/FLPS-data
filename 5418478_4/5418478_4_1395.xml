   <p>It is not so long ago, just a little over a years when we were complaining about the decline in gymnastics in Chicago and the general indifference of the citizens in this matter. At that time there were only two local organizations and they were rapidly heading for extinction.</p>
   <p>Knowing the merits of these organizations who could help but groan at their ruin. But, see! before a year passed, conditions changed greatly. Immediately after the organization of the National Gymnastic Union the membership of both the local units increased by considerable numbers. But even that did not end the awakening spirit of gymnastics. There was organized, on the North Side, a third unit known as, "Cechie" (Bohemians) which in its vicinity has gathered to itself many youths. It has a gymnastium of its own and was the tenth unit to join the National Gymnastic Union. So it is with much pleasure that we announce the organization, in Chicago, of a fourth unit in the vicinity of Pilsen. At the organization meeting of this unit there were twenty three youths accepted into membership, and the outlook is, that this will shortly be one of the strongest units in the National Organization. Also there have been inquiries from many places as to methods of procedure for the organization of other units, so, it is possible to imagine, that although the <pb facs="5418478_4_1396.jpg" n="2"/>National Gymnastic Union is not as yet powerful, it will in the hear future, have its branches, for the enlightment and training of Bohemian youths.</p>
