   <p>The appearance before Judge Rafferty of Attorney Vladimir A. Geringer, one of the publishers of the Svornost, resulted in doubts expressed by the court whether the charge of criminal libel against Mr. Geringer is legally tenable. Dr. Iska, an editor of the Vesmir had taken out a warrant for the arrest of Geringer charging libel on two counts:</p>
   <p>First, a news item in the Svornost of Feb. 29, 1916, reprinted from the Providence Journal, in which it was asserted that Dr. Iska was on the payroll of the Austrian government for journalistic services rendered through the medium of the columns of the Vesmir in the United States. Second, by publishing in the Svornost a resolution passed by the society Beseda Fric, the item bearing the date of Oct. 12. In the resolution a protest was voiced against Dr. Iska's having been given the chance to deliver a speech <pb facs="5418478_4_0157.jpg" n="2"/>at the foundation of the Klacelovo Kolo, on the Bohemian National Cemetery. Iska's name does not appear in the protest, true enough, but the wording of the latter gives little leeway to mere guessing. Iska claims to have been criminally libeled.</p>
   <p>The defense argues, as to the first charge, that the news item contained nothing objectionable and was irrelevant; as to the second charge, that Iska's name was not mentioned in the resolution. The defense further points out that Iska, as the editor and publisher of the Vesmir, stands in the limelight of public opinion, and that whatever was printed was merely part of a public discussion of the Czech state-rights. Iska was an antagonist in this respect, whereas the Svornost stood up for the independence of the Czech nation, and therefore the Svornost's news <pb facs="5418478_4_0158.jpg" n="3"/>item was not directed against Iska's person.</p>
   <p>The outcome of the hearing was decidedly unfavorable to Iska. The court, after reading the item in the Providence Journal and a translation of the item as printed in the Svornost, declared that no malicious intent was in evidence in the latter, and that any legal action considered, should be, if at all, directed against the Providence Journal; it is the opinion of the court, that the Svornost was within its rights, and merely fulfilling its duty, in conveying current news to its readers. Attorney Ratkovic then asked the court for a continuance to give the complainant time to have precedents looked up; the request was granted. Attorney Geringer, whom the complaint denominates as "editor," appeared before the court only as "one of the publishers," for technical reasons.</p>
