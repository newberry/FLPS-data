   <p>The Bohemian Alma Mater in Chicago received a letter the other day from the "Society of Zdenka Havlickova Jednoty Ceskich Dam" - " The Union of Bohemian Ladies of the Name of Z. Havlickova." The letter appointed the representative of the union to the American Falcon Union, which is subsidized by the schools in Bohemia. The explanation of this act was the following: The Falcon Alma Mater of Chicago has as its main purpose to teach the American Bohemian children their mother tongue and consequently is more in need of professional teachers and guides than similar institutions in Bohemia and this was the reason why the union desires to be represented in the Chicago Falcon's Union The generous action of "The Union of Z. Havlickova" should be very much appreciated by Falcon organizations in Chicago and it would be very desirable to see all other Bohemian American clubs and societies on the alert to subsidize morally and financially our own Bohemian-American schools. -</p>
   <p>The schools are at present neglected, obsolete, and in need of real professional teachers. The cause is insufficient funds. It is good that we have originated the idea that, being good Bohemians, we are obliged to teach our children the Bohemian language in addition to English.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0737.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We must take care that the Bohemian-American youth is not denationalized. - We must concentrate all our efforts on our national schools. They are in need of real awakening and support.</p>
