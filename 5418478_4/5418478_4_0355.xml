<title level="a">MINUTES OF REGULAR MEETING OF THE LOCAL FEDERATION OF BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT SCHOOLS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The meeting was opened by the president, Mr. J. Tichava. All of the officers and many of the delegates of the Federation were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The minutes of the meeting of the executive board were likewise approved. The president then asked the delegates to rise as a token of sympathy for Mrs. Dobias, the accountant-secretary, whose husband passed away.</p>
   <p>The reading of communications followed. There was a letter from the managing board of the Town of Lake Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) School, in which the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was informed that school fees were being sent. The managing board of the Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius) Bohemian Free Thought School announced the names and addresses of its officers and delegates. A report of the auditing committee <pb facs="5418478_4_0356.jpg" n="2"/>was read and approved.....</p>
   <p>As regards the periodical Czechoslovak Review [and the publication of a protest because of a certain derogation of the local Federation published by the Czechoslovak Review recently], the committee, after hearing the report, decided to let the matter go unprotested although it did not agree with some of the statements made by the author of the article. [Translator's note: To get a better understanding of this matter, the reader is referred to previous translations of the minutes of this organization.] The committee held that the author should endeavor to be better informed before writing anything of that nature; the Bohemian schools of Chicago are well equipped with able teachers and are well supported financially by the Czech people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Reack, a teacher of the F. B. Zdrubek Bohemian Free Thought School made the following report: "The children who are sent here from the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) are rather listless and disinterested when it comes to learning the Bohemian language; in short, <pb facs="5418478_4_0357.jpg" n="3"/>they do not exhibit any interest in the instruction and, as a result, they know nothing. When other children show progress and interest in their studies, why not the children of the Sirotcinec?" The complaining teacher stated further that when acquainting these children with the history of Bohemia, they show an absolute lack of attention and interest in the subject matter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zrust, representing the Utulna....stated that a letter of complaint was sent by the executive committee of the Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools to the meeting of the board of delegates of the Sirotcinec, making these facts known. The board of delegates of the Sirotcinec desires to know, therefore, what steps should be taken to overcome this situation. It is true, of course, that due to recent and constant changes in the membership of the board of directors of the Utulna A Sirotcinec, little attention was paid to the wards of the Orphanage; but the Orphanage and the Old People's Home are Czech institutions, supported and maintained by the Czech people; it is the duty of the institution in question to see to it that the Czech <pb facs="5418478_4_0358.jpg" n="4"/>tongue be taught to the children and that it at least be held in respect. After a lengthy debate, it was decided to send a lecturer to the Sirotcinec who will give brief talks to the children and incite them to study the Czech language with a little more interest.</p>
   <p>A complaint was lodged against the teachers who fail to attend faculty meetings. It was decided that this matter be handled as follows: A letter will be written to all teachers making their presence obligatory at all faculty meetings. Every absentee shall be fined $1 for his or her first absence, $2 for the second, $5 for the third, and finally suspended if the former steps prove of no avail.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Reack read a report on the outcome of the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Country Festival) which was independently given for the first time by the Sdruzeni. The report was accepted and its contents, after being examined by the auditing committee, will be published. The president expressed his thanks to the members of the various committees whose work contributed to <pb facs="5418478_4_0359.jpg" n="5"/>to the success of the festival.</p>
   <p>The Junior Club of the Vojta Naprstek School would like to give a theatrical performance for the benefit of the Bohemian Free Thought Schools, and asked the Sdruzeni to provide a suitable hall for that purpose. The offer was accepted, and the entertainment committee will arrange the necessary details.</p>
   <p>The delegate from the T. G. Masaryk School announced that his School will celebrate its tenth anniversary, on which occasion the children of the School will give a concert and recital. He invited all of the delegates to attend this celebration.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Radesinsky asked that stereopticon slides be ordered from Bohemia; they are to be used for visual instruction and can be projected on a screen. It was decided that the executive committee should determine the quality of these pictures and report at the next meeting. Mrs. Stary reported that the Pilsen Park pavilion was rented for the use of the Sdruzeni during the <pb facs="5418478_4_0360.jpg" n="6"/>ensuing year.</p>
