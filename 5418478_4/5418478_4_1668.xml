   <p>September 25, 1922, will mark the fifty-second anniversary of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union). This most extensive Bohemian sisterhood, well known by all of our Chicago countrymen, in celebrating its fifty-second anniversary will also have another cheerful piece of news to give its many friends and well-wishers--its membership has now reached the staggering figure of 25,000....The news will be received joyously not only by the members of the Union proper, but by everyone who is interested in the growth and development of our societies. While our men's organizations suffered due to the destructive influences of the war and the almost total discontinuance of immigration, the women's organizations, on the other hand, never ceased to function; and, particularly, during recent times has their <pb facs="5418478_4_1669.jpg" n="2"/>membership increased. New lodges are forever being started which belong to one or another of our Czech sisterhoods, and this fact is mainly due to the increased activity of the ladies who are untiring in their efforts to secure new members.</p>
