   <p>All our countrymen in Chicago know that we have in the Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) building a Bohemian library consisting of over 300 bound books, of fiction, educational, and humorous, and that these books have been circulated free of charge among Chicago Bohemians the past three years.</p>
   <p>The library is appreciated very much by our readers, so that in some months there are as many as a hundred who borrow books and thereby with the aid of the library are furthering their education.</p>
   <p>Some have read practically the entire collection and would still like to continue reading if only there were some new material available.</p>
   <p>No doubt there are in the possession of our countrymen many individual volumes , which they themselves have probably read several times, and which are now thrown aside in idleness.</p>
   <p>It is indeed wasteful to allow a book to remain unused when there are so many <pb facs="5418478_4_0111.jpg" n="2"/>people who would like to read it.</p>
   <p>We call on all our local countrymen who might posses such unused Bohemian books to be so kind as to make a gift of it to our Bohemian Library, where it will be taken care of always and loaned to our fellow-countrymen without any charge.</p>
   <p>The names of the donors will be published and memorialized in the volumes they donate.</p>
   <p>Let us act according to the motto:</p>
   <p>"Work and knowledge is our salvation," and cooperate in educating and elevating ourselves.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Fr. B. Zdrubek, Librarian.</p>
