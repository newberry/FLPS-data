   <p>As is known, the students of the Bohemian Free Thought schools have undertaken a collection [for the benefit of the Free Thought school system]. Those students who have collected....the largest sums have been awarded three prizes. In order that the contest might be as fair as possible, schools with the smallest enrollment counted equally with those of the highest, that is, awards were to be made according to the percentage collected by each class of students proportionately. In other words, all schools and their students had an equal opportunity to win the contest.....The outcome of the collection, which was closed on September 17, at 6 P.M.--the day of the Old Czech Festival held by the Bohemian Free Thought school system--was as follows:</p>
   <p>The Vojta Naprstek school, 452 students, $394.62 collected; average per student 87 1/3. The T. G.
