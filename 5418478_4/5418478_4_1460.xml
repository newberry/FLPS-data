   <p>In the meeting of the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Community) held last Sunday, a letter from the Druzstvo Jubilejniho Husova Domu (John Huss Memorial Association) was read, reporting the action taken in the Druzstvo's meeting and requesting the Svobodna Obec to submit a binding proclamation that it (the Svobodna Obec) is taking over the work of building the John Huss Memorial, and that it will finance it by issuing stock which will assure its holders co-ownership and a voice in the management of the John Huss Memorial. The Svobodna Obec reached a unanimous agreement that it will do so....and worked out the text which the shares should carry.</p>
   <p>A committee from the Svobodna Obec attended the meeting of the Druzstvo, which was held yesterday in the hall of the Ceskoslovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). The committee submitted a binding proclamation to the meeting by which it agrees to take over the enterprise and do its best to see the John Huss Memorial built and completed in the shortest <pb facs="5418478_4_1461.jpg" n="2"/>possible time. It also submitted a draft of the text which should be printed on the shares which the Svobodna Obec agrees to issue. The shares will have a face value of twenty-five dollars, and the rights of their owners are to be regulated by an agreement entered into by the Svobodna Obec as the managing body of the enterprise and the shareholders of the John Huss Memorial. The agreement reads as follows: [The provisions are listed]</p>
   <p>All nine provisions of the agreement were unanimously accepted by all those present. Thereupon the president announced that by adopting this agreement, the Druzstvo has disbanded, and the whole enterprise goes over to the Svobodna Obec. All officers of the Druzstvo are requested to present the Svobodna Obec with all material, correspondence, and other matters concerning the John Huss Memorial at the earliest opportunity........</p>
