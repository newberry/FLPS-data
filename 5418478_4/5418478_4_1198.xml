   <p>The Czech clubs devoted to soccer had good luck last Sunday. Most of them were able to win over their opponents. One of the real surprises was the victory won by the club Slavia over the first class team of the Mc Duffs; the score was 1 : 0.</p>
   <p>The club Cechie did not play last Sunday. There was a friendly game played by the combined first and second team of the Olympia against the Mohawks which finished with a draw, 2 : 2. The A. C. Rangers defeated the Primrose easily 5 : 0, though it had loaned to the Primrose four of its own players to render the defeat less stinging. The S. K. Union scored two points through default of the Sellers team. S. K. Praha did not play, as the majority of its team had offered themselves to Uncle Sam by joining the Czech regiment of volunteers. S. K. Sparta lost in a friendly game 3 : 4 to the Danish-Americans.</p>

   <p>The Czech Football League is saying good-bye to its members who are leaving for military service today. The latter are all known as very active members of the League. (Follows list of ten names.) "All of you are heading towards a fate unknown. We hope for a re-union. Na Zdar!"</p>
   <p>Jerry Beran, president Czech Football League.</p>
