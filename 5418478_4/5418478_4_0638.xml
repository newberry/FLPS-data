   <p>The exhibition and bazaar of the Czech Free Thought School Frantisok B. Zdrubek ended Sunday. A successful dance was held on Saturday, and on Sunday the remaining chance books were raffled off and other chosing matters were settled. Although the Czech community in Irving Park is not yet very large and this year's working conditions are such that workingmen do not have much spending money, still the exhibition was a success both morally and financially. Receipts were more than a thousand dollars and since disbursements were restricted, it is estimated that the clear profit will amount to about nine hundred dollars. Credit for the success of the affair belongs to the Arrangements Committee, the Board of Trustees, and the generous, enthusiastic public.</p>
   <p>A speaker's table was won by Telocicna Jednota Sokol Rozvou (Gymnastic Society Sokol Rozvoj).</p>
