   <p>Again, the Public Library Board has increased the number of Czech books in the Public Library. Five hundred dollars worth of the newest and best Czech books have been bought. The Board also established a new branch library in Svatopluk Cech Park in the Pilsen district. There the newly purchased books will be available to readers. We are convinced that our young folks and the older ones also, who long for worthy Czech books, will visit this library often,and derive therefrom much pleasure and learning. Various Czech newspapers and periodicals, American and European, will be available at this branch. It is desirable, since the Library Board is meeting us half way, to show that we appreciate their efforts. We are convinced now that cooler weather is arriving and evenings lengthening,that both branches <pb facs="5418478_4_0087.jpg" n="2"/>of the public library in Svatopluk Czech Park, and in Ceska Kalifornie [district on west 26th Street] will be well attended and Czech books much read.</p>
