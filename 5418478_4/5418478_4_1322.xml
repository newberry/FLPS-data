  <body>
   <p>The annual distribution of Christmas presents, which is associated every year, with a public drill exhibition designed to show the progress of the Sokol Pilsen youth and adults, was held in their hall yesterday.</p>
   <p>The children's parents had an opportunity to see for themselves that they are not sending the children to the drills in vain. Yesterday everyone had good reason to be pleased, because the youngsters behaved very well.....</p>
   <p>First there were squads of girls of six to twelve years....who drilled with a charm which only girls can show.....Boys between six and twelve years....also received the applause due them.....The mazurka by girls between twelve and fourteen....was much admired.</p>
   <p>One of the girls presented Brother Styblo, the children's gymnastic teacher, with a beautiful bouquet of flowers.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1323.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The boys of twelve to fourteen drilled in groups with batons, and their performance may be considered the best presented by our youth yesterday. They also gave Brother Styblo a gift.</p>
   <p>This was followed by a distribution of presents to those boys and girls who were most diligent throughout the year, that is, those who attended the drill lessons most frequently. In addition to the gifts, they received a few words of praise from their teacher.....</p>
   <p>All children then received their share of candy and other delicacies, after which adult men Sokols aligned for a short drill, and the ladies obliged with a dance similar to a polka.....</p>
