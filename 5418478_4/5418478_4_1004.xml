<title level="a">PUBLIC GYMNASTIC EXHIBITION OF THE SOKOL SLAVSKY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Although there were several interesting events taking place in various sections of our neighborhood last Sunday, the exhibition arranged by the Sokol Slavky deserves special mention. As usual its program for the day was very good, and those who attended the exhibition were well satisfied. The members again showed their love and devotion to their Sokol unit; their exercises gave sufficient proof that they always attend their drills with diligence and regularity. When one considers that almost all of these members live either in Ceska Kalifornie (Bohemian California [a Bohemian settlement district of Chicago]) or in Cicero, Illinois, one must acknowledge the fact that their devotion to their Sokol unit is great.</p>
   <p>The program began at 3 P. M. with the playing of Mazzetta's "Overture". Mr. Miller, the president of the unit, addressed the audience briefly, mentioning our duties to Sokoldom. This was followed by exercises of the younger members led by Mr. Holan.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1005.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At this juncture it is necessary to mention the fact that the Bohemian population of the Pilsen district of Chicago is on the decrease. Years ago the Sokol Slavsky could boast of a great number of pupils; in fact, there were so many that they could not all drill at the same time. But yesterday the young girls' team consisted of only thirty-four members....while the boys' team had twenty-eight. Their exercises were well chosen, and it was a pleasure to see the youngsters perform. They were followed by a group of twenty-five girls who drilled for the ensuing gymnastic meet of the Stredni Zupa (Central District). Their performance was facile and faultless. Thereupon twenty-five boys performed some setting-up exercises which are to be repeated during the meet of the Zupa....</p>
   <p>The program continued with exercises in which Indian clubs and wands were used. ...The uniform head coverings of the performers were greatly admired and are much to be recommended, for uniformity of dress is beautiful as well as desirable. ...in Sokol exhibitions....The women's team was followed by a team of thirty-four men who, under the guidance of Mr. Kostlan, performed a fine group of setting-up exercises. It would be superfluous to praise their work for under <pb facs="5418478_4_1006.jpg" n="3"/>such good tutelage as that of Mr. Kostlan only good results may be expected. Worthy of mention, however, was their fine lineup. Apparatus work followed, and in this the first men's team excelled all others, particularly their trapeze performances.....The women's team then gave an unusually good account of itself in special setting-up exercises arranged by Mr. Tomes. Without flattery we may congratulate him on such a remarkable piece of work....As the last number on the program the men's fencing team exhibited its collective prowess in saber fencing. This last item was [also] directed by Mr. Kostlan....</p>
