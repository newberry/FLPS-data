   <p>It will be almost a year since the Sokolska Zupa Stredni (Central District of the American Sokol Union) had occasion to prove its mettle. After a year of energetic and persevering exercise our teams will again appear before our public to show the results of their annual endeavors. This time, however, and contrary to accepted custom, the teams will perform at a place fully adequate for such an event. The new place is Cermak's Baseball Park, located at West 26th Street and Kostner Avenue. The field is large and well equipped to provide for large audiences. There are enough seats to accommodate about four thousand people, to say nothing of an additional space provided for standing room, from where a few thousand more onlookers may easily watch the performances. That there will be such thousands cannot be doubted if we gauge our expectations by the publicity given to the work of our Sokols of both sexes. Everyone believes that the field will be crowded with visitors.....</p>
