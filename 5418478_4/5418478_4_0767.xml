  <body>
   <p>In all parts of our city which are thus far inhabited largely by Bohemians, we have organized schools either daily or Sunday, which enjoy quite a large attendance of both younger and older pupils.</p>
   <p>One of the newest such schools is the Sunday School near the lime kilns organized about three quarters of a year ago. The attendance and progress of the pupils is gratifying and as in the schools of the Northwest side tuition is free, mostly in subjects which are not found in our public schools.</p>
   <p>Tonight the pupils of this school will present their first play in the Bohemian language, which is the best proof of the progress they are making. We hope and expect that everyone interested in our youth will attend this first effort of these pupils. The larger the audience the more encouragement they will receive and the greater will be the improvement of the school in general.</p>
