   <p>Yesterday, Chicago's liberal-minded Bohemians [freethinkers] attended the funeral of one of the foremost Czechs, Nestor of Czech journalism, writer, speaker, and journalist, Mr. František Boleslav Zdrubek, president and speaker of the Svobodna Obce (Rationalist Society). Mr. Zdrubek was a member of many other national societies; a man outstanding and meritorious in every respect, editor and founder of the first Czech daily in America, Svornost, and of the weekly, Amerikan, etc. The funeral of the deceased was a most phenomenal one. By this gigantic participation, the people demonstrated their recognition of the deceased for his inestimable merits on the national field, as a pioneer of Czech journalism, and as a fearless and persistent fighter for the Rational cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0193.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The funeral was held from the Cesko-Anglicka Svobodna Skola (Bohemian-American Liberal School) on Eighteenth and May Streets. The body lay in state in the center of the hall and hundreds of people filed past to pay their last respects to the deceased who was departing forever for eternal rest, after many years of hard work.</p>
   <p>The stage was crowded with floral pieces, while the coffin was covered with a simple laurel wreath.</p>
   <p>After all the speakers had arrived, the Česko-Dělnícký Pěvecký Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) sang the dirge, "Co Pláčete" (Why Do You Weep?). Then the president of Lincoln Lodge, Č. S. P. S., Česko Slovánska Podporujici Společnost (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society), of which the deceased was a member, addressed the gathering. Mr. M. M. Mangasaian, well-known freethinker and lecturer of the Svobodna Obce <pb facs="5418478_4_0194.jpg" n="3"/>Rationalistu (Rationalist Community), a personal friend of the deceased and a fighter for the same ideal, then appeared. He called attention to the great merits of our deceased countryman, that fearless, persistent defender of rationalism, that fighter for the spiritual and political freedom of his countrymen. "For almost half a century he cleared the way for the Rationalist idea. Mr. Zdrubek was a Catholic, but in his twenty-first year he awakened from a deep dream and forced his way to the light of spiritual freedom. After him, came those others who today mourn beside his coffin. With all his energy, he threw himself into the open arms of the Rationalist idea." The speaker recalled Mr. Zdrubek's debates with Mr. P. Cokou, at which time, because of his quiet and scholarly appearance, he gained the respect and admiration of even the most ardent Catholics....</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Mr. Lev Palda of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, an old friend <pb facs="5418478_4_0195.jpg" n="4"/>and fellow worker of the deceased with whom he had worked a great many years upon the national field for the enlightenment and spiritual freedom of his countrymen.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Jaromir Pšenka then spoke in behalf of the publishers of Svornost, and described the rare character of the deceased. He reminded the people that with the departure of Mr. Zdrubek a breach, which will not be filled so soon, was created in the ranks of the liberal-minded Bohemians [free-thinkers].</p>
   <p>Dr. Frank Iska spoke for the Svobodna Obec (The rationalist community).....</p>
   <p>The services at the hall were concluded by Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, manager of the Český Tiskový Kancelař (The Bohemian Press Bureau).</p>
   <p>At the cemetery, the rites were opened by Mr. John Pech, president of the <pb facs="5418478_4_0196.jpg" n="5"/>Bohemian National Cemetery. He was followed by Dr. John Jicinsky of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who spoke in behalf of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Sokol Union).</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Egermayer, president of the Cremation Society, was the next speaker. He expressed regret over the fact that the deceased did not live long enough to see the realization of a Czech crematorium, although it has been decided already that a new crematorium of the most modern type will be built in the Bohemian National Cemetery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bartoš Bittner, a colleague of Mr. Zdrubek, then gave a short talk in behalf of the Czech journalists of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The rites at the cemetery were concluded by Mr. Soukup and Mr. Hrodět.</p>
   <p>The body was then taken to Mount Rose Cemetery for cremation.</p>
