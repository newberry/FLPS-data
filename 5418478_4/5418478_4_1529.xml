   <p>Bareheaded, with throbbing hearts and eyes dimmed with tears, we stand with deep emotion before the monument by which Czech-America will pay tribute to the memory of the immortal teacher of the nation and martyr for its cause, Karel Havlicek Borovsky. It will be a moment truly sublime which will climax this three-day celebration, when the shroud that veils the bronze statue of our great hero falls. It behooves us, therefore, to approach this significant scene in our American life with clean hearts, and with minds elevated above earthly dust and everyday toil. There will be few among us, indeed, who will be given an opportunity during our lives to witness again an event of similar import--one inspiring keen flights of thought, and at the same time tragic memories.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1530.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Half a century of our national life in America has passed, a half-century in the course of which our people were conscious of the fact that by emigrating they were, not released from allegiance to the old motherland, and that it is their duty to adhere to their blood relationship with those who could remain upon their native soil and defend to the last breath their material and cultural possessions against overwhelming numbers of ancient enemies, and against reactionaries among their own people as well. Half a century of our hard, and, as it has often seemed, utterly hopeless strife has passed.....</p>
   <p>This monument was built by the combined efforts of all the Czechs of America, especially, however, by the settlers scattered over the vast spaces of the Great West. It is telling proof of the strong root which Czech sentiment has in our people. It demonstrates that it is not a vain undertaking to foster this sentiment. This memorial to the most famous among the Czech journalists is a crowning of our national work of half a century's duration.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1531.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>True enough, we have often lost our way and stumbled over one another. But from the moment of the unveiling of this monument we should begin a new life, filled with more idealistic, soaring longings, with sterling intentions and noble endeavor--a life in the spirit of Karel Havlicek Borovsky!</p>
   <p>"The Darling of the Czech Nation" is the endearing term given to Havlicek, and truly his people could not honor him more than by these tender words. We have had several really deserving, unforgettable patriots during the time of our national revival. We had Jungman, the patriarch of Czech literature; we had Palacky, "the Father of the Nation"; but no one of these noble men found his way into the hearts of the people as did the modest journalist, Havlicek, who made no pretense to dignity and sought no honors. Great reverence and gratitude are contained in the words, "the Father of the Nation", but he who became the "Darling of the Nation" has surely had more heartfelt relations with his people, who saw in him more than a born <pb facs="5418478_4_1532.jpg" n="4"/>leader. Only he can become the darling of a nation who not only leads, educates, admonishes, and counsels it, but writes his name into the hearts of men and women by his patriotic actions and noble character--he who knows how to be brotherly toward them, he in whose eyes one can see a thoroughly honest and sincere soul which knows no selfishness, which is determined to go to the limit for its convictions, and which does not draw back when sacrifices are demanded, if only these serve the nation.</p>
   <p>We have written above that from the moment of the unveiling of Havlicek's monument we ought to begin a new life, a life in the spirit of this immortal national hero and unsurpassable worker. We should, indeed. It is high time. That monument stands here like our conscience, a conscience full of blame. If there is in us the least bit of feeling for that so-called national honor of which we so like to boast, and with which we surround ourselves, it must stab out hearts every time we look upon the upright figure and strictly <pb facs="5418478_4_1533.jpg" n="5"/>earnest features of the immortal Czech journalist. Do you know what he would say to us if his bronze figure came to life?</p>
   <p>"I worked myself to death so that I might imbue the people with the conviction that only complete and sincere education is salvation, and you, here at my feet, only trifle and barter!"</p>
   <p>And would it not be the truth, every word?</p>
