   <p>The pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery Park was the scene of a public drill by the members of Sokol Slavsky yesterday afternoon. Sokol Slavsky is known as one of the most active of our organizations. It has arranged numerous patriotic affairs which have won countless friends for it. This was evident by the multitude which gathered yesterday to view its exhibition of skill, although the public drill had been advertised as an informal event.</p>
   <p>Twenty-four young girls from the junior class exhibited their agility on the rings. Twenty-eight boys of the same age performed with dumbbells, and thirty-two older girls executed light athletic drills. Twenty-four grown girls in picturesque Sokol costume drew thunderous applause because of their graceful motions. These drills were directed by Mr. Tomes.</p>
   <p>The exhibition given by the adults differed from those usually seen in that several veterans took part. They took the places of those Sokol members who <pb facs="5418478_4_1174.jpg" n="2"/>have enlisted for military service. This shows that Sokol Slavsky heeded the appeal issued by the Sokol Americky (The American Sokol) to older Czechs to fill the Sokol ranks which have been depleted by enlistments in the United States or the Allied armies.</p>
   <p>Jarka Kosar, an indefatigable worker among our Sokol organizations, directed the drills of the older members, and Mr. V. Husa was in charge of the music.</p>
