   <p>Fifteen years of publication was completed with yesterday's issue of Svornost and the sixteenth year was begun with today's issue; we look upon the fifteen years activity of the first Bohemian-American daily with satisfaction.</p>
   <p>How conditions and personalities have changed; what progress has been made; how much the material and moral standing of Bohemian society in Chicago and throughout America has improved in those fifteen years!</p>
   <p>And Svornost - today is it's anniversary, for that reason we can feel somewhat happy - Svornost faithfully and diligently made note of changing relations, events and persons, arousing and encouraging progress; <pb facs="5418478_4_0256.jpg" n="2"/>helped, with all it's strength, in the improvement of the material and moral standing of our co-nationals in this new land; growing, in the number of their members, in prosperity and social and political influence.</p>
   <p>A newspaper, such as ours is, has a great field of operation and usefulness, and encourages all the other Bohemian papers to activity and progress. How great a step forward has been taken by all Bohemian-American papers since Svornost began to show Bohemian journalists a new road.</p>
   <p>How many good, honorable and honest citizens were protected against blind slavery to partisan political tramps, against being lead into the dirty dance of dishonest politics, against bodily and spiritual injury by timely warning, explanation and education, in political questions....</p>
