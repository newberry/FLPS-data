<title level="a">A PUBLIC SOKOL EXHIBITION OF THE STREDNI ZUPA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Chicago sokol units which are united in the Stredni Zupa (Central District of the American Sokol Union), held a joint exhibition of their men and women sokol members and their junior boys and girls, yesterday afternoon at Pilsen Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. The exhibition could just as well be called a general rehearsal for those great sokol celebrations which are to take place during the last part of August at the Coliseum. The public exhibition held yesterday was really a success, although it cannot be denied that the hot weather which prevailed yesterday had something to do with the attendance. This time Pilsen Park was not as crowded as it has been on similar occasions.</p>
   <p>The exhibition was preceded by a parade which formed in front of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs Hall and got under way at about 2 P.M. The participants of the parade after reaching Pilsen Park were given a short rest, and it was after four o'clock in the afternoon when the program started.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1081.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All the active members of the Stredni Zupa were scheduled to appear in four numbers of the program. The program was started by a large number of junior girls who, under the leadership of Sokol Brouk, presented four sections of a sokol drill. But the presentation was very poor, and even for an expert it would have been very difficult to analyze the individual postures and fundamental elements of this drill. More then anything else the large number of girls who appeared in this number attracted the attention of the audience.</p>
   <p>Much more effective was the performance of junior boys who also appeared in large numbers. The boys were led by Sokol Kostlan, and by their self-conscious acting and correct postures aroused a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>The precision drills of women Sokols then followed. These were led by Sokol Bedrich Styblo. This number appeared to be very monotonous, and the first section of this drill are exercises more suitable for men than for women. The second fault was that the drills were executed too mechanically, <pb facs="5418478_4_1082.jpg" n="3"/>without proper comprehension.</p>
   <p>The main attraction of the afternoon was the performance of men sokols who were led by Bedrich Styblo. This exhibition of precision drills was awaited with anxiety because it was supposed to give us a picture of what we may expect in the Coliseum on a much larger scale. The boys presented four sections of the precision drill but their number was in want of that uniformity and spiritual perception which is the background of the presentation of these symbolic exercises.</p>
   <p>Here again we emphasize that which we have often repeated: that much work and polishing will be needed in our sokol halls before the slet (sokol mass meet and exhibition). These symbolic sokol drills are the work of Sokol Jarka Kosar, a well-known sokol expert of Chicago, who put into them the intentions of the author. But according to yesterday's performance the boys still have far to go to meet these intentions. It was a pleasant sight to watch some of the boys, but the majority of them were satisfied with just <pb facs="5418478_4_1083.jpg" n="4"/>keeping time; the most significant elements were performed too phlegmatically. The lack of fighting spirit was self-evident.</p>
   <p>Following this number of the program, various sokol units presented their special numbers.....In the evening a genuine fraternal and sokol dance and entertainment was given.</p>
