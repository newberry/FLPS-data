   <p>Man is an investigating animal. He wants to know. He is an eternal citizen of Missouri, his slogan is, "Show Me!"</p>
   <p>Until every man is freely permitted to investigate every book, every creed and dogma for itself, the world cannot be free. Mankind will be enslaved until there is mental grandeur enough to allow each man to have his thought and say.</p>
   <p>The modern theory of religious freedom has never been accepted by any church, because no church can wholly admit that its rivals may provide an equally good vehicle of salvation. Martin Luther made it plain four hundred years ago that in his opinion "pagans or Turks or Jews or fake Christians would remain under eternal wrath and an everlasting damnation," and today the "Catholic Encyclopedia" says that "as the true God can tolerate no strange Gods, the true Church of Christ can tolerate no strange churches beside herself." That is the ancient dogma that outside the church there is no salvation. The churches continue to assert <pb facs="5418478_4_0779.jpg" n="2"/>that they possess the only complete version of the truth. The existence of rival sects, the visible demonstration that none has a monopoly, cannot but dispose men against an unquestioning acceptance of the authority of one sect. The existence of many churches in one community weakens the foundation of all of them, and that is why every church in the heyday of its power proclaims itself to be intolerant. It is the only true religion, all other religions were conceived in falsehood, and only those who believe in the true religion will be happy forever, while all others will burn in hell.</p>
   <p>But in our days the desire to investigate subjects that are hidden and unknown to us, and by persistent mental effort make them clear, is the greatest joy known to human kind. And there is no end to investigation. After every height we scale, we see heights beyond, but to investigate is to grow. Investigation lights up the dark abyss where ignorance gropes and stumbles, and reveals to us truths before unguessed. Investigation strengthens self-reliance. Man becomes a free man by using his reason.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0780.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We rationalists do not accept anything as truth that can not be demonstrated. Reason, Observation and Experience - the Holy Trinity of Science - have taught us that happiness is the only good, that the time to be happy is here, in this world, and the way to be happy is to make others so. To prevent man from thinking for himself is to prevent all advancement. The Creed of the Future will begin, "I know," not "I believe". This creed will carry with it no promise of an eternal life of idleness and ease if you accept it, and no threat of hell if you don't. It will be so reasonable that no sane man or woman will reject it. As soon as all men and women will begin to think, the new era will dawn. We are working for it.</p>
   <p>Thought is the thing!</p>
   <p>As you already know, another English speaking Chapter grew up under the guidance of the C. R. F. A. (Czechoslovak Rationalist Federation of America). The name of this chapter is Thomas Paine. Its meeting is held every second Thursday of the month in C. S. P. S. (Czechoslovak Benevolent Society) Hall, at 18th and May Streets in Chicago. The purpose of this chapter is to propagate the <pb facs="5418478_4_0781.jpg" n="4"/>rationalistic conception to the progressive youth of Pilsen. And speaking of our old Pilsen district, we strongly believe that there is still enough Czechoslovakian youth in this neighborhood to form a chapter so strong that it will make the Progressives proud of us.</p>
