   <p>In the name of education and enlightenment for Chicago Bohemians we start the fourth volume of the daily newspaper "Svornost."</p>
   <p>On this day Chicago Bohemians should be thankful that it was possible to found and maintain a daily publication without feat of possible damage or injury; Bohemians in Europe even though they are nearer to the native land than we have not been able to do so. In Vienna, where live as many Bohemians as in almost all of America and where a daily paper is a national necessity, where they are surrounded only by the German elements to which they are accustomed since childhood, where it is not necessary for them to hide their nationality as here, they have been unable to maintain a fairweekly, let alone a daily publication.</p>
   <p>From a nationalistic viewpoint it is painful to note the decline and denationalization going on. In comparison here in far Western America, in a city where live scarcely 25,000 Bohemians, and these mostly of the kind who were not accustomed to reading daily newspapers, occurred the undertaking of a Daily-paper and it is <pb facs="5418478_4_0263.jpg" n="2"/>worthily prospering. This newspaper was founded because of a pure love of Bohemian National Culture and for its elevation. Every Chicago citizen knows well, the kind of offering the publisher had to bring in the beginning, that the publisher has plenty to do to meet his obligations to the employees of the paper and at the same time take care of credit obligations from the first year of publication.</p>
   <p>For the past three years "Svornost" has served unselfishly in the interests of the Bohemians in Chicago and in America. They have been trying years. Because of conditions in general, we could not depend too much on support among our local countrymen, who in the majority are laborers of limited means and who must of necessity count every penny laid out for things other than food. We know many would gladly read our paper, but as they can just barely provide the absolute necessities of life, and being unable to find in their neighborhood one with whom they might jointly subscribe for the paper, they must do without. Even so we hope that the number of subscribers will continue to grow until we will be able to bring to our <pb facs="5418478_4_0264.jpg" n="3"/>readers a better and larger paper than heretofore. The enlargement and improvement of our papers is our chief concern, but all must realize that this depends largely on the prepayment of subscriptions so that we may have an incentive to further effort. In the political field "Svornost" will remain as in the past independent. Our conception of political dependence is nothing other than slavery for pay.</p>
   <p>Svornost for the entire three years of its existence can not be rightfully accused of accepting payment to serve any political party. We will praise and support that which we think is good, generous, or useful, regardless of which party presents it. Beyond that we can only publish the platforms of the various parties so that the electorate may make its own choice.</p>
   <p>The main objective of this paper shall be to up-build our nationalism, to elevate and help build up our culture. Thus we dedicate the new volume of Svornost to all of our past and future patrons, readers and friends and we promise them they may depend on it, that they will always find it ready, unselfish and ardently, to support everything good, generous, and progressive in the National, Public and Social fields.</p>
