   <p>The afterglow of the great Sokol festivities, during which we witnessed an event of exceptional importance for our nation--the unification of the Czechoslovak Sokoldom--had its brightest moment in yesterday's banquet given by the [Slovak] Sokolska Zupa Ludevit Stur (Sokol unit called Zupa Ludevit Stur) to our overseas delegation. It was not a banquet in the proper sense of that word, although the refreshments served to the guests were by no means negligible, but the speeches which on other similar occasions have been drowned in the clatter of glasses and knives and forks, were devoured last night; and these speeches were not the elaborate orations of gala speakers, but simple talks by simple men of every station, and they spoke from their hearts and their souls.</p>
   <p>The Sokol delegation arrived shortly before nine o'clock, at which time the rich and tasty dinner prepared by sister Sokols was served.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1055.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first speaker was the editor of the Nove Casy (New Times), Mr. Huska, who cordially welcomed our guests....and asked one of the members of the delegation, Professor Kraus, to address the assembly. Professor Kraus spoke in Slovak, a knowledge of which language he acquired during his work in Slovakia, and truly he spoke words of gold. He pleaded for co-operation in the Sokol work and in respect to national economics, stressing the importance of the American branch of the Slovak part of the nation.....</p>
   <p>Thereafter Mr. Huska introduced the leader of the overseas delegation, Brother Bilek. His speech was a glorification of Slovakia, her natural beauties, her good people. "We are proud" (to use the speaker's words) "of having been given Slovakia". He asked every Bohemian to create an opportunity to visit Slovakia because only by staying there is it possible to learn how to appreciate her people.....</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Dr. Guca,who recently returned from Slovakia, and who is <pb facs="5418478_4_1056.jpg" n="3"/>an excellent orator. With a goodly sense of humor, he told how difficult it is to penetrate the Slovak soul: It is strong, but its strength is yet dormant; it has to be awakened.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Huska,chairman of the County Board [of the Slovak League], thanked all Sokols and all Legionnaires for everything they have done for the liberation of our beautiful country. He was followed by the Chicago Czechoslovak consul, Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, who immediately turned to the burning question of autonomy. He explained the reasons why some Slovak political factions hostile to the Czechs are continually bringing up this question, using it for propaganda purposes and against our government, but he has full confidence in our younger generation, in the younger generation of our Slovak brothers, which has the future of Slovakia in its hands.....</p>
