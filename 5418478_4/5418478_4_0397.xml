   <p>Registration in the Vojta Naprstek [Bohemian Free Thought] School begins tomorrow, and Czech parents are advised that this Bohemian six-grade school is now ready to admit pupils as follows: On Saturday, September 2, and Sunday September 3, both mornings and afternoons, registration will be held for pupils who are to attend the Saturday and Sunday morning classes. On Tuesday, September 5, and Wednesday, September 6, registration between the hours of 4 and 7 P. M. for all children who are to attend the regular day classes. All children over seven years of age will be admitted. The tuition fee is $2.50 for Saturday and $3.00 for Sunday courses, to be paid in two installments, one-half on registration day, and the balance on February 1, 1923, at the beginning of the second semester.</p>
   <p>We wish to emphasize that it is imperative that all parents have their children register at the time set for registration, that is to say, even those <pb facs="5418478_4_0398.jpg" n="2"/>children who attended this school before.</p>
