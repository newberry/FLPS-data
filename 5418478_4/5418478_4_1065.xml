   <p>Following are the minutes of the meeting of the Slet Committee held August 1:</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Dr. Antonin Mueller. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The reading of communications followed. The following cablegram was received from the Ceskoslovenska Sokolska Obec v Praze (Czechoslovak Sokol Union of Prague, Czechoslovakia): "Nine members of the exemplary team, five members of the delegation, one instructor, the representative of the Czechoslovak government, Klofac, are leaving Bremen, August 9, aboard the steamship 'America'."</p>
   <p>From the administration committee: An office on the first floor in the Sokol Chicago Building has been rented for a period of two months, that is, July and August. The rental amounts to twenty-five dollars a month. The office is being used now as the office of the Slet. Contracts have been signed with <pb facs="5418478_4_1066.jpg" n="2"/>the Bohemian daily newspapers, Denni Hlasatel and Svornost, to advertise the Slet during the month of August. Besides this, the Slet will also be advertised in the Predmestske Listy (Suburban News and a Slovak newspaper, the Nove Casy (New Times). Mr. V. Hnatek is willing to advertise the Slet in his Twenty-sixth Street News, and the Slet reporter will prepare the necessary articles.</p>
   <p>The technical committee was requested to present a report concerning the contests. It was resolved that no complimentary tickets will be given to the members of the committees, and that each member of the committees must buy his own admission ticket. The contestants will be admitted free to two entertainments. The American Red Cross acceded to our request concerning the sanitary guards, and the chairman of the Slet committee, Dr. Antonin Mueller, was appointed as the commandant of the sanitary guards. Senators Thomas O'Grady and David Davis, in their communications, express their thanks for the invitation, and both hope that they will be able to attend. Two thousand copies of the pre-Slet weekly, the Cesky Svet (Bohemian World) <pb facs="5418478_4_1067.jpg" n="3"/>were ordered from F. Pancner &amp; Company. The Twenty-sixth Street Businessmen's Association, the Twenty-second Street Businessmen's Association, and the Blue Island and Eighteenth Streets Businessmen's Association have been requested to decorate the streets and their business places during the week of the festival. An invitation to attend the Slet was sent to the Federation of Ukrainian Sokols of America. An order for streamers, to be used by the members of the Slet committee, by the guests, by the technical committee, by the administration committee, etc., was given to Emil Bachman and Co.</p>
   <p>From the economic committee: Dvorak Park was also secured for Monday, when a special contest will be held. It was resolved that the second floor of the Coliseum Annex should be rented. Invitations were sent to Bohemian singing societies and to our artists, requesting them to take part in the Slet program. Brother Slovaks and Jugoslavs were invited to send their speakers. The board of trustees of the Czechoslavonic Benevolent Societies Hall, at Eighteenth and May Streets, and the board of trustees of the Czechoslavonic <pb facs="5418478_4_1068.jpg" n="4"/>Benevolent Societies Hall in Town of Lake offered the use of their buildings, gratis.....</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak Embassy at Washington, D. C., is offering the Slet committee the use of a film of the Seventh Slet of the Ceskoslovenska Sokolska Obec v Praze, which could be shown in Chicago during the festival week. The offer was gratefully accepted and the administration committee was instructed to take care of this matter.</p>
   <p>The band which is to perform at the Slet on Saturday and Sunday will consist of forty-two or forty-five pieces.</p>
   <p>Brother Spacek reported for the Slovak Sokols that they are already prepared for the Slet and will participate in the Sunday's program. He also announced that they will not be able to march in the parade in uniform because they are waiting until the unification is completed before they buy uniforms for themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1069.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Brother Kostlan then announced that the judges for the contests will hold their meeting next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Na zdar (To success)!</p>
   <p>Prchal.</p>
