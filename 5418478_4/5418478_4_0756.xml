   <p>The meeting called for last Sunday of all friends of the Bohemian School was very feebly attended. This was in contrast with general expectations. That we were mistaken in our predictions was proved by the fact that there were only about twenty persons present. Of these five were representatives of Vlasta Lodge # 2. Regular officers were to have been elected but because of the small number of delegates present only the chairman and secretary were chosen. ( Mr. Jindrich Hajek and Gust. B. Reisl.)</p>
   <p>It was resolved to call a meeting of the delegates for next Friday, to be held in the hall of Tel. Jed. Sokol. ( Gymnastic Union Sokol) and complete the selection of officers.</p>
   <p>Thus far there have been ten or twelve lodges which have declared their intention of supporting this worthy project and their representatives, as well as the representatives of the lodges which are still willing to signify their willingness to co-operate, are requested to be present at the coming meeting.</p>
   <p>A project of such importance as this must be put off if it is to be accomplished, therefore, we hope that everyone will do his duty. We shall expound this matter further in the course of the week.</p>
