   <p>The injustice committed by the old school board upon the Bohemian school of Cicero has been undone. The arrogant action of the old school board, which not only threw the Bohemian classes out of the public schools, but also vulgarly insulted Bohemian children and their parents, induced citizens of Bohemian origin to elect new members to the Cicero School Board--people of good will, sincere fellow countrymen, and righteous Americans.</p>
   <p>These new members of the school board resolved at the meeting held yesterday that the Saturday Bohemian classes may use the public school buildings again. At yesterday's meeting the matter was brought up by Mr. Frank Petru, president of the school board, who then introduced the representatives of Sokol Karel Jonas (a unit of the American Sokol Union), Messrs. V. Cada, Karel Smiricky, and Blazek. These men explained in their speeches to members of the board how the Bohemian classes are conducted and how important it is to have them. They proved that the teaching of the Bohemian language <pb facs="5418478_4_0509.jpg" n="2"/>does not prevent the children from being good Americans. They refuted the accusations brought forth by the old school board and pledged themselves that the Bohemian school classes in public school buildings will be conducted in such a manner that no one with a sense of justice will have any reason whatsoever to complain. The school board then unanimously resolved to permit the Bohemian school to hold its classes in public school buildings.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, a week from tomorrow the Bohemian schools will move into the public school buildings, Notification as to which of the public school buildings will be used and more detailed information will be given by competent officers. The school board recommended that the Bohemian school classes be under the guidance of a supervising committee, one member of which will be a member of the school board. This committee will meet next week in order to work out the regulations and prepare everything to inaugurate the teaching of Bohemian language in Cicero public school buildings again.</p>
