   <p>The work connected with the compilation of the Address Book of Bohemians in America is progressing very satisfactorily, according to the information received directly from the chief editor, Frank Ludvik. The board of trustees hopes that when the Address Book is finished, it will surpass all expectations. We are therefore urging all business and professional men and also private individuals to have their advertisements or names inserted in the Address Book, because by doing so they will help not only the hospital, which will be a purely Bohemian endeavor, but also themselves. The Address Book will be placed into the hands of Bohemians not only in the United States, but also in the old country, where it no doubt will be received as a most welcome and novel means of information from which our brothers and sisters will be able to learn about the large number of progressive and enlightened countrymen overseas. For this reason nobody should refuse the solicitor of advertisements when he calls, and everyone should consent at least to have his name inserted for a nominal fee.</p>
