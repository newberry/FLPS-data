  <body>
   <p>The Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Jan Amos Komensky (Sokol Jan Amos Komensky Gymnastic Association) celebrated its tenth anniversary two days in succession, that is Saturday, Oct 23, with a festive banquet and Sunday, October 24, by presenting its children and junior and senior classes in a gymnastic exhibition. Saturday's banquet was really festive, because we have not witnessed such an artistic program at similar occasions for quite a while. For this, credit must be given to the arrangement committee, which endeavored to do its best to satisfy the audience, but all in vain, because the attendance, which at some other occasion might have been called satisfactory, was really small for such a significant occasion as was this, considering that there are more than three thousand Sokols united in the central district in Chicago and vicinity. When at such occasions as the fifty-year jubilee of the Sokol Cesko-Americky (Bohemian-American Sokol Association), held last year, and the recent tenth anniversary of the Sokol Jan Amos Komensky, only few of our men and women Sokols from other units attend, then a really poor impression is created. We cannot comprehend the behaviour of the central district, which at one time urges its members to attend and <pb facs="5418478_4_1137.jpg" n="2"/>patronize a picnic of a certain unit and at another time seems to know nothing about dignified and significant celebrations of other units!</p>
   <p>The opening number of the program of Saturday's banquet was the playing of the "Star-Spangled Banner," after which the president, Brother Ferdinand L. Musil, in greeting the audience, mentioned that the Sokol Jan Amos Komensky was founded just ten years ago, on October 8, 1910, when several of our national workers conceived the idea of uniting our Moravian countrymen who sympathized with the Sokol idea into one Sokol unit. The name of the supreme teacher of nations, Jan Amos Komensky (Jan Amos Commenius), a Moravian, was selected for this new Sokol unit.....</p>
   <p>The gymnastic exhibition held Sunday was also a success. In the afternoon the children and junior classes of both sexes presented several drills under the leadership of Brother Rudolph Styblo. In the evening Sokols of both sexes gave an exhibition of precision calisthenics, apparatus, and games.....</p>
   <p>The gymnastic exhibition was followed by dancing, as usual.</p>
