   <p>Mr. Bures, publisher of Pokrok Zapadu (Progress of the West), waited almost a year before filing the suit about which we had had so many reports. He has asked for $25,000 damages in the superior court from the Denni Hlasatel. He claims that sum for damages to his honor, his business, and who knows what else, caused by the publication in our paper on March 16, 1911 of what was written in Cesko-Americky Sokol about Mr. Bures. The article declared that the money which Pokrok Zapadu collected for the million-cent gift for the Ustredni Matice Skolska (Central Scholastic Association), was not turned in by Mr. Bures at the time set by the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau)--the originator, financial adviser and manager of the fund.</p>
   <p>Anyone who knows with what enthusiasm this collection was carried on among us; what the purpose of the collection was; and how every Czech must be affected by every apparent dishonesty will understand the indignation with <pb facs="5418478_4_0187.jpg" n="2"/>which the Cesko-Americky Sokol wrote. Every Czech will understand equally well that we, in reading such accusations in so important a paper, considered it our duty to inform our readers about it. We were not concerned about Mr. Bures; we were concerned about our Ustredni Matice, about the good name of American Czechs whom the entire Czech nation watched at that time. Therefore, we committed a "sin" for which Mr. Bures now wants $25,000 from us.</p>
