   <p>The meeting called for yesterday, was attended by so few of our Bohemian citizens, that it could hardly be called a meeting.</p>
   <p>We believe that it could hardly have been so much because of the inclement weather as it was the dreadful lack of interest which sooner or later will punish us severely.</p>
   <p>We must say that for some of our countrymen, it is more to their liking to sit at a table in some saloon than to try to do something for the benefit of their children and Bohemian Nationalism.</p>
   <p>This disinterest is to be regretted and we fear that it will be destructive for us in all respects. It is high time that this lack of interest should be done away with and in its place some beneficent activity take life. There were only twelve persons present at the meeting. Mr. Paters was elected as Chairman and V. Layer as secretary. After a short debate it was resolved that the meeting be adjourned till next Sunday, and a committee of five composed of V. Herold, Jos. Hausner, Jindr, Hajka, V. Layer, Karl Soldat, who are to try to get a larger group of our countrymen to be present, if possible.</p>
