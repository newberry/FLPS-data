<title level="a">MINUTES OF A REGULAR MEETING OF THE FEDERATION OF BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT SCHOOLS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A regular meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was opened by the president, Mr. Tichava. A large number of delegates were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The minutes of the meeting of the executive committee were likewise approved. A letter was read from the Grand Lodge of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) announcing the remittance of $542.80 as a contribution to the Bohemian Free Thought school system; this was a quarterly remittance which resulted from the taxing of every member of the Jednota by a levy of seven cents per capita quarterly. The letter was accepted. A letter from Mr. V. Straka, a teacher, who thanked the Sdruzeni for a gift of $100 made to him during the summer vacation, was read and accepted. The report of the periodical Svobodna Skola (Free Thought School) was approved; it mentioned that Mr. Machek, a teacher, has secured a large number of new subscribers, for which work he deserves much recognition.....A letter was read from the faculty of the <pb facs="5418478_4_0366.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian Free Thought schools in which the Sdruzeni is asked to request Mr. Petrzelka, the official spokesman of the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought community), to formulate his ideas as to how the Free Thought philosophy ought to be taught in our Free Thought schools. This letter was approved, and it was decided to ask Mr. Petrzelka to set a date on which he could visit a meeting of the faculty and the representatives of the Bohemian Free Thought schools. The meeting is to be held in the Vojta Naprstek school building.....The Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) sent a gift of $145.30, a sum which resulted from a collection taken at a mass meeting held by the Svaz on July 2, 1922. The letter also reported the receipts and disbursements made on that day; Mr. J. J. Jelinek stated that the attendance at the meeting was small, that it could have been larger, and that had it been so the receipts, also, would have been larger. This could be true if our freethinking Bohemian people would give better support to such festivals as the one arranged by the Svaz. The delegate Mr. Cada did not agree with this statement, but was of the opinion that the day of July 2 was badly chosen, for on that day people left for the country to enjoy nature and, consequently, could not attend the mass <pb facs="5418478_4_0367.jpg" n="3"/>meeting. Dr. Antonin Mueller read a report from the periodical Czechoslovak Review in which Professor Velebnicky wrote the following:</p>
   <p>"The Bohemian Free Thought schools of Chicago, which have neither a qualified staff of teachers nor a systematic curriculum, have no desire to preserve the Bohemian language, but only the traditions of the Czech nation."</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate it was decided to elect a committee which would compose a resolution; the local branches of the Bohemian Free Thought school system would then be asked to sign their names to it and send it as a protest to the Czechoslovak Review, sending copies of the resolution to the local Bohemian news papers of Chicago. Dr. Mueller will also inform the Sokol unions about it. The following were elected to serve on the resolution committee: Mr. J. J. Jelinek, Mrs. F. Schejbal, Mrs. Mazac, Mrs. Minar, Mrs. K. Radesinsky, Mr. Frantisek Hudecek, and Mr. Frantisek Kravcik. There was a partial report on the outcome of the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Country Festival). According to this report the festival was a success, but a full report will be submitted at the next <pb facs="5418478_4_0368.jpg" n="4"/>meeting of the Sdruzeni. It was decided to sign a new agreement for the use of the Pilsen Park pavilion for the year 1923.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tichava reported that he had received several letters from Cleveland, Ohio, which ask anew whether a convention of the Bohemian Free Thought schools of America could be held for the purpose of uniting all such schools into one system. After a lengthy debate the idea was rejected, as the convention could not come to an agreement.</p>
   <p>There was a recommendation to arrange a bazaar in the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, but this was rejected also. The press and publicity committee reported that covers for textbooks have been purchased at a cost of $45; further, that 5,000 teacher's report cards and 5,000 student's certificates have been ordered printed.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Stary's motion that the day of October 28 be kept as a national holiday was carried, but the teachers, instead of dismissing classes on that day, are to address the student body on the significance of that date. It was decided <pb facs="5418478_4_0369.jpg" n="5"/>to close the schools on Christmas Day and New Year's Day but to hold classes on Columbus Day.</p>
   <p>Receipts till October 21, 1922, were as follows: From the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Sisterhood, $542.80; from the Grand Lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union), $550.35; from the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), $450; from the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Americti Lesnici a Lesnice (Bohemian-American Foresters), $257.15; from the Grand Lodge of the Jednota Tarboritu (Taborites), $89.32; school fees from the Husuv Dum (John Hus Memorial), $9.58; from the women of the Pilsen Sokol, $14; from Martinec and Company, $14; from the Proletariat school, $6.50 in school fees; the total sum of receipts was $1,933.70. Disbursements: Teachers' salaries, $1,165.20; rental,....$25.00; deficit of the periodical Svobodna Skola, $52.02; covers for school books, $45.10; total disbursements, $1,287.32.</p>
