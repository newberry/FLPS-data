<title level="a">A PUBLIC DRILL OF SOKOL HAVLICEK-TYRS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The great hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs was filled yesterday afternoon and last night with Sokols who assembled there to present the unit's fourth public drill. Like the three previous drills, this one met with marked success.....</p>
   <p>The speech made by the head of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, Mr. D. Novak, opened the afternoon program.....After the applause following his speech had died down, a class of pupils carrying little flags aligned for a drill.....A class of somewhat older pupils presented a routine drill using rings.....The two numbers following consisted of work on the apparatus by grown-up Sokols.....</p>
   <p>Brother Novak also opened the evening performance with a few words of welcome to the guests, among whom were the representatives of all the Sokol units of Chicago.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1235.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The group drills which followed, and the performances on apparatus were splendid proof of the progress made by the popular Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs.....</p>
   <p>During the drills and routines, and the apparatus work, Mr. Brousek's band delighted the spectators....and contributed a great deal to the general success of the day.....</p>
