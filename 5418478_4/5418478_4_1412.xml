   <p>Three hundred years have passed since the time when the heart of gold in the breast of that great old man, J. A. Komensky, stopped beating in Naarden, Holland, far away from his beloved homeland. Kindly hands laid the body of the Bohemian emigrant to his eternal sleep in the soil of a foreign land, but his careworn head was put to rest on the handful of Bohemian soil which Komensky had brought with him to distant Holland, and which often felt the moisture of his bitter tears.</p>
   <p>For three hundred years the prophecy of J. A. Komensky that "the Bohemians shall again take the government into their own hands" was the brightest star in the darkness enveloping the future of the Bohemian nation. Today the prophecy is fulfilled, and it is up to the Bohemian people to honor the memory of him who, <pb facs="5418478_4_1413.jpg" n="2"/>even during the worst times, was hopeful and was doing the same kind of work as Thomas G. Masaryk is doing now. J. A. Komensky, unlike T. G. Masaryk, did not live to see our country freed from its shackles.</p>
   <p>Foreigners honor the memory of J. A. Komcnsky at every opportunity. A new school now being erected in Naarden, Holland, will be named in honor of J. A. Komensky, and the Dutch society Comenius petitioned the city council of the capital city of Amsterdam that one of the main streets of Holland's metropolis be named in honor of this great Bohemian.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians of Holland, during one of their former visits to the grave of J. A. Komensky, resolved that they would erect a monument to him in that city. In order that this idea may be realized, they are asking the people of Bohemia and of Bohemian-America for monetary aid. We, the Bohemians of America, boast about the teacher of nations, J. A. Komensky, on every occasion. Are we ready to prove our love for him by our deeds [as well as our words]?</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1414.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Send or bring your contributions to the American State Bank, 1825 Blue Island Avenue, for this institution voluntarily agreed to collect the contributions. All the contributions will be acknowledged in Bohemian newspapers, and will be sent directly to the Society for the Erection of the Jan A. Komensky Monument in Naarden, Holland. This Society is headed by our countrymen, Messrs. Cejka and Hemelik.</p>
