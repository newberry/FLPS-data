   <p>Dr. Jaroslav E. Salaba Vojan, journalist and manager of the Ceske Tiskove Kancelare, (The Bohemian Press Bureau), also author of Velkeho New Yorky, wrote and published a new book, Cesko-Americke Epistoly (Bohemian-American Epistles). The writer dedicated this work to his wife, Olga, but we immediately note that he made a remarkable gift to Bohemian-American literature thereby. Bohemian-American literature is scarce, almost too scarce, so far as really worth-while works are concerned, and we welcome with sincerest joy its every enrichment with works of distinctive worth.</p>
   <p>Bohemian-American Epistles is such a work, even if we did not agree with some parts of its contents. For instance, we disagree with the author in his division of Bohemian-Americans into three groups. We agree that there is a group here which is rapidly and indifferently becoming denationalized. These people the author places in the first group. We also know, and agree with the author that there is another group of those who, although they are becoming <pb facs="5418478_4_0338.jpg" n="2"/>adjusted to American habits and customs, are remaining sincere Bohemians, but we do not agree with the author that there is a third group, who are surrounding themselves with a veritable Chinese Wall against everything American and, under no consideration, want to admit that they are in any way duty-bound to this new country. True, there are such people here, but they do not and cannot create a group. They are merely strays, a few individuals, who simply can not be considered. Otherwise, we agree with the contents of the book to the last letter.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vojan sees correctly what we have, and what we lack. He judges remarkably the work accomplished by Bohemians in America, and we admit he is absolutely correct when he says that Bohemians in America are not a dying branch of the Bohemian people, and are not threatened with extinction as many Bohemian writers predicted, who, in former days, made a flying visit through America.</p>
   <p>Bohemian-American Epistles are written in a beautiful, easily understood style, and because the cover of the book is very fine, we do not doubt that <pb facs="5418478_4_0339.jpg" n="3"/>it will become an adornment to every Bohemian-American library. We recommend it most heartily.</p>
