   <p>Some time ago a number of groups of the Czech-American Sokol Community voiced their dissention with the plan of holding an all-Sokol rally this year. Recently, however, some of the groups seem to have changed their minds, and it is now probable that the rally will be held. The idea of a postponement originated in New York and found favor with the majority of the groups, so that it was about to be voted on. Conditions have, however, arisen which make the rally advisable.</p>
   <p>The Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs is for the rally, and advances five reasons for advocating it. One of them is a deficiency in the statutes which had not been worked out sufficiently when the Fuegner-Tyrs merged with the National Sokol Union. Many points in the statutes were handled too flimsily, and others were laid aside to be taken up by the rally, it is said. The rally has, therefore, been tacitly guaranteed. But the rally, it is pointed out, is needed also for the <pb facs="5418478_4_1165.jpg" n="2"/>reason that the Sokols are confronted with serious problems resulting from the war. The executive committee has, in regard to this, sent out an appeal to the Sokol groups:</p>
   <p>"You do not agree with being called upon to vote on the new proposition concerning the rally shortly after you have cast your vote on another motion. We wish to explain:</p>
   <p>"Unusual conditions demand emergency measures. Our Sokol Community was created in just such an extraordinary time, and in order to maintain and preserve harmony for the future, it is necessary to provide means against any grievances. Our brothers standing behind the projected rally lay emphasis upon the closer relations which will be established at the big meet, and also upon many questions to be cleared away, the solution of which have been left to the rally. We are only doing our duty by submitting the proposition of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs to you to vote on."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1166.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The question of a rally gathers momentum by the support lent to it by the Jednota Delnickeho Americkeho Sokola (Workmen's American Sokol Union), which has joined our organization and expects a better mutual understanding as a result of the big meet. The proposition for the rally does not mention the time and the manner in which to limit the number of delegates. We wish to present a supplement on which a vote should be taken. We propose October 14 as the date of the rally. The statutes can be worked out until that time. Every group will send one delegate. Only those groups that are not behind in the requirements as to dues and national patriotic obligations will be permitted representation.</p>
   <p>We request that the meeting at which our proposition will be voted on also elect the delegates, and that amendments to our constitution be worked on as soon as possible. On the occasion of the jubilee of the Milwaukee Sokol Gymnastic Union, it was remembered that the Czech-American Sokol of Chicago is to celebrate its golden jubilee this year. To this we wish to remark that <pb facs="5418478_4_1167.jpg" n="4"/>the fiftieth anniversary coincides with this year, but not with the month of June, as stated in an article. The organization was founded in the month of April, 1868, and the first meeting, after its separation from the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol (Gymnastic Sokol Union), was held April 5, when Joseph Bedlan was elected its head. The meeting was held at Vilims hall, Taylor and Canal Streets, where all the meetings were held till June 1, 1868, when a new home was built.</p>
