   <p>The inspection of the burned remnants of the building of Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy in Merigold, participated in, as it was, by many countrymen and friends of the Sokols, took place early yesterday morning.....</p>
   <p>When our yesterday's report was written.....there was little hope that anything in the building would be recovered.....</p>
   <p>Nothing could be carried out of the building during the fire, but our readers will be happy to learn about the surprise of the search party when.....they found, in what used to be the library, all shelves and cabinets badly burned, but many of the books in a still usable condition.....</p>
   <p>Another happy find was made in another room. The flag that was brought by the first Sokol expedition from Prague to Chicago was not completely destroyed by the fire or subsequent streams of water pouring into the building. Remains <pb facs="5418478_4_1208.jpg" n="2"/>of it were found which, while hardly recognizable as a keepsake of the great holiday of Bohemian Sokoldom, will at least be a memento of yesterday's fire.....</p>
   <p>Another place where the flames could not finish their work of destruction was the lodge rooms. Here, as if by a miracle,....framed charters, flags, and trophies of societies using the building for their meetings, were found on the remains of the walls. Badly burned, of course, but still usable.....</p>
   <p>Another item of good news has come from the office of Fire Chief O'Connors. It has refuted the theory that the fire was caused by carelessness. His report shows that it was caused by a short circuit in the dressing room next to the stage where a switch is located.....</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Sokol unit held a meeting in the home of its head, Mr. Pokorny, last night. One of the first steps the committee took <pb facs="5418478_4_1209.jpg" n="3"/>was to secure the insurance money that would be forthcoming from one $10,000 policy on the building, and one $1,000 policy covering the equipment, such as apparatus, two pianos, etc., all of which was destroyed.....</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to call at the City Hall and present a request for permission to use the Bryant School on 41st Court between 13th and 14th Streets for drilling.....</p>
   <p>An agreement is expected to be reached with the Patronat (Board of Directors) of the Svobodna Skola Frantisek Palacky (Frantisek Palacky Free Thought School) permitting the organizations that used to hold their meetings in the Sokol building to use the School's premises. It is hoped that the Patronat will consent to discontinue, temporarily, Sunday afternoon classes in that school in order to accommodate the said associations.....</p>
