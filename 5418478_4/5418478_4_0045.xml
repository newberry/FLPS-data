   <p>A Bohemian Section in the Women's Palace is now assured. It has become a sort of habit with us, that if we wish to accomplish something we get the help of our women folk. Whenever the women and men join for some purpose, success of the undertaking is assured from the very beginning, for we will not allow it to be said that our women lead us in resourcefulness and energy.</p>
   <p>Bohemian women went to work quietly without any fanfare, and to day announce to the public the results of their efforts. A committee was appointed and it called upon Mrs. Palmer, Chairman of the Women's section of the Exposition, who received the committee very kindly and assured them that the Bohemian Women would have a separate section allotted to them. We feel certain that a Bohemian section in the Women's Building would arouse only admiration,and with congratulations to our Chicago committee for the results thus far accomplished, we wish that they should continue in the same manner. Since they are assured of space in the exhibition they should secure for the Bohemian section the finest of products such as only the artistic hands of Bohemians are able to produce.</p>
