   <p>An exhibition of moving pictures was held in Chicago last week. "Stars of the first magnitude" were shown there in the brilliancy of theatrical makeup and in the garish glare of their fame. We know that America can point to a resplendent array of stars, more or less famous; we Czechs can also boast of a goodly number of them--but what do they mean in comparison with the "nickel show artists"?</p>
   <p>We do not venture to estimate the number of Czech-Americans who went to see the big display. We are inclined to think there were not many, and the show did not seem to need them very badly. There were large throngs of other American citizens to make up for their absence. All these people crowded at the entrance seemed to have only the desire to see the "stars". The press, of course, gave copious space to reports on the splendid success of the event <pb facs="5418478_4_0349.jpg" n="2"/>This only proves that those people seem to be more interested in flimsy entertainment than they are in the war, high prices of commodities, prohibition, and all the other problems which should at this moment occupy an eminent place in the minds of everyone. The throngs crowded the Coliseum so thickly that the attendance had to be restricted, because some people fainted, and there was reason to fear other more serious accidents. All this in order to see an actress who has received publicity; to acclaim her as a world famous heroine; although she would attract very few people if she were seen in everyday life.</p>
   <p>Let us observe, by way of contrast, the occasion of the visit which Marshal Joffre paid Chicago recently. Countless multitudes thronged the streets to welcome the famous hero of the Marne and to testify to the affection of the Americans for the French nation. "Had there been an admission fee of fifty cents, as in the Coliseum, the arrangements committee would probably have had a hard time collecting all the 'half-bucks' for the spectacle."...By the same token it is to be assumed that people would not relish the idea of parting with "four bits" to see Theodore Roosevelt, one of our most popular <pb facs="5418478_4_0350.jpg" n="3"/>men, or President Wilson, beloved head of our Republic.....But then, what are men such as these, really, compared with Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford? Wilson may well be our greatest President after Lincoln, and Joffre the greatest general of the World War. To some people this is merely a trivial fact. The fame of a photo buffoon who makes a million dollars a year, like Chaplin, or of an actress like Mary Pickford who does not know how to act, obscures the pictures of the President and the General completely...Only a few years ago a majority of the people looked down upon the cinema with disdain,never fathoming its brilliant future.....</p>
   <p>In summarizing the above considerations, we advise those who are craving fame and riches not to entertain pipedreams about Wilson or Joffre, but to become cinema stars instead.</p>
