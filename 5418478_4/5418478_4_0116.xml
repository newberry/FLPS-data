   <p>Like all great movements the Sokol movement had its origin in a great era. It was in the early sixties, when constitutional government was instituted in Austria and when national liberty became the one most desired prize, especially among the non-German races who up to that time were the most unhappy subject of absolutistic Austria. The wave of the Czech renaissance was fast reaching its peak. To live meant to live for one's people and for the ideas of freedom and national greatness.</p>
   <p>Out of this desire to serve the common good and to help the nation with its aspirations, the Sokol idea was born. The founders Miroslav Tyrs and Jindrich Fuegner, men as noble as history has on record , wrote at the very beginning the immortal motto "Not for gain or glory!" on its standards. From the very beginning the only goal was to serve humanity, especially their own people.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0117.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And the best way for the far seeing leaders to serve would be the way of bringing individuals and through them the whole nation to the highest levels of human perfection, both physical and mental. As Neruda, the great poet of Czech renaissance, expressed it: "If everyone be of granite, the whole nation an unshatterable rock shall be."</p>
   <p>Yes, that was the objective of the Sokols from the very start: To be of granite; to be able to resist oppression; to have the strength to conquer all human pettiness and failings and to reach the highest goals ever conceived by the human mind.</p>
   <p>It is no wonder therefore that the growth of Sokol was so phenomenal. From the seventy-five original members in January, 1862, the organization grew in five short years to 10,448 in 1871, and to 663,702 in 1930. And the growth was not only in numbers, but in interest, enthusiasm, and <pb facs="5418478_4_0118.jpg" n="3"/>influence as well. Soon a slogan passed from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart: "Co Cech, to Sokol," which freely means"Every Czech a Sokol." And indeed, even those who were not so active whose names did not appear on the books of the organization were Sokols at heart. It can be safely said that the Sokol idea captured the heart of the nation, that Sokol became its pride as well as its hope.</p>
   <p>What the Sokols did during the war, during the revolution and during the first few trying years of the newly born Republic, is a glorious story. Their deeds are written in indelible gold in the history of the country.</p>
   <p>It is only natural that the Sokol idea took hold of all Czechs residing in America. And it did that early. Attempts at organizing Sokol units were made in the early sixties, until finally there grew American Sokol communities extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific from almost the Arctic to the southern bounderies of the United States. And in America <pb facs="5418478_4_0119.jpg" n="4"/>as well as in the land of its birth, now as at the very beginning, its purpose is the same: to develop men and women; to make them strong in body and mind; to make of them efficient defenders of true democracy and true brotherhood; to promise the highest type of humanity.</p>
   <p>It is easy to understand that in America the Sokols cultivate the highest type of citizenship and are in every sense of the term committed to American patriotism. They are a valuable asset to American democracy. It is an erroneous idea that Sokols are just another athletic association. They use athletics but only as a means of developing men and women. Physical fitness is recognized as one of the requirements of a well rounded character. Besides, they train their members in voluntary, democratic discipline, in love for the common cause and general welfare of the nation. In other words, they socialize, while they build the individual. The common good is never lost sight of, and the idea of sacrificing individual convenience for it is always alive in the Sokol code of ethics.</p>
