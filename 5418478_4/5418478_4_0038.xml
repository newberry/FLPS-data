   <p>One of the oldest lodges of the powerful Czechoslovak Benevolent Society in the northwestern part of the city, Osveta Lodge #27, celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence in a grand manner in Cechii Hall, last Saturday night. It was one of the biggest events among our countrymen living in that section, and that almost all of them took an active part in the celebration is not be wondered at.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened by the band which played the march from Smetana's "Bartered Bride". Jakub Jiracek, chairman of the celebration committee, made a few remarks suitable to the occasion. Following him, Vojta Janecek, for many years the worthy chairman of Osveta Lodge, warmly welcomed all those present, mentioning the prosperity of the entire C.S.P.S. (Czechoslovak Benevolent Society). His words were received with applause, and he was presented with a bouquet. Twenty-five girls under the direction of choirmaster J. Simonek, sang the "March of the C.S.P.S.Lodges".</p>
   <p>The secretary of the lodge, one of the most active members, not only of his own <pb facs="5418478_4_0039.jpg" n="2"/>lodge, but of the entire C.S.P.S., Longin Tuma spoke of the history of the lodge.</p>
   <p>Osveta Lodge was organized under great difficulties on the 12th of May 1878. During the twenty-five years of its existence, there were proposed 254 candidates for membership, of these 220 were inducted, thirty two members resigned, twelve transferred, thirteen were expelled, and forty one died. The treasurer of the lodge, Jakub Kouba then read a summarized financial report, from which it is indicated that during its existence the lodge paid out $44,373.49. It has on hand $1,588.17 and $627.45 in the sinking fund.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Pelikan, chairwoman of the women of the lodge, delivered an emotional speech, in which she urged the mothers to raise their children for the lodges, after the manner of Bohemians, so they might become the successors of their parents. The speaker of the occasion Jos. Tuma, spoke at length, explaining the advantage in the joining together of lodges, and the benefits derived thereby by all people, pointing out the C.S.P.S. as one of the outstanding examples.</p>
   <p>In the presence of the founders of the lodge, who had taken their places on the stage, were read the well wishing communications, which had arrived.</p>

   <p>After a choral sung for the chartermembers by seventy children, the chairman of the lodge, Vojt. Janecek, was presented with the emblem of his office, a gavel. With that the program was brought to an end, and after a wonderful dinner, which had been prepared, those present gave themselves up to an informal pleasant entertainment, which lasted until the early hours of the morning.</p>
