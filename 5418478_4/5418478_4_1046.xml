   <p>This day will be a memorable one for the small Czech colony of Lyons, for it will celebrate the opening of its own Sokol Hall. This accomplishment was possible only after a great many sacrifices....Lyons, which formerly served as a picnic ground for our Chicago countrymen, today boasts of a goodly number of Czechs who live here. For some time now they have also had a Sokol association. It is this association which has so tirelessly worked toward the establishing of its own home, and its efforts have finally been crowned with success.....</p>
   <p>The Hall is located on Gage Street, and the celebration attending the formal opening will be held there. It will start at three o'clock in the afternoon. The program will include gymnastic, musical, and dance numbers. After two musical renditions on the program, the building will be officially declared open by the building committee. This will be followed by gymnastic exercises <pb facs="5418478_4_1047.jpg" n="2"/>by girls and women, and several interesting dance numbers. It will end with the playing of the Bohemian and American national anthems.</p>
   <p>The evening program will start at 7:30 with a brisk one-act play in which members of the association will take part. The evening's entertainment will close with a dance.....</p>
