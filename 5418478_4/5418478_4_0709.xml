   <p>p. 2.. There is certainly not one single countryman of ours who would not look up with love and respect to the Bohemian Liberal School "Vojta Naprstek." And if the Czechs from other parts of Chicago just knew more about this school they not only could understand the pride with which those from the district "Bohemian California" regard their school, nay, they would share their pride. It is a Czech school which proves to the Bohemian-Americans that we would have no complaint about the dearth of Czech schools, if only the shining example given by the "Bohemian-Californians" were followed.</p>
   <p>We cry over denationalization, and some even have calculated to a nicety in how few years there will not be a vestige of our beautiful Czech tongue in America. Well, the "Vojta Naprstek" school, for the benefit of which there is a "Bazaar" being held in the hall of "Sokol Chicago," on Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street, banishes these gloomy thoughts.</p>
   <p>Although the school days are limited to Saturday and Sunday forenoon, the results are most surprising and gratifying. Many hundreds of children attended the classes who otherwise would have weaned from their maternal language, who <pb facs="5418478_4_0710.jpg" n="2"/>would have forgotten it utterly. They not merely speak and write the language, they have obtained a good knowledge in the glorious history of our nation and they feel as Czech children.</p>
   <p>This statement does not represent any flattery for the school, it is based on actuality. That this goal has not been reached in an easy manner will be obvious to everyone who is acquainted with our public life. There is, it seems, a curse upon us, which prevents every good plan, be it ever so sound and promising, from being carried out without a stubborn fight.</p>
   <p>The "Vojta Naprstek" school was founded by a small group of patriots in October, 1896. It has been in existence for eleven years. Former pupils are maturing into men, and as they were taught the Czech language and to love Czech atmosphere, they are joining Czech social institutions and associations, and it is to be expected that they will spread Czech sentiment in their families, clubs, and, of course, in public.</p>
   <p>The school at its beginning had two classes and was frequented by fifty pupils; it now consists of six classes, four in the building of "Sokol Chicago," and two on Homan Avenue and 26th Street, where the sponsors of the school had purchased the building and some lots. The premises proved inadequate, however, and <pb facs="5418478_4_0711.jpg" n="3"/>a larger building will have to be acquired.</p>
   <p>The exposition just opened in the "Sokol Chicago" hall, is to aid the patrons in the development of the institution. The hall was crowded with patriots ready for sacrifice and service; the president of the patronate, Mr. Dusil, welcomed them, and an excellent program filled the first evening.</p>
