<title level="a">THE CESKO-AMERICKA NARODNI RADA INAUGURATES SERIES OF LECTURES ABOUT THE BOHEMIAN PEOPLE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>There are among us many countrymen who regard the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) as an institution whose only aim is to help the motherland, and who say that its first duty should be to promote the welfare of Bohemians here in the United States. These countrymen will no doubt change their opinion after they read the present report. They will have to admit that if there is a single institution which takes care of our needs here in America it is the Narodni Rada. This institution is among the first which, through its cultural work, fosters among our youth a respect and love for everything Bohemian and disseminates correct information among non-Bohemians about the high development of our people and their cultural achievements, as well as the unjust treatment to which they are being subjected. In other words, by this inestimable activity the Narodni Rada makes our struggle for existence in this country easier; it renders more agreeable our intercourse with non-Bohemians who are frequently prejudiced against everything Bohemian.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0891.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this way it enriches and deepens our national life in this country, creating a better understanding of our people--the great people of Bohemia--among hundreds of thousands of non-Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The results of this activity are gratifying indeed. Many columns could be filled with an account of our countrymen's experiences in the improvement of other people's opinions about our nation.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Rada has inaugurated a new series of lectures which is producing excellent results. Professor J. Zmrhal spoke at the Lincoln Center, Oakwood Boulevard and Langley Avenue, to an audience comprised of educated Americans, about Bohemian-Americans and their merits. The talk was filled with fitting observations taken from social, political, and cultural life in the United States. The speaker was rewarded with many bursts of applause. In the audience there were many university professors, teachers, school superintendents, etc. We are therefore justified in expressing the hope that his splendid work will bring permanent results. At the conclusion of his speech, Professor Zmrhal <pb facs="5418478_4_0892.jpg" n="3"/>was requested by Mr. Genkin Lloyd Jones to add a few words about the history and culture of the Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>Of no lesser importance was the lecture presented in the Burns School at 25th Street and Central Park Avenue. Here the teachers and pupils of the school became acquainted with the beauties and glories of the people and the country of Bohemia by word and pictures. For our Bohemian pupils, of whom there is a majority in this school, this was a festive occasion--a day which will linger in their memories for many years. The audience was electrified when Mr. E. St. Vraz, who was introduced by the school superintendent, Mr. Nightingale, spoke touchingly to the Bohemian youth in their native musical mother tongue, of which he is a supreme master.</p>
   <p>Professor Zmrhal spoke in English about the history, glory, and beauties of Bohemia. He created great enthusiasm not only by the pictures which he displayed, but also by the delivery of his lecture. When he showed the last picture, a deeply impressive apotheosis of royal Praha, and when he said, <pb facs="5418478_4_0893.jpg" n="4"/>"Thank you--I have lead you through all possible roads in our jaunt into beautiful Bohemia, and by this time you certainly must be tired"--to his great surprise, the teachers and pupils shouted: "No, no, we are not tired, please tell us more! Please go on!" He who knows how restless and impatient the American students are and how difficult it is to interest them in a lecture; he who recalls the stereopticon pictures which are practically a daily occurrence in our schools, and therefore quite common to students, will have to admit that the pictures from Bohemia must have been most beautiful and interesting.</p>
   <p>Noisy applause greeted the showing of the picture of calisthenics at the last Sokol Slet (Gymnastic Festival). Notwithstanding all the enthusiasm, the children were deeply interested and when the applause subsided and the speaker could continue, one could even hear the breaths of the happy children and adults. The profuse expression of gratefulness and thanks given to the speakers certainly was sufficient proof that their efforts were fully appreciated.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0894.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Requests from other schools are pouring in. This week a lecture will be delivered at the Corkery School, then in Gary, and then in the Teachers' College. This last-mentioned lecture will be delivered to six hundred teachers and about one hundred professors. For this lecture great preparations are being made, because it will be a most outstanding event for our Bohemians in Chicago.</p>
