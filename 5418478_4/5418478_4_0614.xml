<title level="a">MEETING OF THE PATRONAT CESKE SVOBODOMYSLNE SKOLY VOJTA NAPRSTEK(Summary)</title></bibl>

   <p>The regular meeting of the Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslne Skoly Vojta Naprstek (Trustees of the Bohemian Free Thought School Vojta Naprstek) was held on April 7, 1913, under the chairmanship of Mr. R. Mulac. All officers and many delegates were present. ....The Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) advised the Patronat that it reaffirms its decision to the effect that the teachers will be paid directly by the Sdruzeni and that the Sdruzeni assumes the right to appoint and discharge teachers of its member schools, but the Sdruzeni leaves the right of supervision of schools and teachers to the Patronat. The letter was discussed very thoroughly and the delegates offered reasons why they do not agree with this decision. A committee of five members was appointed and given instructions to attend the next meeting of the Sdruzeni and explain the attitude <pb facs="5418478_4_0615.jpg" n="2"/>of the Patronat in regard to this matter.....</p>
   <p>A special meeting of the Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslne Skoly Vojta Naprstek was held on April 25, 1913, under the chairmanship of Mr. Mulac. The meeting was called to appoint new teachers who would fill the existing vacancies, and to take up in detail the reasons why the Patronat opposes the decision of the Sdruzeni in regard to the paying of teachers' salaries and their appointment and discharge. The committee of five listened to the discussion in order to be in a position to defend the Patronat's position in the coming meeting of the Sdruzeni.....</p>
   <p>Chairman Mulac requested the delegates of the Sdruzeni who were present at the meeting to justify the decision of the Sdruzeni, whereupon Mr. Kopecky explained that all of the other Patronats have welcomed this decision, and that in practice it proves to be very beneficial. The teachers are required to attend conferences of the Sdruzeni and are fined for nonattendance. The Sdruzeni is <pb facs="5418478_4_0616.jpg" n="3"/>thus in a position to withhold the teacher's salary. Chairman Mulac disagreed and maintained that before making this decision, the Sdruzeni should have consulted all Patronats and learned their opinion..... The Patronats have men who are just as competent to examine credentials and appoint able teachers. The Patronat Skoly Vojta Naprstek has men on its staff who have taught there for more than fifteen years and who own considerable financial interest in the Patronat's school building.....</p>
   <p>After the departure of the delegates of the Sdruzeni, it was agreed to consult lodges and other groups which are the Patronat's members, on the question of whether or not the Patronat should continue to defend its rights against the Sdruzeni.....[Translator's note: After a discussion of minor personal matters, the meeting was adjourned.]</p>
