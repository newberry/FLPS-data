   <p>As already announced in our previous issues, the great Sokol festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, started on Friday. The significance of this festival is not less than that of the one held here in Chicago last year. This all-Sokol convention is the eleventh of its kind for the Slovak Sokols of America, and is combined with the Czechoslovak convention of all the leaders of the Svaz Ceskoslovenskeho Sokolstva (American Sokol Union). Many American guests were present.....The Olympiad was held on the athletic field of Lehigh University. It began on Friday morning at 7 A. M. with both the first and second class divisions....in which both sexes participated....Many teams from all parts of the country competed and the competition was stiff. Our convention correspondent, Brother Karel Prchal sent us a report by telegram yesterday. From his report it appears that our Chicago boys had thoroughly good luck by winning several first prizes both as teams and as individuals. The first prize went to the team of the Sokol Chicago, and the first prize for individual <pb facs="5418478_4_0994.jpg" n="2"/>prowess went to our well-known Sokol brother Jindrich Smidl. Brother Smidl is, without doubt, one of the best competitors we have, and during the last few years there has not been one athletic tourney in which he has not competed for prizes--bringing back to Chicago an unquestioned championship. We are not at all surprised, therefore, at his latest victory.....</p>
