   <p>p. 4. The reports coming from the Bohemian reading room are very pleasing to us, because they indicate that the attendance at the reading room in our Pilsen is large. The reading room at Blue Island Avenue and 18th St. is a deserved attainment for us Bohemians. However, now that we have this reading room, we must not fold our hands in our laps, but we must strive further so that we may find in it Bohemian books and newspapers, so that we may make of it our own headquarters. Therefore it is necessary that we visit the reading room and send our children there also. Let us not, however, send them in such a manner that the police will have to take action against them. Bohemian parents should come to the reading room often with their children, so that they may see what a grand opportunity the children have of educating themselves in the reading room.</p>
