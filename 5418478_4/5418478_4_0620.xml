   <p>Our countrymen who are about to apply for citizenship papers, and all those who desire to become acquainted with the Constitution of the United States and the country's political conditions, will be interested in the inauguration of Bohemian classes in political science. These classes will be conducted in the Bohemian Settlement at 1827 South Center Avenue every Tuesday night, from 7:30 to 9 P. M. The instruction will cover the fundamentals of American history, of the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of Illinois, and especially of the municipal administration of the city of Chicago. The purpose of these classes is not only to prepare students for the questions which they may be, asked at the time of their naturalization, but also to familiarize them with public questions and current political problems, thus enabling them to use their suffrage judiciously.</p>
   <p>The classes will be conducted by Mr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, who is at <pb facs="5418478_4_0621.jpg" n="2"/>present employed in Chicago as a customs inspector. Mr. Smetanka has received the degree of Bachelor of Arts as a result of his studies in political science at Columbia University. He will use the Bohemian language, with occasional explanations in English. The classes are free.</p>
   <p>Similar classes are held also in the Cesky Dum (Bohemian House) at 2324 South Central Park Avenue in the Lawndale district every Thursday night from 7:30 to 9:00 P. M.</p>
