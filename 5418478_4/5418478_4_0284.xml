   <p>The establishment of a better understanding between the American public and our youth on the one hand, and our national ideals and aspirations on the other, has been a long-felt need. This understanding is now possible. We have always complained about the lack of a publication printed in English, one which would represent the interests of the Czech branch of the American people and would, at the same time, reflect our cultural achievements.</p>
   <p>We have such a publication now; The Bohemian Review, a monthly publication, splendidly edited by Dr. Jaroslav Smetanka. No longer can we say that we lack a medium for effective propaganda. We should make good use of this magazine which we recommend especially to our youth, that they may <pb facs="5418478_4_0285.jpg" n="2"/>better understand our aims.....</p>
   <p>The latest issue contains a picture of our brave boys who now serve in the 223rd Canadian battalion. The reading matter is equally attractive. Besides political comment, there is an excellent sketch by the Reverend Miller of New York, which deals with the Czechs in Texas, and concludes with the assertion that "a Czech who is not a member of the Czech National Alliance cannot possibly be a good American." The author, as is well known, has a perfect command of our language. He was instrumental in the formation of several branches of the Alliance in the State of Texas.</p>
   <p>One item in the current issue discusses the refusal on the part of our national leaders to permit the coronation of Emperor Karl as king of Bohemia. Another deals with the truth about the murder at Serajevo. News of our volunteers from the camps in Canada and Chicago is another item. One article deals with the "Bohemian Question" which, in the days <pb facs="5418478_4_0286.jpg" n="3"/>of the former Austria-Hungary, involved the question of Czech political and cultural rights.</p>
   <p>Every Czech family and society should subscribe one dollar for the whole year, or fifty cents for six months. The Chicago office of The Bohemian Review is located at 2627 Ridgeway Ave. They will be glad to mail a copy for inspection.</p>
