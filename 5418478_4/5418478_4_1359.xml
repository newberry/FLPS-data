  <body>
   <p>p. 1, col. 5.. Last week, in the hall of Pilsen Sokol, a meeting was held of delegates from the National Sokol Union, the American Workingmen's Sokol Union and of the "Fuegner-Tyrs" Sokol circuit. The question again was the important matter of how to combine the various Sokol units in America into one powerful organization.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate it was resolved to submit to the above named organizations the original motions by Sokol Jar. Kosar and Jos. Cermak and according to the decisions of these organizations, to hold further discussions of the matter. The motions made, deal mostly with conditions and circumstances under which the organization is to be kept active after it is created.</p>
   <p>If one of these motions is approved, then a convention of delegates from the various Sokol units will be called as soon as possible, who will make the final decision about the creation of the Union, elect the necessary officers and begin their duties at once.</p>
   <p>This union will be a benefit to the Sokols especially from a technical point, <pb facs="5418478_4_1360.jpg" n="2"/>because its purpose will be: to maintain an educational course for instructors, to arrange instructive lectures on physical culture and hygiene, and the arrangement of joint public exhibitions. We hope that American Sokols will recognize the real necessity for such an organization and will not allow such a good idea to fail.</p>
