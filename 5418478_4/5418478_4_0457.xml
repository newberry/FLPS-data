   <p>The meeting of the Mistni Sdruzeni Svazu Svobodomyslnych v Chicagu (Local Alliance of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers in Chicago), held July 25, 1921, was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Joseph Mikolas, at 8 P.M., in the presence of forty-one members and delegates. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read.</p>
   <p>The reading of communications followed. The following societies announced their new delegates: Trocnov Court No. 15 of the Bohemian American Foresters, Mr. Joseph Jirgl; Kalifornie Lodge No. 62 of the Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood, Mrs Marie Bulicek; Jolly Friends Club, Mr. Joseph Pec.</p>
   <p>The Statni Svaz Svobodomyslnych Statu Illinois (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of the State of Illinois) in its communication requests that a delegate to its organization be appointed. The request was approved.....</p>

   <p>of America) and with the representatives of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago). But at the said meeting attacks were made on them by the delegates to the Cesko-Slovenske Narodni Sdruzeni and the privilege of the floor was refused to them. At this meeting it should have been explained why the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu should not arrange the Posvicenska Slavnost (Country-wake Festival) under the auspices of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph M. Musil then reported on the meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol. In that meeting it was resolved that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol would not co-operate with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni in arranging the Posvicenska Slavnost. After the presentation of these reports a lively debate ensued in which the following delegates took part: J. Pelant, Anton Zdarsky, Bohumil Dufek, Joseph Kroc, Vojtech Cada, V. K. Soukup, Joseph Mikolas, Joseph M. Musil, Mrs. M. Hudec, Mrs. Anna Kroc, and others. Some of <pb facs="5418478_4_0459.jpg" n="4"/>the delegates recommended that our Bohemian societies and organizations be urged through our daily newspapers to buy the admission tickets to the Posvicenska Slavnost which will be arranged by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni for the benefit of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol, but to send the money for them directly to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol. Other delegates again recommended that our people, who have been intentionally misinformed on this matter, be informed that the Posvicenska Slavnost will be arranged by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni only and that our people should act accordingly. It was finally resolved that the minutes of this meeting be published in Bohemian daily newspapers so that our Bohemian free thought people of Chicago would be properly informed on this matter.</p>
   <p>The report on a theatrical performance, "Vojnarka," was presented and according to which the net proceeds of the performance amounted to $293.40.</p>
   <p>The report on the Protestni Manifestace (Protest Manifestation) reads as follows: <pb facs="5418478_4_0460.jpg" n="5"/>receipts, $1118.20; expenditures, $888.03; Net proceeds, $230.17.</p>
   <p>Both these reports were approved and it was resolved to publish them in our newspapers and in the organ of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych v Americe (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America), Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason). The chairman thanked the arrangements committee and all those who helped to make the theatrical performance and the Protestni Manifestace successful. It was also resolved that at the time these reports are published our societies which heretofore have not paid for the admission tickets to the Protestni Manifestace or which did not return them be requested to do so as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>It was then unanimously agreed that the proceeds of both enterprises be donated to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol; thus our Bohemian free thought schools will be enriched by the sum of $523.57. It was resolved that a request be presented by our delegates at the next meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodo <pb facs="5418478_4_0461.jpg" n="6"/>myslnych Skol, requesting the said organization to arrange its own enterprise on a larger scale, and that the Mistni Sdruzeni Svazu Svobodomyslnych v Chicagu will see to it that the proceeds of such enterprise be as great as possible.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph M. Musil then presented a report of the Statni Svaz Svobodomyslnych Statu Illinois. From this report it was apparent that toward the end of the month of August two new Mistni Sdruzeni (Local Alliances) will be founded in the State of Illinois; one in Town of Lake, August 29, and one in Cicero, August 30. The report was acknowledged.....</p>
   <p>It was resolved that all the members whose dues are in arrears be reported in the next meeting. The financial secretary will notify these, and those who fail to pay their dues will be excluded.</p>
   <p>Receipts in this meeting amounted to $561.07; expenditures, $554.57; cash on hand, $1,010.91.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0462.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The meeting then was adjourned.</p>
