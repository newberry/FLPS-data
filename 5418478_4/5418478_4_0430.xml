   <p>The graduation exercises in the Vojta Naprstek school took place on Wednesday, February 1, 1922. There were numerous visitors there on this occasion. The program was opened with an address by one of the instructors, Mr. F. Vlach.....This was followed by recitations, piano solos, and a one-act play rendered by the students of the school.....The parents and the graduating class were addressed by Mrs. Beranek, who is [also] one of the instructors. She pointed out the importance of Free Thought education, asking the graduates to continue their education in the clubs [created] for adolescents. She stated that they ought to acquaint themselves with the native tongue of their parents and with the history of Bohemia. By doing this, they may contribute to the growth of culture of the country in which they were born. [Translator's note: By this she means the United States]....</p>
   <p>This address was followed by some choral pieces sung by the choral society Karel Bendl, and a violin duet played by two brothers, Josef and Vaclav Kuta.</p>

   <p>....The graduates were then addressed by the president of the school, Mr. Dusil, who wished them good luck upon their entrance into life and wished that they would someday fill the ranks of the leaders of the Free Thought movement. There were twenty graduates. The valedictorian was Miss B. Straka.....</p>
