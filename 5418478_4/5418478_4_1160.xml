   <p>The technical committee of the Central Division of American Sokols has just published the score of the public drills of the first rally, which took place in the Pilsen Brewery Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue, on July 6 and 7, of this year. The committee had decided to hold back the publication, because some changes requiring special care had been made in the program. This work is finished now; the points are all counted and awarded, and our Sokols will finally learn of their various successes.</p>
   <p>The results will surely be accepted with gratification. While in former contests the bulk of the prizes went to Chicago Sokols, their competitors fared excellently this time, and will consequently feel greatly encouraged for the future.</p>
   <p>The winner in the individual competition is Brother Ladislaus Cap, member of the Sokol group Havlicek-Tyrs of Chicago. He reached the top with 48.3 points, <pb facs="5418478_4_1161.jpg" n="2"/>on 85 per cent. Brother Cap was discharged from the United States Army because an ailment requiring an operation had temporarily disabled him for service. He seems to have recuperated as shown by his success. The full score follows.....</p>
