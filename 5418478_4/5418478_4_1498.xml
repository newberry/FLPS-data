<title level="a">YESTERDAY'S HAVLICEK CELEBRATION WAS A DIGNIFIED DISPLAY OF PIETY BY THE BOHEMIAN PEOPLE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The anniversary of the death of Karel Havlicek-Borovsky, one of the greatest sons of the Bohemian nation, was commemorated in a truly dignified manner yesterday. The ceremony took place before the monument erected in memory of Karel Havlicek, which was unveiled exactly one year ago yesterday.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's celebration was in reality a double celebration: In part we remembered this significant day of Havlicek's death in order to manifest in this memory our homage to a man whose heart of genuine gold ceased beating fifty-six years ago; and we also set aside this day to honor his work.....</p>
   <p>The Karel Havlicek anniversary celebration pleased us, and we called it dignified only because it was a really democratic affair.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1499.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Gathered around the Havlicek monument in Douglas Park were just ordinary people, and if there were not as many present as there were a year ago, there were more whose purpose was to pay homage to Havlicek's memory.....</p>
