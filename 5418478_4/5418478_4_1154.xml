   <p>We had an opportunity, last Sunday, to watch the long-heralded contest between the Czechoslovaks and American-Hungarians, two soccer teams. It was taken as a foregone conclusion that the Czechoslovaks would win. To our great disappointment, the Czechoslovaks lost by one goal. This cannot be termed a crushing defeat, yet our people expected their team to win by a decisive margin.</p>
   <p>One reason for the result was lack of co-ordination in the play of the forwards, another was the unethical behavior of one of our players toward another, which brought about dissention among the rest of the team. If the wing did not take advantage of a ball crossed from the center improper remarks were passed. They did not make allowances for unintentional misplays. We do not like to hear Czech players call each other names. We failed to notice any dissention among the Magyar players.</p>
   <p>It is intended to select eleven players who are to represent the Czechoslovaks <pb facs="5418478_4_1155.jpg" n="2"/>before the football world. Before this can be done, our players will first have to improve considerably in their behaviour.</p>
   <p>Our players do not recognize the authority of their captain. Each of our players follows his individual reasoning, and insists on its being acknowledged.</p>
   <p>It is utterly impossible, under these conditions, for our team to win.</p>
   <p>We shall not fail to record that Mr. Anton J. Cermak, candidate for the office of sheriff of Cook County, keeping his promisc, appeared at the playground and spoke in behalf of our boys in France, admonishing the players not to forget them. He also pledged his support to the players. The latter, in turn, should extend their aid to him in the coming fall election.</p>
   <p>Our team Olympia will meet the Swedish second team next Sunday on the playground at 31st Street and Tripp Avenue at 3 P.M.--Olympia lost its protest against the <pb facs="5418478_4_1156.jpg" n="3"/>Lincoln Park team recently for having left the field of play contrary to the referee's orders. They were suspended by E. Schwarckopf for an indefinite period.</p>
