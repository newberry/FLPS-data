   <p>We Chicago Bohemians may fearlessly boast that we have the greatest opportunity for the raising of our children in a nationalistic manner; for in every ward where Bohemians are settled we have some kind of Bohemian-English school, so that an opportunity is offered to all children that they may spend at least a part of their school days in such schools in order to learn the mother tongue and familiarize themselves with the principles of their nationality, remaining true members of the Bohemian community and grateful children of their parents, of whom they are in no way ashamed of, as are de-nationalized children, but loving and helping them in their old beliefs.</p>
   <p>The greatest advance in these schools was achieved by the patrons of the Bohemian English Independent School in the 6th ward, where with the help of the members of the "C. S. P. S. "(Czecho-Slavok Benevolent Association) they organized and erected a building in which the school proper is located on the ground level and the auditorium occupies the second floor; the profits derived from the rental of which will no doubt be of considerable aid in the maintenance of the school during the ensuing years.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0763.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The patrons are striving diligently to assure the success of this great undertaking and they have the support of all our countrymen who are interested in the Bohemian school. Besides that the members of the above-named lodges contribute in the form of regular quarterly dues for the maintenance of the school. Also there are special benefits from their treasures, allowed according to their means for the maintenance and sound management of the school, which are also needed. The patrons have taken advantage of the opportunity to secure for the school every privilege and the necessary income.</p>
   <p>For this patriotic and generous purpose the patrons are arranging for the coming week a school exhibition in the school building and judging by the preparations of the committee the affair should be a tremendous success.</p>
   <p>The committee has been promised plenty of support from all sides and the enterprise should be abundantly profitable for our school.</p>
   <p>The attention of our public is called to the exhibition, with the purpose in mind, <pb facs="5418478_4_0764.jpg" n="3"/>that all should take every opportunity offered to give a hand towards aiding our independent school, for we all greatly depend on it. Every countryman who is in the least interested in the Bohemian education of his and other parents children, should without any hesitation on his part contribute to the success of the exhibition to the full extent of his means.</p>
   <p>This school has many opponents who through superstitution seek to bring about the sending of all children to parochial schools, where they are taught in church matters, to the neglect of subjects which are more or less necessities of life. This must be explained to all parents having children of school age and opportunity must be provided for them to send the children to an independent school. Now since we have such an opportunity to offer, it is necessary to cultivate, to defend and support it so that we may enjoy the benefits derived from it in the raising of our children as long as possible.</p>
   <p>Therefore friends of the Bohemian-English school in Chicago should get together and declare themselves, that the exhibition may be a success and a testimonial, before all other nationalities in Chicago, of our sense of nationalistic culture.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0765.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A successful exhibition will be an honor and benefit not only to the school but to all of our local countrymen.</p>
