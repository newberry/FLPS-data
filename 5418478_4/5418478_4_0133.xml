   <p>Yesterday marked the thirtieth anniversary of the Denni Hlasatel. Cheerfully and with satisfaction the Denni Hlasatel may look back upon the past three decades--thirty years made notable by the favors and confidence of the Czechoslovak people of Chicago and of all the Bohemian-American settlements. This knowledge, that its work was being recognized by all classes of our people, was a stimulant to the Denni Hlasatel in its struggles for existence. It was an encouragement to its further growth and to more energetic activity for the benefit of our nation.</p>
   <p>The Denni Hlasatel had to overcome many obstacles during the past thirty years. The World War was especially unfavorable and difficult, and all these difficulties were accompanied by constant attacks by merciless enemies of immigrants by whom the foreign press was and is still being threatened. Let <pb facs="5418478_4_0134.jpg" n="2"/>us hope, however, that even these obstacles will be surmounted and the foreign press will be given a credit for its genuine and actually sensible Americanization work.</p>
   <p>The Denni Hlasatel has always performed its duties toward this new country and toward our old homeland. It may look toward the future hopefully and with the satisfaction that it has always honestly fulfilled its mission-that it will always continue to do so. With this knowledge we step into the thirty-first year. We wish the best of success to our readers and we hope that in the future they will stand by the Denni Hlasatel just as they have done in the past.</p>
   <p>The Publishers of the Denni Hlasatel.</p>
