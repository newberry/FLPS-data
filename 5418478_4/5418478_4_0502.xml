   <p>The Ceska Svobodomyslná Škola Vojta Náprstek (Vojta Náprstek Bohemian Free Thought School), which without exaggeration may be called the pride of Bohemian Freethinkers of Chicago, very seldom appears in public with a project of its own. But it it does make a public appearance, it is done so successfully that many of its friends and patrons are always pleasantly surprised.</p>
   <p>The last time the school appeared in public was at the New Year's festival held at Sokol Chicago hall on Saturday afternoon. The festival was attended by a large number of our people. School children of the preparatory school and of various grades participated in the program under the supervision of their teachers, Mr. Fr. Vlach, Mrs. Beranek, Mrs. Weiner, and Mrs. Hulka. Various numbers on the program were very beautifully presented by the school children. We must also mention the fact that members of the Junior Club of the Vojta Naprstek School participated in the program.</p>
