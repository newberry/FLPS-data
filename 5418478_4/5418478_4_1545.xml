<title level="a">KAREL HAVLICEK MONUMENT COMMITTEE MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held last night in Mr. Welky's hall by the Committee for the erection of the Karel Havlicek Borovsky monument. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. A letter from the Havlicek Benevolent and Educational Club of Horny Ruzodole in Bohemia was read, the contents of which were as follows:</p>
   <p>"Esteemed Brothers, Bohemian People: With great pleasure we look upon you in that far off country of yours, with what cheerfulness and indefatigability in both the national and economic fields you are able to demonstrate your strength and power of national enlightenment before the eyes of other nationalities. It was your task to see to it that a monument of our great Bohemian journalist and educator of the people, Karel Havlicek, be placed in Douglas Park in Chicago. We also look forward to July 29, at which time the monument is to be unveiled in a <pb facs="5418478_4_1546.jpg" n="2"/>festive ceremony. We wish you all much success. Alois Chodera.</p>
   <p>A letter from Mr. Malik was read in which he protests against the publication of a letter by Mr. Martinek in some newspapers by which his business is injured. He believes Mr. Martinek was not authorized to publish such a letter. Mr. Zednik explains that Mr. Malik originally offered twenty-five per cent of the profits, which was approved and a committee appointed to deal with Mr. Malik. However, Mr. Malik absolutely refused to have anything to do with the committee, and for that reason, it was decided in the meeting to make an explanation to the public. Mr. Glaser, however, called attention to the fact that Mr. Malik was willing to do all that he could for the committee, but did not say anything definite.</p>
   <p>It is also announced that Mr. Malik's medals are being sold everywhere under a false pretense, that they are being sold for the benefit of the Monument Fund, which is not true, because these medals are a private <pb facs="5418478_4_1547.jpg" n="3"/>enterprise. The clear profit from the sale of the medals is to be donated to either the Old People's Home or the Orphanage. The editor of Svornost, Mr. Psenka, was asked why Mr. Martinek's letter was not published in Svornost. He replied that this happened entirely from the standpoint of carelessness, because in the letter there was proclaimed a sort of boycott against the business of Mr. Malik, who could then possibly bring suit against either the committee or the newspaper which published the letter. A motion was then made that the secretary write to Mr. Malik, telling him that the committee had authorized the secretary to publish the letter.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that a new statuette of Havlicek be bought for Mr. Dobias, the statuette which Mr. Dobias loaned to the committee is now in the pavilion of Svatopluk Cech Park. Doctor Jar. Vojan announced that the memorial book is now in the press, and that he had no little difficulty <pb facs="5418478_4_1548.jpg" n="4"/>because he was forced to omit some pictures so that the book would have a beautiful appearance. The chairman of the arrangements committee announced that four hundred sixty tickets have been distributed to various societies and corporations, so that the committee has only one thousand and forty left.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes announced that there is room for only two thousand persons in the stands before the monument, and there is no room to build a larger stand. Mr. Kolacek announced that arrangements have been made for police in the park. For the parade, there will be twenty-four policemen, eight of them, motorcycle police. Eight policemen will be assigned for duty at Pilsen Park on Saturday and Sunday. Mr. Kolacek will also arrange for medical care and ambulance service for the occasion. The construction of the platform and stands in the park will be started this week. Receipts at this meeting: Collection by Mrs. Benes $9.00; Disbursements: for postage stamps $5.94.</p>
