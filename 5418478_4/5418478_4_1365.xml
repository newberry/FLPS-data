   <p>Perhaps it is not known to everyone, that we have in every branch of sport a fitting part and representation, and that proportionately we excel over other nationalities. The Bohemian Sokols, wherever they have appeared, surprised everyone with their systematic drills and the performance of all apparatus work. In colleges and universities, Bohemian students were always among the leaders in gymnastics, baseball, football and other sports. We are informed that the leading clubs of the National and American Leagues have engaged several boys of Bohemian origin for the great American game of baseball.</p>
   <p>With the American League Chicago Club (the so-called White Sox) we find among the pitchers the most important position in the game, Mr. Kotal and Mr. Skopec. With the Cleveland Club is the celebrated 3rd baseman Lave Cross (Vacl Kriz). In the Wisconsin Club we had Mr. Cech, and Ed Holy of Chicago has been engaged by the Hot Springs, Colorado Club. As can be seen we are not behind in any sport such as boxing, baseball etc., andit is laudable, that our athletes do not hide their nationality.</p>
