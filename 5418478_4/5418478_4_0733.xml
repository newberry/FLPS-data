   <p>There is probably in the United States not a single reader of free-thinking Bohemian newspapers who would not know that in the first days of this year there was created in Chicago a new organization for the followers of spiritual freedom, The name of it is "Straz Osvojenych", (The Guard of the Enlightened).</p>
   <p>As the name of the new organization shows, it is a representation of associated societies, which see the necessity of undertaking some steps to protect the Bohemian name against sectarian disgrace. Depending upon false statistics they have described us to the American public as a nation of low intelligence, contributing to rude pleasures and seeking the solution of all troubles in suicide. This organization is already functioning and was greeted by our enlightened countrymen very enthusiastically and thankfully. Many societies have already sent to the "Straz Osvojenych" their representatives, and those clubs which have not done so are asked to do so as soon as possible. Every free-thinking society, may it be educational, charitable or entertaining, can join the "Straz Oswojenych" and the ladies' societies are especially welcome, because an independent, educated and cultured woman is able to raise <pb facs="5418478_4_0734.jpg" n="2"/>a strong, active and enlightened generation.</p>
   <p>The subcommittees, which of course have the biggest problems to solve, started their activity as an organization by the printing and educational part of our task. The most important thing is, that all the clubs of other Bohemian-American settlements join the "Straz Osvojenych", that they open new branches and keep in close contact with the original organization in Chicago. You, friends of spiritual freedom, worshipers of idealistic progress, you all, who hate hypocrisy, the religious violence and the depression of superstition, wake up! It is high time that the free-thinking Bohemians start their new life! It is not sufficient that we escaped from the authority of the priests and from the sovereignty of the church; we must educate ourselves and our youth; we must raise them in our principles and impress upon them that they never fall again into religious superstition; and make them carethat the liberal feelings among American Bohemians are not extinct in our generation of today.</p>
   <p>The "Straz Osvojenych" is an organization not only defensive, but educational also, and its activity in this direction is the main task. It will struggle continually to extend our free-thinking schools to support decent free-thinking journals, and to open new progressive liberal libraries and reading rooms for <pb facs="5418478_4_0735.jpg" n="3"/>adults and children. These are the main problems and every educated countryman should agree on them. To be able to penetrate into the largest circles of our people the organization "Straz Osvojenych" will develop the greatest propaganda and system of lectures; - educational meetings will be arranged in different parts of our city that are populated with Bohemian Americans. All free-thinking Bohemians in Chicago do not hesitate to help us in this splendid work. Take your part in the agitation for an urgent and good idea among your clubs and lodges and make them send their representatives to our next meeting.</p>
