   <p>For several years the Bohemians of Chicago have been entrusted with the arrangements for various festivities, Sokol drills, and folk dances in Chicago parks on the Fourth of July. A particular example of this occurred four years ago when the Bohemians led a parade of twenty-two nationalities. The impression which the Sokols--men, women, and children's classes, all in uniforms--made on that occasion is still fresh in the memories of many people.....</p>
   <p>This year the celebration of our national holiday is spread over a whole week, and again it is our sprightly Sokols who have the privilege of inaugurating the festivities. The credit for securing this honor for us is due to the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau).....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1313.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our Sokols and singers have welcomed this opportunity with great enthusiasm, and although practically every Sokol unit has recently given a public drill of one kind or another--last Sunday's common drill of several units requiring a particularly great expenditure of energy--the Tuesday rehearsal in Anton Dvorak Park showed what can be accomplished with good will.....</p>
   <p>Originally, tomorrow's festivity was to be an all-Slavonic one. However, because of indifference on the part of other Slavonic nationalities, it will be almost exclusively Bohemian. Only a very few Slovene, Croatian, and Slovak units will participate, but our Sokols will appear in imposing numbers.....</p>
