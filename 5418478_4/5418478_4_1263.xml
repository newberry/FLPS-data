   <p>The annual tournament of the Cook County Amateur Athletic Federation was held last Saturday evening in the fine, modern gymnasium in the Young Men's Christian Association building on La Salle Street, a gymnasium which satisfies all the latest requirements of sanitation and qualifies as a health center.</p>
   <p>The Cook Country Amateur Athletic Federation is an organization composed of 366 amateur athletic and gymnastic societies.</p>
   <p>Ninety-three men competed in this tournament and the number of men sent by the Sokols was surprisingly large, which made the representation of the Bohemians quite noteworthy.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the technical commission which had charge of this tournament <pb facs="5418478_4_1264.jpg" n="2"/>was Brother Joseph Pokorny, who teaches gymnastics at Sokol Tabor.</p>
   <p>In the staff of judges, beside non-Bohemians we found the names of the following Sokols....[five names].</p>
   <p>The arrangement of this tournament was exemplary, and the rating of performances was impartial. Considering the large experience of the judges, the final result of this contest may be looked upon as a criterion of the work of teams as well as of individual contestants.</p>
   <p>The first prize for individual performance was won by Frank Paul of Sokol Plzen (Pilsens) Sokol Plzen also carried home the first prize for teams and without overstatement, its team may be called most exemplary.</p>
   <p>Paul, with his accomplished performance, scored 94.50 points, out of a <pb facs="5418478_4_1265.jpg" n="3"/>possible 100, and the team of Sokol Plzen received 430.25 points, the perfect score in this instance being 500. These scores are really outstanding, and show the high degree of physical and mental perfection the contestants have achieved.</p>
   <p>The second prize in the senior division for individuals was taken by James Vesely of Sokol Plzen with 91.75 points, the third by a Turner, Jacob Kraft, with 90 points.</p>
   <p>The second prize for teams was won by the Chicago Turngemeinde. They lagged far behind our boys, scoring only 315 points, and had a strong rival in the team of Sokol Slavsky, which scored 311.50 points, and so received the third prize.</p>
   <p>The contests were divided into two divisions: senior and junior. In the senior division there were twenty-three contestants, in the junior division, seventy six.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1266.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Sokol Plzen entered the following men...[five names]. Sokol Slavsky was represented with distinction by Brothers....[six names].</p>
   <p>The team of the Chicago Turngemeinde competed in the Senior division and the Turnverein Vorwaerts, which in previous contests played a conspicuous part, entered only two men in the senior division....</p>
   <p>In the junior division the teams of the following organizations competed: Turnverein Vorwaerts, Chicago Turngemeinde, and Lincoln Turngemeinde.</p>
   <p>The team of Sokol Slavsky, also competing in the junior division, was composed of....[six names].</p>
   <p>Sokol Slavia, a Slovak organization, was represented by....[six names].</p>
   <p>Sokol Tabor entered....[five names].</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_1267.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Sokol Plzen entered....[five names].</p>
   <p>Sokol Chicago entered....[seven names].</p>
   <p>Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs entered....[nine names].</p>
   <p>Slovensky Sokol No. 39....[six names].</p>
   <p>The Turners were represented by a five-man team of the Social Turnverein, but as the figures mentioned above show, the Slavs had a greater representation in this event.</p>
   <p>In the senior divisions, the contests were arranged in the following order: work on parallel bars, work on the horizontal bar, work on the broad horse and work on rings. The junior division had the same order and apparatus <pb facs="5418478_4_1268.jpg" n="6"/>except the rings. The rings are very difficult to handle, and for that reason were replaced by calisthenics in the junior division.</p>
   <p>The type of work which would be obligatory for all contestants was selected by the staff of judges by draw just before the contest. This made the contest more interesting and, because of it the contestants stepped up to compete wholly unprepared. But as far as the Sokols were concerned, the most complicated obligatory work was neatly performed. An unfinished exercise, or one that was not even attempted, was quite rare. Such occurrences as these were evident with some contestants, and their absence among the Sokols assured the Bohemian boys their victory.</p>
   <p>The gymnasts in the senior division attracted the attention of everyone. Their work was certainly a treat for the eyes, and especially so for a professional specialist, many of whom were present. The exercises were performed with <pb facs="5418478_4_1269.jpg" n="7"/>elegance, to some extent with bravery, and many of them presented extreme technical difficulty.</p>
   <p>The feats of Paul, Vesely, Kristufek, Herzog, and others actually electrified the on-lookers, and the gymnasium reverberated with applause when the more difficult numbers were presented.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian team again proved that it is, and will be for a long time to come, a tough opponent for any team of gymnasts.</p>
   <p>Paul won easily with his complicated and almost unending combinations on the broad horse, performed with ease and elegance. He repeated the same on the horizontal bar. On parallel bars he was not excelled by anyone. But Vesely and Kristufek dominated on the rings. Vesely seems to be invincible on this apparatus. Kristufek won his points by free combinations. He showed almost unbelievable strength in swinging into a handstand and, by letting go of the <pb facs="5418478_4_1270.jpg" n="8"/>right ring, coming to a stationary horizontal position--the flag--supported only by his left arm.</p>
   <p>The team of Sokol Slavsky also showed their training in daring exercises. But it was noticeable that they were not used to the apparatus, and especially so with the low hanging horizontal bar, which seemed to inconvenience them considerably.</p>
   <p>The Turners showed that they are acrobats in the true sense of the word. Great bravery was needed to complete their free combinations on the horizontal bar. Here is an example: One of their men made a giant swing on the horizontal bar, let go with his hands and came over the top of the bar with legs spread eagle-fashion to a perfect stand on the ground. And here is another: Change from a giant swing overhand, over a thrust of the feet backward through the arms, and a lightning-like spread-eagle to the rear, to a perfect <pb facs="5418478_4_1271.jpg" n="9"/>stand on the floor.</p>
   <p>The Sokols went through their performances with a sharp, machine-like surety, with faultless precision of execution, a correct position of the whole body, and perfect correlation in every movement. All this helped them gain more points than they needed.</p>
   <p>Every expert of gymnastics was disappointed by the light entries of the Turners in the senior division. The Turners did not distinguish themselves as they had in previous tournaments, and it is noticeable that the ranks of the full-fledged performers are getting thinner.</p>
   <p>Also in the junior events the entries of the Turner societies were not as large as formerly, when a number of teams were entered from each society.</p>
