   <p>We knew in advance and saw later that the Sjezd Cesko-Americkych Zurnalistu (Congress of Bohemian-American Newspapermen), which just ended in Chicago, would be without any significance for Bohemian journalism; and all we had expected from it has been fulfilled. The congress was taken advantage of by all those who never miss an opportunity to try to damage our newspaper--that is, as far as they can damage it. So far we have kept quiet and shall keep quiet in the future. This is the first, last, and only expression of opinion which we shall voice.....</p>
   <p>Our editors attended the congress, co-operated in every way they could, and.... <pb facs="5418478_4_0173.jpg" n="2"/>now we hear that "the management of the Denni Hlasatel does not permit their editors to join the 'Union' because their salaries would have to be increased." On the other hand, even the organizers of the Sjezd have admitted that the editors of our paper are the best paid of all Bohemian newspapermen. Hence, with us it is not a matter of money.....</p>
   <p>The Sjezd rewarded the idealism of our editors with insults. This is the only reason why we open our columns to what they have to say in this matter, and what was said for all of them by Editor Lou W. Dongres who, under the pen name of "Just A Man," is known not only here but also in the old country as an able correspondent and contributor to many leading Bohemian newspapers.</p>
   <p>The disappointment of Mr. Dongres and his colleagues is expressed in the letter he addressed to the "Sjezd Cesko-Americkych Zurnalistu assembled at the 'banquet' in the Pilsen Auditorium," and dated August 28, 1913, in Chicago:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0174.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Gentlemen: I am herewith returning my membership card and I resign my membership in your organization, requesting that I be relieved of any and all membership obligations if there are any.</p>
   <p>"At the same time I consider it my duty to give you the reasons (which will also be published in the daily press) for this action.</p>
   <p>"Against all principles of decency, the congress published a resolution which was defeated by a majority of votes. In this resolution, the work of the editors of the dailies, Svornost and Denni Hlasatel, was designated as worthless and absolutely without any significance. Immediately thereafter you came to me with the request that I induce these valueless journalistic entities to join your New York association. I say "New York" association advisedly, because the congress has done nothing but give the New York organization the right to speak for all Bohemian journalists throughout the United States. This <pb facs="5418478_4_0175.jpg" n="4"/>was also the only reason for the visit of New York men to Chicago. I substantiate this statement with the following:</p>
   <p>"The congress adopted a resolution to express its thanks to the daily Spravedlnost, none of whose editors attended the congress. Spravedlnost has done nothing for the congress but play it up. Evidently a little 'paper glory' was all the New York men were after. And what is more, the Spravedlnost, whose members did not attend the congress has received the authorization of that congress to publish a defeated resolution in which the work of editors who were in attendance is called 'worthless and absolutely without any significance.....</p>
   <p>"The two gentlemen from New York intended to go so far as to call an indignation' meeting against the Svornost and Denni Hlasatel because they were being 'ignored' by these two papers.....Realizing the danger of such a proceeding and its meanness toward colleagues working on these papers who attended the congress, I met these gentlemen in time to prevent the calling of such a meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_4_0176.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>I suggested that they draft the text of a resolution which would show the justice of their cause and which, if adopted by the congress, would be made known to the Bohemian public. The next day these two gentlemen brought in a resolution insulting the papers for which these colleagues work and the colleagues themselves. This resolution was defeated--and in spite of it, all Chicago now reads about the' worthlessness' of the work of the editors of Svornost and Denni Hlasatel.</p>
   <p>"Wishing you as much success as you deserve, I am,</p>
   <p>"Lou W. Dongres,</p>
   <p>Editor, Denni Hlasatel."</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned members of the editorial staff of Denni Hlasatel give our full approval to the statement of our colleague, Dongres, and share his point <pb facs="5418478_4_0177.jpg" n="6"/>of view. We also state that under no circumstance shall we enter into any further discussion of this matter. We shall ignore anything and everything that the so-called "Svaz Cesko-Americkych Zurnalistu" (Association of Bohemian-American Journalists) may publish in this respect.</p>
