   <p>Denni Hlasatel is now the only Bohemian daily in Chicago, which signed the agreement with the typographical union, observes it and is entitled to use the union protective label. Narod never was union, and Svornost's label was taken away when the agreement was grossly violated in that plant.</p>
   <p>Every issue of Hlasatel is provided with the union label, which is to be found on page four. This is the best proof that our paper is union, and that the various reports circulated by our enemies, as though we had a strike at our plant, are nothing more than lies.</p>
   <p>Several typesetters who wanted to be publishers and who stopped working when we refused to divide with them the results of ten years' work, can be called by any other name except strikers.</p>
   <p>Everyone can understand that.</p>
   <p>Actual proof, that there is no strike in our plant, is the fact, that strikers from Svornost and Narod came to us seeking employment, which they were given so far as it was possible to place them.</p>
