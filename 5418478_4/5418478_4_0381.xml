<title level="a">MEETING OF THE LOCAL FEDERATION OF BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT SCHOOLS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was opened by the president, Mr. Tichava. [Translator's note: I have noticed that the minutes of this local organization never specify where its meetings are held.] All of the delegates and officers of the Federation were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved without changes. The minutes of the meeting of the executive committee of the Federation were also approved. The minutes of that committee revealed that Mr. Vaclav Vales was appointed treasurer of the fund of the executive committee upon furnishing a bond of $500.</p>
   <p>A letter was read from the patronat (managing board) of the school of the Ceskoslovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), located in the Town of Lake, Chicago. In this letter the patronat enclosed <pb facs="5418478_4_0382.jpg" n="2"/>a [check] for $126 as its school tax for the past [school] year.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Krafcik submitted a report on the preliminary work of the festival committees of the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Country Festival) which the Federation will hold on September 17, 1922. [Translator's note: obviously the meeting of the local Federation was held before that date, the report of the meeting not reaching the newspaper office until after the festival.]</p>
   <p>Mrs. Racek reported on the printing of new textbooks. The estimated cost of printing these was twice as high as the last time the books were printed. These estimates were given to Mrs. Racek by the Narodni Tiskarna (National Printing House) and by the Svornost, a Bohemian daily. It was decided that all textbooks should be either simplified or purchased [sic]. Mrs. Schejbal recommended that they be simplified and made more uniform. The executive committee, after conferring with the faculty, will take care of this matter.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Soucek delivered a check for $50 as a gift of the sixth convention of the <pb facs="5418478_4_0383.jpg" n="3"/>Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) to the Federation. It was decided to send them a letter of thanks.</p>
   <p>The report of the F. B. Zdrubek Bohemian Free Thought School was then read. The annual festival, in honor of the death of our great Bohemian freethinker was held at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery). The speaker on this occasion touched upon the Free Thought school system, and among other things, maintained that the instruction given in these schools is far from liberal. How often was the fact advertised that once a week our schools are giving instructions in the [principles of Free Thought]. The idea of teaching the Free Thought ideals comes up for discussion in almost every meeting of the Federation, and attempts are made to attain the best possible results in that direction. The teachers are required to explain natural phenomena and natural forces to their school children, and thus help in overthrowing the religious superstitions of and sharpening the wits of these children. The teachers, [on the other hand], are unable to discuss the difficult <pb facs="5418478_4_0384.jpg" n="4"/>aspects of the Free Thought principles with their school children on all occasions and at every opportunity; a child's brain is hardly able to absorb such [difficult] questions. Mr. Jelinek requested all delegates to inform their lodges, societies, etc., on every possible occasion that the instructions given in [our] schools is [based] on the Free Thought principle. He also asked them to visit these schools, observe the kind of instruction that goes on in them, and thus prevent the kind of statements that are being made about the school system, statements which are apt to hurt the interest of the system. The delegates of the [various]....schools reported that the school attendance is the same now as it was during the past school year, but that they expect an increase. The Federation [continues] to make appeals to the parents of children to send them to Bohemian schools, and, considering the low tuition fees, this practice is going to prove advantageous in many ways for everybody, since the children will learn to read and write Bohemian correctly. "Ceske dite patri do Ceske skoly" (a Bohemian child belongs to a Bohemian school). [Translator's note: I have intentionally used both the original and the <pb facs="5418478_4_0385.jpg" n="5"/>translation of this famous slogan which was first used in the Sudeten districts of Czechoslovakia before and after that country gained its autonomy. Its aim was to prevent the ever-present danger of Germanization of the children of Czech parents. In writing the history of the Chicago Czechs, the full knowledge of the origin and use of this slogan might prove serviceable.] The knowledge of Bohemian should surely be found useful to every Bohemian-American.</p>
   <p>It was further decided that the size of the periodical Svobodna Skola (Free Thought School) be increased by four more pages, and that the addresses of the officers of the various school managements be included in that publication.</p>
   <p>Josef Tichava, president,</p>
   <p>Karel Soukup, secretary.</p>
