   <p>The thirty-second anniversary of the January Insurrection [Rising of the Poles against Russia in 1863] was commemorated by a special exercise at the beautiful and spacious Kaiser Hall, Sunday, January 20, at 4 P. M. Over 1500 patriots jammed the hall to participate in the exercises.</p>
   <p>Credit for such a large turnout must be given to the Polish societies of Bridgeport, because harmony reigns throughout all of them. Besides the two Polish national societies, all the church and military groups were represented. The sight of the various societies, Ulans, Cracovites, etc., along the sides of the entire hall, brought memories of Poland, a Poland that once was free, to all those present. The national decorations, flags, native costumes, and military uniforms completed the picture of a Poland of long ago.</p>
   <p>Dr. [?] Weintraub opened the occasion with a few choice words, and pointed out that the aim of the celebration was not only the commemoration of great <pb facs="5423968_9_0841.jpg" n="2"/>events in Polish history but the revival of the Polish spirit in all Polish hearts. He called upon Max Wojtalewicz to act as chairman; Theodore J. Wikaryasz was appointed recording secretary.</p>
   <p>After the introduction of these personages, who were greeted with applause, Mr. Wojtalewicz gave a short address appropriate to the occasion.</p>
