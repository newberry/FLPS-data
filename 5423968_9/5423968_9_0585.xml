   <p>The Polish Group made a splendid showing in yesterday's Fourth of July parade which proved a success, in spite of the unusual heat which was 102. Groups gathered at the appointed locations on time. People arrived by elevated trains, street cars, automobiles, and many on foot, in order to participate in the Independence Day Parade.</p>
   <p>There was, however, no confusion, thanks to the capable management of the committee of the parade.</p>
   <p>Michigan Ave. and 26th St., was the busiest location. The parade started at 39th Street and Michigan Ave., shortly after 10:00 A.M. At 11:30 A.M. the parade reached the reviewing stand, where important personages were present.</p>
   <p>The parade represented all nationalities, arranged in alphabetical order. The first group consisted of Bohemian units, headed by Bohemian Falcons and a float representing the history of the Bohemian kingdom.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0586.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Next in order were the English, Irish and Scotch divisions; which, too, had beautiful floats. Next in order were the Croats who were headed by Croat Falcons, and a float. The Germans were represented by several societies which also displayed a float.</p>
   <p>Other nationalities followed in order. The Poles, however, made the most excellent showing. The Polish division was composed of many groups, one of which consisted of Polish Falcons, including women who were dressed in uniforms. They made a very good impression and the public showered them with flowers. Another group represented Polish Kosynierzy or peasant soldiers bearing scythes. Still another of the Polish units represented a regiment of Polish cavalry which looked very impressive.</p>
   <p>There was also a beautiful Polish float representing three groups: (1) The American group, portraying George Washington, Pulaski and Kosciuszko; (2) Spirit of the Nation which was represented by Miss Jadwica Rybarczyk; (3) Polonia or queen of Poland who was impersonated by Mrs. Anna Jozwiakowska.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0587.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The queen was attended by many court ladies. The Polish float was very beautiful and it called forth great admiration. About 800 Poles participated in this parade. The Polish parade committee was headed by Mr. J. F. Smulski.</p>
