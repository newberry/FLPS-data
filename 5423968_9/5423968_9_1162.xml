   <p>It is evident that not only does the spirit of patriotism live within our people, but that enthusiasm for the Catholic faith has not waned. Proof of this lies in yesterday's celebration of the patron saints day in St. Hedwig's Parish. In spite of it being a weekday, the church was unexpectedly crowded both in the morning and evening; the piousness and reverence expressed in most of the faces was inspiring. It can easily be seen that the priest of that parish watch zealously over the souls entrusted to their care.</p>
   <p>The celebration was a beautiful one. Mass was said by the Reverend S. Kobrzynski, assisted by Fathers B. Pawlowski, and Malkowski, as deacon and subdeacon respectively (both of St. Adalbert's Parish).</p>
   <p>The Reverend A. Nowilki of South Chicago delivered a very beautiful sermon. He spoke of the virtues by which each saint distinguished himself, and of St. Hedwig's special virtues.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1163.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A procession and the consecration of the Holy Sacrament were held in the evening. The Reverend F. Matuszewski delivered the sermon. His subject was how we are to follow the examples set by our forefathers, especially our saints.</p>
   <p>Music by the parish choir and the participation of the girls' societies and colorfully uniformed military societies helped to make the day a success.</p>
   <p>In addition to the afore-mentioned priest, the Reverends F. Lange, of St. Josephat's; S. Radziejewski, of Poznan; Kozlowski, Nawrocki, L. Magozicki, V. Barzynski, and J. Gieburowski, were also present.</p>
