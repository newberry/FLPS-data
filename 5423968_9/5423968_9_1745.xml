  <body>
   <p>Our national strength depends solely upon two elements which are firmly united with themselves. The essential principles are our holy Roman-Catholic faith and our Polish national impulse. These constituents must be practical as well as theoretical, and make the road to destruction impossible.</p>
   <p>Our national strength depends entirely upon practical Catholics and practical patriots. We cannot call those people practical Catholics who were christened and wedded in Catholic churches, but disregard the church and God's commandments. We cannot call those people practical Catholics who are Catholics in name only and disbelievers in their heart and soul.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1746.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We cannot call those people practical Polish patriots who continually speak English among Poles; those who instead of joining Polish organizations enlist in other international organizations, and instead of attending services in the Polish Roman-Catholic churches, attend other national churches, also those who send their children to public schools instead of to Polish Catholic schools, where they would be taught the Polish language and receive religious training.</p>
