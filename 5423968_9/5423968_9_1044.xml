  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held yesterday at 4 P. M. at the school hall of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish relative to the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America, which will take place on October 20 and in which all Polish Catholic societies will take part. The chairman of the meeting was Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer, who recently returned from a visit to Texas; Mr. Frank Fuhl acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>The plans presented were agreed upon and the following Polish Catholic societies promised to participate:</p>
   <p>From St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish: St. Stanislaus Kostka Society, Holy Trinity Society, Sacred Heart of Jesus Society, Holy Cross Society, St. Joseph Society, St. Casimir Young Men's Society, St. Michael Archangel Society, St. Hedwig Society, St. Peter and Paul Society, St. Adalbert B. and M. (Bishop and Martyr) Society, St. Stanislaus B. and M. Society, John III Sobieski Society, <pb facs="5423968_9_1045.jpg" n="2"/>St. Francis Society, St. Valentine Society, St. Hyacinth Society, Holy Name of Mary Society, St. Barbara Society, Sacred Heart of Jesus Society No. 1, St. Stephen Society, St. Joseph Society No. 1, Casimir The Great Society, St. Anthony Society, St. Joseph Society No. 2, King Jagello Society, and Prince Joseph Poniatowski Society.</p>
   <p>From St. Josaphat Parish: Sacred Heart of Jesus Society.</p>
   <p>From St. Hedwig Parish: St. Hedwig Society, Blessed Virgin of the Holy Scapular Society, St. Joseph Society, Holy Cross Society, and Sacred Heart of Jesus Society.</p>
   <p>Thirty-four societies were represented at this meeting. It is said, however, that more societies will participate....</p>
   <p>The marshal of the Polish division of societies will be none other than Mr. Kiolbassa, who will be assisted by Jedrzejek, Arkuszewski, and Paszkiewicz. If the necessity should arise, others will be appointed. Every society may <pb facs="5423968_9_1046.jpg" n="3"/>have its own mounted marshal, who will fall in line with the Chief Marshal's staff.</p>
   <p>The order of march will be as follows: Cadets, Knights, members of military societies in full regalia. Members wearing caps [same as the ones worn by Kosciusko's soldiers], and other groups. Those having caps designed for the occasion may march together with members of societies wearing them. All those who are to participate in the celebration are requested to wear badges, which may be obtained from F. Kaczmarek, 668 Noble Street, and should be ordered as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Societies from the Northeast Side are to meet on October 20, at 8 A. M., at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, along Noble Street. Everyone, regardless of whether he belongs to a society or not, is invited to participate.</p>
   <p>The Polish societies belonging to the Catholic Division will meet at Lake Street with the right wing, which will gather at Dearborn and South Water Streets. This Polish division will number at least eight thousand members.</p>
