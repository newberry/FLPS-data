   <p>A program commemorating the January Insurrection [of 1863] was given by the local branch of the Polish League on Sunday evening at the new Polish Hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. Despite the severity of the cold weather, a large crowd, including many young people, attended the event. Just before 8 P.M., Leon Szopinski, president of the branch of the Polish League in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, officially opened the exercise. He called upon Julius Szczepanski to act as chairman; Vincent Jozwiakowski was chosen recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The Young Ladies Choir sang "Wiazanki Styczniowe" (January Garlands) as the opening number on the program. B. Klarkowski followed with a declamation entitled "A Short Historical Sketch of the January Insurrection and the Systematic Co-operation of the People." Mr. Klarkowski said that the rising of 1863 was an unavoidable occurrence and described its course in review. He tied up all this with the importance of systematic national work among our people here, especially among the young people. As he touched upon the conditions prevailing among us, <pb facs="5423968_9_0832.jpg" n="2"/>he showed how a Polish paper, under the guise of Catholicism, could harmfully influence the young readers, whereas a paper of sound honest principles could not only enlighten our youth but also broaden their cultural horizon.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecilia Men's Choir gave a truly magical touch to "Polska Krasna" (Beautiful Poland). This was followed by a declamation by young Miss M. Bardonska, entitled "Rok 1794" (The Year 1794).</p>
   <p>John Nering [also Nehring] addressed the young people, pointing out the pursuits they are to follow in order to bring honor to their people and to the fatherland. He emphasized the fact that the younger generation should follow the principles of our fathers, in order to safeguard their mother tongue and work energetically.</p>
   <p>After a rendition of "Z Powstania Styczniowego" (From the January Insurrection) by the St. Cecilia Choir, Mr. Jozwiakowski, with his customary warmth and heartfelt sincerity, recited the poem "Pobudka Do Mlodziezy" (Inspiration for Youth).</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0833.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When the applause ended, Andrew Stachowicz sang a solo, "Wspomnienie" (Remembrance).</p>
   <p>Drills directed in Polish and English were executed by St. Stanislaus Kostka Cadets.</p>
   <p>An unexpected treat was given the audience when Ursula, the small daughter of Mr. and Mrs. B. Klarkowski, recited "Sto Lat Niewoli' (One Hundred Years of Bondage). She did it so charmingly that the public applauded until young Ursula returned on the stage and by request sang in her silvery voice "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" (Poland Is Not Yet Lost), the Polish national anthem.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecilia Woman's Choir sang "Wiazanki" (Garlands). This was followed by a declamation by W. Gorecki, teacher, entitled "Modlitwa" (Prayer). The St. Cecilia Men's Choir gave an excellent rendition of "Wisla" (Vistula).</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski was the last speaker of the evening. The theme of his <pb facs="5423968_9_0834.jpg" n="4"/>talk was unity and co-operation among the Poles during this year of national mourning. He said that without this nothing definite could be attained. The pastor said that whenever there was no harmony among the Polish people a split occurred which wrought irreparable damage. Faith in the true God was abandoned and new gods were created, new moral principles adopted, and various ideals introduced. Reverend Barzynski asserted that it might take many years before unity and harmony could be attained among Poles and that this would not be accomplished without work, continuous work.</p>
   <p>The program was closed with a national air, "Buze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>This morning at 8 A.M. requiem services were held for the souls of all those who lost their lives for Poland. Evening services will also be held at 7:30 P.M.</p>
