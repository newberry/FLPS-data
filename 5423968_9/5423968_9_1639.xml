   <p>In reply to Senator Heflin, the apostle of the discredited Ku Kluxism, the editor of the Birmingham News asks why the promoters of the Confederacy did not recognize a Catholic danger. We quote:</p>
   <p>"Why is it that Jefferson Davis did not discover this danger? Why was he so indifferent to Alabama's and America's liberties that he appointed in his cabinet not only Judah Phillip Benjamin, the Jew, but Stephen Mallord, the Roman Catholic?</p>
   <p>"If Roman Catholic citizens may not be trusted, why was it that President Davis, commissioned Beauregard, a Catholic, to be lieutenant general in the Confederate Army, and Raphael Semmes to be admiral to the Confederate Navy.</p>
   <p>"Why did Mr. Davis commission Judge Mann, a Roman Catholic, to represent the Confederacy in Europe?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1640.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Does Mr. Heflin forget that it was a Catholic, James Ryder Randall, of Maryland, who wrote the Confederacy's battle song "Maryland, My Maryland"?</p>
   <p>"Does he forget that "The Sword of Lee" and "The Conquered Banner" were written by Father Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest, appointed chaplain in the Confederate Army?</p>
   <p>"What has this defamer of Roman Catholics done for Alabama, for the South, for America, that is comparable to the patriotic work done by Roman Catholics like James Ryder, General Beauregard, or Stephen J. Mallord, to say nothing of Roger B. Taney, and Edward Douglas White, two Roman Catholics whose images now stand at the altar of justice in the nation's court of Last resort?"</p>
