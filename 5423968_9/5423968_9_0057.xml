<title level="a">FIRST DONATIONS FOR POLISH NATIONAL FUND</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>It will be impossible to acknowledge in the newspaper all the penny donations which will be sent to the Polish National Fund, for thousands of persons will be sending donations.</p>
   <p>To prove that the public is already interested in this institution (before the Polish League had been incorporated and before its officials had been sworn in and began to function), which will undoubtedly grow very rapidly, we are publishing a list of the persons who called on the secretary of the League yesterday.</p>
   <p>The following men paid their penny tax (12 cents a year) to the Polish National Fund: Roman Meclewski, John Brandziulewski, John Koronkiewicz, Casimir Dorszynski, Thomas Nalepinski, Francis Romanowski, and Joseph Sztermer. Michael Osuch paid three cents for three months.</p>
   <p>The following women paid their yearly (12 cents) tax: Mrs. Mary Brandziulewski, <pb facs="5423968_9_0058.jpg" n="2"/>Michaeline Dorszynski, Dorothy Nalepinski, and Frances Koronkiewicz. Mary Osuch paid three cents for three months.</p>
   <p>The following children, under 12 years of age, paid three cents each: Francis Osuch, Hewig Osuch, Vincent Osuch and Casimir Osuch. Mrs. L. Szwajkart paid her twelve cents to the Polish National Fund and forty eight cents to the treasury of the League.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Fund (not including the money which was deposited yesterday and the day before but including $1.12 sent by Michon) amounts at present to two dollars and sixty two cents.</p>
