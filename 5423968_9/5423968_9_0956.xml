   <p>The moment is approaching when the Poles should honor publicly one of the greatest Polish heroes, a chieftain in peasant smock frock--Thaddeus Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>The hero of two worlds, Thaddeus Kosciusko, has shown us by deeds how we should work for our motherland, how we should sacrifice ourselves for her, how we should love her, Therefore, his memory should unite all sons of Poland, and we can honor him best by celebrating Kosciusko Day in one of the large halls in Chicago on the third day of the Polish mass meeting which will fall on May 3, 1894. It should be a magnificent celebration worthy of the memory of a great chieftain, and it should be observed as a second Polish Day.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we Poles should unite and, by combined efforts, honor the great <pb facs="5423968_9_0957.jpg" n="2"/>Polish hero unanimously and harmoniously, thus showing Americans that we have our Washington and know how to honor him.</p>
   <p>But if we desire to make such a celebration successful, we must work and make proper preparations.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we are inviting representatives of the committees in charge of the celebration, representatives of societies, organizations, and the clergy from Chicago and vicinity to our meeting, which will be held at Pulaski hall on Wednesday, March 21, at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>The order of business will be as follows: (1) All societies and organizations participating in the celebration will be registered; (2) The hall will be chosen; (3) Suggestions will be discussed; and (4) The celebration committee which will be in charge of the Kosciusko celebration will be chosen.</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that our people need no persuasion when patriotic celebrations or the honoring of the great Kosciusko are concerned, and that every <pb facs="5423968_9_0958.jpg" n="3"/>Polish organization and every Polish patriot will do their duty.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the program for the Polish mass meeting and the Kosciusko celebration is composed of M. A. La Buy, J. Napieralski, Andrew Schultz, F. Bieszka, and S. Zahajkiewicz.</p>
