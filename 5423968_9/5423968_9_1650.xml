<title level="a">ALL SAINTS PARISH BUILDING A CATHEDRAL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>At the last parish meeting presided over by Mr. F. Nowak, it was unanimously agreed to build a church according to the plans designed by architect Steinbach, and recommended by the building committee.</p>
   <p>It will be a beautiful cathedral in gothic style with two towers thirty-five feet high.</p>
   <p>The front of the church and windows will be finished in terracotta, a beautiful in imitation of marble. The structure will have a form of a cross. The main section will be 54 feet high.</p>
   <p>We chose the terracotta for the front of the front of the church because it is a durable material and because of its smooth surface it looks clean. From time to time it can be washed and the church will look like new.</p>
   <p>The interior of the church will also be decorated with colored terracotta. This material is very practical for decorations because it keeps in its <pb facs="5423968_9_1651.jpg" n="2"/>original state for a long time.</p>
   <p>The ceiling will also be finished in a gothic style. The great pointed arches will meet at four points right over the windows, forming a beautiful gothic ceiling directly over the center of the cross.</p>
   <p>The front of the church will be finished in a rich style. Artistic niches, richly carved columns and pointed towers will form a beautiful and artistic structure.</p>
   <p>A beautifully carved facade will protrude over the front steps of the church. The ceiling of the facade will be constructed of blue terracotta and ornamented with gold stars.</p>
   <p>The tall pillars of the church will be inlaid with terracotta from 7 to 8 feet from the floor.</p>
   <p>The towers will be decorated with gilded and colored terracotta. The bells <pb facs="5423968_9_1652.jpg" n="3"/>will be installed in the tower and operated by electricity. In other words, it will be a magnificent church in a gothic style and a most modern structure.</p>
   <p>At the parish meeting before that decision, Bishop Grochowski called the attention of the members to the fact that a beautiful church is a very costly proposition and that no one is forcing the parishioners to build a costly temple.</p>
   <p>But the parishioners, like one man, demanded this imposing temple and our parishioners are like a brave army. Our resolutions are not only on paper, they will be carried through.</p>
   <p>We have already gathered a nice capital but it is not enough. Next year we intend to collect about $50,000. Can we do it? Why not? As soon as we start to build the donations will come. We are a great and generous army. Our parishioners will prove that we are a great and God loving family. Some people gave even their lives for God and the country, and we can share some of our hard earned money for the great work of God.</p>
