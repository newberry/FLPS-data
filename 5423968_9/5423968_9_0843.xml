   <p>In commemoration of the thirty-second anniversary of the January Insurrection [rising of Poles against Russia in 1863] and the one hundredth anniversary of the Third Partition of Poland exercises were held at the Holy Trinity Parish Hall yesterday. The hall was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened by Mr. [?] Terczewski. Michael Majewski was called upon to preside, while major M. Michalski was his assistant; Mr. Zloczewski was made recording secretary (sic).</p>
   <p>The first patriotic address was given by F. H. Jablonski. Addresses by Reverend Casimir Sztucko and A. Majewski followed. All speakers were well received by the audience.</p>
   <p>Declamations were rendered by Mesdames Zolkowska and Topor and Misses B. Ciesielska and C. Matelska. Solos were sung by Mr. [?] Gatkowski, G. Wojnicki, A. Mallek, <pb facs="5423968_9_0844.jpg" n="2"/>and the Chopin and Wanda Choirs entertained with a number of songs. Solos with piano accompaniment were given by Misses J. Mikitynska and [?] Majewska. The students of the Holy Trinity School recited the poem "Resurrection of Poland," which was especially prepared for the occasion by I. Machnikowski.</p>
   <p>A living picture, the "Martyrdom of Poland," concluded the exercises.</p>
