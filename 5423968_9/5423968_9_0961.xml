<title level="a">POLES CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY OF INSURRECTION OF 1863</title></bibl>

   <p>Day before yesterday, the societies belonging to the Polish National Alliance celebrated the thirty-first anniversary of the Polish Insurrection of January 1863 at the Polish Hall, located on Emma Street.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened by Mr. S. Terczewski, who called upon Mr. M. Osucha and Mr. J. Olbinski to act as master of ceremonies and secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>The program started with two musical selections--"Soldier Song of 1863," by the Szopen Singing Society, and a piano solo, by Mrs. Lande.</p>
   <p>The first speech was delivered by Dr. Midowicz, who pointed out that in spite of the thirty-one years that had elapsed since the Insurrection, the memory of this event, written in blood in our history, still lingers vividly with us. "Our zeal did not cool off; neither was the hand of our oppressor any lighter," said the speaker. "In spite of these oppressions, we have been getting stronger and stronger. May the next year, the year of the anniversary of Kosciusko, <pb facs="5423968_9_0962.jpg" n="2"/>change the present cry of 'Poland is not yet lost!' to 'Long live Poland, free and independent!'"</p>
   <p>Dr. Janczewski's two violin solos, accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Lange, as well as the recitations by Miss Sniegocki and Mr. W. T. Tobinski, were received with hearty applause.</p>
   <p>The second speech, delivered by Mr. Broel, was in the nature of a historical sketch, in which the speaker gave a detailed description of the main events in the Insurrection.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with "March Over The [River] Bug," sung by the Szopen Singing Society. This was followed with a collection for charitable purposes.</p>
