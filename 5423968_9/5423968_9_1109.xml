   <p>(Tuesday, May 5, 1891. The third day)</p>
   <p>According to the program, May 5 is the most important day of the Polish National Hundredth Anniversary Celebration, and it was so in many respects.</p>
   <p>At 8 A.M. delegates from all over the country gathered at the school hall, and their names were registered together with the names of the clergy.</p>
   <p>At 10 A.M. a solemn Pontifical religious service was celebrated at the church.</p>
   <p>At 9:45 A.M. the uniformed Knights of the church societies and all delegates went to meet Right Reverend Feehan, the Archbishop of Chicago, and a few minutes after 10 A.M., the procession escorted the Archbishop into the <pb facs="5423968_9_1110.jpg" n="2"/>church, which already was filled with people. The procession consisted of uniformed knights and school girls dressed in white, after whom strode the ecclesiastical dignitary, the Archbishop, escorted by sixteen clergymen. The delegates followed the clergy. The Archbishop occupied the throne prepared for him, and Reverend Simon Kobrzynski, assisted by the clergy, celebrated a Pontifical Mass. The knights kept honorary guard.</p>
   <p>Reverend Snicurski delivered a patriotic sermon, in which he encouraged concord and brotherly love. His sermon impressed the participants so profoundly that some of them wept at the end.</p>
   <p>Credit is due to Mr. A. Kwasifroch, the organist, who trained and prepared church choirs for the occasion. The choirs accompanied by a good orchestra, sang at the Pontifical Mass melodies composed by Reissinger. Deserving <pb facs="5423968_9_1111.jpg" n="3"/>special attention is "Ave Maria," which was sung at Offertorium Tercet by Mrs. Pauline Kiolbassa with great success. Miss Rose Kiolbassa sang alto, also with great success.</p>
   <p>Afternoon</p>
   <p>At 2 P.M. the delegates and clergy gathered at the Polish hall for the purpose of holding a strictly national conference, at which the clergy did not take any part other than as observers and advisors. Mr. John Koziczynski was chosen chairman of the meeting and Reverend Barzynski was asked to be a spiritual advisor.</p>
   <p>Three important issued were taken up at this meeting, namely: (1) Proper understanding of the Constitution of the Third of May, (2) Creating of national and political unanimity and solidarity among Poles in the United States, (3) Eradication of the discord that checks the enlightenment of the Polish people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1112.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As we cannot describe this conference in detail, we will outline only the important points.</p>
   <p>The delegates decided that, according to the constitution of the Third of May, the Poles in the United States are and should remain Roman-Catholics. However, the word "dominating" employed in the Polish constitution was not adopted because there is no dominating religion in the United States.</p>
   <p>As to the second issue, it was decided to hold a general convention of all American Poles, or contact all Polish societies, or seek the cooperation of other organizations, provided that the Roman Catholic Religion will not be attacked. A committee of seven men were chosen who will take charge of this issue.</p>
   <p>As to the third issue, the delegates agreed that all slanders should be considered a crime against the country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1113.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The delegates decided that religion should not be taken up at controversies and whoever attacks it in journals and newspapers should be branded an apostate, and such periodical should not be supported.</p>
   <p>The same delegates declared that disrespectful expressions about the clergy, and especially slander, cannot be reconciled with religion and should also be considered a national crime, a treason against the fatherland.</p>
   <p>The delegates also stated that those who send their children to non-sectarian schools, depriving them thereby of the principles taught by the Holy Roman-Catholic Church, and also those who do not try to teach their children the native tongue, violate their national honor.</p>
   <p>Finally the delegates expressed their sorrow on account of lack of patriotism at Polish societies and asked the clergy for cooperation in their respective parishes. Every pastor should instruct his parishioners how to fulfill this important duty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1114.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>IN THE EVENING</p>
   <p>Tuesday night the hall was so filled that many persons were turned away. The attendance was great because the program included two attractions. It read that Reverend E. Kozlowski, a pastor of a Polish parish at Manistee, Mich., one of the greatest orators in America, would speak. The other attraction was the famous play "Jasnogora" or "The Siege of Czestochowa."</p>
   <p>The program must have been very interesting, for this large audience of approximately five thousand people behaved as if there had been only a few persons throughout the entire program. The subject of Reverend Kozlowski's message was "Our Holy Patriotic Duty." He moved the hearts of the listeners with his masterly dissertation, which was frequently interrupted by applause. Whoever heard this speech, will never forget it.</p>
   <p>As to the play "The Siege of Czestochowa," it is said that a play so successful was never staged in Chicago. The leading role, that of Father August <pb facs="5423968_9_1115.jpg" n="7"/>Kordecki," was played by Mr. B. Klarkowski, who was greatly complimented by the critics. The author of the play took the role of the "Haughty Nobleman," and played it admirably. Other roles were in good hands. The play was well written and well played; it was a great success. We are not in a position to give a description of its six acts. We regret that we cannot give all details of this great patriotic celebration. We wish to add that we were honored by many prominent persons among them two church dignitaries and many clergymen from all over the country.</p>
