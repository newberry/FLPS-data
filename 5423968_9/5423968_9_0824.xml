   <p>A patriotic meeting, under the auspices of the St. Casimir Young Men's Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish and the Polish League, was held yesterday in hall number one of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School building. The gathering was dedicated to the present year of national mourning, commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland.</p>
   <p>A large crowd gathered, the younger generation being especially well represented. Admission was free.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, opened the meeting with a speech in which he paid tribute to the Polish League for its noble work. He urged everyone to support its every effort.</p>
   <p>A lecture on "Poland and Her Civilization" was delivered by H. Nagiel.</p>
