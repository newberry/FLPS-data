   <p>A third in a series of patriotic manifestations, commemorating the one hundreth anniversary of the third partition of Poland, was staged in the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish school building yesterday. The program was arranged by the Polish League.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened by Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, who called upon Henry Nagiel to make the initial speech. Mr. Nagiel spoke about the need for patriotic work and the development of education. In conclusion the speaker urged everyone to support the library movement of the Educational Department [of the Polish League].</p>
   <p>After the declamation rendered by Miss Murkowska, Mr. Zahajkiewicz delivered an address on Kosciusko. The highlights of the life of this great Polish hero, especially during 1794, were clearly presented. The sacrifices, the <pb facs="5423968_9_0808.jpg" n="2"/>love for his country and the desire for its freedom, and the heroic feats of this immortal hero were also emphasized. Mr. Zahajkiewicz concluded his lecture by urging the Polish youth to emulate the deeds of Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>This was followed by songs of the school boys' choir; other national songs were rendered by the parish quartet.</p>
   <p>Miss Sophia Szwajkart recited a beautiful Polish poem, "Polka" [Polish Woman]. After a declamation by the Misses Barwig, Vincent Jozwiakowski recited with great feeling the "Battle of Ballawica", a poem by the Polish poet Lenartowicz. At this point of the program the parish quartet presented its final number.</p>
   <p>The program was closed by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, who emphasized the importance of these patriotic gatherings <pb facs="5423968_9_0809.jpg" n="3"/>and also their benefits. He urged the audience to continue its work for the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>The entire program was well received by the audience, which included a large number of Polish young ladies and women.</p>
