   <p>Some people say that the only time we gather in a crowd is when a ball or a dramatic play lures us. This certainly would be a fine demonstration of patriotism.</p>
   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization believes the contrary. This organization does not plan any balls nor theatricals. After all, we are not children who need be tempted with sugar and spice! Every Pole in Chicago is going to attend the ceremony commemorating the founding of the Polish Constitution and to show that he is a true patriot. By being present, the Poles will show that they revere the memory of their forefathers, that they respect the blood spilled by their fathers, that they have come to pay homage to an unforgotten national cause.</p>
   <p>Those who in spite of being Poles will not attend this inspiring patriotic <pb facs="5423968_9_0297.jpg" n="2"/>ceremony have not that national feeling so prevalent among true Poles, nor do they possess the spirit of patriotism.</p>
   <p>Sunday, May 8, the Polish Patriotic Organization will complete preparations for a Third of May celebration, which will start at 7 P. M. We trust that the freedom-loving Polish people will fill to capacity the school hall at Bradley and Noble Streets. Prior to the ceremonies, several Orders of Polish Knights will put on a demonstration and march through several of the main streets in the neighborhood. After the parade, they will march to the school hall. To make this celebration a great occasion, to be treasured in the pages of the history of a worthy cause, the proceeds of the affair will be added to the fund of the Polish-Russian Catholics. Admission will be twenty-five cents for adults and fifteen cents for children.</p>
   <p>The program will be as follows:</p>
