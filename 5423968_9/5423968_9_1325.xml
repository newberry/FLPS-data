   <p>Yesterday at Turnhall Hall, located on the north side of our city, the yearly convention of United Societies was held. At the hall were congregated 594 delegates representing 629 societies, where the reports of these different societies and their statutes were read, and the election of new executives held.</p>
   <p>From the organization report we extract the following items: Since the time the charter was issued, 88 societies joined this organization with 23,174 members, of this number 27 groups were Polish with 11,033 members, 14 German groups with 1,035 members, 30 Slavic groups with 8,282 members and 11 Italian groups with 2,650 members.</p>
   <p>At the present time the organization has 629 groups; 135 Polish groups, 80 German groups, 173 Slavic groups, 83 Italian groups, 7 Danish groups, 2 Norwegian and Belgian groups and 16 groups of mixed nationalities.</p>

   <p>The convention was a quiet and gorgeous affair, and the executives wished that these Societies might be as prosperous in the future as they have been in the past.</p>
