<title level="a">HOW SHOULD THE POLES OF CHICAGO CELEBRATE THE ONE-HUNDRED-FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF KOSCIUSKO</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In yesterday's paper, we carried a reprint of an article from the Baltimore Polonia, reminding us that February 15 is the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the hero of two worlds--Kosciusko--and explaining why we should celebrate this occasion.</p>
   <p>Yesterday we promised to answer the following question: "How shall we in Chicago celebrate this anniversary?" We present the following suggestions: We are of the opinion that despite our inexcusable forgetfulness of so important a jubilee, and despite the fact that it was brought to our attention so late, there is still plenty of time to consider ways and means of honoring our Commander.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0732.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We still have two-and-one-half weeks before us.</p>
   <p>What could not be accomplished in these eighteen or nineteen days if we applied our energies, enthusiasm, and a little self-sacrifice? So, we repeat, we cannot fold our arms and think only of how much trouble it would be; but, we must work so that the Poles need not be ashamed of their efforts! We therefore propose the following: The one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the birth of our hero will be commemorated on February 12. Let us make it a public holiday; this will be quite easy to do, because on this same day, the anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln will also be celebrated.</p>
   <p>Let us honor the birth of our hero, Kosciusko, with a parade, which would include members of various societies from all parts of Chicago, culminating in a great public celebration in one of the halls in downtown Chicago. The expenses, probably totaling not more than a few hundred dollars, would be divided among the various communities and societies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0733.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Tomorrow, Sunday, in view of the fact that several January Insurrection celebrations are being held in various halls, should be a good time to talk over this matter and to select delegates to the large mass meeting which will be hold some day next week. This mass meeting could be called by any of our organizations or parishes. The first organization to raise its voice in our paper was the St. Casimiris Society Of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish; let it, therefore, take the initiative in calling this meeting. The rest will follow in order as usual. The parade should really be grand.</p>
   <p>But, this should not be sufficient to honor this day. We should, according to our way of thinking, do something more, and that is to collect enough contributions on this day to build a monument to Kosciusko in Chicago. This would not only be possible, but also easy to accomplish. We have already collected about seven thousand dollars for this monument and we need a total sum of fifteen thousand dollars. Let us say that there are 150,000 Poles in <pb facs="5423968_9_0734.jpg" n="4"/>Chicago. This is conceded by everybody. If, on this memorable day, only two thirds of this number of Poles--men, women and children--contribute even five or ten cents each to this Kosciusko monument fund, whether they do so in the halls where the celebrations will be held, or whether they send their contributions directly to the monument committee to the editorial offices of various Polish newspapers, or to the treasurers of the Polish organizations, then a sum between five and ten thousand dollars will be realized. We suggest that five cents rather than ten cents be contributed.</p>
   <p>Would there really be anybody so poor or so miserly who could not afford to contribute such a small coin on this memorable day--a new "Polish Day"--for all America?</p>
   <p>There would still be three thousand dollars needed, but this would probably be donated by our wealthier Poles or by our countrymen in other cities.</p>
   <p>Once again we remind you that now is the time to act.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0735.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We are presenting this suggestion to all Poles for consideration, if, indeed, they wish to build this Kosciusko monument. We are convinced that this idea is sound.</p>
