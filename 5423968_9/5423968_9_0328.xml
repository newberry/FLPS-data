  <body>
   <p>Polish songs were heard last night at the Palmer House, one of the finest hotels of our city, during the banquet given by the Polish Allied Singers of America. The banquet was to celebrate a contest sponsored by the Allied Singers on the best composition of a cantata to be sung at the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the Polish Constitution of the Third of May.</p>
   <p>Twenty compositions were submitted from many parts of America and Europe. The prize for the best composition was one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>The following choir leaders, were selected as the judges of the contest: Hans Balatka, J. Frereka, N. Leduchowski, A. Seebaum, and Anthony Mallka. The judges selected the cantata "Tam Na Wschodzie Gwiazda Swieci" (In the East Shines a Star), which was composed by Mr. Titus Ernest, of Utica, N. Y.</p>
   <p>About one hundred persons participated in the banquet, among them prominent Poles of Chicago. The banquet was held in the hotel's banquet hall, which <pb facs="5423968_9_0329.jpg" n="2"/>was beautifully decorated for the occasion. The Polish Singers Alliance of America, the Chopin's Quartette of Chicago, and the Harmony's Quartette of Milwaukee thrilled the guests with their songs.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. Mallek, president of the Polish Singers Alliance of America, delivered a short address. He was followed by Mr. E. I. Slupecki, who spoke about the Polish Singers Alliance in America. Other speakers were Mr. S. Nicki, who talked about Poland, and Mr. Michael Osuch, who gave a speech about America, our adopted country. Mr. E. Seebaum spoke in the name of the judges of the contest and Mr. E. Z. Brodowski about the Polish Constitution of the Third of May (1791).</p>
   <p>There were other speakers, among them Mr. Jan Smulski.</p>
   <p>The solo numbers were by Mr. Wojnicki and Mr. Slupecki, of Milwaukee.</p>
