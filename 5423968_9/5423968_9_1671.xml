   <p>Within the last year two new national parishes have been established in Chicago. These young outposts are thriving continuously, and we may be certain that before the end of this year the new parishes will be as big and important as any old one in America.</p>
   <p>What is the cause of that beautiful development?</p>
   <p>There is only one answer to this question. The members of these newly established parishes proved to be men of good will and ready to devote much for the sake of Christ and their church.</p>
   <p>Despite all the hindrances and mockery on the part of the papal disciples, our parishioners kept faith and perseveringly endeavored towards their goal. Thus God blessed their work, and in a very short time these new parishes were set up.</p>
   <p>Last year the New Poland Parish, where Rev. F. Swiatek is pastor, <pb facs="5423968_9_1672.jpg" n="2"/>practically did not possess anything. There was only a small group of Poles which, having been despised by Mundelein and his adherents, decided to bury themselves with the building of a church; and indeed, before the Christmas holidays the church was completed.</p>
   <p>Good will, perseverance and patience were the contributing factors of this achievement. Wherever Rev. Swiatek came to ask support for the establishment of the church he received generous contributions.</p>
   <p>The parish on Town of Lake, where Rev. Antoni Sobaszek is pastor, was established last summer. Poles in that neighborhood, enthused by the spirit of their neighbors in New Poland, became organized; purchased a Lutheran church and now are the owners of a beautiful church building. The people are becoming more and more acquainted with God, and every day new members join the parish.</p>
   <p>It will not be long now before again we shall hear that a new parish has <pb facs="5423968_9_1673.jpg" n="3"/>been set up on the South Side of the city. This will come true thanks to the efforts and patience of our two new outposts, which truly and Christian-like fulfill their duties.</p>
