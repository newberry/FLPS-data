   <p>Council III of the Polish National Alliance observed the fifty-fifty anniversary of the January Insurrection [1863], honoring the heroes who gave their lives for Poland. Services were held in the morning at Holy Trinity Church, where the Reverend [C.] Sztuczko is pastor.</p>
   <p>When the services were ended, Father Sztuczko spoke to those gathered in the church. In inspired words, he told them of these heroes who, believing that they could tear off the chains of slavery, rose against an inexorable enemy; they fought, believing that they could win Poland's freedom; but unfortunately, in spite of their heroic sacrifices, Poland remained in bondage. But today, the reverend speaker continued, the moment approaches when we will be avenged on our enemies, when Poland will arise again, free, independent, united, and with <pb facs="5423968_9_0431.jpg" n="2"/>an outlet to the sea. Today as before, we have heroes who have gone forth to battle to destroy the most implacable of our enemies, the Prussians. Almost all the world is behind them, for the Allies, without exception, have agreed that Poland must be free, independent, and united. Under the leadership of President Wilson, they have decided to accomplish this at any cost, knowing well that a free Poland with an outlet to the sea is necessary to create the balance of power that will make future peace possible in Europe. Our Father Sztuczko, who is an ardent and unwavering Polish patriot, said a great many other things which, due to lack of space, we must omit. We must add, however, that all honor is due to such priests as Father Sztuczko.</p>
   <p>The commemoration exercises took place in the afternoon at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall. The exercises were opened by Leon Nowak, president of Council III, who named Leon Mallek, legal advisor to the Polish National Alliance, chairman, and Mrs. W. Chodzinski secretary. He also invited the officers of organizations and the veterans of 1863 to the platform.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0432.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Chairman Mallek delivered a short address and then proceeded with the program, which was executed in the following order:</p>
   <p>1. The Holy Trinity mixed choir, under the direction of W. Baluta, sang Oginski's "Polonaise". Their efforts were rewarded with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>2. W. Poszwinski, a veteran of the Insurrection of 1863, delivered an address in which he described the January Insurrection in detail; then he spoke of present times. Among other things, he pointed out that today, during this great World War, at a time that is so critical for our country, at a time when our volunteer Polish Army is organizing and is soon to be ready to take its place in the battle of Grunwald [1410], we ought to forget our differences of opinion, our partisan or personal quarrels, and stand together as one man to help, morally or materially, to crush that barbarous enemy of ours, the Prussians; for otherwise we stand in great danger.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0433.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>3. Violin solo by P. Hojnacki, which was received with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>4. Sextet from "Lucia" [Donizetti], sung by Miss A. Kempski, soprano, Miss L. Kempski, alto, A. Ciesielski, baritone, A. Ludwik, bass, P. Stawinoga, first tenor, and M. Gaworski, second tenor. These singers deserve special mention for their fine rendition of the number. The audience's unceasing applause forced them to return for an encore.</p>
   <p>5. Judge [Edmund] Jarecki delivered an address on the January Insurrection, and on present conditions in Poland and America. He said that he was disappointed to see the public gathered in such small numbers to observe so great an occasion as the anniversary of the January Insurrection. It saddened him that, perhaps because the weather is a little cold, we neglect to pay proper respect to those who fought for Poland. It was cold then too, but they did not care, for they knew they were fighting for the freedom of their beloved Poland, for all of us. And we neglect our duty by not honoring them properly at such a manifestation as this.</p>

   <p>6. Thaddeus Kempski, well-known singer from the Filaret Choir, sang a solo, which was enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>7. Piano solo by Miss A. Wieczokowski.</p>
   <p>8. Recitation by Miss J. Lukasik.</p>
   <p>9. To conclude the program, the Holy Trinity Choir, directed by W. Baluta, sang the Polish National Hymn, "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>A collection netted $25.</p>
