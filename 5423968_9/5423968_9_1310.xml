   <p>The delegates to the Polish Women's Alliance convention began to congregate before the Kosciuszko Hall as early as 8:00 A.M. A majority of the delegates to this convention are married ladies, mothers, who have safeguarded the Polish language and who will not permit it to die out. In their hands the future of the young generation of Poles is assured.</p>
   <p>A religious ceremony was conducted at St. Josephat's Church before the opening of the convention. The church was filled with the devout. Reverend Szulz delivered an appropriate sermon on the occasion, in which he encouraged <pb facs="5423968_9_1311.jpg" n="2"/>the work of the Polish Women's Alliance. He also expressed his wishes of success to all other Polish organizations. The parish choir sang during the Mass. The rich voices of Miss Gierszewska and Mr. Lukaszewski were heard in solos. The choir was conducted under the baton of the local organist, Mr. Kuszler.</p>
   <p>Following this a parade was held to Kosciuszko's Tomb. Here an introductory speech was given by Mrs. Stephenie Chmielinska, president of the Polish Women's Alliance. The first declamation, entitled: "Kosciuszko, Look Upon us From Heavenly Heights," was rendered by Miss Baranowska.</p>
   <p>A formal opening of the convention by Mrs. Sawicki, chairwoman of the pre-convention committee, occurred in the afternoon. In brief, but very cordial words, she welcomed the delegates and guests. In a further preamble, Mrs. Kaczorowska, the eminent physician and surgeon, touched upon the position of women in world events.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1312.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The next speaker was the Honorable Judge John C. Horel, a brother Bohemian. In sincere and patriotic words he greeted all those congregated, speaking in behalf of the state of Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>Appropriate speeches were then made by the Honorable Judge Blenski, Reverend Goral, Mr. Tomkiewicz, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance, Mrs. Sakowski, lady commissioner of the same organization, Mr. John B. Wleklinski, director of the Polish National Alliance, and Mrs. Krenz who spoke in behalf of the Polish Welfare Association.</p>
   <p>A formal opening of the convention was made by Mrs. S. Chmielinska, president of the Polish Women's Alliance. Following this, the committee on credentials reported the presence of one hundred and forty qualified delegates, representing one hundred and six groups of the Polish Women's Alliance organization. The questioned credentials of groups 11, 12, 13, 41 and 82 were accepted.</p>
   <p>The following ladies were presented for chairwomen of the convention: Mrs. Neuman and Mrs. Tomaszewski. Mrs. Neuman declined the nomination in favor <pb facs="5423968_9_1313.jpg" n="4"/>of Mrs. Tomaszewski, causing the latter to be elected unanimously. Mrs. Petrykowski was elected as vice-chairwoman in a similar manner. For the position of secretary, the following were presented: Mmes. Hon, Napieralska, Weyna and Ball. The result of the election was as follows: Mrs. Hon received 18 votes; Mrs. Napieralska, 45 votes; Mrs. Weyna, 64 votes and 8 votes were cast for Mrs. Ball. Mrs. Napieralska declined the nomination, hence Mrs. Weyna was chosen as first secretary and Mrs. Hon as second.</p>
   <p>Then came the reading of the telegrams sent by the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance, accepted with enthusiastic and reverberating applause; the Polish Free Falconry, equally favorably accepted; the Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy; South Bend Chamber of Commerce, asking also that the future convention be held in that city; the Polish National Daily News.</p>
   <p>Mmes. Nagre and Dyborowska were elected as marshals. Mrs. Chmielinska, the president, then asked the newly elected administration for the convention to take their respective posts, and after completing the necessary formalities, the convention was adjourned until the following morning.</p>
