   <p>Countrymen! Only a few weeks separates us from the day on which all the Poles who are impressed with one thought and patriotic spirit will honor in common the hero of Raclawice.</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Kosciusko! This name is not only deeply engraved in the heart of every Pole, but is also distinguished in the history of the United States. Here in this country our hero fought for freedom and gained fame; over there in our native land, he raised an army and boldly attacked the enemy and tyrant. For this reason we have decided to honor the memory of this hero with a public manifestation. We are aware of the fact that we should not <pb facs="5423968_9_0941.jpg" n="2"/>be disunited, that we should not place our ego above a patriotic duty, the duty of honoring one of our great heroes.</p>
   <p>Polish Day proved that our nation lives. [It was] an open protest against our oppressors. Let the Kosciusko manifestation be another. Let it prove that we do live, that we desire to be free, that we have solidarity, and that we desire to follow the example of Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>We should not pay attention to hard times. There is nothing without hardships and sacrifice. Besides, the honoring of our hero will require only a small expense. Let us not shun this small offering, bearing in mind that our ancestors sacrificed not only their wealth but also their lives for our motherland a hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>The members of the Kosciusko manifestation [committee] levied a special <pb facs="5423968_9_0942.jpg" n="3"/>assessment of fifteen cents on every member of society or group in order to defray the expenses of the manifastation.</p>
   <p>With good will and sincere desire every Pole can contribute this small sum. We appeal also to those who do not belong to any Polish organization. Let them collect funds in their circles. The funds should be sent to J. Napieralski, 687 West Seventeenth Street, Chicago, or to the office of the Polish newspapers. We also appeal to our youth, that they may, of their own free will, collect even a very small sum and deliver it into the proper hands.</p>
   <p>Countrymen! Time is short! Therefore, let us act. Let us prove that we can serve and devote ourselves to a good cause without government collectors. We are certain that our businessmen, who are well known for their generosity in such cases, will contribute toward this cause.</p>
   <p>We appeal to you again, dear countrymen. contribute all you can, but do it <pb facs="5423968_9_0943.jpg" n="4"/>promptly, so that the funds may be deposited in the treasury as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>We must have and will have a manifestation, for there is no Pole who would not desire it, there is no Pole who does not love his country, who would not honor the memory of his ancestors and so much more our Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>By our deeds people will know us; by our deeds they will learn to respect, fear, or despise us.</p>
   <p>With fraternal greetings,</p>
   <p>Sigmund Schmidt, president</p>
   <p>Ignace Kowalski, secretary</p>
   <p>committee in charge of the Kosciusko</p>
   <p>manifestation:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0944.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>All Polish papers are asked to reprint this appeal.</p>
