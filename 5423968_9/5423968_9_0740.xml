   <p>The November Insurrection of 1830 [uprising of the Poles against Russian rule] was commemorated by the St. Hyacinth parishioners at J. Grabowiecki's Hall on Sunday, December 8. Peter Kiolbassa acted as chairman and Leon Szopinski acted as recording secretary. The program was opened with a prayer by the Reverend J. Gieburowski, pastor of St. Hyacinth Church.</p>
   <p>Besides the declamations presented by local talent and the songs of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Choir, under the direction of Andrew Kwasigroch, four speeches were delivered, by Messrs. Krus, Szopinski, Kiolbassa, and the Reverend Gieburowski.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa spoke on the need of faith, sincerity, and work, in order to achieve our aims. He also stressed the importance of safeguarding our <pb facs="5423968_9_0741.jpg" n="2"/>cultural heritage and the avoidance of contact with false prophets who tend to ruin our standing in America instead of bettering it. This speech was received with great acclaim by the audience.</p>
   <p>The next speech worthy of mention was that of the Reverend Gieburowski, who made reference to the training of our children along the proper channels, for our future depends on them. "Without religious guidance and knowledge of our past they will not understand the cause that we are fighting for", he said.</p>
   <p>All speakers and performers were generously applauded.</p>
   <p>Before closing, the Reverend J. Gieburowski thanked everyone present for making this affair possible.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with the singing of the national hymn, "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
