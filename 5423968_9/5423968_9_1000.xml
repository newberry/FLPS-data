   <p>The Third of May exercises held in Town of Lake in commemoration of the Polish Third of May Constitution were more successful than any hitherto held in that section of the city. The exercises, held on Sunday, May 7, were opened in the morning with celebration of solemn High Mass. They were continued in the afternoon with a parade to Columbia Hall, where the program was held. The principal speaker at the exercises was the Reverend W. Zaleski, pastor of the parish. The program was a varied one, including music and recitations. A collection for a Mass for the intention of those who had died for Poland brought in fifteen dollars. A like amount was collected for the Kosciusko Memorial Fund, while fifty-two dollars was collected for the new church that is to be constructed in Town of Lake.</p>
