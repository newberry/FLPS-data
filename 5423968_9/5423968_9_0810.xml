   <p>The third in a series of patriotic programs commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland, was held Sunday evening, March 31, at Pulaski Hall in St. Adalbert Parish.</p>
   <p>Casimir Zychlinski officially opened the program at 8 P. M. with a short address, which was received with great applause by the capacity crowd. Adam Blaszczynski was called upon to preside as chairman and Francis P. Danisch as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was the beautiful Polish song "Piesn Zgody" (Song of Peace), sung by the combined Moniuszko and Halka choirs.</p>
   <p>Reverend Paul Rhode, a young priest, ardent patriot, and vicar of St. Adalbert <pb facs="5423968_9_0811.jpg" n="2"/>Parish, delivered the first speech of the evening. He spoke to the audience in the name of Polish youth. In their name he besought the Polish people to bring about harmony within their own ranks, and urged the parents to rear their children in a Polish environment, so that the Polish language will not become a dead language to them.</p>
   <p>"Our Polish youth should be the support of our Polish cause," he asserted. "In order to retain this Polish training and spirit, such meetings as this one are imperative. The youth, seeing these living examples of patriotism displayed on our stages, will comprehend the significance of the hardships the Polish nation is undergoing, and by this their love for the motherland will be reborn. The Polish youth will find in Polish literature such laurels as are not found in the literature of other peoples. It should read the works of our Polish authors. I urge everyone to do his share for the national cause", Reverend Rhode concluded.</p>
   <p>A declamation was rendered by little Mary Bauer, and this was followed by another given by little Eugene Janiszewski.</p>

   <p>At this point of the program, I. Machnikowski, gave a lecture on the third partition of Poland. This was followed by a re-enactment of a Polish historical event, "Sobieski at Vienna."</p>
   <p>Carol and Josephine Bednarz played a piano duet. Another historical event was depicted at this point. Miss Pawlowska gave a recitation.</p>
   <p>The Halka and Moniuszko choirs made their second appearance and sang "Beautiful Is the Land of Poland." This combined group was directed by Professor Hensl; Carol and Josephine Bednarz played the piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>Next on the list of entertainers was young Francis Szumski, who recited "The Queen of the Polish Crown."</p>
   <p>"Long Live Poland," the third in a series of stage scenes, was then presented.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was J. Slowikowski, who urged the Polish people to support the <pb facs="5423968_9_0813.jpg" n="4"/>national cause, either through the Polish League or the National Fund [the fund started by the Polish League for the national cause], etc. He said that all these institutions have the same objective in mind and are worthy of support.</p>
   <p>The fourth and final stage scene, "Polish Carnival", was presented. Mr. Zychlinski explained to the audience the meaning of scenes which were portrayed.</p>
   <p>A collection to cover the cost of staging this program brought $8.15.</p>
   <p>The singing of "God Save Poland" brought the program to a close.</p>
