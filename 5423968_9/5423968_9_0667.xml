  <body>
   <p>The celebration arranged by the national societies in the Saint Adalbert Community, was held Sunday afternoon in Pulaski Hall, which was quite crowded.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Napieralski, president of the celebration committee, opened the program and requested Mr. Ludwik Dorszewski to act as chairman. The latter then called upon Mr. F. Wolowski, secretary of the Polish Young Men's Alliance, to act as secretary of the celebration, and invited the speakers and presidents of the societies to the stage.</p>
   <p>The Moniuszko Choir sang "Third of May" as the opening number of the program. Professor Siemiradzki then spoke about the historic uprising and the meaning of the Constitution to Poland. Although Poland has been condemned to death by its enemies, it still lives, and will continue to live.</p>
   <p>Miss Anna Malkiewicz then recited a poem, "To Our Brethren On The Third Of <pb facs="5423968_9_0668.jpg" n="2"/>May," and was loudly applauded. Next the Moniuszko Choir sang "Memories Of Old Poland". Mr. A. Szydlowski followed with a speech in the Lithuanian language. He spoke of the meaning of the Constitution of the Third of May and called on all Lithuanians to join hands with the Poles. The youthful Turner Joseph Malkiewicz recited "The Battle At Raclawice".</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Mr. Poszwinski, who spoke about our enemies, internal and external, and about the oppression of our nation by the Russians and the Germans. He urged that all Poles, regardless of their own convictions, work together for the freedom of our fatherland. In conclusion he raised the cry, "Long live the Poles!"</p>
   <p>Miss Malkiewicz recited another poem, and the Moniuszko choir sang "Krakowiak From The Kosciusko Uprising".</p>

   <p>Mr. J. Napieralski then urged everybody to attend the picnic for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument, and called on the ladies to solicit contributions in the hall for the benefit of Pulaski Hall. The sum of thirteen dollars and eleven cents was collected.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Mr. S. Osada, who emphasized the importance of these national celebrations. He especially urged the young people to attend these national celebrations and to guard their native tongue.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. L. Dorszewski spoke, thanking the audience, both civilians and military, for attending the celebration; the singing of the Polish national anthem, "God Save Poland," ended the celebration.</p>
