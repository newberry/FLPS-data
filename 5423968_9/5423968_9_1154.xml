<title level="a">EXERCISE STAGED AT ST. HYACINTH PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>An exercise commemorating the nine hundredth anniversary of St. Adalbert's death was staged at St. Hyacinth Parish yesterday (Sunday). The only changes in the announced program was that instead of having Stanislaus Szwajkart as guest speaker, Ignace Kowalski gave the opening address. The parish hall was filled to capacity. Mr. Dominowski presided as chairman and Anthony Jankowski as recording secretary. The Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, pastor of St. Hyacinth Parish, delivered a stirring speech. At the conclusion of his talk the pastor was applauded with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Frank Brzezienski distinguished himself as an elocutionist when he gave an outstanding rendition of "Konfederaci Barscy" (The Barski Confederates).</p>
   <p>A spirited solo, "If You Have Chosen Us Oh Lord," was sung by Paul Myks. This was followed by a duet, "Song to My Mother," by the Misses Szulareckh and Zmudzinska.</p>

   <p>"The Polish masses supported the Polish nobility," asserted the immortal Krasinski, renowned Polish poet. It can readily be said that the "Polish people are with the Polish priests". This was exemplified by yesterday's celebration at the St. Hyacinth Church; one of the youngest and most rapidly growing Polish parishes in Chicago.</p>
