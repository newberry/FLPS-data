   <p>We have been asked to publish the following appeal in Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"All our Polish neighborhoods are getting ready for the Kosciusko manifestation, which promises to be a great event. Only a small number of our societies, for unknown reasons, will not participate in the manifestation. Hard times do not excuse anyone from participating in the manifestation, since a member's participation expense, which is only fifteen cents, is small enough not to make his condition any worse.</p>
   <p>"Let us pay no attention to those who have patriotism on their lips but not in their heart or to those who, like evil spirits, whisper that we have had enough manifestations, that marches are tiresome, that these things are not necessary, and that our people has had enough of it, for the words of such <pb facs="5423968_9_0918.jpg" n="2"/>people, like venom, destroy unity, harmony, and love.</p>
   <p>"We do not stage manifestations for the purpose of displaying our badges and uniforms, but for the purpose of proving to our cocitizens and our enemies that we are united, that we live in harmony, that we love one another, and that formerly we were a great and brave nation ready to defend ourselves and our country.</p>
   <p>"Those who refuse to participate in our national manifestations do not promote other peoples' respect for us; on the contrary, their action indicates that we are not of one thought, one sentiment, not even when the eyes of the public are focused on us.</p>
   <p>"Let us not keep away from other people, lest they forget that we exist.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0919.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Everyone with a spark of life followed Kosciusko, and we should also do like-wise for the sake of his memory.</p>
   <p>"The Lithuanians gave us a splendid example of their solidarity, an example worthy of imitation.</p>
   <p>"Let our indifference in national matters transform itself this coming spring into ardent and real brotherly love, love of motherland, harmony, and unity.</p>
   <p>"Let us contribute toward this manifestation and it will bring us honor.</p>
   <p>"Those societies which have not been invited to participate in the manifestation because their addresses are unknown to the committee, are asked to apply, without ill feeling toward anyone, to the secretary. Our invitation has been repeatedly addressed to all Poles, not to certain societies alone.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0920.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Therefore, countrymen, let us not remain aloof from one another; let us not listen to the whispers of those who lie in wait for our humiliation, but let us stage a public demonstration, as only such a demonstration can bring us honor. A little sincere desire, good will, and sacrifice on our part--and the manifestation will be comparable to Polish Day.</p>
   <p>"Sigmund Schmidt, president;</p>
   <p>Ighace Kowalski, secretary</p>
   <p>"P. S. Polish newspapers are requested to reprint this appeal."</p>
