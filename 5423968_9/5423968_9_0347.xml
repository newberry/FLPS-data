   <p>The Polish National Alliance Central Board has sent out a special proclamation, in which it calls the attention of the P.N.A. Communes and groups, and also of the Alliance patriotic public to this year's May 3, Polish national festival, to be celebrated in commemoration of the 140th anniversary of the Polish Constitution. That day should be celebrated by the P.N.A. members as truly as Alliance holiday, approved and proclaimed as such by the Alliance authorities.</p>
   <p>The P.N.A. leading role in arranging and conducting the celebrations of Polish national festivals, especially that of May 3, has caused an unfriendly reaction on the part of our native opponents, who grumble and mutter that the Polish National Alliance has assumed to itself a monopoly in such matters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0348.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To appease the envious voices we reply that the Alliance's predominant role in staging and celebrating national festivals in general, and that of May 3, in particular, is fully consistent with the Alliance's public service for the past 50 years of its existence. During those long years, the Polish National Alliance has been the only guardian and priest over that national memorial's sacred five among the Polish immigrants, and has celebrated the national festivals not only in the sense of its duty, but because it knew how to arrange it on a larger scale and on a deeper tone than could have been done by anybody else. It has been noticed on numerous instances and in many communities that without our initiative the national festivals either are celebrated very inadequately, or else are not celebrated at all.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance is most aptly prepared to take care of such festivals, knowing how to make them efficient in obtaining both moral and material results.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0349.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On such occasions, especially on the May 3, festival, there are solicited donations to the educational fund, with which to serve the educational needs of the Polish public; and the Polish National Alliance is best prepared to carry out that task. For these reasons the Polish National Alliance has full right to regard the celebrating of the National festivals, and that of all May 3, in particular, as predominantly its own privilege and duty.</p>
