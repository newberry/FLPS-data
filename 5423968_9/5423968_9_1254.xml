<title level="a">SEMIANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE CENTRAL POLISH RELIEF COMMITTEE AND NATIONAL DEPARTMENT</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The convention opens today. We welcome the delegates to our city.</p>
   <p>We expect that the deliberations of the members of the Central Polish Relief Committee during the present grave times so important to our cause will answer their purpose both in the quality and importance of the motions passed at this time, and will be a new source of encouragement for further efforts on the part of our people.</p>
   <p>Today we need action, not fine-sounding words or useless quarrels, as Mr.I. J. Paderewski, our spiritual leader here in America, emphasized in his speech in <pb facs="5423968_9_1255.jpg" n="2"/>Pittsburgh. Our whole community expects such actions to follow today's convention of the Central Polish Relief Committee and the National Department.</p>
   <p>We call attention to the resolution, in the matter of Poland and other countries, introduced in Congress by Medill McCormick, representative of the State of Illinois. This resolution will be given a public hearing in Washington. The National Department and other Polish organizations, as well as private individuals, should not confine themselves only to sending telegrams to Medill McCormick, author of the resolution, or to their district representatives, but they should, in the first place, consider sending a strong group of representatives to Washington for this public hearing, in order that they may help base the resolution on strong, healthy arguments, and present the Polish cause in the proper light.</p>
   <p>Today, also, the National Department should, in the name of the immigrants <pb facs="5423968_9_1256.jpg" n="3"/>belonging to the most powerful Polish organizations, express itself in the matter of the temporary decree of the Russian government; it should reply to the appeal of free Russia to the Poles with an act worthy of our nation, that is, by accepting with brotherly affection the gift which is only a compensation for punishments and Siberias, whereas the complete fulfillment of our demands could be a salve for healing the wounds and scars inflicted on our nation by tsarist governments.</p>
   <p>Emphasizing and documenting at every step not only our loyalty but also our gratitude to the President of the United States, the National Department should send out a call to the Poles to join the ranks of the volunteers and defenders of this country, which has not only given us the means of life and development, but in addition has taken such a noble stand in the Polish question.</p>
