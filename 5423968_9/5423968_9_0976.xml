   <p>The national societies on the Northwest Side of the city celebrated the sixty-third anniversary of the November Insurrection on Wednesday, November twenty-ninth, in the Bohemian Hall on Emma Street.</p>
   <p>The audience filled the entire hall and gallery. Mr. F. H. Jablonski opened the meeting, after which Mr. Victor Bardonski was elected chairman and Mr. C. Machek secretary.</p>
   <p>The program was made up of speeches, singing and recitations. Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of the Holy Trinity Parish, was the first speaker, and he advised us to have faith in God's goodness, and pointed out the destiny of the Poles on this earth. This destiny is the defense of Christianity. The speaker concluded by predicting the freedom of Poland provided we ourselves live according to God's dictates and in God's name.</p>

   <p>Then Mr. Max Kaczmarek spoke in English. The speaker argued eloquently, stating that the restoration and rehabilitation of Poland is a political necessity for the European nations, that the present situation in Europe must change soon as it is too great a burden to bear. Mr. Kaczmarek urged the audience to be patient, to work and to love our country. The third patriotic speech was delivered by Mr. C. Sawicki.</p>
   <p>Miss A. Sniegocka, Miss A. Lisztewnik and Miss Jaroslawska recited some poems in a gracious and pleasing manner, and with true understanding of the texts; Mr. Kamprowski also recited and was warmly applauded for his good efforts. Miss H. Jankowska played the piano, and the Chopin and Wanda choirs sang again in their usual excellent manner.</p>
   <p>A collection for the poor Poles was then taken up. Singing of the Polish national anthem concluded the program.</p>
