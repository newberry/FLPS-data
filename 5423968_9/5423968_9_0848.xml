  <body>
   <p>At the mass meeting held Sunday at the Polish Hall, Reverend Vincent Barzynski gave the following address relative to the method of commemorating 1895 as a year of mourning throughout St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, of which he is pastor:</p>
   <p>"Our national year of mourning is either to be something great, holy and important as the very meaning of the words imply, or it must be turned into some kind of a farce, as a French imposition or an American humbug.</p>
   <p>"If the latter were to occur then it is of no use for me to continue to speak; however, I believe otherwise, dear friends, about your patriotism and feeling toward the motherland. For which of you does not feel the stigma of the heavy wrongs and sorrows which our people rose against a hundred years ago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0849.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We Poles in America, especially those in the large cities and towns, feel the brunt of these past burdens the more, and that is why we should strongly commemorate 1895 as a year of national mourning. We are the sons of the Polish fathers who have already died or are dying for their country, for our beloved Poland, this mother of heroes and saints, this bulwark of Christianity, and this sun of Slavic civilization.</p>
   <p>"Just as in torn Poland, so here the hand of the enemy is reaching out and tearing apart that which could unite, awaken, elevate, and envelop our scattered nation with respect.</p>
   <p>"The enemies of our people have sent and are sending daily so-called emissaries to organize various pseudo-patriotic factions, only to prevent the Poles, especially the Polish youth, from uniting into one group, a group that would embody patriotic and nationalistic virtues for the unification of our youth and the elevation of its moral, national, patriotic, and educational feelings. The work of these agents has been directed toward leading our Polish youth astray. And <pb facs="5423968_9_0850.jpg" n="3"/>during the coming year, this epochal moment of sorrow, their activities are even more concentrated.</p>
   <p>"The poor Polish-American youth, as a result, is being drawn into numerous factions. Here in Chicago are found camps of debauchery and idleness, camps of prodigality and family disorganization, camps of false patriotism where all the pompous speakers come to the conclusion that our enemies have long ago adopted; that Polish schools are unnecessary (because they are Polish and Catholic), that our youth should not think about its fatherland, that work for the Polish national cause is foolish, that contributions for the Polish National Fund are not necessary.....For what reason, they say, should the Polish-Americans create such a fund? They would not know what to do with it!</p>
   <p>"This is indeed sad in many respects. It is sad the more because these camps and one-sided factions, which follow their own particular program of weakening the Polish national spirit, have a common aim....All of them, although they carry on all kinds of misunderstandings among themselves, join together and attack the central Polish order--the Polish Catholic.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0851.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Is this not desperate? Is it not painful to look upon these conditions?</p>
   <p>"This is the reason for our national mourning, a mourning for every Pole who knows what the fatherland is, and who has respect and love for it as a son cherishes his mother. It is this son who clearly sees the dangers threatening our mother, our Poland.</p>
   <p>"In the presence of such dangers, in view of the possible loss of our youth for the national cause, it is not right for us to observe this year, as was done for a century, in silent mourning. It is not right to stay by the wayside. The festive shroud of silent mourning should be cast away and exchanged for one of diligent work.</p>
   <p>"We are in need of action--action which will bring about a cure. We will make an especial effort during 1895 for such action.</p>
   <p>"Amid the thought of the above desires, I open debate for the realization of <pb facs="5423968_9_0852.jpg" n="5"/>such resolutions, devoted toward better patriotic work during 1895, a year of Polish national mourning."</p>
   <p>After the conclusion of this address by Reverend Barzynski, the mass meeting was started on its way. Details were given in yesterday's issue.</p>
