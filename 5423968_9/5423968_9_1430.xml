   <p>According to dispatches direct to Dziennik Chicagoski, the Buffalo convention of Polish-American journalists, held on July 4 and 5, resulted in the establishment of the Polish Journalists Association of America, thus was laid a foundation for the organization of the Polish-American newspapers and for the settlement of differences between them.</p>
   <p>The first session of the convention was opened by M. J. Sadowski on July 4, at 11 A.M., at the Polish Reading Hall, Broadway and Sweet Streets, Buffalo. Mr. J. Bernolak, a Polish newspaperman from Baltimore, was appointed chairman, and Mr. Henry Nagiel secretary.</p>
   <p>The roll call was answered by Joseph Bernolak, editor of Polonia (Baltimore); Henry Nagiel, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski; M. J. Sadowski, editor of Echo <pb facs="5423968_9_1431.jpg" n="2"/>(Buffalo); C. Neuman, editor and publisher of Slowo (Voice) and Nadziea (Hope), both of Milwaukee; Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, representative of Wiara I Ojczyzna (Chicago); J. I. Migdalski, publisher and editor of Sztandar (Chicago); Mrs. H. Piotrowska, representative of Amerika (Toledo); P. Lobarzewski, former editor of various Polish publications in Buffalo; T. Struzynski, co-publisher of Gornik (Wilkes-Barre); T. Wasowicz, publisher of Patriot (Philadelphia); Dr. Laskowski, publisher and editor of Detroit's Prawda (Truth); T. H. Jablenski, editor of Zgoda (Chicago); N. C. Zlotnicki, representative of Chicago's Kropidlo (Sprinkler); E. L. Kolakowski, publisher and editor of Polska I Litwa (Poland and Lithuania) of Shamokin, Pa.; S. Osada, publisher and editor of Reforma (Buffalo); P. Politowski, co-worker and agent of Reforma; P. Zborowski, co-worker and agent of Baltimore's Polonia; and J. F. Smulski, co-publisher of Chicago's Gazeta Katolicka. The editor of Cleveland's Polonia, Mr. L. Dewoyno, was also present. In short, nineteen journalists, representing fifteen Polish newspapers in eight American cities, attended the opening of the convention.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1432.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After the roll call, the chair proceeded to the business of the day. To begin with, it was agreed that anyone of those present had the right to take part in the discussions, that the public should be invited to the sessions, and that the convention committee was to look over the mail received and read it to the assembly.</p>
   <p>A telegram from the publisher of Toledo's Amerika, wishing the convention success, was read.</p>
   <p>Upon presenting his plan of action, outlining the purpose and aims of the convention, Mr. H. Nagiel voiced his reasons for its adoption, contending that if the assembly had nothing definite in mind the results would be chaotic and nothing would be accomplished.</p>
   <p>After hearing Mr. Nagiel's proposals, the convention named a committee of three--Joblonski, Nagiel, and Struzynski--to evaluate their merits, and then adjourned until 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1433.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>During the second session, which was called to order at 2 P.M. and lasted several hours, a number of important matters were decided.</p>
   <p>The rules and regulations, designating the purpose and aims of the convention, and considered to be essential and necessary, were adopted with many valuable additions. It was agreed that an association of Polish-American journalists should be organized. An administrative body was elected, and five articles adopted at the Detroit Convention of 1891 were thoroughly discussed.....</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of the committee, the secretary was instructed to read three telegrams--one from Dr. J. Czupka, of Chicago, who expressed hope for the formation of a society of Polish journalists and added, "Vivat, crescat, floreat," in honor of the society-to-be; another from Dr. J. Szlupas, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who wished success to the convention and offered a few suggestions; and a third from D. T. Boczkowski, of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, who, besides offering good wishes, expressed a desire to become a member of the new organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1434.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The first two telegrams were accepted with enthusiasm. At the reading of the third, however, all the delegates rose from their seats in order to honor Mr. Bozczkowski, a brother Lithuanian who, in addition to showing his willingness to join, has for long made every possible effort not only to unite the Lithuanians and Poles of America but to bring an understanding between them as well.</p>
   <p>A draft of the aims of the convention, which was read by Mr. Nagiel, was accepted. Upon a motion by Mr. Zanajkiewicz, it was agreed to accept the draft in its entirety for revision and to examine it in detail at once. This was done, and the gist of the six articles that were finally adopted is as follows:</p>
   <p>"The aim of the convention is to organize an association of Polish journalists whose purpose will be to regulate the Polish press of America. The deliberations of the convention are to deal primarily with journalistic matters, especially the five articles introduced at the Detroit convention, as well as other new resolutions that may be adopted for the benefit of the Polish press from <pb facs="5423968_9_1435.jpg" n="6"/>time to time.</p>
   <p>"Discussion of personal quarrels and differences is not permitted. It is not the intention of the convention to exert any social, political, or religious influence to the disadvantage of anyone, nor is it permissible to engage in controversies over general social matters, when such controversies may give rise to discontent among certain factions. Those who feel that some particular questions demand attention should refer such questions to the convention, so that their acceptance or refutation may be put to a vote."</p>
   <p>A long and animated discussion followed, in which Messrs. Piotrowski, Neuman, Zahajkiewicz, Osada, Dr. Laskowski, Migdalski, Sadowski, Jablonski, Nagiel, Smulski, and Zlotnicki took a very active part.</p>
   <p>The first five articles were unanimously accepted after they had been thoroughly aired. The sixth article, however, hit a snag. One side contended that three-fourths of the vote was enough for passage, while the other side kept insisting <pb facs="5423968_9_1436.jpg" n="7"/>that a unanimous vote was necessary. After a long debate, the sixth article was accepted by a unanimous vote.</p>
   <p>Its aims accepted, the convention proceeded to the business of organizing an association, adhering strictly to journalistic matters and leaving personal questions and quarrels alone.</p>
   <p>M. J. Sadowski moved that the Polish Journalists Alliance of America, organized at the Detroit convention in 1891, be recognized by the convention. This motion was carried by a unanimous vote.</p>
   <p>J. F. Smulski moved that the delegates be asked whether they wanted to join the organization. His motion was carried and all the delegates joined.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sadowski moved that the convention accept the offer of the five individuals who had written to express their desire to become members of the association, namely: the representatives of the Polish press in Cleveland, New York, <pb facs="5423968_9_1437.jpg" n="8"/>Chicago, and Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. This motion was carried. Later on four other individuals were accepted upon recommendations made from the floor. As a result, twenty-eight persons became members, of whom nineteen were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Neuman moved that secret ballots be used for the election of president, secretary, and treasurer for the coming year. The votes for president were ten for H. F. Jablonski, three for H. Nagiel, and two, one each, for two other persons. In the election for secretary, M. J. Sadowski received eleven votes; H. Nagiel, three; S. Zahajkiewicz, two, and two others one each. For treasurer J. F. Smulski received ten votes and, S. Bernolak seven. Mr. Neuman moved that the convention accept the results of the election. His motion was carried. Carried also was a motion by Mr. Nagiel, who moved that a committee be named to draw up a constitution to be discussed at the next session. H. Nagiel, Mrs. H. Piotrowska, and C. Neuman were chosen for this committee.</p>
   <p>In order to facilitate the work of the committee in charge of framing the <pb facs="5423968_9_1438.jpg" n="9"/>constitution, Bernolak, Nagiel, Sadowski, Neuman, and others engaged in a discussion of the five points adopted by the Detroit convention and other matters concerning Polish journalism. The discussion over, Mr. Bernolak and Mr. Smulski were chosen to prepare a budget for the organization.</p>
   <p>This terminated the business of the first day, and at 7 P.M. the convention adjourned until the following day at 8:30 A.M. Further details will be given in tomorrow's issue.</p>
