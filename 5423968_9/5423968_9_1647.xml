   <p>In every Polish National Church parish there are people who are sincere and greatly attached to the church. We are quite sure that the majority of our members belong to this class, not the class that is cold, insensible and indifferent. Some of these families may be taken as an example for other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The family of N. N. joined the parish of Our Savior right after the consecration of the church, during the mission week.</p>
   <p>The initial deposit fee was brought into the parish office by the mother of the family who stated that the sum was too small but they would try to make it up later so the parish could exist and develop. After joining our parish the parents sent three of their children to our school. They spoke Polish beautifully and took a course in higher Polish. Two of the girls are attending the catechism class with great punctuality, never missing a lesson.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1648.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This year they will receive their first communion. The son is our altar boy and attends the church services every day.</p>
   <p>The mother, in order to help our parish, offered herself to serve as a theatrical performer. Both parents can be seen at all church services with the exception of the evenings when the father is at work; even then the mother comes with the children.</p>
   <p>Those parents help our parish willingly and sincerely at every opportunity; there was no play, lecture or entertainment of any kind in the parish without that family; they always took active part in every thing.</p>
   <p>From the pastor we have learned how glad this family was to receive our pastor in their home during the so-called "Kolenda," or the annual visitation by the pastor. Although it was quite late the whole <pb facs="5423968_9_1649.jpg" n="3"/>family was home waiting all day for the rare opportunity of having their pastor for a guest.</p>
   <p>The house had been cleaned and redecorated. On the table there was a vessel containing holy water and a new sprinkler. All members of this family greeted the pastor very cordially and behaved very respectfully during the entire visit.</p>
   <p>Besides the holy water there was also an envelope containing a donation for the church. This envelope was presented to the pastor by the head of the family. The family was made very happy by the visit of their pastor and escorted him to the gate. The children waved their hands saying good by. Our work could be much easier if all members of our parish would act in that manner.</p>
