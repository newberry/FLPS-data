<title level="a">OBSERVATION OF PALM SUNDAY AT ST. MARY'S OF PERPETUAL HELP CHURCH</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Letter)</title></bibl>

   <p>Palm Sunday was observed yesterday amidst solemn rites as the palms were blessed and passed out to those that attended the services at St. Mary's of Perpetual Help Church.</p>
   <p>Unusual impressive Gregorian hymns were sung by the church choir during the blessing of the palms and the procession. Reverend Father S. Nawrocki, pastor, officiated during the solemn high mass. The Passion was sung by three assisting priests, garbed in attire fitting the ceremonial. Father C. Domogalski sang the part of the Evangelist, Father F. Wojtalewicz sang the role of Jesus Christ, and Father Byrger took the part of the Jewish priests and people.</p>

   <p>Those who have witnessed the blessing of the palms for the first time were greatly impressed by the solemn rites and the Gregorian singing. This Palm Sunday ritual recalled to many with joy and sadness the Cathedrals of Posen, Gniezno, and Pelpliny.</p>
