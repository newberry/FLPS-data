   <p>On Tuesday, February 22nd, we will observe George Washington's birthday all over the country. George Washington was born in February 22, 1732 on his father's plantation in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was educated as a geometrician, and, as a 19-year old youth, took an active part in the Franco-Indian Wars where he distinguished himself by bravery and good judgment. He also schooled himself in military tactics.</p>
   <p>Later, when the Colonies seceded from England and the Revolutionary War began, the Congress of the United Colonies appointed George Washington Commander-in-Chief of the American Army, on June 14, 1775.</p>
   <p>General Washington organized a small army and after a few years more by persistence and continuous harrassing of the king's troops than by winning battles, forced the British forces, one after the other to surrender.</p>
   <p>General Washington defeated General Cornwallis on January 3, 1777, and at Yorktown, October 19, 1781, he forced an army of eight thousand men to surrender.</p>
   <p>Bearing patiently the greatest of hardships, in most difficult circumstances, George Washington preserved an invincible determination and excellent character. These attributes kept up the confidence of the Colonists but lowered the morale of the enemy to such a degree the English, by a temporary peace, treaty, recognized the independence of the United States on November 30, 1782, <pb facs="5423968_9_0427.jpg" n="2"/>and a year later left New York.</p>
   <p>Some army men proposed a crown to Washington, but he refused it with indignation. Immediately following the conclusion of peace, Washington resigned as Chief of the Army, giving back the authority into the hands of Congress.</p>
   <p>He retired to a farm in Vermont, which he had inherited from his brother. Later, he assisted in the framing of our Constitution, which is still the highest authority, and in 1789, he was elected unanimously President.</p>
   <p>George Washington rendered great service to our country by regulating national debts and defenses, establishing public schools, building roads, etcetera. He was elected President for a second term in 1793. He could have served as President for a third term, but refused. By this refusal he established the precedent of but two Presidential terms for one candidate.</p>
   <p>In March, 1797, when his second term expired, Washington, in a great farewell speech, gave valuable instruction on how to conduct the government. A portion of his advice stated: "Americans should keep out of all foreign entanglements." Another was: "America should always be ready to defend herself."</p>
   <p>Washington rendered such distinguished service to his country the whole nation respects his memory, and claim that he is "First in War, First in Peace, and First in the Hearts of his countrymen."</p>
   <p>Honor and glory to that great man of a great Republic.</p>
