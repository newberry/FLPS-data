   <p>The committee on celebrations of the society Freedom Through Enlightenment, group 1948 of the Polish National Alliance, arranged exercises on Saturday, January 27, at 8 P.M., at Johnson Hall, corner Milwaukee and Lawrence Avenues, commemorating the January Insurrection. The exercises were opened by Mr. Felix H. Zendzianowski, who explained the meaning of the commemoration and called upon Mr. Julien Kaczanowski and the undersigned to act as chairman and secretary respectively. The folowing program was then carried out.</p>
   <p>1. Song, "The Vistula Flows Along," sung by Irene and Helen Milewski of Avondale.</p>
   <p>2. Speech by Mr. S. Orpiszewski, editor of the Polish National Alliance publications, in which he honored the memory of the heroes who shed their blood for the cause of the homeland. He described the gravity of Poland's present situation, urging us to aid the starving in Poland. He expressed strong faith in Poland's resurrection, urging us to join the Polish National Alliance, which <pb facs="5423968_9_0490.jpg" n="2"/>protects the future generation from losing its national identity.</p>
   <p>3. Violin and piano duet, "Kujawiak and Cavatina," played by Misses Eugenia and Elizabeth Natucki.</p>
   <p>4. Recitation, "Crucified," by Mrs. K. Rosinski.</p>
   <p>5. Polish compositions for violin and piano played by Misses Eugenia and Elizabeth Natucki. At this time the chairman called upon Mrs. Rybski and Mrs. Zielinski to take up a collection for the starving people in Poland, which yielded $11.14.</p>
   <p>6. Vocal solo, "The Wish," sung by Miss Agnes Ludkowski, accompanied on the piano by Miss Kowalski, both of Avondale.</p>
   <p>7. Speech by Mrs. Magdalene Milewski, director of the Polish National Alliance. Although Mrs. Milewski was not on the program, but was called upon to deliver an address in place of the scheduled speaker, who did [not] appear, <pb facs="5423968_9_0491.jpg" n="3"/>she did very well. She spoke with great feeling on how Poland has been persecuted, and how it now has been destroyed by our enemies. She asked us to help, reminding us of the thousands of tiny graves of the Polish children who have died of starvation. She appealed to the Polish women to give up luxuries, to dress modestly, and thus save money which would save the lives of many children and adults. She encouraged them to join the Polish National Alliance rather than organizations of other nationalities. Finally she wished the society arranging the exercises continued growth and development, and encouraged it to further work.</p>
   <p>8. "God Save Poland," sung by everybody.</p>
   <p>All the numbers on the program were very well performed, as was shown by the enthusiastic applause of the audience.</p>
   <p>After the program was completed, Mrs. Parysz and Mrs. Kaczanowski sold flowers, which brought in an additional $2.75 for the starving people of Poland, making a total of $13.85 collected.</p>
