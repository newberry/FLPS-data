   <p>In a large and beautiful Auditorium of Lincoln School the Poles of Hammond, Indiana and vicinity held on 22nd day of April 1923 a celebration in honor of Copernicus, the Polish astronomer.</p>
   <p>The celebration started in St. Casimir's church at 1:30 P. M. Father Bernacki, rector of the Calumet parish, delivered a very beautiful and interesting sermon, suitable for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The school hall was filled with Poles and among them were many Americans. The celebration began with a short talk by Father Doktor, the assistant of the parish. Mr. Jakaitise's orchestra then played medley of Polish songs. Then under the leadership of Mr. Jakaitis the local choir (Sienkiewicz's choir) sang Zukowski's Polonez. The public applauded and the choir sang a group of Polish songs. The melody took the listeners to their own native land far away across the seas and reminded them of the lively life of our people.</p>
   <p>One of the most aesthetic and beautiful numbers was a program by a local parish school girls composed of marches and drills with American and Polish flags.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0382.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Two groups of girls: one dressed in Polish and the other dressed in American costumes performed the movements with great patience of the Sisters who trained the girls to perform so beautiful yet difficult movements. When the girls raised symbolically the American and Polish flags crossing them the crowd gave great applause all over the hall. The Sisters and their pupils certainly deserve a credit for such program.</p>
   <p>A well known Hammond attorney, Mr. Joseph Conroy, spoke about Copernicus and Poles in America. He paid due respects to Poland for giving such a man as Copernicus to the world also other great men almost in every department of civilization and culture. He gave a short biography of Copernicus and praised the merits of the great astronomer and finally changed the subject and spoke about American chauvinism among a 100% Americans. He gave the Hammond Poles a friendly advice to become American citizens. His speech won a great applause.</p>
   <p>Next was the instrumental and vocal program by our young artists from the parish school.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. F. Bloch, the editor of Polonia, spoke in Polish about Copernicus, Poland, Polish life and conditions among Poles in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0383.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He pleaded with the Poles to bring up their children in a Polish spirit which is similar to American. His speech brought great applause. The program was continued with many more numbers by local and Chicago artists.</p>
   <p>Copernicus was born in Torun Poland on 19th of February 1473. He was a son of a merchant by the name of Mikolaj who lived in Krakow Poland. About the year 1460 he moved from Krakow to Torun. It is supposed that the father of the astronomer came from a village Kopernik in Silesia, Poland. His mother was Barbara Watzelrod sister of Lukasz, bishop of Warmia. The family of Watzelrod was related with many Polish families and Lukasz always defended Polish interests against the Prussian order of Black Cross. Copernicus had one brother and two sisters. After father's death Copernicus lived with his uncle, the bishop. He received his education first in Torun then in Chelm and in the year of 1491 he enrolled with his brother as a student of philosophy at the University of Krakow. About the year of 1494 he went to his uncle and on his advice enrolled for theology and became a priest. In the year of 1495 getting some help he went to Italy where in the cities of Padua and Bolonia he studied mathematics and law, for which he received a doctor's degree. In 1499 he was made a professor of astronomy in Rome. Returning to Poland he spent a few years in Krakow where he conducted an Astronomical observatory.</p>
   <p>His theory created a great stir among learned men.</p>
