   <p>On Wednesday morning, the memorable November 29, church services were held for the dead, and at seven in the evening vespers in memory of our dead brothers killed during the insurrection were recited.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, December 3, at seven-thirty in the evening, a celebration took place at Mr. Nowotny's Hall on 21st Street, under the auspices of the Stephen Buszczynski Society, the St. Casimir Society, and the St. Casimir Court of Foresters.</p>
   <p>The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The president of the committee, Mr. W. Steichert, after greeting the guests, called on our pastor, Reverend W. Fuhrman, to act as chairman, and Mr. Rosinski, as secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0973.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. The parish choir sang "Z Dymen Pozarow" (The Smoke of Burning Fires).</p>
   <p>3. Speech by Mr. [N. J.] Szameit. The speaker touched on the glorious and sad events of Poland's history. He spoke for over an hour, and his words reached the hearts of the audience. He was interrupted frequently by applause.</p>
   <p>4. The members of the Stephen Buszczynski Patriotic Society sang "Do Pracy" (To Work).</p>
   <p>5. The parish choir sang "Mlody Wojennik" (The Young Warrior).</p>
   <p>6. Mr. John Rosinski recited a poem.</p>
   <p>7. The male quartet sang "Na Groby" (On the Graves).</p>
   <p>8. Speech by the pastor, Reverend Fuhrman. He spoke of the valiant <pb facs="5423968_9_0974.jpg" n="3"/>deeds of our forefathers, what they achieved, and what we should do today. The reverend speaker exhorted all to unity and peace and added that we should be happy to have found sympathy among the other American citizens. The audience was well satisfied with these [words] by the pastor and applauded him time and again. It was evident then that our pastor, although here only a short time, has already earned the love and respect of all; may Almighty God preserve him for us a long time!</p>
   <p>9. The members of the St. Buszczynski Society sang "Nasza Piesn" (Our Song).</p>
   <p>10. Mr. Alfonse Tokarski spoke of national solidarity. He pointed out in practical and brief sentences how we should live, love each other, and unite.</p>
   <p>11. The reverend pastor then announced that a collection for the Lwow Exposition would be taken up, and eight dollars and thirty cents was donated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0975.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In conclusion the audience sang "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that the hall was beautifully decorated with transparencies and draperies, for which the committee deserves due credit and thanks.</p>
   <p>John Rosinski, Secretary of Celebration.</p>
