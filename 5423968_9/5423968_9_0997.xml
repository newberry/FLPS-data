   <p>The 350th anniversary of the death of Copernicus was observed yesterday by the Polish National Alliance at the Falcon's Hall on Emma Street. Although the hall is not a large one, the attendance was not great enough to fill it.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened by Mr. L. Szopinski who, in a few words, described the work which brought Copernicus world-wide fame. He emphasized the necessity of a protest against the German tendency to claim for themselves everything that is rightfully Polish. The first speaker was Mr. S. Slupski. He gave a short biography of Copernicus and outlined his discoveries. Mr. John F. Smulski followed with a lecture, delivered in English. He went to considerable length to demonstrate conclusively Copernicus' Polish origin. Mr. Smulski's lecture was very carefully prepared and ought to find a place in the columns of at least one of the American papers.</p>
   <p>Other speeches followed. A wreath was placed upon the bust of Copernicus, and another wreath was placed upon the table in honor of the poet Lenartowicz, who <pb facs="5423968_9_0998.jpg" n="2"/>was also mentioned.</p>
   <p>There were numerous songs and recitations. It must be admitted that one of these recitations, a poem (?) by a "half-baked" ("Niedowarzony") carpenter-poet, written in honor of Copernicus....was entirely unnecessary.</p>
   <p>One of the numbers on the program was a speech by Doctor Pindor, an evengelical pastor from Cieszyn (Austrian Silesia), or, as he was pompously introduced, "the delegate from Silesia." Dr. Pindor who, it develops, came to this country on personal business, is not at all a bad speaker. He said nothing out of the way; indeed, certain parts of his speech, dealing with Polish National affairs, were even interesting. We cannot understand by what authority Dr. Pindor was called the "delegate from Silesia"! A "delegate" has to be delegated somewhere by somebody; from Dr. Pindor's words, it appears that if he greeted the audience in the name of the citizens of Silesia, it was simply because a few of his friends had shaken his hand upon his departure from Poland and said, "Greet them in our name!" Everyone who comes here from Europe can be such a "delegate." The public appearance of such an individual can have no significance whatever.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0999.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We protest against the misuse of the term "delegate," since it may harm the mission of a real delegate from Poland who is in our midst--Doctor Dunikowski. He is here by proper authority and with a definite purpose which, when accomplished, will serve ourselves and our homeland alike.</p>
