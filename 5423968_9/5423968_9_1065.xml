   <p>We have received the following report relative to holding a patriotic exercise in commemorating the centennial of the Battle of Dubienka:</p>
   <p>Chicago, June 27, 1892.</p>
   <p>Honorable Editor:</p>
   <p>A meeting of the delegates of the Polish societies was held on Sunday evening, at Mr. M. Majewski's hall, 779 Milwaukee Avenue. They desire to participate in an exercise commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Dubienka. Mr. M. Osuch presided at the meeting, and the undersigned was chosen as secretary.</p>
   <p>The following societies were represented:</p>
   <p>1. Harmonia Society--represented by Mr. Lagodzinski.</p>
   <p>2. Polish Community Society Number 1.--represented by Mr. M. Osuch.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. Gwiazda (Star) Society A--represented by Mr. Stanley Nicki.</p>
   <p>4. Society of John III Sobieski--represented by S. F. A. Satalecki.</p>
   <p>5. The Eagle and Pursuit (Orla i Pogoni) Society--represented by Mr. Zloczewski.</p>
   <p>6. Society of John Kochanowski--represented by Mr. Tuchocki.</p>
   <p>7. Pulaski's Guard--represented by Mr. Binkowski.</p>
   <p>8. Kosciuszko's Society--represented by Mr. Wojcieszyk.</p>
   <p>9. Society of Adam Mickiewicz-- represented by Mr. Krakowski.</p>
   <p>10. The Polish Community Society--represented by Mr. St. Slominski.</p>
   <p>11. Society of Thomas Zan--represented by Messrs.: Wild and Koinski.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously decided upon to conduct most impressive exercises in one of the larger local halls.</p>
   <p>The following members enter into the composition of the committee conducting the exercises: Messrs. Osuch, Satalecki, Nicki, Koinski and Wozny. The above mentioned committee was empowered to take as many aides as it will need.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1067.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A detailed program will be published at a later date. Americans favorable to our cause will also be invited as speakers.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held this coming Sunday, July 3, at 8:00 P.M., at Mr. M. Majewski's place. In this meeting the newly selected committee on exercises will give an account of its activities. An invitation for this meeting is extended, to the representatives of all the Polish and Lithuanian societies. We presume that the exercises of this very important anniversary will be the only general ones in our city. Consequently, we should exert all our efforts to make it most successful.</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski, Secretary.</p>
