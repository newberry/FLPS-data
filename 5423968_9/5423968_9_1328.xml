   <p>At 8:30 A. M. the different delegates began congregating before Pulaski Hall in the neighborhood of St. Adelbert's parish. At 9 o'clock two men and two women societies paraded before the parish on their way to the hall; they were the Polish Sons group No. 123, Polish Freedom group No. 164, Virgin Mary group No. 124 and the Knights of St. Casimir group No. 146.</p>
   <p>We noticed four carriages filled with lady delegates on their way to attend this conference. Chief marshall of this parade was Mr. Vincent Biskup; assistants were Mr. Vincent Pakowski and Theodore Rzepka.</p>
   <p>At the request of Bishop Rhode, the delegates did not parade to meet him. Bishop Rhode arrived at 9:30 in Mr. Kwiatkowski's car, accompanied by Rev. Fathers Frank Wojtalewicz, John Lange and Stanley Szpotanski.</p>
   <p>The parish of St. Adelbert was filled with people who were awaiting the arrival of Bishop Rhode, so they could see the first Polish bishop of Chicago archdiocese.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1329.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In about fifteen minutes after he arrived Bishop Rhode started the mass with an episcopal blessing, assisted by Rev. Father Wojtalewicz from South Chicago and Rev. Father Stanley Szpotanski from Pennsylvania. The deacon at the celebrated holy mass presided over by Bishop Rhode was Rev. Father Leon Zuchola, from St. Adelbert; the subdeacon was Rev. Father Felix Fildheim from Holy Innocence parish and the ceremonials at this holy mass were performed by Rev. Father Lange from South Chicago, Rev. Father J. Ostrowski from St. Adelbert and Rev. Father C. Truszynski, from Peru, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The choir of St. Cecilia under the direction of a well known organist Mr. B. Kujawski. During the Holy Mass Mr. Dumanowski sang, "O Sacrum Convivium," a solo, as did Miss Helen Chomoszewska, also Miss B. Wieklinska. Mr. Kujawski also obtained the well known singer Mr. Robert McGuirk, also Mr. Paul Zmidzinski, known the world over as a reputable violinist.</p>
   <p>The gospel was preached by Rev. Father Dominick Majer from St. Paul, Minn., the organizer and for many years the head pastor of St. Adelbert's parish.</p>
   <p>After the holy mass the whole retinue returned to Pulaski Hall, which was <pb facs="5423968_9_1330.jpg" n="3"/>beautifully decoated for this great occasion. The homes in the neighborhood between Pulaski Hall and St. Adelbert's parish were beautifully decorated; also many words of thanks and praise were given to the committee in charge of affairs, which consisted of F. Kaminski, Peter Kornaks, W. Kordas, Casimir Kakla, S. Kasperski, John Doman, John Drzycinski, Joseph Doman, W. Kledzinski, A. Gall, J. Tanerowicz, M. Novak, Joseph Tanerowicz, S. Swiercz, W.

   <pb facs="5423968_9_1331.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The first speaker at this session was Mr. Etan, president of the committee, who greeted the assembled delegates. After his short speech, he introduced Mr. Weglinski, president of the Polish Union, who asked that Bishop Rhode say a prayer to open the conference, then he read a well prepared speech which was applauded by the assembly.</p>
   <p>Next Mr. Weglinski asked the asembled delegates to express their appreciation for Bishop Rhode's beautiful speech by shouting three times "Long live Bishop Rhode."</p>
   <p>Following this applause, Mr. Drzycinski, a delegate from Chicago, introduced Mr. A. J. Sabath, a congressman who is a true friend of the Polish people, spoke earnestly and wholeheartedly to the delegates.</p>
   <p>After Congressman Sabath's speech, Mr. Weglisnki introduced Miss Sophie Kalawa, president of the Liberty of Polish Women Group No. 164, who in the name of her society donated a bouquet of flowers for this conference.</p>
   <p>Next Mr. Drzycinski introduced a lawyer, Mr. George Bagbey, who spoke in the name of our mayor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1332.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Following this Rev. Father Szpotanski of Pennsylvania introduced Bishop Rhode, who spoke about the unity, brotherly love, harmony and true spirit of the Polish people in this great Polish Union. He also thanked the Polish people for their respect of the Roman-Catholic religion, sending their children to Polish parochial schools and speaking the Polish language at home.</p>
   <p>After the speech Bishop Rhode bade all the delegates and the assembled guests a farewell and departed.</p>
   <p>Following Bishop Rhode's departure, Mr. John Smulski, the treasurer of the State of Illinois, spoke about the strength of the Polish Union and his belief that it continue in the future as it did in the past.</p>
   <p>Then the president asked that the committee check the mandate of the following out of town delegates. Mr. S. Kowalski from Minnesotta, Walter Kopczynski from New Jersey, Anthony Kowalewski from New York, S. Tyburski from Pennsylvania, and John Jasinski from Michigan.</p>

   <p>The following newspapers were represented at this conference, The Polish Daily News, National Daily, Polish National Alliance Catholic Newspaper of Chicago, and the Nowiny Polskie.</p>
   <p>The delegates were pleased to hear the telegram sent by His Excellency Archbishop J. E. Quigley.</p>
   <p>After a series of short talks by prominent delegates, and the selection of members for the complain committee, and the press committee, the President Mr. Weglinski brought the Eighth Conference of the Polish Union to an end.</p>
   <p>It was the best and most successful conference of the Polish Union ever held in America. Some of the best speakers were obtained besides the singers and entertainers. May God bless you all until we meet again.</p>
   <p>Mr. Weglinski, President</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Tyburski, Secretary.</p>
