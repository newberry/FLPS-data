   <p>Exercises commemorating the Third of May were held at the Polish Women's Alliance on May 6. The exercises were opened by Mrs. Klarkowski, chairman of the Educational Department, who appointed Dr. M. [Mary Olgiert] Kaczorowski chairman of the meeting, and the undersigned as secretary.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kaczorowski explained the purpose of the meeting and proceeded to open the program.</p>
   <p>The first number was by the Polish Women's Alliance chorus. This chorus, although very young, deserves recognition.</p>
   <p>The second number on the program was a song, "Na Grobic" (on the Grave), <pb facs="5423968_9_0448.jpg" n="2"/>by Miss Sophie Widman, accompanied by Miss M. Golnik and Mr. Ciudai.</p>
   <p>The third number was a recitation, by Miss Jakowanis, which was applauded.</p>
   <p>The fourth number was a violin solo by Mr. Ciudai, accompanied on the piano by Miss M. Golnik.</p>
   <p>The fifth number was a song by the Philaret Choir.</p>
   <p>This was followed by an excellent and spirited address by Dr. Klarkowski, dealing in lofty and moving words with our present situation as Poles, and forecasting in the near future the happy, hoped-for moment of Poland's resurrection.</p>
   <p>This was followed by a vocal solo by Miss Eugenia Markowski, pupil of <pb facs="5423968_9_0449.jpg" n="3"/>Mrs. Agnes Nering.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Golnik played the piano while a tableau was shown on the stage, during which time a collection for Polish relief was taken up. The collection brought in $25.76.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jozwiakowski recited "Trzeci Mai" (The Third of May) with his usual ability and deep feeling. Toward the end of the recitation the curtain was raised on a tableau portraying "Rising Poland," in which, besides older girls, little children participated.</p>
   <p>After the recitation, when the applause subsided a little, Mr. Jozwiakowski intoned "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland), and the audience took up the majestic melody of our national hymn, giving vent to its repressed emotions, and the desire for the realization of our most cherished ideal of a free, united and independent Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0450.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the words "Przed Twe Oltarze" (Before Thy Altars), three little girls Casimira Chrapkowski, Harriet Boraczewski, and Mary Setmaier, and Scout Thaddeus Panek--all dressed in Polish costumes--removed the crown of thorns and the shackles from the figure representing Poland in the tableau, placing a laurel wreath on her head and a scepter in her hand. The flag of the United States was hung above the tableau.</p>
   <p>Those present were deeply moved on seeing these Polish children performing, under the protection of The Star Spangled Banner, the symbolic act of the "Resurrection of Poland".</p>
   <p>When the curtain was lowered Dr. M. Kaczorowski sincerely thanked the audience for the large attendance, and also those who in any way helped make the program more interesting; at the same time she expressed the hope that those present would take with them a good impression of this lofty celebration.</p>
   <p>(Signed) G. Thierse,</p>
   <p>Secretary of the meeting.</p>
