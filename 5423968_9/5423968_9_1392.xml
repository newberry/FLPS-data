   <p>We had written a few days ago that in June there will be an unusual convention held by the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. During the past week various publications put the 28th of July in the city of Chicago as the day that this convention will meet.</p>
   <p>This coming convention brings many things to our heads to think and speak of. A year hasn't yet gone by since the last convention of this institution--and already the delegation is busy preparing everything possible to achieve a greater representation. In the presence of this coming, and important for this organization, convention, Zgoda-organ of the Alliance-will point out a few sincere facts, pertaining to this institution. We shall not follow the example of the clerical publications which shun us in every possible way.</p>
   <p>The Zgoda shall not attempt to do this because that isn't the Christian and Polish method. Because the Zgoda is sincere and honest, it never avoided any kind of an organization by publishing misleading statements; above all it has always recommended the Polish Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
