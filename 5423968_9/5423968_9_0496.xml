   <p>Exercises commemorating the January Insurrection were held last Sunday at St. Hedwig Parish hall. The large hall was packed.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. M. Nowicki opened the exercises, calling upon Lieutenant Joseph Palczynski to act as chairman. The latter called upon the undersigned to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1) Song by the St. Hedwig's parish choir under the able direction of Mr. Wiedeman. The song was so well rendered that the applause of the audience forced the choir to give an encore.</p>
   <p>2) Speech by Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, well-known journalist who has traveled over war-torn Poland. He spoke picturesquely of our past and present, telling us to believe in a better future. His speech was frequently interrupted by the applause <pb facs="5423968_9_0497.jpg" n="2"/>of the audience.</p>
   <p>3) Recitation by young B. Czuwara, which was very well done.</p>
   <p>4) Scouts' Orchestra under the direction of Mr. Wiedeman.</p>
   <p>5) Performance of Zgoda Falcons--pyramids excellently executed.</p>
   <p>6) Song by St. Hedwig Parish choir.</p>
   <p>8) Scouts' orchestra. During this number Mesdames Mikrut, Nowicki, Guzikowski, Miss Konczykowski, and Mr. Wiedeman's daughter took up a collection for our starving brethren in Poland which yielded $45.36.</p>
   <p>7) Speech by Mr. John F. Smulski, well-known orator and national worker, who spoke with his usual ease and zeal, appealing to the audience to give generously to the Polish cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0498.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>9) Speech by Municipal Judge Edmund Jarecki, which was generally liked by the audience.</p>
   <p>The chairman thanked those who took part in the program and the audience for attending in such large numbers. With the singing of "God Save Poland" this inspiring commemoration was ended.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Francis Porzuczek, secretary</p>
