   <p>The following appeal has been received relative to participation in the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus:</p>
   <p>"With the approach of the celebration activities commemorating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus, many organizations of Chicago are making preparations to participate. We, as Poles, should not let our interest lag in this direction.</p>
   <p>"There is great need for unified preparations among our organizations. At a previous meeting of marshals of all Polish national societies it was unanimously agreed that all Polish military organizations, as well as civil, should work in unison in formulating plans for participation. Because of this agreement the representatives of Krakus of South Chicago, Krakus of St. Florian, and Krakus Division No. II agreed upon having the commanders of all the <pb facs="5423968_9_0279.jpg" n="2"/>military groups meet. They contended that such a meeting would help to avoid much unnecessary confusion. All commanders and captains are invited to attend this meeting on October 9 at 9 A. M. in the home of W. Zwierzynski, 715 West 17th Street.</p>
