   <p>To-morrow, all Poland is celebrating the anniversary of her political rebirth, caused by the enactment of the national constitution, known as "The Third of May Constitution" (Konstytucya Trzeciego Maja). Home and abroad, on that day, the Poles send their supplications to the Lord of Hosts for the restoration of the liberty of their Fatherland. In churches and in schools, in public halls and in national centers, the Poles commemorate the last really bright moment in their political life, before the partition of their Fatherland. There were other great and bright events in the political history of Poland, but the Constituion of May third, 1791, has been the greatest of them all. It revived new hope and confidence in the rebirth of national health and life, based on the eternal idea of true liberty, equality and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>With that high ideal incorporated, the Third of May Constitution had the power to save Poland from the menacing claws of her three external enemies. For that reason, the anniversary,of the May Third Constitution, will be celebrated by the Poles with endeared memory and loving affection. The May Third Constitution is regarded by the Poles as a momentous act of voluntary sacrifice on the part of the nobility, in favor of the middle classes and of the peasants. The glory of the May Third <pb facs="5423968_9_0601.jpg" n="2"/>Constitution has not been dimmed during the period of partition and servitude, lasting over one-hundred years. In spite of all reactionary theories and external suppressions, the constitutional seed of May 3, 1791, is springing up in each generation and is still generating an abundant fruit, that is equally nourishing and wholesome.</p>
