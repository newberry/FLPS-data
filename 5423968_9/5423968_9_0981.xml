   <p>A celebration, in commemoration of the sixty-third anniversary of the Insurrection of November the Twenty-ninth, was held last Thursday, night, November 30, in St. Stanislaus Kostka School.</p>
   <p>The audience filled the enormous hall to capacity and listened intently to the beautiful program. Mr. J. Tomaszewski was called upon to act as chairman and Mr. I. Kowalski acted as secretary. The St. Cecilia Choir, Number 2, sang the opening number of the program. Mr. Rudnicki then gave an historical oration. In simple words he related clearly and briefly the history of that memorable November the Twenty-ninth and the battles that followed it, and then considered deeply the causes of our national calamities and the present depression. He found the cause in the insolence of the magnates and their refusal to grant the necessities of life to the people, who constitute the real bulwark of civilization. Commenting on the Polish-American situation, Mr. Rudnicki stated that we, here in the land of freedom, possess everything that is necessary to improve our condition, to be enlightened and to profit <pb facs="5423968_9_0982.jpg" n="2"/>from the laws of citizenship. He urged the Poles to educate themselves and to take active part in public life. Mr. Rudnicki's speech, understood by everybody and containing many practical thoughts, was loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>After this speech by Mr. Rudnicki the St. Cecilia Young Ladies Choir, Number 1, sang two numbers. Then Miss W. Chlebowska recited a poem, "Do Matki Polki" (To a Polish Mother), beautifully, with much vigor and feeling. Then came the senior St. Stanislaus Kostka turners in a well-drilled gymnastic exhibition, which was much praised by the audience. Then the St. Stanislaus Kostka Male Choir sang two numbers.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Kondriorski was unable to appear to make his speech, because of unexpected business. In his place Mr. Boleslaus Klarkowski appeared on the stage with a beautifully prepared sketch about Mickiewicz [Translator's note: Adam Mickiewicz was one of the greatest of Polish poets]. Mr. Klarkowski did not give dry facts about the life of our beloved poet, but endeavored to bring before us the high position he occupies in the life of our nation. In <pb facs="5423968_9_0983.jpg" n="3"/>his opinion Mickiewicz was the mouthpiece of the feelings and sufferings of the entire nation; he captivated millions with his poems, and will enthrall millions more in the future.</p>
   <p>After this came the drill of the Cadets. As usual they put on a superb performance. The singing of the St. Stanislaus Kostka and St. Cecilia choirs enthralled the audience and evoked tremendous applause. Mr. Andrew J. Kwasigroch sang a solo beautifully. As director of the choirs he deserves great praise for his wonderful teaching.</p>
   <p>The last to speak was the pastor, Reverend Vincent Barzynski. The reverend speaker made a truly inspired oration on the question: Why is there so much suffering around and among us? As the answer he said that we are so used to depending on and imitating others that we lack the individual foundation of moral and national strength. We tried to imitate France, we followed Germany-- and we see what is happening in one country and in the other. Our foundation must be faith, faith that is alive, faith that knows martyrdom and heroism, faith that is apostolic, the faith of Sobieski and Kordecki, from which is <pb facs="5423968_9_0984.jpg" n="4"/>derived the love for God and one another. Such faith does not doubt, but lives on and keeps on building. Whatever evils are besetting us is because we lack such faith and love. Poland fell because it sinned, because the rich oppressed the people; instead of loving God and one another they gossiped, displayed their licentiousness and selfishly thought only of themselves.</p>
   <p>And here, too, among the Poles in America, a lot of evil is being nurtured. The sins of the rich are becoming more and more prevalent among us. We lack faith, sincerity and self-denial for our church and our national unity. Selfish interests, schemes, dishonesty and unrest are torturing our hearts.</p>
   <p>In this picture of our life, here and there you will find a little sunshine, but the largest part of it is dark. We must free ourselves from the bondage of moral oppression, go forward, and above all build a firm foundation of faith. Through God, love and truth will our nation be resurrected. Pride and envy should be eradicated from our hearts; we should love our brethren and strive for enlightenment; then conditions will improve. Let us go forward and spread <pb facs="5423968_9_0985.jpg" n="5"/>the teachings of morality, and good will. Let us organize libraries, educate our young people, bring relief to the poor, and peace will settle among us.</p>
   <p>Such was the gist of the pastor's speech. It made an indelible impression on the audience; it spoke to the hearts of many--and many will be inclined to look within themselves and seek improvement.</p>
   <p>The celebration, which was most remarkable, due to the oratory of the last speaker, was concluded with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland) by the entire audience.</p>
