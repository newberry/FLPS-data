<title level="a">HOLY TRINITY PARISH STAGES NOVEMBER DEMONSTRATION</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday, November 30, a November demonstration, commemorating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the uprising against Russian oppression, was staged at the Holy Trinity Parish School hall. The audience filled all available space and many people were turned away.</p>
   <p>The affair was opened by A. X. Centella. Michael Majewski was chairman and J. Olbinski was secretary.</p>
   <p>The first speech was made by the Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of Holy Trinity Parish. He spoke about the love for the fatherland, harmony, and unity; about organizing, etc. The pastor urged everyone to be staunch in support of their religion. Warm applause followed as the speech came to an end.</p>
   <p>Other speakers who also spoke in Polish were: Dr. Kodis, who spoke on the <pb facs="5423968_9_0780.jpg" n="2"/>conditions existing in Europe and in America; M. J. Sadowski, secretary of the Polish, Roman Catholic Union, who spoke about present-day conditions; while A. Czechowicz, teacher at the Holy Trinity Parish School, spoke about national duties and the Polish schools.</p>
   <p>The speech of Mr. Czechowicz will appear in tomorrow's issue of the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>Judges Becker and Tuthill spoke in English. Judge Becker expressed sincere sympathy for the Poles. Judge Richard S. Tuthill, whose speech was in the same vein, spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"I was familiar with Polish history when a child--and am a great worshipper of this nation. There was a time when Poland was one of the most prosperous countries of Europe. Today the wild despotism of Russia and other countries has wiped it off the roll of existing nations. But we have the means to review the <pb facs="5423968_9_0781.jpg" n="3"/>valor of Poland's heroes: I am convinced that a time will come when freedom will arrive for Poland--and that it will be a greater country than ever before."</p>
   <p>A resolution condemning the partitionings of Poland was made and accepted. The text was prepared by Attorney Max Drzemala [also Drezmal].</p>
   <p>Besides the above speeches, song, music, and elocution combined to make an interesting program. The Chopin and Wanda choirs entertained with songs, Anthony Mallek played the piano, Mr. Gatkowski and Miss Wojtalewicz sang solos, and recitations were delivered by Kadecki, John Mallek, and Adam Bebnowski, all students of the parish school.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with the showing of magic lantern slides. Patriotic and other pictures of interest were shown on the screen.</p>
   <p>A collection was made for the parish school and library. On the whole the <pb facs="5423968_9_0782.jpg" n="4"/>exercise was a success.</p>
