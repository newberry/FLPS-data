<title level="a">ANNIVERSARY OF ST. ADALBERT CELEBRATED BY RELIGIOUS AND PATRIOTIC EXERCISES AT ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH</title></bibl>

   <p>The nine hundredth anniversary of the death of St. Adalbert awakened in the people of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish great religious and patriotic feeling. This feeling was even greater if awakened in the hearts of those who realized the lack of fervent faith and true patriotism prevalent on strange soil. As it happens, there are some on American soil who have quickly shed the dust of their country, their Polish culture and ideals, and have been quickly transformed into disbelievers and cosmopolitans.</p>
   <p>A commemorative exercise was staged by the parishioners at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall yesterday (Sunday) afternoon at 2:30. The Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor, opened the program and, after an introductory speech, called upon John Gniot to act as chairman and Leon Szopinski as recording secretary. The program was opened with the singing of a religious song, "Mother of God," by the parish choir. This old religious song, which <pb facs="5423968_9_1152.jpg" n="2"/>was sung by the martyrs many centuries ago, aroused great feeling in the audience. It prepared the crowd for the three speeches which followed.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, superior of the Resurrection Fathers, gave the initial address, and was followed by Peter Ligman and the Reverend Barzynski. All three speeches were acclaimed by the people. The Reverend Sedlaczek presented the historical facts of the influence of Catholicism on the Polish nation. Mr. Ligman spoke about the "simpletons" who are noted for their empty vociferations, a practice which is indicative of the weakness of our "patented" patriots who preach the shortcomings of religion and favor severance from the Church [Roman Catholic] for which St. Adalbert gave his life. The Reverend Barzynski pointed out how the life and martyrdom of St. Adalbert should influence our lives. The pastor also indicated how his life influences the clergy, whose duty is to fight for the ideals of this great saint on strange soil amidst new paganism, and said that this struggle will continue until there is one "flock and shepherd".</p>

   <p>The beautiful speeches were interspersed with verses and declamations. Among the outstanding monologues delivered were those of Vincent J. Jozwiakowski and Miss Rosalie Gorzynska. Three students from the Holy Family Academy, Miss Jaroslawa Weclewska, Miss Sophia Knapinska, and Miss Mary Malinska, brought glory and recognition to their school and teachers by their stirring rendition of patriotic and religious verses. The mixed choir of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish held the interest of the audience with their songs. Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, Miss Mary Barzynska, Stanislaus Szwajkart, and Stephen Schultz joined in playing "Jubilee Overture" by Weber and the "Soldiers Chorus" from Gounod's "Faust" on the piano. The exercise was concluded with the singing of "God Save Poland" by the audience.</p>
   <p>Although the Poles of Chicago were not able to make the pilgrimage to Gnesen, Poland, where the body of St. Adalbert lies at rest, they were able to demonstrate their feeling through an exercise at the parish hall. This program was a climax to the religious services celebrated during the morning. The entire affair was a just tribute to the first Polish martyr, who died nine hundred years ago.</p>
