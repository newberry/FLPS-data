   <p>A Polish papal journal, discussing the great Polish material wealth that the Polish people have in the Roman-Catholic churches, states:</p>
   <p>"Our acquisition in that field is so great that even other nationalities may be jealous of us on account of it.</p>
   <p>"'Our' Polish churches and school buildings are among the most beautiful and most magnificent in America.</p>
   <p>"Let us take a look at 'our' wealth in the land of Washington, gathered in the name of religion and nationality; indeed, we should be proud of it, for in this respect we are better than other races, because none of them have gained that much for themselves in such a short time.</p>
   <p>"Hundreds of Polish parishes, hundreds of Polish churches, hundreds of Polish priests and nuns, and a number of Polish organizations in the name of faith are headed by the Polish Roman-Catholic Union."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1642.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is hard to understand what the editor means by such nonsense. It seems to us that the editor jeers at our humble Polish people. On the other hand we realize that this was written by a "papal" editor and in a "papal" newspaper. Would he care to sneer at his own camp?</p>
   <p>Who will believe them? There is no Pole with such a limited mind who would not know and grieve over the fact that papal priests have squeezed out millions of dollars from Polish people, for magnificent churches and schools and then handed them over to the bishops of other nationalities, enemies of our people.</p>
   <p>A case in Madison, Illinois. We still remember the affair in Madison, where a bishop of another nationality made a disposition of a Polish church by changing it into a dance hall and telling the Poles to join the Irish parish and pay their debts there.</p>
   <p>Another example. We have another very vivid example in Saint Tekla's parish. There the "Polish slaves" have built the church and the German <pb facs="5423968_9_1643.jpg" n="3"/>cardinal declared arrogantly that it is not a Polish parish and the church is not for the Poles.</p>
   <p>He told the truth. The cardinal is right, for all so called Polish churches do not in reality belong to the Poles, for they are the property of others. The cardinal took a half million dollars to Rome but he indebted Polish churches and schools. The Polish slave will pay it off. The swell descriptions of the great Polish fortunes invested in Polish churches and schools are common everyday frauds.</p>
   <p>Yes! The Poles have built magnificent churches, for which they paid millions of dollars but those million dollar fortunes are and will remain the property of others.</p>
