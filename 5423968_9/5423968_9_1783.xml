<title level="a">ST. CASIMIR'S SOCIETY CELEBRATES THIRTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the members of St. Casimir's Society celebrated their thirty-fifth anniversary at Kosciuszko's hall, located in St. Stanislaus' parish. Along with this special ceremony, officers for the following year were installed. The hall was gaily decorated. The officers were seated at the head of the arranged tables. An interesting program was presented. It was as follows:</p>
   <p>Prayer was said by the chaplain of the society, Fr. Francis Pieczinski. C. R. Joseph Liss, president of the society, pointed out the purpose of the celebration and emphasized the aims of the organization. At the conclusion of his speech, Mr. Liss called upon his predecessor, Joseph Grabowiecki, who emphasized the early hardships of the society and other crises. After this, the new officers were installed. They took an oath before Fr. Pieczynski, who told the new leaders the importance of their work, and told them to fulfill their duties in the name of God and their people. An <pb facs="5423968_9_1784.jpg" n="2"/>appetizing after-dinner meal was then served. During the course of the meal, popular music was played sweetly.</p>
   <p>After the meal, the program was continued. One of the early founders of the society, Julian Szczepanski, was called upon to say a few words. He spoke about the early history of this society and the difficult barriers faced after it was launched. The struggle, according to him, to continue its early existence was no easy problem. In conclusion, he expressed a warm desire for the continuance of the good work and the expansion of the society as a whole. Before the speaker took his chair, he gave a toast to all the original founders. Gifts which were donated by the Polish businessmen were presented by Edmund Mucha who passed them out to deserving members. Matthew Reptowski received an umbrella; Valentine Banul was presented a box of cigars; Felix Kuczynski was given a beautifully framed picture; and a hand-tailored tie went to Louis Zielinski.</p>
   <p>After the presentation of gifts, the following were called to speak: Francis Szwed, secretary pro tempore and former vice-president, Stanislaus Cywinski.</p>

   <p>Both spoke words of praise about the new officers, and expressed wishes for a continued progress.</p>
   <p>A quartet, made up of Joseph Kondziorski, Frederick Gabryszewski, Felix Gabryszewski, and Bruno Sroki, sang a number of Polish songs. Next on the program were the short speeches of the following: Paul Giersch, former treasurer, Anthony A. Kloska, Victor Gorke, Francis Brodzinski, Simon Waszko, and Vincent Klajbor, secretary. The last speaker on the program was the president of the society, Joseph Liss, who pledged that he would do his best to have the society prosper under his administration. The singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (O Lord, who has given salvation to Poland) terminated the program.</p>
   <p>St. Casimir's Society has two hundred fifty members at present. It ranks as one of the finest and strongest at St. Stanislaus' parish.</p>
   <p>The officers for the New Year will be:</p>
