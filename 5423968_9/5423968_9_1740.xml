   <p>A great day in the Polish settlement of Hammond, Indiana, was August 17, 1924 for on that day they celebrated the laying of a cornerstone for a new St. Casimir's church. This parish came into existence thirty-four years ago. At that time there stood in Hammond, Indiana, on Russell Street, St. Joseph's church, in which services were held occasionally by different Polish priests. In 1890 there was a first meeting of Polish members who agreed to start a parish of their own and they named it St. Casimir's Parish. Father Casimir Kobylinski suggested the name. They bought eight lots for $2,400, and erected a building which was used as church, school, and Sisters' house. Father Kobylinski was the Pastor of that parish for a few years. Before he left there were about 125 families. In 1911, Father Felix Seroczynski took charge of the parish which under his management started to grow. The debts were paid off, the membership increased and there were fifty-five children <pb facs="5423968_9_1741.jpg" n="2"/>attending school. The new church has been started. The weather was beautiful. The ceremony of laying the cornerstone was performed by Bishop Paul P. Rhode, Green Day, Wisconsin, in which participated many societies from Hammond and adjacent towns. There was a great celebration and happiness among the parishioners.</p>
   <p>The joy was great because the first Polish Bishop in America was to perform the ceremony. At 8 A. M. Bishop Paul Rhode said a mass, after which he preached a sermon praising the parishioners for their good work. Other masses followed the sermon. The church was filled by 2:30 o'clock. There was a procession of different societies and as it marched through the streets, other societies from adjacent towns joined. It was a grand day.</p>
