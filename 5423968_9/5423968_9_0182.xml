   <p>We have very important and gratifying information for our readers.</p>
   <p>The proposed Polish mass meeting to establish a Polish League in America--an idea which has been the object of much publicity by the Polish press-has ceased to be just a project and has become a reality. A group of well-meaning people took this matter into their hands, after some consultation made a definite step in this direction yesterday.</p>
   <p>An invitation was written and signed calling all American Poles to a mass meeting to be held in Chicago on May 3, 1894. At this meeting the year 1894 will be dedicated to Kosciusko and a large Polish organization, called Liga Polska W Ameryce (Polish League in America), will be organized. The <pb facs="5423968_9_0183.jpg" n="2"/>organization will be patterned after the one organized by prominent Polish patriots and clergymen in the province of Posen in 1848.</p>
   <p>The Polish League in America will be very large in scope and will represent all the Poles in America. Not being a fraternal organization, but one to serve our motherland exclusively, the League will not have sick, death, or any other direct material benefits. Its aims being idealistic, it will work for the benefit of the community in patriotic, religious, educational, economic, and other fields. The League, which will not interfere in the affairs of other organizations, unless it is to wish them success in their good work, appeals to all parishes, societies, and organizations for their co-operation.</p>
   <p>The League plans to collect a general contribution of, say, one cent a month from every Pole. The funds thus collected will be used for the realization of its aims, one of which is education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0184.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The authority of the League will be vested in the Executive Committee and its branches.</p>
   <p>The people who planned this League are affiliated with many Polish organizations and represent many factions. They are headed by Mr. Erasmus Jerzmanowski (from New York City but now residing in Chicago), one of the leading representatives of the Poles and a very generous man.</p>
   <p>So much for the present about the new plan, the significance of which is understood by every one.</p>
   <p>The appeal in question, as well as a pamphlet, will be distributed among the Poles as soon as the work of printing it is finished. These two documents contain all the details of the new plan, a plan which may determine our future fate. We recommend them to our readers. In the meantime, we are glad that the first step has already been taken towards the realization of <pb facs="5423968_9_0185.jpg" n="4"/>this matter, which is so important to all Poles in America.</p>
