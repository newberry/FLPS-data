  <body>
   <p>(We have been requested to publish the following letter):</p>
   <p>Every supporter of the Polish League must be filled with indescribable joy because, already in the first few days, there was great enthusiasm for this organization; and whoever has observed closely the wide spread interest of the public in this matter must have come to the conclusion that this splendid organization will, in a very short time, grow to large proportions and gradually embrace such large circles of our emigration as was originally anticipated by its founders.</p>
   <p>The undersigned feels that he has been greatly honored by being chosen a secretary of the League, and he realizes the great responsibility which has been placed upon his shoulders. Impressed with the sacredness of the cause for which he has the honor and the duty to work, he knows very well that, on one hand he could not succeed in this task without the assistance of <pb facs="5423968_9_0037.jpg" n="2"/>ardent patriots, and on the other hand that he is assured of this assistance because he has had more than one opportunity to acquaint himself with the generosity of his countrymen in this respect.</p>
   <p>Just like the entire Central Board of the League which obligated itself to work wholeheartedly for the good of our motherland, so likewise will many experienced citizens and genuine patriots surely assist the Central Board of the League by deeds, whenever such necessity shall arise.</p>
   <p>The Central Board of the Polish League cannot accomplish very much during the first few days of its existence till certain necessary formalities are settled, which according to its nature require more or less time. According to the instructions given to the Central Board of the League by the mass meeting which created the League, the administration will, more or less, be formed during the next week. However, there are other preliminary functions which will require more time, and the regular work cannot begin officially before three or four weeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0038.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The unofficial secretarial work began the moment the League was founded. Before the necessary bookkeeping system was established, before the legal formalities confirming the organization were settled, before the rules, regulating the functions of the commissions and agencies were made, many persons expressed their desire to become members of the League. Many ardent patriots are soliciting members for the League on their own account, and the societies are active in this matter. Also there is much correspondence to be taken care of.</p>
   <p>This unusual activity already manifesting itself, promises on one hand great hopes, but on the other hand it threatens to create certain confusion during the first few days of the League's existence, unless the institution establishes the necessary rules, and adopts a fixed policy.</p>
   <p>Because, above all, it is a duty of the undersigned to call the attention of our countrymen to this circumstance, in behalf of the Central Board of the League; therefore, I take the liberty to say a few words about this <pb facs="5423968_9_0039.jpg" n="4"/>matter and ask them to help me in my work by paying attention to the remarks which I am submitting.</p>
   <p>I have no desire to arrest this vivacious movement or to cool off the enthusiasm manifested everywhere; on the contrary, even if it were premature, --which in my opinion can never be--I would like to contribute towards its growth. But I am obliged to adopt certain rules, which I was forced to observe myself in my preliminary work, and I must observe these rules if I desire to fulfill my duties conscientiously.</p>
   <p>These remarks are limited at the present to the following points:</p>
   <p>1. I am responsible only for services rendered by me, verbal or written, and for payments, gifts and donations handled by me or with my approval.</p>
   <p>2. I am willing to supply the necessary information either verbal or written, but I cannot be responsible for information given by other persons, <pb facs="5423968_9_0040.jpg" n="5"/>which, although generally given in good faith, is neither quite correct nor approved by the decisions of the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>3. Every applicant for membership to the League who makes a donation for this purpose should remember that the regular assessment allotted to the Polish National Fund is one cent a month from every person. Of course, a person may assess himself more according to his means and pay more. Such obligations will be scrupulously recorded by the secretary of the League. These voluntary offerings will constitute the fund of the Polish League which may be used for other purposes. This money, unlike the Polish National Fund is at the disposition of the League. Whoever donates a larger sum should designate how much he is donating to the Polish National Fund and how much to the League's Fund. This caused misunderstanding and confusion during the first few days, chiefly because some persons did not attend to this themselves but left it to their friends. Therefore, in the beginning in such cases where a larger sum was offered I was obliged to credit twelve cents to the Polish National Fund as a <pb facs="5423968_9_0041.jpg" n="6"/>yearly assessment and the rest went to the League Fund.</p>
   <p>4. Applicants for membership in the League are asked to supply us not only with their names but also with their addresses.</p>
   <p>5. It was decided at the mass meeting, though this was not presented formally to the League, that women and even children, who desire to pay twelve cents a year, should be gladly accepted as members of the League. Conforming to this decision I enrolled many women and children under 12 years of age. These are recorded separately.</p>
   <p>6. As I announced in another article, until the official opening of the League's offices by the Central Board, I will serve my countrymen every Monday and Thursday from 6:30 P. M. to 9:00 P. M. at the office of Wiara i Ojczyzna, located at 141-143 West Division Street.</p>
   <p>7. Until the commissions and agencies are established, the parishes <pb facs="5423968_9_0042.jpg" n="7"/>and organizations desiring to join the League are asked to communicate with me through their secretaries or other officials. Single persons who do not belong to any society may communicate with me direct.</p>
   <p>8. I will not publish the names of persons joining the League in the newspapers because this will be an impossibility. No paper will offer its columns for advertising these names which run into thousands. However, there is a list of these names in my office which may be seen by any person.</p>
   <p>As I am governed by the rules and decisions of the Central Board, I am obliged to apply the foregoing temporary rules that this vital movement which has already begun may not be arrested, and for the purpose of establishing some kind of order on which will depend the success of the organization.</p>
