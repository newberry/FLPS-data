   <p>Yesterday the St. Casimir's Youth Society celebrated the day of its patron saint very solemnly. At the early hour of 5 A.M., the members of the Society, dressed in full regalia, gathered at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church to hear Holy Mass and receive the Holy Communion. The Mass was said by Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, spiritual adviser of the Society, who also delivered a beautiful sermon, in which he spoke of Saint Casimir as an example of virtue for the Polish youth, whom he urged to love God and the Motherland, telling them that man may earn eternal happiness by leading a virtuous life.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon, after participating in vesper services, the members of the Society gathered in their hall, where they finished the celebration with patriotic exercises. The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. John Nering, president of the Society, opened the exercises with a short talk, in which he sketched the history of the Society, and encouraged the <pb facs="5423968_9_0150.jpg" n="2"/>members to persevere in their endeavors to preserve their slogan of "God and the Country".</p>
   <p>2. The choir of the Society sang "Saint Casimir, Thou Art Honored".</p>
   <p>3. Anthony Barwig recited a poem, "The Polish Language".</p>
   <p>4. Stanislaus Czajka read his well-prepared biography of Saint Casimir.</p>
   <p>5. F.A. Kwasigroch sang "Consolation", a patriotic song.</p>
   <p>6. John Kirulski recited "Elegy to Samuel Korecki".</p>
   <p>7. F.A. Kwasigroch, John Nering, and S.F. Cywinski sang "The Exile".</p>
   <p>8. Jacob Oszwaldowski delivered a lecture, "Polish Youth in Chicago". This very interesting lecture dealt with our condition in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0151.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>9. The choir of the society sang "Poland Is Not Lost".</p>
   <p>10. V.J. Jozwiakowski recited "Polish Hymn" with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>11. A quartet composed of F.A. Kwasigroch, J. Nering, R. Szajkowski, and S.F. Cywinski, accompanied by the choir of the Society, sang "Brothers", "The Anniversary", "Our Beautiful Poland", and "March of St. Casimir's Society".</p>
