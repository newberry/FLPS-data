   <p>Yesterday's ceremonies at the convention of the Polish Women's Alliance opened with an unusually good concert. In a hall literally packed with people, Mrs. Makowska, chairman of the convention committee, welcomed the delegates and guests. Then the choir of the department of education sang the "March of the Polish Women's Alliance", composed by Mr. A. Mallek.</p>
   <p>The culminating point of the evening was the truly inspiring speech of Mrs. Anna Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>"I welcome you, dear sisters, in the name of our organization. I welcome you sincerely as workers for the cause of nationalism," began Mrs. Neuman." Fifteen years have passed since the founding of the Polish Women's Alliance, fifteen years of hard work and struggle against obstacles. Now our organization stands upon a firm foundation, but we may not cease working because the development of this organization, which is so dear to us and which serves our homeland, depends on this work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1272.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"After summarizing briefly the history of the development of the Polish Women's Alliance, the president, who has earned recognition for her tireless work in the development of the organization, ended her speech with these words: "On the corner stone of our building these words are inscribed: 'The future of the Polish nation depends on the Polish women.' Now, when in Poland, far across the sea, our brothers are dying on the battlefields and their mothers, sisters, and wives are suffering hunger and privation, we should strive all the more to meet our obligation and to do our duty as Polish women, in whom the future of the Polish nation lies. Our homeland calls to us and, since we cannot serve it as we should wish, let us do what we can. Let us serve it through work leading to its rebirth, because Poland is a great thing--because a free Poland is the highest ideal and aim of every true daughter of the oppressed homeland."</p>
   <p>The reading of "A Medley of Polish Songs" was followed by a solo by Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch (Girl with lips like a raspberry), after which Miss Walery Sowka played a piano solo.</p>

   <p>The choir of the department of education of the Polish Women's Alliance gave an excellent rendition of "Kalina," after which the well-known violinist Mrs. Constance Krenz played, accompanied by Mr. Victor Hensel.</p>
   <p>The overture to "Norma" preceded the one-act operetta played by the orchestra under the direction of Mr. R. Hensel.</p>
   <p>The last number on yesterday's program was the one-act play "Trouble", in which the amateurs proved that through hard work excellent results can be obtained. The cast made one forget that this was an amateur performance and that one was listening to amateur singers. Mrs. H. Chmielowska admirably played the part of "Nosey" and the other three main roles, portrayed by Mrs. Weyna Idzikowska and Mackowicz, were played equally well. The choir deserves recognition not only for the excellent way in which it sang its numbers, but also for its manner of conducting itself on the stage, since moving about on the stage is so difficult for amateurs, especially for such a large choir.</p>
