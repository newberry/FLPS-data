   <p>On charges brought by H. Nagiel before the Censor of the Polish National Alliance against Zgoda for slander and falsification of the record of the Central Committee's meeting on December 16, 1892, a reply was received from the Censor by Mr. Nagiel. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Bay City, Michigan,</p>
   <p>December 18, 1892.</p>
   <p>H. Nagiel,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: Your complaints against the Central Committee and the editor of <pb facs="5423968_9_0262.jpg" n="2"/>Zgoda were received today and placed on record. The undersigned wishes to inform you that January 16, 1893, has been set aside as the date on which the Central Committee and the editor of Zgoda are to appear at the central headquarters of the Polish National Alliance, where they will be given a just and impartial hearing by me.</p>
   <p>Until such time as a decision can be given in this matter, I beg of you to remain patient and to avoid contact with the accused--by word or pen.</p>
   <p>It grieves me very much that I cannot be in Chicago any sooner, but my present duties as cashier in this section keep me busy.</p>
   <p>I am equally sorry that such matters take up so much of our valuable time and disrupt the harmony of the Polish National Alliance. In order to weed out the evil, I will appear in person.</p>
   <p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0263.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>M. Przybyszewski,</p>
   <p>Censor of the Polish National Alliance</p>
   <p>This letter has been published by us with the permission of the Censor. As the letter suggests, we will remain neutral in this matter until a decision is reached. In this respect the nonsense published in today's issue of Zgoda will also pass unnoticed. We reserve, however, the right to make known any documents or facts that may follow.</p>
