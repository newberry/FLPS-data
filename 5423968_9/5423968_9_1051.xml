   <p>The officers of the Polish societies [in St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish] had a meeting yesterday at 7:30 P. M. at the St. Stanislaus Kostka's school hall to discuss plans for the [celebration of the] 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus. All the societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish were represented. Delegates from St. Hedwig's parish were also present.</p>
   <p>The mission of Dr. Dunikowski, who recently came to Chicago from Europe, was discussed. The representatives of the various societies agreed to hold a meeting during the last few days of Dr. Dunikowski's stay, in order that he may have an opportunity to talk to as many of our Poles as possible. Further discussion of this proposed assembly will be continued this evening in hall number one of the school building. All society officers are welcome.</p>
