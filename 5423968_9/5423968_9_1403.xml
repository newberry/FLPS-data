   <p>(We have received the following correspondence regarding the Polish Catholic Congress, which we are glad to publish.)</p>
   <p>Chicago, January 29, 1896.</p>
   <p>Dear Brethren: Permit me to write a few words regarding the proposed Polish Catholic Congress, which is to take place this year. The heart of every Pole who really loves his country, is filled with pain, when he sees the indifference displayed by his compatriots--who have been forced to immigrate to this country--toward very important matters. We lack the ability of understanding one another and of acting together; we lack that ability because we overlook the most important thing, which should unite us for common action in this free land of America.</p>
   <p>The proposed Polish Catholic Congress is, without a doubt, the most important <pb facs="5423968_9_1404.jpg" n="2"/>project that has been conceived during the past few years. It concerns the welfare of all of us. It appears that the plan is close to being realized, and yet, there are many among us who look upon it with disfavor, and others who are indifferent to it.</p>
   <p>What is the cause of this situation? We cannot conceive of a more important or more beneficial proposal for all Polish Catholics. I do not refer here only to those who merely speak Polish and call themselves Poles, although their actions do not indicate any degree of patriotism; I mean those Polish Catholics in the United States who are truly patriotic, and who want to work for the welfare of their fatherland.</p>
   <p>Come, brothers, let's get to work! Let us all, by our sincere desire to call a Polish Catholic Congress, prove that we understand our duty. Let us show the world and our enemies, who think that they have buried our country forever, that Poland, although bound in chains, lives, and that we, her faithful sons <pb facs="5423968_9_1405.jpg" n="3"/>in a strange land, remember her and want to work for her. The most merciful God will bless our efforts, if we begin in His name, and will divert His anger from us, if we prove worthy of His mercy.</p>
   <p>Remember, dear brothers, the final words of our mothers and fathers, when we bade them farewell; remember the sincere advice of our former reverend pastors as we went out into the world; they urged us to remember our Holy Faith...and to remain forever faithful to it.</p>
   <p>With this faith in our hearts, inspired by the love of our country, the desire to see it free, and the desire to work for it with all our strength and means, let us support this Polish Catholic Congress with all our influence, and, God willing, we will see its success.</p>
   <p>Altogether, shoulder to shoulder, let us form an invincible force, against which all the schemes of our enemies will be of no avail; let us all support <pb facs="5423968_9_1406.jpg" n="4"/>this cause, which is so important to us now, and the result, with God's help, will be successful.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Joseph Kramer, 828 West 17th Street.</p>
