   <p>The first national celebration in the parish hall in Bridgeport was held yesterday. The celebration, arranged by all the local societies, both church and national, was very lovely. The hall was overcrowded. The audience listened intently for three-and-one-half hours to the speeches, singing, and recitations. All of the various numbers on the program were applauded with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Francis Wleklinski presided and called the celebration to order, and Mr. Swiatkowski was secretary. The first speaker was Mr. H. Nagiel, an editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski (Polish Daily News), who, after greeting those assembled for the first time in this new hall, spoke at length on the importance of the 1863 January Insurrection. He explained what our present national program should be, and in conclusion, he appealed to all those present to take part in the commemoration of the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>The little Eufrozyna Wleklinski recited a poem and really did it well. Then <pb facs="5423968_9_0719.jpg" n="2"/>the Zorza (Sunrise) Chorus sang; the small F. Wleklinski (quite a boy) recited; and the attorney, Mr. Nicodem L. Piotrowski, spoke beautifully and solemnly. He reviewed the present political situation and pointed to the war clouds hanging over Europe. These clouds are proof that we do not know the day or the hour when lightning will strike..... We should, therefore, always be prepared, and before anything happens, expend all efforts to educate ourselves and to be faithful to our nationalistic ideals.</p>
   <p>Then Miss Helen Reich recited a poem entitled "Pogrzeb Kosciuski" (The Funeral Of Kosciusko).</p>
   <p>After the beautiful singing of the St. Cecelia Choir and a recitation by the young Eugene Janiszewski, the chairman read the speech of Mr. Zbikniew Brodowski, the president of the Central Administration, who was forced to leave Chicago on business and therefore sent his speech in writing. Mr. Brodowski gave a historical sketch of the January Insurrection of 1863, explained the objects and aims of the Polish National Alliance, and warmly urged mutual action and education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0720.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Then the little Miss Martha Kliszewski recited a poem. After the singing by the school children, directed by Professor Reich, there followed a speech by Mr. M. Mezydlo.</p>
   <p>The speaker urged everyone to action and emphasized the need for collecting funds for national purposes. An active defense is our sacred duty. The money sent to Rapperschwil Switzerland, is not lost; it is the seed for our future freedom.</p>
   <p>The singing by the Zorza Chorus pleased everybody, as did the recitation by young Bauer.</p>
   <p>Next on the program, two small boys, M. Przekwas and Eugene Janiszewski, took part in a beautiful patriotic dialogue, and they were excellent. The smaller St. Cecelia Choir also sang. Then Mr. M. Sadowski, the secretary of the Polish National Alliance, spoke of the gratifying increase in the Polish population in America during the last fifteen years as a very encouraging sign. We not only are not losing our nationality, but each year we are giving greater evidence <pb facs="5423968_9_0721.jpg" n="4"/>of our patriotism. Let us work together. The organizations (the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish Union) should not separate us, but should bring us closer together to work for the common good of our fatherland.</p>
   <p>After the recitation of a poem by little Miss P. Bauer, Mr. F. Grygiel of Minneapolis presented a few well-chosen remarks and then recited a famous poem written on the field of battle by one of the participants in the Insurrection.</p>
   <p>There followed a collection for the new Parish hall and for the Rapperschwil fund by young ladies of the Zorza Chorus and St. Cecelia Choir. A sum of twenty-five dollars was realized.</p>
   <p>The singing of "God Save Poland" ended the celebration.</p>
   <p>This celebration was one of the grandest ever seen in Bridgeport, and it proves how patriotic our countrymen are in that community.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0722.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The local committee in charge of arrangements and the pastor Reverend Adolph Nawrocki, deserve the greatest praise.</p>
