  <body>
   <p>The committee composed of members from our two organizations has sent an invitation to many Poles of Chicago to attend a special meeting tomorrow evening at eight o'clock at A. Groenwald's hall. The purpose of the meeting is to determine whether or not it is possible to unite all the Poles belonging to various organizations into one unified group, and as one solid mass take part in the 400th Anniversary celebration of the discovery of America, which will be held on October 21.</p>
   <p>It is well known that previous plans for a unified participation did not fare so well, for reasons which we do not wish to mention. Many Poles realize the advantages of such unified action and are exerting every effort to settle their differences to the satisfaction of all.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that, despite the tactlessness of Zgoda, the aim of this meeting may be realized.</p>
