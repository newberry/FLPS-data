   <p>The festive celebration of the third of May was held Sunday evening in the parochial hall of Immaculate Conception of St. Mary's and witnessed by many of those who were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wojnowski opened the celebration and called upon Rev. father Francis Wojtalewicsz, who later called upon the alderman's secretary Mr. John Derpa to conclude the affair. After conclusion of a newly created symphony played by the Kornelia orchestra, Mr. Ignac Kowalski spoke. He spoke about the supernatural and natural ideas without which the nations cannot survive. Mr. Kowalski, as a public speaker, knows how to hold the people's interest on a subject, and his speech given for the Polish public in South Chicago was accepted with the utmost satisfaction from the listeners. The next event on the program was the presentation of the school children who sang "Hail, May morning star." Mrs. J. Pick recited the verse "On the shore." A member of the orchestra, Mr. J. Urban, played a solo on his clarinet with the accompaniment of the piano. Mr. Malolepszegi recited the verse "November," following him Mr. R. Andrzejewski played on the piano, they presented various other musical numbers on this program. Mr. P. Osada <pb facs="5423968_9_0603.jpg" n="2"/>translated the statutes of the Constitution of May the Third, informing the listeners of the meaning of the memorable deed, which the Poles accomplished before the fall of their mighty nation.</p>
