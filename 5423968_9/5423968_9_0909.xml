   <p>After opening the meeting and reading the reports of the last meeting, the subcommittees reported their unfinished work. [K.] Bielinski, who represented the Reception Committee, stated that the work of this Committee was almost finished. Peter Kiolbassa and A. J. Kowalski went personally to the Governor of the State of Illinois and invited him to participate in the manifestation. We are informed by the latest dispatches that the Lieutenant Governor has accepted the invitation. The rest of the speakers and guests promised their participation. One of the speeches in English will be delivered by the censor of the Polish National Alliance, who will speak about Kosciusko's activities.</p>
   <p>Reporters of American and Polish newspapers will receive invitations in a few days, and Mr. Bielinski has promised to furnish a stenographer for the manifestation.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of renting a hall and hiring a band reported that it <pb facs="5423968_9_0910.jpg" n="2"/>had accomplished its work.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as a tableau could not be presented because the hall of Battery D has no stage, this performance was cancelled. It was decided, however, that the hall would be suitably decorated for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The work of decorating the hall was entrusted to the Tableau Committee, which is composed of [S.] Zahajkiewicz, Kowalski, Sawicki, Wojanski, and Rys. Fifty dollars was appropriated for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The Badge Committee reported that it had also accomplished its task. The badges for the societies that paid their share of the expenses of the manifestation are at the office of Mr. [S.] Napieralski, the head cashier. The rest of the badges will be distributed among the Polish communities, where they will be sold at ten cents each to those who do not belong to any organization but desire to participate in the manifestation.</p>
   <p>Those who do not belong to any society may buy a badge at the following <pb facs="5423968_9_0911.jpg" n="3"/>drugstores: Szwajkart's, Bardonski's, Xelowski's and Kaczmarek's. In other Polish communities the badges will be sold at places designated by the cashier.</p>
   <p>The Badge Committee was instructed to take charge of the sale of badges at the entrance of the hall of Battery D.</p>
   <p>According to the announcement made by Lisztewnik in the name of all marshals, the march to the hall of Battery D will start at 11:30 A. M.</p>
   <p>The Resolutions Committee will meet today for the purpose of preparing resolutions.</p>
   <p>The Program Committee will meet once more on Saturday, April 28, at the office of Zgoda, to translate the program into English in order to publish it in the American newspapers. The task of translating the program and submitting it to the American newspapers was entrusted to Bielinski.</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of the secretary, the members of the [various] committees <pb facs="5423968_9_0912.jpg" n="4"/>decided that the Central Committee should direct an appeal through the American newspapers to all manufacturers employing Poles, asking them to excuse their Polish employees from work on that day. This task was entrusted to Bielinski.</p>
   <p>Finally, a Reception Committee to take care of the guests and keep order in the hall was chosen. The members of this committee will wear special badges.</p>
   <p>All marshals of the societies are requested to call for their badges and to deposit the collected money at the cashier's office not later than Friday, April 27.</p>
   <p>One hundred and fifteen societies will participate in the Kosciusko manifestation.</p>
   <p>No more general meetings of all delegates will be held.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the Kosciusko manifestation will meet at Pulaski Hall on Monday, April 30, at 4 P. M., and not on Sunday, as was announced.</p>
