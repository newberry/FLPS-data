   <p>According to the censor, the third question to be discussed at the coming Polish National Alliance convention is the Immigration Home. Those who think that the administration of the Polish National Alliance has in mind the continued support and growth of this New York institution are greatly mistaken. The time is past when the Alliance members, to spite an opposing faction, appropriated large sums of money for the Polish seminary in Detroit. This was done to win over the Catholic faction and the Catholic Alliance members.</p>
   <p>Today times have changed. From the time the Alliance became interested in the Polish National Fund in Rapperschwil, Switzerland, and on the assumption that we should direct our efforts to support the patriotic treasury there, <pb facs="5423968_9_1394.jpg" n="2"/>as there was no work in the nationalistic field here in America, the activity of the Polish liberals has been aimed at splitting whatever is still whole. They oppose everything we have and try to replace it with something new. In this respect the administration of the Polish National Alliance, with the help of unwise or subversive liberal writers, favors openly and secretly the Independent Church [group that severed its connection with the Pope] for the purpose of distracting the people from the true faith of our forefathers and from the authority and guidance of the Holy See. To achieve its aims, the Alliance extols the delusive national education offered in English by nonsectarian public schools; it also praises the Jewish newspaper Kropidlo (Sprinkler), with its offensive stories, as "Barbara Ubryk." It is along this path that it proposes to guide the projected Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily), whose sole purpose will be to "kill the parochial daily" (our Dziennik Chicagoski) and check the influence of the Polish Catholic press in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1395.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>True to their policy of not leaving anything alone, some leaders of the Alliance are dreaming of a new Immigration Home--their desire being to bring ruin to the already existing Home, which they now overlook because it was founded by Polish Catholics and Polish Catholic priests.</p>
   <p>A war against Catholicism has been declared today. Formerly the Alliance opposed the Chicago "sprinklers" [probably the readers of Kropidlo are meant] and the "laggers". According to the Alliance leaders, all the Polish Roman Catholic priests are bad, while the true patriots are those from the Independent Church movement. They, with the help of Zgoda (Harmony), are elevating the "soiled banner of Christ." With their help the Polish Roman Catholic churches and schools are going to be "changed into factories." With their help Dziennik Narodowy is going to chase Dziennik Chicagoski out of every home, along with all the other Polish Roman Catholic newspapers. Through their assistance, the present Immigration Home is going to fall to pieces and a new Independent home is to sprout in its stead.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1396.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is simple to understand that the liberals do not wish that all these "noble" projects succeed. It is only natural that success does not concern them. They are content when their foolish words are swallowed by the Polish National Alliance horde. This clique knows that there is money in the Alliance treasury. They are convinced that the Polish National Alliance is something more than a benevolent home for the Chicago exploiters. All the money that has not been used should be wasted in patriotic projects and fantastic dreams. Therefore new jobs--for managers, clerks, bookkeepers, and agents--will be created for the proposed Dziennik Narodowy and the new Immigration Home.</p>
   <p>It must be pointed out that the censor of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. Helinski, does not consider the proposed Dziennik Narodowy, and the Immigration Home as Polish enterprises, since these projects are proposed by people not worthy of being considered Polish and unworthy of their Polish names.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1397.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As to the suggestion of subduing the Dziennik Chicagoski through a private enterprise, our opinion is going to be withheld. But opposition to the present Immigration Home, which is being supported by Polish people and Polish institutions, cannot be overlooked. It would not be fair to be indifferent to this matter.</p>
   <p>He who does not think that the present dreamers of the Polish National Alliance are digging their own graves, compels the better forces of this organization to have the administration fall into more capable hands. That these better forces are going to have a tough nut to crack at the coming Polish National Alliance convention is not denied. The duty of the true Polish-American press is to support the better faction of the Alliance, for the object of the Polish Roman Catholic group is not to create disorder and dissension within the ranks of the Polish National Alliance but to uphold it upon sound principles and to fulfill our work on such fields as will be beneficial to us in the future.</p>
