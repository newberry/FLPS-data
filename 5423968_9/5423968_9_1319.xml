   <p>The recent convention of the Polish Military Alliance, held in Chicago on September 4th and 5th, 1910, indicated a marked progress in this very patriotic and important organization. This was the second convention held since the time when the two military organizations united into one alliance. As individual associations they were previously known as the Second Corps of the Polish Army and as the Polish Military Alliance. By the consolidation of the two smaller, closely related organizations into one large body, the Polish leaders gave evidence that they are not only brave soldiers but good diplomats as well. The nation is one and, hence, its army should be one. When a nation has no army then various military organizations might be formed in various localities, each independent of the other. But as soon as several such organizations are discovered they should unite into one army <pb facs="5423968_9_1320.jpg" n="2"/>or into one military alliance, which would remain under one general administration. The two previously mentioned military organizations acted thus and are now convinced of the sanity of their step in that direction.</p>
   <p>The Polish Military Alliance was able to present twenty-two divisions at its second convention. It has a total of more than seven hundred members. This, of course, is a rather small number in comparison to the number of Poles in America and the numerous military societies in the Polish parishes. It is, however, an alliance presaging great strength in the future when it will, undoubtedly, develop by accepting new groups that still stand aside as independent.</p>
   <p>A sincere acknowledgement is due all those who succeeded in uniting these two military organizations. A great deal of time was sacrificed by these people in organizing this civic Polish army. Such leaders as Maciejewski, Andrzejewski, Schmidt, Czechowicz and others, whose names appear in a more <pb facs="5423968_9_1321.jpg" n="3"/>complete report of their activity at the convention, have been involved in this national cause. They have encouraged their brethren to volunteer into the Polish military service, organized groups, combining them into one Alliance and directed them into a large, general Polish National Alliance. The entire nation acknowledges the efforts of such men. It extends them not only its sincere wishes for success, but also due recognition among all their fellow citizens.</p>
   <p>A sincere recognition is also due Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, the pastor of the Holy Trinity Parish in Chicago. His words of encouragement have filled the hearts of many. This priest and patriot has pointed out two tasks that the military organization must fulfill, namely, to maintain the great military tradition among the people and to develop strength and discipline. At the conclusion of his speech, Reverend Sztuczko expressed his wish, which is also the wish of all good Poles, namely, that all military groups, national as well as those formed at the churches, should join the Polish Military Alliance and thus create a great and powerful military organization. The voice of this <pb facs="5423968_9_1322.jpg" n="4"/>honorable and universally respected priest will be answered by a reverberating echo in all Polish hearts and will bring better results than several calls of encouragement in articles or at meetings.</p>
   <p>The convention of the Polish Military Association did not forget our great Polish National Alliance, with whom the Military Alliance combined upon the principle of autonomy, that is, upon the power and right of self-government. An excellent paragraph about the Polish National Alliance can be found in the resolutions of the convention, the text of which is hereby noted:</p>
   <p>"Whereas the Polish National Alliance, the greatest Polish organization, protects and has under its banner various smaller institutions, among which the Polish Military Alliance is included, and nowhere is the organization omitted wherever a need for national ideals is present, we therefore present our feeling of appreciation to the Central Committee, and we wish the organization a most prosperous growth."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1323.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance expresses its sincere thanks to the Military Alliance for this recognition. It (the Polish National Alliance) needs no praise because it works, not for personal gain or glory, but for the Motherland and for the welfare of Polish emigration. It is pleasant, however, to meet with an evidence of recognition; because this recognition is simultaneously an evidence of patriotism and of political sanity by those who understand the great mission of the Polish National Alliance and who extend their efforts toward its development.</p>
   <p>By building the Polish Military Alliance, by organizing this national army, they also contribute to the development of the Polish National Alliance and by that they fulfill the greatest obligation to the immigrant Poles. They are urgently requested to continue in their well-directed work, having the assurance that the Polish National Alliance is capable of repaying them properly. The Polish Military Alliance has a great task before it. Its most important mission is to unite the innumerable military groups existing at all the parishes, to conbine them under one banner. Why, in Chicago alone, <pb facs="5423968_9_1324.jpg" n="6"/>there are so many of these individual military associations that they could constitute a rather large corps. The newly elected administration is composed of the following members: Maciejewski, president; Poklacki, vice-president; Anrzejewski, general secretary; Wittort, treasurer; Przymorski, commander;Opalewski, Cieslak, Stefanowicz, trustees. These gentlemen will undertake the task of uniting all the independent military groups. The very names of these people would indicate that organizational work will progress with speed and will bring the desired results. The newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, will offer every assistance possible to the Millitary Alliance. We only ask for the greatest possible amount of information that we may have material to write on. The members are requested to forward their letters relative to their groups, to forward statements and all material that they might think useful to their cause. The Dziennik Zwiazkowy will always find a place in its columns.</p>
   <p>The next convention of the Polish Military Alliance will be held in Detroit. It is fervently hoped that its membership will increase a thousandfold and that its efforts will be marked by success.</p>
