   <p>Last Sunday, at 4 P.M., the Organizacya Patryotyczna [Patriotic Organization] of Saint Stanislaus Kostka's Parish held its annual meeting, at which we had the opportunity to hear about the good work it accomplished last year. The Organization is progressing slowly but steadily. That it progressed during last year is revealed by the increased activity of its branches--the Choir, the Knights, the Dramatic Club, and the Polish Falcons. The Patriotic Organization observed the January and November anniversaries of Polish insurrections independently, and the May anniversary in co-operation with other societies. The proceeds from these activities were quite substantial, allowing the Patriotic Organization to set aside a certain sum of money for charitable and patriotic purposes.</p>
   <p>Statement of Last Year's Activities</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0188.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(1) The Patriotic Organization defrayed the expenses of the protest against the extradition treaty between the United States and Russia;</p>
   <p>(2) It donated $20.40 to the orphans;</p>
   <p>(3) It bought a fifteen-dollar wreath for the late Theophil Lenartowicz, poet and sculptor;</p>
   <p>(4) It gave $110 to the Knights;</p>
   <p>(5) It donated $50 to the parish library;</p>
   <p>(6) It spent $130 for a float on Polish Day;</p>
   <p>(7) It donated $100 to the Lwow Fair; and</p>
   <p>(8) It donated $120 to aid the poor during Christmas.</p>
   <p>These figures prove that the Organization is active, even though it has a relatively small number of members, many of whom do not pay their dues of ten cents a month. In spite of this, the Organization collected $741.64, out of which it spent $565 for charities and other good purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0189.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At its last meeting, the Patriotic Organization agreed to help the parish Falcons financially, so that the latter may buy the athletic equipment they need. It was also agreed to celebrate the January anniversary of the Polish insurrection.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob Mucha moved that the old board of directors should be re-elected for the next year. The motion was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>The meeting, which many members did not attend, ended with a prayer by the pastor.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the Patriotic Organization's noble deeds written with golden letters in the book of notable achievements may, with the help of God, become a stimulus for the negligent and the indifferent.</p>
