<title level="a">NATIONAL CELEBRATION IN THE SAINT JOHN CANTIUS PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The first May national celebration ever held in this parish took place yesterday in the Saint John Cantius parish hall, under the auspices of the young men. The celebration was opened with a march by the parish band.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Kalisz was president, and the undersigned was secretary.</p>
   <p>The opening speech was given by Reverend Floryan Matuszewski, who urged those assembled, in very beautiful words, to attend the national celebrations so necessary to us here in exile, regularly and in great numbers. "The celebrations," said the reverend speaker, "awaken our spirit of patriotism, acquaint us with the history of our fatherland, and protect us against losing our nationality."</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Mr. Henry Nagiel, explained the meaning of the Constitution of the Third of May, 1791, and the lessons taught us by it. Mr. Ignatz Kowalski <pb facs="5423968_9_0676.jpg" n="2"/>spoke about the causes that gave us the Constitution, what value it had, and why we celebrate it every year. Mr. Kwasinski spoke, in an interesting vein, to the young people. Then Miss Sikorska spoke to the Polish women, appealing to them to keep their Polish language and to perform the duties of Polish Catholic women. The speakers were applauded warmly.</p>
   <p>The piano solos by Miss M. Barzynska and by Mr. Stanislaus Szwajkart were beautifully rendered. They were well applauded, and Miss Barzynska was given a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>The tiny S. Szolarecka recited correctly the poem "One Hundred Years Of Exile," then Miss N. Piatkowska and Miss R. Olszanowska sang a duet,"Where is my home?"</p>
   <p>Reverend Nowicki then earnestly exhorted the audience to peace, unity, and love, and urged all to guard our most cherished possessions--religion and language.</p>
   <p>The play, "Through Gratitude," pleased everybody. Mr. Rydwalski, in the role of <pb facs="5423968_9_0677.jpg" n="3"/>Wojtus, performed well, and his actions caused gales of laughter throughout the audience. The other amateurs also played their roles excellently. The audience did not stint in its applause for their efforts.</p>
   <p>The orchestra and the singing of the Saint Gregory Choir completed the program. The pastor, Reverend John Kasprzycki, thanked those assembled for participating in the celebration, also the amateurs for their efforts; he urged the parishioners to attend such celebrations often. He was rewarded with thunderous applause for his sincere remarks.</p>
   <p>The singing of the Polish national anthem, "God Save Poland," concluded the celebration.</p>
   <p>S. Chmielewski, Secretary.</p>
