   <p>The large Pulaski Hall was already packed by eight o'clock. The exercises began with a procession from Pulaski Hall to St. Adalbert's church, where religious services were held. Members of the following organizations took part in the procession: Alliance of Polish Youth, Polish Falcons (men and women), and the Confederation of Polish Youth.</p>
   <p>After the opening of the exercises by Mr. J.M. Sienkiewicz, president of the Alliance of Polish Youth, Mr. Francis Kunicki was called upon to act as secretary. Representatives of the following organizations were present at the exercises: Polish National Alliance, Central Committee of National Defense, Alliance of Polish Falcons, Polish <pb facs="5423968_9_0557.jpg" n="2"/>Women's Alliance, and the Confederation of Polish Youth.</p>
   <p>The program of the exercises was as follows:</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Here follows the entire program, consisting of songs, declamations, and instrumental solos; an address by Mr. F. Danisch, clerk of the Municipal Court of Chicago, on the present European situation; and an appeal by Mr. Sienkiewicz for contributions. Seventy-seven dollars were collected for the National Treasury. Professor T. Siemiradzki delivered an historical address, describing Poland's battles for independence and giving a short biographical sketch of R. Traugut's life. Pictures of the Insurrection of 1863 were shown with the aid of lantern slides. After the adoption of a resolution, the text of which is given here, and the singing of "God Save Poland" and "Poland Is Not Lost," the meeting was closed.]</p>

   <p>Resolution</p>
   <p>"On the fiftieth anniversary of the execution, on the heights of the Warsaw Citadel, of the members of the National Government, together with Poland's last dictator, Romualb Traugut, as head of this government.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, A terrible war of peoples has broken out over Europe, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our own people are murdering each other, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The long awaited moment for Poland has at last arrived, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, For the past fifty years we have paid homage to the memory of the heroes who died for the freedom of the nation, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We have often vowed loyalty to the idea of independence, be it <pb facs="5423968_9_0559.jpg" n="4"/>"Resolved, That we Poles, regardless of our views and opinions, gathered together at Pulaski Hall, deeply moved by the gravity of the moment, and having great faith in the future of the nation, attest all our previous vows and swear before God and the people, to offer our goods and our lives, if our homeland, fighting for its rights, which have not been voided by time, demands it of us today."</p>
