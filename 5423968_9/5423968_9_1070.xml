   <p>In honor of the one hundred and first anniversary of the Polish Constitution special services were held yesterday at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Parish. Rev. Fr. Felix Zwiardowski, C. R., former pastor, who has come here to celebrate his twenty-fifth anniversary of priesthood, officiated at a solemn high mass. This mass was offered for our persecuted people. By the kind grace of God, let us hope that freedom will come soon to our people. Let the prefatory words of this mass, "In unde mors oriebatur inde vita resurgeret," come true. Let our oppressions earn for us the resurrection of our people.</p>
   <p>Because yesterday was a regular workday, the church was not filled to capacity, instead school children filled the pews which would have been ordinarily occupied by the parishioners. Consequently, the younger generation had an opportunity to share in the celebration of one of the most endearing moments in the hearts of all our people. This participation enabled <pb facs="5423968_9_1071.jpg" n="2"/>them to understand and appreciate the cause for which their forefathers have lost their lives on the fields of battle.</p>
   <p>The church choir sang their best during the entire mass, especially at the offertory when national hymns were rendered. The songs of the choir enriched the solemn mass services. They brought the possibilities of a free Poland closer to view.</p>
   <p>Patriotic rites were also held at the church during the evening. Rev. Fr. Kobrzynski officiated at the rosary services. Later, Rev. Fr. Zwiardowski gave a sermon appropriate for the occasion. With profound words, he painted a picture of the hardships our people have endured during the past century at the hands of the merciless Russians. Although Russia calls herself christian, her christianity is far below that of Turkey. He pointed out that patience coupled with endurance will someday bring to light the ray of hope for the resurrection of Poland. If we can withstand the onslaught <pb facs="5423968_9_1072.jpg" n="3"/>of Russia, if we can keep harmony and peace intact within our own ranks, and if we will fall back upon the religious beliefs of our fathers, our cause will be won.</p>
   <p>During the services of the Blessed Sacrament, the church choir sang two Polish patriotic hymns. Rev. Fr. Kobrzynski gave an inspirational talk for the continuance of the Polish spirit of old.</p>
   <p>We are very thankful that the priests of St. Stanislaus Kostki's church make plans and arrangements for the celebration of Polish national holidays, because we firmly believe, whoever is with God, God is with them.</p>
