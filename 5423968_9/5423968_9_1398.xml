   <p>To all Reverend Pastors and Polish Societies:</p>
   <p>We wish to remind all reverend pastors and Polish societies that it is now only three months before the opening of the Polish Catholic Congress, and that there are many things yet to be attended to before then.</p>
   <p>We therefore respectfully ask all reverend pastors and officers of societies to assist us as much as possible in our work. We appeal to all reverend pastors to select delegates to the Polish Catholic Congress in their parishes as early as possible and to send their names and addresses to us. All societies should do likewise.</p>
   <p>Much depends on knowing in advance how many delegates each parish and society is sending to this congress, as it will enable us to make a complete list of the delegates and proceed to the necessary arrangements in Buffalo, <pb facs="5423968_9_1399.jpg" n="2"/>New York, where the congress will take place.</p>
   <p>Every delay is unpleasant to us, so please hurry; otherwise the cause will suffer, and we believe all of us are working and making sacrifices for it.</p>
   <p>We hope that this appeal will have the desired effect and that the reverend pastors, as well as the Polish societies, will send us the desired information as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Pitass, president</p>
   <p>S. Slisz, secretary</p>
