   <p>As everyone knows, the fifteenth of October of this year will be the one hundredth anniversary of the death of Thaddeus Kosciusko, our great national hero. The anniversary should be celebrated far more solemnly this year because our homeland is now experiencing events that are of great importance.</p>
   <p>The Committee for Economic Aid to Poland, headed by Mrs. Laura Gozdawa Turczynowicz, author of the book "When the Prussians Came to Poland," has arranged for a special commemorative edition [of the Chicago Herald] which will contain articles in Polish and English on the life and activities of Kosciusko and on the Polish cause in general.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0443.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The American newspaper, Chicago Herald will issue its special Kosciusko edition on October 14, on the eve of the anniversary date as a supplement to the regular Sunday paper. It will cost, as usual, only five cents.</p>
   <p>This commemorative edition will include articles by some of the best Polish and American writers, and illustrations by well-known Polish and American artists. The issue should be found in every Polish home in America. Orders for the commemorative issue should be placed with the secretary of the Committee for Economic Aid to Poland now, for, because of the high cost of paper, the Chicago Herald would like to know as accurately as possible how many copies of the edition to print. It should be added here that the usual Sunday circulation of the Chicago Herald exceeds 250,000, while on October 14, several tens of thousands more copies will be printed.</p>
   <p>All orders for the commemorative issue should be sent to the secretary <pb facs="5423968_9_0444.jpg" n="3"/>of the Committee for Economic Aid to Poland at 1406 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
