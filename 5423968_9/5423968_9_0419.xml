   <p>Today is the Third of May. For everyone of us Poles it is a memorable day, a day of glory and of hope for the future. A nation which, over a hundred years ago, could establish such liberal statutes, will not be lost. There has never been any other case in the history of the earth where the wealthy, being masters of the land and of the people, have given up their rights, privileges, and high positions in order to share with those who had nothing. This happened only in Poland, on the memorable Third of May, and for this reason, that day means as much to us as Independence Day means to the United States.</p>
   <p>On the Fourth of July, America achieved territorial [political] independence, but freedom of man's spirit, the equal rights of man were still long exposed to abuse; they were born of the fires and blood of the terrible Civil War. Poland gave freedom to everyone without the shedding of blood, with the <pb facs="5423968_9_0420.jpg" n="2"/>agreement of all classes, the privileged as well as the underprivileged. This was the greatest triumph of humanity in the history of the world, and for this reason this day is so sacred to us, and sometime it will be celebrated as an important milestone in human progress by every enlightened and civilized nation.</p>
   <p>In truth, the Constitution of the Third of May has not been put into effect to this day, and does not even agree with present-day conceptions, but thanks to that blossoming forth of the spirit of Poland, the Polish nation is now not only alive, but fighting on the side of those who have gone to battle for the same ideals as inspired the creators of our immortal constitution. Today it fills us with pride that the present war is only a continuation of the one that the Polish nation started against lawlessness more than a hundred years ago and which it has been conducting inflexibly to this day.....</p>
   <p>On the first page of today's issue [of Dziennik Zwiazkowy] there is a reproduction of a certificate received by the Polish National Alliance from the government of the United States for having purchased war-savings stamps.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0421.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Every Polish organization should possess such a certificate, as should every larger association or even wealthier Polish family, for it is proof of loyalty to this country which has shown itself a sincere sister nation to Poland. For general information, we add that the Polish National Alliance has purchased four thousand dollars' worth of these stamps, besides its one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar purchase of Liberty bonds. To this last, the Alliance newspaper administration added thirty thousand dollars. Let the Polish National Alliance, then, be an example to everyone.</p>
