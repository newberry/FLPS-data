  <body>
   <p>The National Department of the Polish National Alliance in Chicago has decided to call an all-Polish Congress on May 3, 1917, at Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>So far we do not know any of the details of this congress, what organizations will be represented, or how it will be arranged--but we expect that all this will be made known to the public in the very near future, so that all details may be thoroughly discussed and all matters clarified. Accepting the idea of the congress as a fact already accomplished, we wish today to say a few words about it.</p>
   <p>We know very well what was behind this idea. Although the present situation in Europe has already been made sufficiently clear, the opposing camp with its wild antics has tried to take advantage of the fact that it is <pb n="2"/>sometimes difficult to express oneself clearly and coherently, especially at times such as these, when it is better to avoid mobs. It is trying all the more to force its already bankrupt political ideas on the people in order to preserve at least a semblance of some sort of influence among the immigrants. This no doubt was the deciding factor in the acceptance of the plan to call a congress.</p>
   <p>Although our people are constantly expressing their opinions through the National Department or the various organs of the daily press, they have not yet had the opportunity of expressing their collective will and demands. They definitely must do this, and they must do this before the fate of Poland is decided.</p>
   <p>A meeting of delegates sent by all sorts of societies--political, national-insurance, educational-literary, or parish--elected in accordance with the constitution of each society or in a manner decreed by a congress commission of the National Department, is the only way in which this collective opinion <pb facs="5423968_9_1267.jpg" n="3"/>can be expressed. Since there would be too great a difference in the manner in which each society would appoint its delegates, a congress commission should be formed at once of people who are familiar with things of this sort, and who could establish a method of election and begin the tremendous task of organizing the congress.</p>
   <p>We believe that, since this is to be a serious congress, all misunderstandings which abound among our people will be avoided and that this congress will be that which its authors, our people and all of Poland want it to be--a mirror of our longings, pains, hopes, and desires.</p>
   <p>This congress must fulfill its mission. It will be held at Washington, the capital of this mighty republic, which will play its part when the time comes for the peace overture. A joint meeting of representatives of all classes and strata of Polish immigrant society, which has already manifested deep love for the Polish cause, will have to be accepted as an act of the will of the entire Polish nation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1268.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>All the sporadic expressions of opinion which have been sent so far either to the highest official of this country, to congressional authorities, or to diplomatic representatives of foreign powers, have lacked the characteristic of universality.</p>
   <p>At the congress of May 3, the Polish people will speak, their representatives will speak, all sorts of emissaries from Europe, if they are able to get into this country, will speak; our hearts, which have learned to love Poland above all else and which want to serve Poland, will speak to the entire world, placing before the international tribunal all that the people feel and think at this time.</p>
   <p>Public opinion of today must take such a manifestation into account. Censorship will not be able to hold back this voice, because its echo will go far, and in the first place will reach those who eagerly await it, in order to get strength and encouragement from it to endure their lot and persevere <pb facs="5423968_9_1269.jpg" n="5"/>in the hope of a better, a more just, and a realistic solution of their problem.</p>
   <p>We believe this to be the idea of the congress, and that is why we received the news of it with enthusiasm. We are eager to co-operate. Quod bonum, faustum, felix, fortunatumque sit--these are the first words which we wish today to send to the organizers and creators of this idea of the congress. We are leaving the discussion of other necessary matters connected with it for later.</p>
