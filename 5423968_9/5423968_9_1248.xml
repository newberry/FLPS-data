<title level="a">FIFTEENTH CONVENTION OF POLISH ALMA MATER</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The fifteenth convention of the Polish Alma Mater of America was held at Holy Innocents Hall on May 21, 22, and 23.</p>
   <p>The report of the secretary-general, which was accepted by the convention, showed that on March 1, 1915, the total assets of the Polish Alma Mater amounted to $45,782.93. Today they amount to $74,035.07. The active membership on March 1, 1917, was 5,584. Further, the report showed that $1,000, has been paid to charity; from May 1, 1915, to May 1, 1917, there were sixty-four deaths, benefit payments totalling $30,280. A majority of the deaths were from pneumonia, heart disease, and kidney ailments.</p>
   <p>Assets of the Polish Alma Mater as of May 1,1917, are as follows: Mortgages, $67,705; cash in bank, $8,554.35; cash in treasurer's hands, $752.72; uncashed checks, $2,972; furniture and office equipment, $13,739.36; badges and apparatus, $528.06; total, $78,302.49. The treasurer reported that the income since <pb facs="5423968_9_1249.jpg" n="2"/>the last balance was $83,380.23; disbursements, $83,333.69.</p>
   <p>The legislative committee made the following amendments to the constitution, which were accepted: 1. No political or other matters outside the scope of the constitution are to be discussed. 2. The first aim of the Polish Alma Mater is to spread the spirit of Christian morality; the teaching of national and civic duties is second to this. 3. Conventions will be held every three years instead of every two years, as formerly. 4. Every official of the Polish Alma Mater must know the Polish and English languages well. 5. The treasurer of the Polish Alma Mater must be acquainted with accounting. 6. Any member whose dues are regularly paid and who performs his or her duties according to the constitution does not lose his or her rights to benefits and other privileges of the organization in case of leaving the United States for Poland.</p>
   <p>After considerable debate, the salaries of the officials were established as follows: The salary of the secretary-general for an eight-hour working day as secretary and bookkeeper will be $125 per month; the treasurer's salary will be <pb facs="5423968_9_1250.jpg" n="3"/>$35 per month; the president's salary, for three hours' work per week, will be $25 per month; the moderator will receive $5 for every meeting of the administration; the vice-presidents and directors will receive $2 for each meeting and one dollar for each time the books are checked; the chief physician will receive twenty-five cents for each examination of a candidate for membership; the secretary-general's assistant will receive a salary of $15 per week.</p>
   <p>On a motion by the secretary of the convention, the card system for membership, required by the state legislature for adequate state control over insurance, was adopted.</p>
   <p>Regulation of hours of work of officials was left to the consideration and decision of the administration.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected: Albert Soska, president; Mrs. A. Baranowski and J. Menkicki, vice-presidents; Thomas Blachowski, secretary-general; Francis Witkowski, treasurer; Walter Lopatka of East Chicago, Indiana, Stanley Liczmanski, <pb facs="5423968_9_1251.jpg" n="4"/>and Mazurek, directors. For the next three years, the Reverend Gordon will be moderator and the Reverend A. Klowo vice-moderator.</p>
   <p>The choice of a city for the next convention was left to the administration, with the restriction that the convention be held outside the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The resolution which follows, prepared by the Reverend Klowo, Joseph P. Schroeder, Mrs. A. Jozwiakowski, Mrs. E. Zamorski, and M. Wellnitz, was accepted:</p>
   <p>"It is hereby resolved to--</p>
   <p>1. Pay homage to the Holy Father, Benedict XV, to Archbishop J. Weber of the Chicago diocese, to Bishop Paul Rhode, and to the clergy in general.</p>
   <p>2. Support the parochial schools, churches, and all Alma Mater institutions.</p>
   <p>3. Express recognition and appreciation for the efforts for the good of the Poles of all organizations favorable in spirit to the Polish Alma Mater, <pb facs="5423968_9_1252.jpg" n="5"/>and to express that organization's readiness for mutual and harmonious work with them.</p>
   <p>4. Reaffirm affiliation with the Polish National Council and to support that body.</p>
   <p>5. Call upon all members of the Polish Alma Mater for further contributions for the relief of our poor and homeless countrymen in Poland.</p>
   <p>6. Express our gratitude and honor to the president of the United States for the stand he has taken in respect to our homeland, defined in his proclamation of January 22.</p>
   <p>7. Encourage defense of this country against the enemy.</p>
   <p>8. Recommend the purchase of Liberty bonds.</p>
   <p>9. Support the Red Cross by soliciting new members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1253.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>10. Thank the Reverend Zwierzchowski, pastor of Holy Innocents Parish, for his hospitality."</p>
