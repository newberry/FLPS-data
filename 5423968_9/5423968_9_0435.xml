   <p>January Exercises [commemorating the Insurrection of 1863] were held last Sunday at Slowacki Hall under the auspices of the J. Slowacki Library and Council 39 of the Polish National Alliance. The audience was not very numerous, which shows how negligent our local Polonia has become. The program itself was none too good, for several numbers had to be dropped because persons who had promised to participate failed to appear.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened at 3:30 in the afternoon by D. Hojnacki, president of the Slowacki Library, with a short talk explaining the reasons for the present national celebrations, after which he named Stanislaus Kleehamer chairman of the meeting and Miss Regina Olkiewicz secretary.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the chairman's address, the program, consisting of the following numbers, began: The first number was to have been a choral piece sung by the united choruses, but due to the resignation of the director of these choruses it could not go on.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0436.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second number was an address by Ignace Kowalski, an employee of the People's Stock Yards Bank. The speaker gave a short resume of Polish history, after which he passed on to present times, discussing the war of life and death between nations, in which the United States too is participating. The speaker discussed in detail the perverse politics of the Germans, describing how they had plotted all over the world, while at home they quietly prepared for the war by which they would rule the world. In conclusion, Kowalski urged young men to join the Polish Army; he urged the older people, whose age and duties do not permit military service, to make donations for the Polish Army. His words were rewarded with applause.</p>
   <p>The next number was a recitation, "Gdzie Ona" (Where is she?) by Miss Regina Olkiewicz, which was followed by a choral number, "Polska, Moja Ojczyzna" (Poland, my Homeland), sung by the Vistula Chorus under the direction of Z. Filisiewicz. After this number, a collection was taken up, netting $21.11. In addition to this A. Ziolkowski, president of St. Michael Archangel Society, Group 434, Polish National Alliance, donated twenty-five dollars to the Polish Army and twenty-five dollars to the relief fund for Polish war victims. Thus, <pb facs="5423968_9_0437.jpg" n="3"/>the total sum collected for the relief fund was $46.11. The collection was followed by an address by S. Kleehamer. Recitations by little Johnny Wcislo and Albert Kubiak followed.</p>
   <p>The last speech on the program was delivered by the well-known Alliance member and Falcon, S. Jankowski. The speaker lamented the present conditions, stating that while we wait for our homeland to be freed from its enemies so few people attend the exercises at which we honor the memories of the heroes who died in the insurrections.</p>
   <p>To conclude the exercises, the audience sang the Polish National Hymn, "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland). It should be added here that all of the numbers were very well executed and that the audience was unstinting in its applause. It is too bad, however, that in a community in which five national choruses existed, only one was able to appear.</p>
