<title level="a">THE REVEREND JOHN OBYRTACZ, C.R., PASTOR OF ST. STANISLAS KOSTKA'S PARISH</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Reverend John Obyrtacz was born May 26, 1873, in the village of Kokoniowka, Chocholow parish, in the Podhale [the sub-Carpathian mountain region], south-western Poland. He began his elementary studies in the Chocholow parochial school; later he attended the grammar school in the town of Nowy Targ; his classical education was received in the classical gymnasium in Nowy Sacz. In 1889 he entered the Resurrectionist order. He pursued his studies in philosophy and theology first in the city of Cracow, thereafter in Lwow (Lemberg), and finally in Rome. Possessing a brilliant mind, he completed his theological studies a few months before the earliest permissible age, according to the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, for ordination to the priesthood.</p>
   <p>Chosen to go to America, he arrived in Chicago on May 24, 1895, while still a deacon. He was ordained by Archbishop Feehan in St. Stanislas Kostka's Church on December 8, 1895. He remained in this parish until May, 1896, as assistant, <pb facs="5423968_9_1779.jpg" n="2"/>when he was transferred in the same capacity to St. Hedwig's Church. Two years and six months later he returned to St. Stanislas Kostka's parish, still an assistant pastor, where he remained until the year 1901. In that year, while his pastor, the Reverend Father Kasprzycki, went to Rome to attend the conclave of the Resurrectionist order, he performed the duties of parish priest. After Father Kasprzycki's return from Rome the Reverend [John] Obyrtacz was appointed pastor of St. Stanislas Bishop and Martyr's Church in Cragin, Chicago, where he remained for more than seven years, gaining for himself the admiration and the love of his parishioners. On January 6, 1909, he was transferred to St. Hedwig's parish in the capacity of pastor, where he labored successfully for nearly twelve years. Finally, on October 12, 1929, the newly elected general of the Resurrectionist order, the Reverend Ladislas Zapala, transferred Father Obyrtacz as pastor to the oldest Polish parish in Chicago, St. Stanislas Kostka's, appointing him at the same time prior of the first and largest congregation of Resurrectionist Fathers in America.</p>

   <p>On December 8, 1920, the silver anniversary of Father Obyrtacz's priesthood was celebrated with great pomp and solemnity.</p>
