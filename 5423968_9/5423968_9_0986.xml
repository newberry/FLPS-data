<title level="a">NOVEMBER INSURRECTION CELEBRATION HELD IN SOUTH CHICAGO</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Correspondence)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, November 24, the November Insurrection was commemorated in South Chicago. The celebration began at 5 P.M., because of the number of very small children who took part in the program.</p>
   <p>The pastor, Reverend A. Nowicki, opened the celebration with a prayer, and then called on Mr. Charles Wilkowicz to act as chairman and Mr. L. Machnikowski as secretary.</p>
   <p>It will be impossible to mention each number on the program separately on account of the limited space at our disposal in the columns of the Dziennik Chicagoski, so we will make note only of the more important events on the program.</p>
   <p>The speeches by Reverend Krawczunas and Mr. Ignacy Machnikowski were of <pb facs="5423968_9_0987.jpg" n="2"/>historical importance. Reverend Krawczunas portrayed the entire November Insurrection in a beautiful poetic style. When he said that the graves and bones of the departed heroes even today call unto us to love our country, and prophesied a brighter future, the audience was thrilled, as if indeed a hero of the November Insurrection was speaking from beyond the grave.</p>
   <p>Mr. Machnikowski spoke of the centennial observance of the second partition of Poland and in eloquent terms outlined the causes of the fall of our country, then pointed out the way to the restoration of Poland. The audience applauded vociferously.</p>
   <p>The singing of the male choirs and of the school children was excellent and the audience applauded in approval.</p>
   <p>A girls' trio and school children who recited (sorry we did not get their names) were very good, while the exercises of junior "Kosvniers" and the rhythmic <pb facs="5423968_9_0988.jpg" n="3"/>exercises of the Cadets under the leadership of Mr. L. Machnikowski evoked thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The crowning effort of the evening's entertainment was the "Kindergarten" (so named by the Rev. Nowicki).</p>
   <p>These children, four and five years old, boys and girls, dressed neatly, were instructed by the venerable Sisters of Nazareth. There were about forty of them, all as beautiful as angels. The girls were empty-handed, but the boys carried small swords. After marching by twos, fours, and in groups, they came to a stop, with the boys in front and girls in the rear; then, to the utter astonishment of all assembled, these children, barely able to talk, began to sing to the tune of "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" (Poland Is Not Dead Yet).</p>
   <p>It is difficult for me to describe the joy and enthusiasm of the audience when the boys began stamping their tiny feet in time and raising their swords aloft, and the girls, with appropriate gestures, concluded each stanza with words <pb facs="5423968_9_0989.jpg" n="4"/>composed by the venerable Sisters of Nazareth as follows:</p>
   <p>"March, march all together!</p>
   <p>When time for freedom comes</p>
   <p>We will leave America</p>
   <p>And return to Poland."</p>
   <p>But this was not all. A five-year-old lieutenant, the commander of this armed and unarmed column, placed his sword in its scabbard, ordered the others to do likewise, then stepped forward and, with the demeanor of an old timer, rendered a poem entitled "The Holy Love of Fatherland".</p>
   <p>If we are not mistaken the name of this five-year-old boy is John Gorzynski. Thanking the audience for their generous applause he took out his sword once again and commanded the others to do the same. Then all sang together:</p>
   <p>"You, big boys, and small boys,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0990.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>March, march all together!</p>
   <p>When the time for freedom comes,</p>
   <p>We will leave America</p>
   <p>And return to Poland."</p>
   <p>It would be impossible to describe the happiness and rapture of those present, or to estimate the applause given to these children, small in body but great of heart, patriots, for their wonderful performance.</p>
   <p>After the applause ceased, Reverend Nowicki announced that guests were present not only from South Chicago, but from other localities also, and then introduced Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek, Reverend John Kasprzycki, and Reverend J. Piechowski from St. Stanislaus Parish, and Reverend Byrger from Bridgeport. He then asked Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz to say a few words. Speaking in a humorous and dignified manner, he told the pastor and the parishioners the truth, and showered praise on them for the wonderful training the children had received.</p>
   <p>Reverend Nowicki concluded the celebration with a beautiful oration. He rejoiced <pb facs="5423968_9_0991.jpg" n="6"/>in the fact that the two parishes, St. Michael Archangel and the Immaculate Nativity, jointly prepared this celebration. He further stressed the duties of Polish women, the proper care of children, correct behavior for the young people, the necessity of studying their country's language, etc.</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that the hall was completely filled. To conserve space all of the seats were removed, and even though everybody had to stand, there was no commotion of any kind. We have seldom seen an audience that behaved so well. The entire celebration, from the beginning to the end, was sincere, heartfelt, and truly patriotic toward Poland.</p>
   <p>Hail to the reverend fathers, sisters, and teachers for this flower of youth whom you taught so well! Hail also to you, Poles, who spare no expense or trouble to educate your children in a godly manner and in true Polish tradition.</p>
   <p>After the singing of the national anthem, "God Save Poland," by all those <pb facs="5423968_9_0992.jpg" n="7"/>assembled, Reverend Nowicki collected $27.85 in voluntary contributions, one half of which is to be given to the hospital, the other half to the Lwow Exposition.</p>
   <p>"March, march altogether!</p>
   <p>We will leave America,</p>
   <p>And return to Poland!"</p>
   <p>Not A Parishioner</p>
