   <p>Last Sunday afternoon an impressive meeting, sponsored by the Adam Mickiewicz Library, was held at the Adam Mickiewicz Hall, 3110-12 South Morgan Street, in celebration of the one-hundred-and-twenty-sixth anniversary of the Constitution of the Third of May. The celebration was attended by many people.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order at 3 P. M. by Mr. Pawlak, president of the Library, who called upon Mr. A. Czasewicz to act as chairman, and Mr. A. B. Chrzanowski to act as secreatry.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Dr. M. Malinowski, who spoke on the history of the Constitution of the Third of May. His speech was followed by a medley of Polish songs sung by the Helen Modjeska choir, under the direction of B. Zaleski.</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Chrzanowski followed with a piano solo; then little P. Pomirski gave <pb facs="5423968_9_0452.jpg" n="2"/>a recitation. Miss Okon's vocal solo followed and was received with enthusiasm. Mr. John Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, made a rather long speech, which was frequently interrupted by applause. He sought to encourage the people to persevere in their work for the cause of the homeland.</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Gorewoda played a piano solo and was applauded enthusiastically. Then Miss F. Okon sang another solo.</p>
   <p>The chairman called for a collection for Polish relief and $25.25 was contributed.</p>
   <p>The celebration was brought to a close by the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>After the celebration a group of amateurs presented a play entitled "O <pb facs="5423968_9_0453.jpg" n="3"/>Polska Kobiete" (Over a Polish Woman), a historical scene of the time of the insurrection of 1863. The play was a great success, and the following players gave an outstanding performance: Mrs. Jane Chrzanowski in the part of Mary, the mother; Mr. A. Biniewski in the part of Sigismund, the son; Miss Ursula Feiner in the part of Josephine's governess; Mr. M. Buczykowski in the part of Lieutenent Iwanow; and Mr. J. Kowalski in the part of General Lucki.</p>
   <p>The audience was charmed with the play, as was evidenced by the applause.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements wishes to express its gratitude piblicly to all those who participated in the celebration and to those who helped make it a success.</p>
   <p>(Signed) A. B. Chrzanowski, secretary.</p>
