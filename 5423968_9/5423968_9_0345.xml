   <p>This year's Thanksgiving Day will be a real day of joy and happiness, for our country "got out" of darkness and uncertainty and is entering on the path to prosperity.</p>
   <p>The danger of further depression is over and the number of unemployed has decreased by four millions this year. The industries have returned to the normal production of 1929 and the wages of the workers are going up.</p>
   <p>The large corporations paid for the first time this year, the biggest dividends they ever did and there is hope that the whole industry is on the road to a bright future.</p>
   <p>By electing President Roosevelt again as a leader of the nation the American People is sure that not only the return of prosperty has well started but that it will continue for the next few years, especially after the revival of industry.</p>
   <p>On Thanksgiving day we may look into the future with more peace and assurance than any other nation of the world. We are free from the nightmare of depression and war. Our country is undergoing a national re-birth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0346.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>While there is bloodshed in other countries and nations rebel against the dictators imposed upon them, we, armed with the voting ballot, have won over the economical tyranny and are on the road to a real democracy without disturbing any fundamental principles.</p>
   <p>The American nation is rid of depression, and of all kinds of demagogues living off the public, who tired to run the country by maintaining economical slavery.</p>
   <p>Happily we rid ourselves of the Republican party, the Liberty League, Father Coughlan, Al. Smith, Dr. Townsend, the, the capitalistic press prestige and above all, the Bolshevik scare, which has been scaring the American people for some time past.</p>
   <p>Let us thank the Almighty Creator on Thanksgiving Day for freeing us from a six year depression and also that we did not fall into the slavery of capitalistic parasites to be controlled by the biggest traitors of the country.</p>
