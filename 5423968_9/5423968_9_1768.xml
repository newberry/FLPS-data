<title level="a">SILVER ANNIVERSARY OF ST. HYACINTH'S CHURCH CHOIR</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday, January 23, the choir of St. Hyacinth's Church celebrated with great pomp the twenty-fifth anniversary of its work in the field of church and national music. On Sunday morning, at the Mass, the members of the choir went to Holy Communion as a group, and at 10:45 A. M. solemn High Mass was sung by the pastor of the church, the Reverend John Sobieszczak, His assistants in the Mass were the Reverend Fathers Leonard Long and Francis Repinski. The sermon was preached by the Reverend Francis Kubiaczek. During the Mass the choir under the leadership of Mr. J. K. Borowinski presented the following compositions:</p>
   <p>"Asperges Me" by Kempter, "Kyrie" by Mercadante, "Gloria" by Zangle, "Veni Creator" by Lambilotte, and "Credo" by Peter Yon, At the offertory the soprano solo "Laudamus Te" by Bagioli was sung by Miss Wanda Obecna; then the choir sang "Sanctus" by Mercadante, "Benedictus" by Peter Yon, "Agnus Dei" by Mercadante, and "Ite Missa Est" and "Jubilate Deo" by Loxhai. During the <pb facs="5423968_9_1769.jpg" n="2"/>singing Mr. Joseph Zielinski played an accompaniment on the violin. The musical numbers were most beautifully rendered.</p>
   <p>In the evening this occasion was celebrated with a banquet in the large parish auditorium, attended by a great many guests not only from St. Hyacinth's parish but also from other Polish parishes, such as St. Mary of the Angels', St. Hedwig's, St. Stanislas Kostka's and St. John Cantius's.</p>
   <p>At the main table were seated the priests of the parish, the Reverend J. Sobieszczak, pastor, and his assistant priests, the Reverend Fathers: Francis Kubiaczyk, Leonard Long, Joseph Zwierzycki, and Francis Repinski, and also the speakers and the representatives of this paper.</p>
   <p>Before the program began, the orchestra played the "Coronation March" by Weiss. Afterwards Mr. E. Ambrozewski, director of the parish choir, asked the pastor to say a prayer before the guests began to enjoy the various dishes set before them. Then followed a musical program. Chopin's "Polonaise <pb facs="5423968_9_1770.jpg" n="3"/>Militaire," arranged by B. J. Zalewski, was beautifully rendered by the choir under the direction of J. K. Borowinski, the church organist; then followed a solo, "All Alone," by Troschle, sung by Miss Wanda Obecna, who has been the soloist of the choir from its very beginning. The guests liked her singing so much that she was obliged to give a few extra songs. Miss A. Dymarska received great applause for her beautiful execution of a Russian dance. Next "The Fishers" by Gabussie was sung by the ladies' choir, and again Miss Dymarska appeared, this time to sing an aria from Puccini's opera "La Tosca". A humorous sketch rendered by Messrs. J. Kamedulski and S. Sikorski brought down the house with laughter.</p>
   <p>Speeches were made by Attorney Schwaba, who described the growth of church choirs and their aims, and by the local pastor, the Reverend John Sobieszczyk, who sketched the more important events in the early history of this church choir, praising the great work of the founder and first director of this choir, Brother (of the Resurrectionist Congregation) Adalbert, who was also an organist of the church. His tireless and unselfish labor will never be <pb facs="5423968_9_1771.jpg" n="4"/>forgotten by the parishioners. Father Sobieszczyk urged the choir to continue their work in the promotion and improvement of singing, ending with the expression of his hope for the continued growth of the choir.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster was Mr. J. Tomczak, who is well known in Polish social circles.</p>
   <p>With the singing of the Polish patriotic hymn, "God Who Keep Poland through So Many Centuries," this beautiful and memorable celebration, which will long remain in the memory of the choir, its director, and all the guests, came to an end.</p>
