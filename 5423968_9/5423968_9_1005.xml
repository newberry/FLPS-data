   <p>The Third of May exercises, under the auspices of the Polish societies on the southwest side of Chicago, were held at Pulaski Hall to a capacity audience. The presiding officer was Mr. J. Napieralski. The first speaker was Dr. Charles Midowicz. He sketched the history of Poland, stressing the partitions. In his opinion, the outlook for the future is good because of an awakening of spirit among the people. He urged harmony and co-operation among the Polish newspapers.</p>
   <p>The next address was by Mr. Stephen Napieralski. The young speaker appealed to the youth to use the Polish language and to resist all foreign influences. There were two or three other speakers on the program, among them two from our part of the city, who failed to arrive in time to speak.</p>
   <p>Outstanding among the four recitations that were delivered during the course of the program, was a declamation by Miss Emily Napieralski. Miss Haremski <pb facs="5423968_9_1006.jpg" n="2"/>declaimed in English. At the close of the program, a collection was taken for the Pulaski Hall Fund.</p>
