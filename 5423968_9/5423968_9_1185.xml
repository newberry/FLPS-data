  <body>
   <p>In the name of God, and with the purpose of uniting all Polish forces in America under the motto "Poland, free, united, and independent, with its own outlet to the sea," the Executive Committee of the Polish National Department in Chicago, as the leading Polish political organization in America, hereby calls a general national convention of the entire Polish element in America on the following terms:</p>
   <p>1. The convention will be held in Detroit, Michigan, and will open on September 19, 1918.</p>
   <p>2. All preconvention matters will be taken care of by the Executive Committee of the National Department, from which a committee of nine has been appointed, consisting of the following: Casimir Zychlinski, the Reverend W. Zapala, N. L. Piotrowski, the Reverend A. Syski, Dr. B. L. Smykowski, L. A. Koscinski, W. Siwinski, J. S. Rybicki, and Henry Setmajer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1186.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. The president of the Executive Committee of the National Department will open the convention and will serve as chairman until the convention elects its own officers.</p>
   <p>4. From the time when the convention will have duly elected its own officers, the Executive Committee of the National Department will leave the convention in the hands of the convention's own officers, but the Committee itself will not withdraw nor resign from its duties: it obligates itself to give the convention a complete report of all preconvention activities and to accept all legal decisions of that convention until the latter is completely organized.</p>
   <p>5. As an external expression of the collective will of the entire Polish element of America, the convention is to be the highest political and nationalistic authority of all the Poles, without exception, in America, but its decisions will not obligate, nor will they concern, the Poles living outside the United States and Canada, who in turn will not be responsible for any decisions made.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1187.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>6. The task, the spirit, and the existence of the convention will depend chiefly upon the fact that it will be, to the greatest possible extent, an adquate representation of every part of the Polish element in America.</p>
   <p>7. The term "Polish element in America" is understood to signify all of the Poles living in the United States and Canada at a given time, without regard to whether or not they are American citizens.</p>
   <p>8. That the Polish Convention shall truly be a most adequate representation and expression of the entire Polish element in America will depend, first, upon the representation of certain of the most important Poles and Polish organizations and institutions in America, as listed below; second, upon the election of delegates to the convention by all Polish organizations now in existence; and third, upon the election of delegates representing Polish communities in the United States.</p>
   <p>9. Important personages represented at the convention will be Ignace Paderewski and Bishop Paul Rhode, because of their distinguished position in Polish affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1188.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>10. Members of organizations entitled to represent their respective organizations, professions, or institutions are as follows:</p>
   <p>a) The president and members of the Executive Committee of the Polish National Department.</p>
   <p>b) The president of the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>c) The president of the National Council.</p>
   <p>d) Presidents of all groups of the Polish Priests Association of America.</p>
   <p>e) Presidents of lay organizations, individual groups, or divisions scattered through the many Polish communities in America.</p>
   <p>f) Members of the Polish Military Commission.</p>
   <p>g) Representatives in good standing of the National Department Centers.</p>
   <p>h) Representatives of the central citizens committees, especially elected for this purpose.</p>
   <p>i) Presidents of Polish chambers of commerce and of Polish businessmen's associations.</p>
   <p>j) Representatives of Polish higher institutions of learning, namely, the Polish seminaries in Cambridge Springs, Chicago, Erie, Ramsay, and Pulaski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1189.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>k) Representatives of the Polish press, medical associations, lawyers associations, engineers and building contractors associations, and associations of teachers and organists.</p>
   <p>l) Representatives of Polish labor union locals, both from the East and the West</p>
   <p>m) Representatives of Polish farmers associations both from the East and the West.</p>
   <p>n) Representatives of Polish loan companies and co-operatives.</p>
   <p>o) Representatives of Polish art and science in America, to be invited individually by the preconvention commission.</p>
   <p>11. If in addition to the above-named representatives, it should be found necessary to admit others to the Polish convention, the preconvention commission has a right to do so in a supplement to this statute not later than August 15, 1918.</p>
   <p>12. The possession of the right to represent a given organization, profession, or institution at the convention does not deprive any person from being elected as <pb facs="5423968_9_1190.jpg" n="6"/>a duly authorized delegate from that organization, institution, or profession, but he cannot have two votes. No accumulation of votes will be permissible at the convention. Each participant will have only one vote for one candidate at the elections. (Thomas Hare rules).</p>
   <p>13. Since the Polish organizations of America are of two distinct types, that is, the purely local type, consisting of one society, and the general type, with groups or divisions scattered throughout the Polish communities all over America and united under a central administration, the representation of the general organizations at the convention will be twofold.</p>
   <p>14. All local organizations have the right to send one convention delegate for every thousand or fewer members, not from individual societies but from all the societies in that particular community.</p>
   <p>15. The term "Polish community" is used here to signify every locality in which Poles are settled in any number. Community boundaries will coincide more <pb facs="5423968_9_1191.jpg" n="7"/>or less with the boundaries of the Polish parishes, on the strength of which there may, in the case of large cities, be more than one community entitled to representation at the convention.</p>
   <p>16. Elections of delegates to the convention by local organizations will be held on the first or second Sunday of July at a mass meeting of the organizations, both men's and women's, of each particular community, and the election will be governed by the simple majority rule.</p>
   <p>17. Election mass meetings of local organizations will be called and presided over by the local pastor, or, if the pastor should not avail himself of this privilege, by the president of the oldest organization in the community, the pastor being notified beforehand.</p>
   <p>18. Societies or divisions of general organizations are not deprived of their local character and can participate in the election of delegates on an equal basis with local organizations, but since their influence and <pb facs="5423968_9_1192.jpg" n="8"/>organizational significance is far greater than that of the others, they have the additional privilege of electing special delegates, in the proportion of one for every five thousand members or less in the entire organization, including all its groups or divisions.</p>
   <p>19. The election of delegates to the Polish convention by organizations with societies scattered throughout the Polish communities in the United States will be held at regular or special meetings during the first half of July, in accordance with instructions to be received from the various central administrations.</p>
   <p>20. Polish parishes and churches, without regard to denomination, are not included among Polish organizations with a right as such to be represented at the convention. Their members will be represented only on the territorial basis.</p>
   <p>21. The basis of territorial representation at the convention of the Polish people in America will be one delegate for every twenty-five thousand people or less, not in every community, but in individual States [or provinces] <pb facs="5423968_9_1193.jpg" n="9"/>in the United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>22. The election of territorial delegates will be conducted in two stages, and should be held in the second half of July.</p>
   <p>23. The election of territorial delegates will be in charge of a College of Delegates from the [Polish] National Department in each State, consisting of organizational delegates already elected in each particular State in the first half of July.</p>
   <p>24. The credentials of organizational delegates to the convention elected in the first half of July should be sent by mail to the preconvention committee of the National Department not later than the fifteenth of July. Signatures of the delegates should be notarized.</p>
   <p>25. The names of all organizational delegates to the convention will be published in the Polish newspapers on the fifteenth of July. If, however, it <pb facs="5423968_9_1194.jpg" n="10"/>is found that a State is not represented by an organizational delegate, the National Department will authorize a special commissioner from among the delegates of the nearest neighboring State to take charge of the election of territorial delegates from that particular State.</p>
   <p>26. The first on the list of organizational representatives in each State, the list to be published by the National Department, will automatically head the College of Delegates from that particular State, and he will have the privilege and duty of naming the time and place of meeting of electors in his particular State for the election of territorial delegates, after reaching an understanding with the other members of his College of Delegates.</p>
   <p>27. Territorial electors in each State will be elected from every community at a public mass meeting of Polish adults, without regard to party, organizational, or religious affiliation, on the basis of one elector for every five hundred voters in each particular community, male or female, each of whom, however, shall have only one vote to be given for only one candidate.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1195.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>28. Public mass meetings to be held in Polish communities for the purpose of electing electors to the State conventions are to be held on the third Sunday of July and are to be called by the local pastor.</p>
   <p>29. If a pastor does not avail himself of this privilege, or if a community does not have a Polish parish, the right to call such a mass meeting falls to the president of the oldest society of that community--oldest in respect to the number of years it has existed in the community--after due notification of the local pastor.</p>
   <p>30. In Polish communities where the presidents of societies also neglect to avail themselves of this privilege, or where there are no societies, the right to call a mass meeting of such a community falls to the oldest Polish resident of that community in respect to the number of years he has resided there.</p>
   <p>31. If misunderstandings should occur when such a mass meeting is called, complaints and requests for advice should be addressed to the College of <pb facs="5423968_9_1196.jpg" n="12"/>Delegates of the State in which such misunderstandings occur.</p>
   <p>32. The credentials of electors from each community should be signed by the chairman and secretary of the mass meeting at which they are elected, and an accurate estimate of the number of persons attending the meeting signified thereon.</p>
   <p>33. Each territorial elector should send his credentials to the chairman of the College of Delegates of his State not later than August 1.</p>
   <p>34. The College of Delegates (organizational) will publish a list of territorial electors in the Polish newspapers not later than August 3.</p>
   <p>35. The State conventions of electors must be held at the latest by the first Sunday in August. Two thirds of the electors present will constitute a quorum.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1197.jpg" n="13"/>
   <p>36. Elections of territorial delegates at the State conventions will be held by closed ballot, and each elector may cast one vote for only one candidate.</p>
   <p>37. The chairman of organizational delegates in each State will preside over the State conventions, but will not have a right to vote.</p>
   <p>38. The first duty of the State convention, after it has organized itself, is to ascertain the number of delegates which that particular State, on the basis of its Polish population, is entitled to send to the convention of Poles.</p>
   <p>39. The basis upon which the Polish population of a given State, and the number of delegates to which that State is entitled, will be the number of votes cast for electors to the State convention multiplied by two, assuming that each voter who casts a vote represented himself and one other.</p>
   <p>40. Organizational delegates have the right to participate in the <pb facs="5423968_9_1198.jpg" n="14"/>discussion and voting on the question of how many delegates a given State is entitled to; and the result of the voting, together with a detailed list of voters who elected representatives to the State convention, should be submitted to the National Department along with the chairman's report of the State convention.</p>
   <p>41. The credentials of territorial delegates elected at the State conventions should be signed by the convention chairman and secretary, and mailed to the National Department by each individual delegate not later than August 15, 1918.</p>
   <p>42. Each delegate should bring with him to the convention of Poles a duplicate copy of his credentials. Election of delegates will be held every four years, and each delegate's credentials are valid for a period of four years.</p>
   <p>43. The entire cost of the elections of both electors and delegates will be covered by local authorities who called the election out of a special collection they will take up for this purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1199.jpg" n="15"/>
   <p>44. The National Department in Chicago will cover only the general expenses of the convention itself and of its own delegates.</p>
   <p>45. The discussions of the convention shall be open to the public unless the convention itself should decide otherwise. The delegates to the convention are not obligated to adhere strictly to the instructions of their constituents, but are to be directed by their own minds, hearts, and consciences.</p>
   <p>46. Marshals for maintaining proper order at the convention will be named by the Executive Committee of the National Department, or rather by its preconvention commission, but not from among the delegates who have been elected to the convention.</p>
   <p>47. The convention of Poles will be opened, after solemn High Mass, by the Executive Committee of the National Department, who will act as temporary officers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1200.jpg" n="16"/>
   <p>48. All committees, with the exception of the nominating and credentials committees, shall be named by the convention as the need for them arises after the convention has been permanently organized.</p>
   <p>49. A detailed program of the convention's work, together with detailed regulations for its proceedings, will be found in a further communication to be published immediately after the appearance of this one. In the meantime, all questions and requests for information or further details should be addressed to the Preconvention Committee, Polish National Department, 1309 North Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>50. If the discussions of the convention should for any reason be discontinued, and the Convention disbanded before any decisions have been reached or before the convention has given the Polish element in America any political or nationalistic direction, the Polish National Department will return to its status of general leadership of the Poles in America as before the convention.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_1201.jpg" n="17"/>
