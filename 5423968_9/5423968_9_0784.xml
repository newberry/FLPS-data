   <p>(The following article was received by the Dziennik Chicagoski for publication.)</p>
   <p>On Sunday, November 24, a November demonstration, commemorating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the November uprising against the Russian yoke, was staged by the St. Joseph Parish societies at the parish hall. The affair was opened by Goniatkowski, who presided as chairman. He also said a few words about the events that led to the rising in 1830.</p>
   <p>Albert Wachowski, trustee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, who was the next speaker, spoke about the deeds of Poland. He was followed by a song, "Za Niemem" (Beyond the River Niemem), rendered by the parish choir, under the direction of Max Kucharczyk. The Misses Zietek and L. Pietras recited Szczesny Zahajkiewicz's poem, "Ja Sie Chlubie Zem Polakiem" (I Am Proud <pb facs="5423968_9_0785.jpg" n="2"/>that I Am a Pole).</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Clement J. Belinski (also called Bielinski), president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. He gave an ardent partiotic address which moved many in the audience to tears.</p>
   <p>Miss Piatkowska gave a recitation, and the choir sang the patriotic song "Walecznych Tysiac" (Thousands of Brave). Miss Pluczinska also recited a beautiful Polish number. Then T. Czerwinski made a speech.</p>
   <p>Later the choir sang "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" (Poland Is Not Yet Lost). Miss Witucka gave a recitation, another number by the choir followed, and Miss Strzelewska also recited.</p>
   <p>The Reverend M. Pyplatz, pastor of St. Michael Parish, spoke about the <pb facs="5423968_9_0786.jpg" n="3"/>present times. He said that enemies are attacking us from all sides and desire to tear away from us our religion [Roman Catholic]. In conclusion he urged everyone to stand firmly by the Holy Cross and the Roman Catholic banner.</p>
   <p>Then Miss Golabieska made a declamation and the choir sang "Ojczyzna Dlugo Gniebiona" (The Fatherland Is Long Oppressed).</p>
   <p>Mr. Chalkowski was the last speaker of the evening. He spoke about matters concerning the parish and pressed everyone to have faith in the Chruch. The speaker also spoke about the value of unity and harmony and the love for one another.</p>
   <p>All the speakers were loudly applauded by the audience, and the performers were also rewarded with applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_9_0787.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The affair was concluded with the singing of the Polish national hymn "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>A capacity crowd attended the celebration.</p>
   <p>The undersigned, in the name of the parish, wishes to extend hearty thanks to the speakers, performers, and audience for their splendid co-operation in making this affair a success.</p>
   <p>M. Pietras, secretary.</p>
