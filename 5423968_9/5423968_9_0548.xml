<title level="a">COMMEMORATION OF NOVEMBER INSURRECTION AT ST.HELEN'S PARISH</title></bibl>

   <p>The club Casimir The Great of St.Helen's Parish and of Commune 91 of the Polish National Alliance arranged a celebration last Sunday of the eighty-third anniversary of the November Insurrection. Despite the inclemency of the weather, surprisingly many people attended; the parish hall was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>Following the prayer led by Reverend Pyterka, Mr. John F. Ruszkiewicz opened the exercises and called upon Mr. Peter Ligman to act as master of ceremonies and the undersigned to act as secretary. Following the opening song, "On the Graves," which was excellently rendered by the parish choir, our well-known compatriot and social worker, Mr. John F. Smulski, delivered an address.</p>
   <p>He expressed satisfaction that the Poles are improving their economic conditions with each year, as is shown by the fact that the number of them settling in the <pb facs="5423968_9_0549.jpg" n="2"/>better districts of the city is steadily increasing, and wished St. Helen's Parish the greatest success and development. Then, reviewing the most important points of the November Insurrection, he asserted that even at that time we could have gained a great deal more if all Poles, regardless of class and convictions, had helped the young insurrectionists. He went on to exhort us to prepare ourselves for the important moment, which will surely come soon, and to develop our young men physically. Finally the speaker described with ardent words the condition of our brothers in the homeland and appealed for financial help for them.</p>
   <p>The next number was a violin solo played by Dr. J. D. Bambenek. This was followed by a speech by Mr. Stanley Osada, secretary of the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>In his speech Mr. Osada called attention to the fact that all the organizations have now united in order to work in concert and collect money for our homeless and hungry brothers, whose property and possessions were destroyed by Poland's enemies.</p>

   <p>"We do not have gendarmes, we do not have a government which forces us to pay taxes [to help Poland]," cried the speaker. "We must ourselves understand our duty and hurry with aid, each giving all that he can. We must have confidence in the people whom we have placed at our head, since without confidence and harmony we will not be able to accomplish anything."</p>
   <p>During the collection which was taken up by Miss Budzban, Miss Ligman, and Miss Piasecki, the parish orchestra played. The collection yielded $49.36, which sum will be given to Mr. Smulski, treasurer of the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>The next number on the program was executed by the parish choir, after which Reverend Grebowicz of St. Innocents' Parish spoke. Reverend Grebowicz's speech on the subject of the relation of the clergy to the Polish people in general, was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>Reverend Pyterka then thanked all those who had participated in the exercises.</p>

   <p>With the singing of "God Save Poland," the commemoration was brought to its close. The gathering was unusually successful.</p>
