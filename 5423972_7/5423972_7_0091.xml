   <p>It is needless to say that this structure is constructed in the most modern style and containing all modern accommodations. The apartments are 11x14, and are very neatly and comfortably furnished. The bedsteads are of enameled metal with brass mounting. Each bedroom has two methods of heating. It has a radiator with heat direct from the boiler-room, and has also a hot air system easily operated by the occupant.</p>
   <p>The doors all have lights and outside them, are located the electric lights that make the corridors bright. Inorder to run no risk of asphyxiatim by gas that illuminant is not used in any of the rooms. A single electric light in the center of the ceiling takes its place. The system of ventilation is so perfect that the air in the entire building can be completely changed every twenty minutes.</p>
