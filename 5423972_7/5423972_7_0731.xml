   <p>(Special to the Courier), New York, January 7: The Central Relief Conference opened today in the presence of 200 delegates. Leon Komaiko, president of the Central Relief Committee, introduced Rabbi Meyer Berlin as chairman of the Conference. He [Rabbi Berlin] appealed for more intensive work to rebuild the Jewish cultural life in Eastern Europe, which has been destroyed.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Fishel's report for the period from October, 1914 to December, 1922 stands as a monument to American-Jewish charity. $10,625,800 was raised during that period and the gigantic task of raising this sum cost less than three per cent of the total.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0732.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>About $757,600 was distributed in 1,027 cities for cultural work alone, benefiting 1,737 institutions, over 5,000 teachers, and 150,000 students, of whom 5,000 were orphans.</p>
   <p>The report presented by the Joint Distribution Committee to the Conference shows that more than forty-seven and one-half million dollars have been distributed for relief throughout Europe.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Levinthal of Philadelphia and Rabbi Hagolis appealed to the orthodox Jews of America to continue their support of the Central Relief in order to make possible the work of preserving the spiritual values of Judaism.</p>
   <p>At a caucus meeting held by the Chicago delegation under the chairmanship of Mr. B. Horwich, it was decided to demand of the organization that the western <pb facs="5423972_7_0733.jpg" n="3"/>states be under the jurisdiction of the Chicago office and that all money raised in the western states be sent through the Chicago office. It was also decided to demand that all questions entering the New York office [from western states], be referred to the Chicago office.</p>
   <p>B. Horwich, chairman of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee, submitted to the Conference a report of the work done in Chicago and the Middle West. The report showed that $2,853,400 had been raised from December, 1914 to December, 1922 and that the expenses were somewhat more than three per cent. Mr. B. Horwich pointed out that the portion contributed by the Orthodox Jewry to relief is, in reality, much larger than it had been reported, but the credit for the rest of the money went to the American Jewish Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>The resolution of the Chicago delegation was referred to the new Executive Committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0734.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It was determined to launch a $600,000 campaign throughout the United States for cultural work in Eastern Europe this year. The quota for Illinois is $70,000.</p>
