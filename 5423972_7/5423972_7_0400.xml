   <p>The United Hebrew Charities, as we all know, are doing much for the poor, sick, stranded and lonely. Under the energetic supervision of Dr. Zepin all charity cases are subjected to a thorough investigation before charity is given; hence, all deserving cases receive quicker and better attention than ever before.</p>
   <p>We take great pleasure in thanking the United Hebrew Charities for adding an employment bureau to their organization, for there is much need for such an institution among our Jewish people in Chicago. Under the system introduced by Mr. Pollack, one who is in need of work can get it without much delay. Mr. Pollack always finds something for the job seeker. He never fails to find employment in the right place for the right people, especially for the immigrants who encounter difficulties in finding employment. We find that not less than two hundred applicants have secured employment every month, and it is due entirely to the tireless work of Mr. Pollak that the employment bureau is able to obtain suitable jobs for the needy applicants.</p>
