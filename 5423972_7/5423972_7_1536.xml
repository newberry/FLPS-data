   <p>Although the Chicago Jewish Community is not the greatest, richest, oldest, or most noted in America, it excels in orderly conduct, in its desire and ability to organize, in its work in the fields of Jewish charity, religion, education, and in the character of its civic workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1537.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The non-Jew of the Middle West represents a higher type of citizenship than the non-Jew of the East.</p>
   <p>All improvements in community life come from the West which was settled by immigrants who had more courage and more pioneering spirit than those who settled in the East. The Western immigrant was not satisfied with the order and life of the East; he followed the good advice of a great newspaper man, who said: "go West young man, go West."</p>
   <p>The Jewish immigrant who does not settle in the East, but has the courage to proceed to the West is a better type than the immigrant whose sole ambition is to be a resident of Hester Street, in New York.</p>
   <p>No city in the East has as beautiful, clean and magnificent a Jewish ghetto as Chicago. The Chicago Jew lives only a short time in the Maxwell Street district. When he becomes more or less Americanized, he moves to the Douglas Park district, one of the most beautiful sections in Chicago.</p>
   <p>With the growth of the body follows the growth of the spirit. A Chicago Jew <pb facs="5423972_7_1538.jpg" n="3"/>thinks more freely than one from the East. The Chicagoan recognizes the differences between the wanton fellow and the radical, as easily as he recognizes the fool and the respectable Jew. No matter how one may try to conceal his identity, he will be recognized in his true colors. The Chicago Jewish civic workers do not look behind them since they have nothing to conceal and, therefore, do not fear the past. Their records are clean, and woe be to that fellow stealing into the community under false pretenses. It makes little difference to what heights he reaches at first for eventually he falls so low that he cannot rise again.</p>
   <p>Many Eastern Jews, unfamiliar with the spirit of Chicago and its Jews, have visited this city recently and were exceedingly astonished at the attacks on the Federation. It is true that not a week has passed in which some Jewish newspaper did not criticize it. Finally the newspaper, Forward, from its ten-story building, started a war on this young corporation.</p>
   <p>Other newspapers followed suit. But these attacks have not hurt the Federation's <pb facs="5423972_7_1539.jpg" n="4"/>collections or subscriptions.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Federation have simply ignored these attacks. There are not a dozen people in Chicago who believe the Federation should answers these accusation. Not even one subscriber has demanded an explanation.</p>
   <p>People who are acquainted with Chicago Jewish civic work, know that the Chicago Jewish public does not give serious consideration to the Forward and its accomplices. But, they did consider the facts very earnestly when the Jewish Courier indicated various weaknesses in Chicago's charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>When the Courier criticized the financial status of the orphanage it stirred up a great commotion. A special committee was appointed. One of the best auditors was hired. Those who feared this left the institution, thus providing a place for a new administration and a new order.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1540.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>When the Courier indicated that the "Strangers' Shelter" was not as it should be, the president and his helpers used public funds for the best lawyers in a vain effort to defend their position; in vain did the Forward and its groups defend the property rights of the officials. But, public opinion was so incensed that the president had to resign, other officers had to leave their positions, and new officers established a new era in that institution.</p>
   <p>A striking parallel comes to the minds of these who do not know the spirit of Chicago Jews. They believe we have miracles here. The fact is that Chicago Jews know the difference between grain and chaff, conservation and radicalism, insincerity and earnestness, ignorance and honesty.</p>
   <p>The office of the Federation knows that out of every hundred subscribers, ninety-two are readers of the Courier; sixty-two out of a hundred do not even know that a newspaper such as the Forward exists, while others have heard of it and about seven have been reading the continued romantic novel.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1541.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>If the Forward has as many readers, as the editor claims to have, they must be like the patrons of the red-light district who are ashamed to claim any relationship with that district, the readers of the Forward being ashamed to admit they read it.</p>
   <p>This is the natural explanation for the miracle and the real reason for the failure of the Forward to do business with the Federation. We will write more on this topic in our next issue.</p>
