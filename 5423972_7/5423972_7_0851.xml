<title level="a">GREAT RECEPTION FOR THE ZIONIST GUESTS: SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS CASH FOR THE KEREN HAYESOD</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>More than one hundred prominent Jewish men and women attended a splendid banquet and reception last night at the Covenant Club in honor of the New York civic worker and Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of the World Zionist Organization] leader, Mr. Peter Schweitzer and Mrs. Schweitzer, and in honor of Dr. Alexander Goldstein, member of the Zionist delegation, and Morris Rothenberg, a prominent Zionist leader of New York.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Horwich, chairman of the executive committee of Chicago, introduced Mr. Max Shulman, who was to act as toastmaster. Mr. Shulman told the audience the purpose of the guests' visit and then introduced the guests.</p>
   <p>Dr. Goldstein, in a brilliant speech, proved that the Keren Hayesod was not a charity institution but was one of the most important funds of the Jewish people, and that the whole political situation in Palestine would be affected <pb facs="5423972_7_0852.jpg" n="2"/>by the success of the Keren Hayesod drive in America.</p>
   <p>"We will be able to approach the leaders of other nations," said Dr. Goldstein, "with the claims of the Jewish people only when the Jewish people, themselves, give money for the Keren Hayesod, which will prove that they want to have a land of their own."</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Schweitzer then made a long and beautiful speech in which he told the audience of the result of the Keren Hayesod drive in America. He also spoke of the political situation in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morris Rothenberg also spoke, and indicated in his speech that the importance of Chicago's work for the Keren Hayesod lies in the fact that it sets an example to be followed by other cities. Dr. S. M. Melamed greeted the guests in the name of the Chicago Zionists.</p>
   <p>In response to an appeal made by Mr. Max Shulman, the sum of six thousand <pb facs="5423972_7_0853.jpg" n="3"/>five hundred dollars in cash was contributed by those present for the Keren Hayesod. Mr. Samuel Phillipson gave two thousand dollars, B. Horwich, Max Shulman, and Thomas Piser, five hundred dollars each.</p>
   <p>The prominent [Jewish] women of Chicago will give a reception and tea in honor of Mrs. Schweitzer, tomorrow afternoon, at 3 P. M., at the La Salle Hotel. Mrs. Benjamin Davis, Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Julius Stone are on the reception committee.</p>
