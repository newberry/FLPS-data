   <p>A protest signed by seventy persons was received at the office of the Courier, who claimed that they, as heads of seventy families are unfortunate enough to be on the list of unemployed and are unable to find work without the help of recommendations.</p>
   <p>The protest is against the B'nai B'rith Free Employment Bureau whose offices are in Schiff's building on 12th Street.</p>
   <p>The reasons for the protest is as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0394.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. When sent to a job, one finds, after rushing to get there before the place opens, and spending his last nickel for car fare, that either the job had been filled about three weeks earlier, or that there is a policeman at the door to protect the lives of the scabs.</p>
   <p>2. They mislead the public with the impression that they do good work, which causes a few hundred fathers of families to sit in their offices all day long, many of them for fifteen weeks and over, expecting to get a job. Finally they are chased out of the office and often times thrown down the stairs.</p>
   <p>In that protest there was also a reproof for the Courier who has lately published a report that the bureau has supplied jobs for 272 people in the course of thirty days, which in the opinion of the protestants was not true.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0395.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We will not publish the full details of the protest nor will we reveal the names, because the protest was written only as bitter suffering unfortunate unemployed family fathers can write, when their families are hungry and they themselves are being fooled every day with false hopes.</p>
   <p>If these people protested against the B'nai B'rith then there must be something wrong in its management. Here the Courier wishes to say the following: now-a-days to run a free employment bureau is a very hard task, and the manager of such a bureau must almost be superhuman to satisfy the hundreds of people that come there daily, feeling tired and embittered, and asking for work to earn enough to buy just bread for their wife and children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0396.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The most, or nearly all workers who come to this free employment bureau, are such as have no trades; for such workers it is hard to find jobs even in the best of times.</p>
   <p>The Jewish worker in general will not apply to the free employment bureau as long as he still has a little change in his pocket and strength in his legs to go from one employer to another asking for a job. Although it is the principle of the B'nai B'rith Free Employment Bureau that the people coming there shall not feel as though they were applying for charity, the word charity is forbidden in their offices. All efforts are made to have all the people coming there feel at home. The bureau does its best for the people. From morning until night they go from one factory to another where many workers are employed, they write letters, and telephone many employers and foremen asking if room can be made for some workers. In most cases they receive very dissatisfactory answers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0397.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Seldom does it happens that a foreman answers a phone call saying that he can use a worker. Then the manager of the bureau picks out one, supposed to be the lucky one of the two hundred who are waiting and by so doing he makes 199 enemies, as they all envy the one picked for the job.</p>
   <p>The fortunate person is now happily running to his new job, but his ill luck is running right after him. When he gets to the place and the employer sees his dried up lips, hollow cheeks, and sunken eyes, he believes that he will not be able to get much work out of him, and he feels that soon there will be ten more people looking for a job and he will be able to pick out big, strong, and husky men. Yet the employer has not the heart to tell the applicant that he can't hire him because he is weak so he tells him that the place is filled.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0398.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The bittered applicant returns to the employment bureau and wants to know why this job did not materialize - on his way to the job he was building castles in the air - he pictured himself coming home from work and telling his family of his job and that they will not suffer hunger any more, and all his hopes are nothing, and the one to blame for that is the manager of the bureau.</p>
   <p>We say something must be done; the time is bad, children suffering from hunger drive their fathers to the employment bureau; the bureau carries the name of this great Jewish organization whose only aim is to do good for the people and when one comes there he is under the impression that the B'nai B'rith organization will at least protect him, his wife, and his children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0399.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We want to say to those who signed the protest that regardless how great and powerful, how good-hearted and well wishing the B'nai B'rith organization is, yet it is impossible for it to change the times.</p>
   <p>We also want to inform you that as far as we know, there is a committee of the B'nai B'rith to investigate the last occurrances in the bureau and all possible changes will be made to satisfy everyone who comes there for aid. Your protest shall not have been in vain.</p>
