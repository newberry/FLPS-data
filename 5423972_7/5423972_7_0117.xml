   <p>The Israelitisch Altenheim Society is the name of a new organization, the purpose of which is to raise money for the erection of a home for aged and indigent Hebrews. The society was formed one year ago, and as a result of the work done, there is now in the hands of the Treasurer over $3,000 to be used for the purpose stated as soon as the remainder of the amount needed is secured. The membership is now more than four hundred.</p>
   <p>At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon a reception and entertainment was given for members of the society at Weber's, on Washington Street. The President, Mrs. L. Newberger, explained the objects and aims in view. She was followed by Rabbi Stolz, who spoke of the great good to be derived from a successful consummation of the plans, and referred to the fact that of all the large cities of the country, Chicago was the only one where there was not an institution of this character.</p>
   <p>The following program was rendered: "Call Me Thine Own," soprano solo, by Mrs. B. J. Cohn; "The Jealous Wife," recitation, by Miss Hanna Felsenthal; piano solo, by Miss Bertie Meyers; mandolin solo, by Mr. Fred J. Meyers.</p>
