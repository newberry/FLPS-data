   <p>By the time this editorial reaches our readers, they will be able to say that in a few days over a month, in five weeks, the Jewish community will begin its work for the new season. The community at large, of course, waits for the coming of the new year to recognize that the season of work is on. And from then on they will be prepared to know that there will be programs and demands and campaigns for all kinds of purposes, educational, cultural, and social. But the few who have matters in charge and who are thinking about the work, know that they must plan carefully and deliberately this year and they cannot wait as long as the rest of the community to plan for the new season. These few cannot know better than the majority that values have been deflated, that fortunes have been wrecked, that the well-to-do of a little while ago have learned a new language. Everyone knows that. But the few appreciate the fact that institutions that the community has built up, must be maintained, not merely for the sake of the pride of the institutions, but also for the safety of the people themselves.</p>
   <p>Mankind pampers its weaknesses in days of prosperity, but it must draw on the source of strength in days of adversity. The stabilizing effects of those <pb facs="5423972_7_0131.jpg" n="2"/>institutions of learning and of religion, that have been taken for granted when everything was going well, must be definitely recognized in the days when the world is awry; perhaps we have been counting as real some details that were but trimming and were not at the heart of life at all. In days of the depression mankind must take stock of the realities and the institutions that have the concern for these realities become absolutely essential for the safety of organized society.</p>
   <p>That does not mean that organizations have not their own realities to face. They have. In better days men and women were lavish in the support of many institutions and they did not always stop to think whether amalgamation of in-institutions might not be a desirable thing. There are many corners, and people readily agreed that every little corner could, for itself, boast of a group of people interested in the welfare of that corner. And in the ultimate, many institutions grew up to do worthy and worthwhile work. All the years have left this year a legacy of institutional life and cost. A year such as the Jewish community is facing, and the larger community as well, will make it necessary for all the institutions to work together, to plan together, perhaps, in the problem of raising money. The very fact that they will have to plan all of this together will give the community a chance to set a new value on <pb facs="5423972_7_0132.jpg" n="3"/>the work that the individual institutions are doing.</p>
   <p>In the past, all that was necessary was for any institution to set its own quota, as it fancied, and then go out to the community and get it. Today, if all the communal organizations are to plan together, it will be necessary to set quotas and limits, not as the institution individually set them, but as altogether, after very careful deliberation, determine. It may be that certain causes that have been maintained for very emotional reasons will have to accept a smaller quota, and certain others will be made surer of their income. There will be certain needs that will be immediate and those institutions serving these causes will be considered first.</p>
   <p>The attention to the work of the year will not mean only that the organizations will have to conduct their campaigns together, and have their quotas of the receipts set on a valuation of the work set by the community at large, but also that some corners of the work will be done more cheaply and more effectively if a number of organizations will merge. It may cut the pride of those who organized and so far have conducted, but the time may have come when that pride must be swallowed and the two or three institutions working in the field may have to amalgamate.</p>

   <p>For example: For many years the Jewish community has been thinking of the religious life of the students in universities. Under the term of religions, we of course, include the social and the cultural. In the past it was impossible for the Jewish students to have place and organizations in which they might have something of the group life and activity. In one direction that need led off into the formation of the Jewish Greek Letter Society, for which, at their best, there was room in the campus and at their worst there was no room anywhere. The difficulty with the Jewish Greek letter fraternities - and the problem extends to the non-Jewish Greek letter fraternities - is that there is really nothing like a constant fraternity as the name indicates. From year to year the body in the fraternity changes and it is not possible to give any fraternity a rating except for that year. At any rate the Greek letter fraternities began not as Greek letter fraternities. They began as centers of Jewish social clanishness. At least that is the history of the Z. B. T. Soon we had Jewish students' leagues. Soon the Jewish Chautauqua Society began to think of the ways in which the students might be helpful to the intellectually growing Jewish life in America and of what responsibility the older Jewish community had to the young students.</p>
   <p>Soon too, the Menorah came with a very elaborate program, and the Menorah Inter-Collegiate Society has always been capable of drawing up very capable programs <pb facs="5423972_7_0134.jpg" n="5"/>and organizational schematics on paper, with officials of high titles. Not so long ago we saw a highly detailed plan of the work of the Menorah organization, with its holding a superholding organization, that reminded us of the holding companies in the business world. Then came the Hillel Foundation of the B'nai B'rith, and the Hillel Foundation was a godsend to the B'nai B'rith; nice crutches in days of limping. The days of the fraternities are numbered. Evenings have many better possibilities than even lodge meetings, in these days. So that we have in the field in the work of the student life in the universities a number of organizations. All of them ask for support. The Hillel maintains the directors in a number of universities. The Menorah has about come down to the occasional publishing of the Menorah Magazine. It has branches in a few of the universities, but our estimate is that these branches have gotten along with very little help from the central office of the Menorah in New York. We think that the time has come when the various organizations will either ask for money from the Jewish community together, and apportion the money according to the worth set to the work, or that the organizations will merge and do their work together, with less expensive title, and with more satisfaction. And, really while we are at this we should not forget that the union of American Hebrew congregations - The United Synagogue, The National Federation of Sisterhoods and the Women's Branch of the United Synagogue are <pb facs="5423972_7_0135.jpg" n="6"/>also doing student welfare work. Some one of the organizations should take up all the rest, or some distinctive Jewish student welfare organization should be formed to take in all the activities.</p>
