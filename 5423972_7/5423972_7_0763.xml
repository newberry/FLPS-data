   <p>The Orthodox Jewish institutions in Chicago are becoming more civilized and more modern. All the Orthodox Jewish institutions in Chicago have learned the spirit of proper management and bussinesslike methods. All keep books and publish financial statements so that the public can see that everything is all right.</p>
   <p>A few days ago the Courier published a detailed financial statement by a reliable auditor of the financial condition of the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery and Infant Home. The statement is concise and precise, and shows what each cent has been spent for.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, the treasurer of the Hebrew Theological College presented a detailed and encouraging financial report on the receipts and disbursements <pb facs="5423972_7_0764.jpg" n="2"/>of that institution. Everybody was happy and satisfied. Every director expressed his satisfaction and promised to do more work. The face of Mr. Ben Zion Leizerowich, the chairman, shone with happiness. The presentation of a report is a step forward when compared with the practice of a very recent past.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow evening, the workers of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of world Zionist Organization] will present a very detailed and encouraging report at the Morrison Hotel, where they will gather for their annual conference. A comparatively large sum was collected in Chicago last year for the Keren Hayesod. The small group of workers, led by Mr. Max Shulman, has the right to be proud of its achievements. No Chicago contributor to the Keren Hayesod should fail to attend the conference of the Keren Hayesod, which will present an encouraging report and will elect new officials.</p>
