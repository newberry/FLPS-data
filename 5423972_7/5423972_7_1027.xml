   <p>The conference of the People's Relief, which was held yesterday in the Labor Lyceum voted to accept the decision of the General Executive to participate in the United drive for $14,000,000 which the Joint Distribution Committee will begin this autumn.</p>
   <p>Immediately after Mr. Lurie, the Chairman of the Executive of the People's Relief, had opened the conference, Mr. Shuchter, the office manager, reported that the clothing campaign had been a huge success.</p>
   <p>N. Rosenfield, a delegate to the General Executive, gave a report of the negotiations and decision to join in the $14,000,000 drive and to open a transmission office, for the purpose of sending private monies to Europe for relatives from American in habitants.</p>
   <p>The conference agreed to the $14,000,000 drive, but presented strong objections to the establishment of a transmission office.</p>
   <p>Many believed that this should not be done since a former experiment had resulted in the receipt of numerous complaints from the senders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1028.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A resolution was passed to notify the New York office that the Chicago People's Relief is opposed to any transmission office.</p>
   <p>The report of the office was accepted and the recommendation that no permanent office manager should be employed, but that the work should be managed by an office committee, was accepted.</p>
