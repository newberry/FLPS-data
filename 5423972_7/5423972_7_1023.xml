   <p>The appeal to the progressive Jewish organizations of Chicago, to come to a Conference, to organize themselves to create immediate relief for the hungry and the weak of Soviet Russia, had a strong response in the hearts of the masses, and a large number of delegates of the various sections of the labor-movement came and unanimously voted to begin the work of conducting a campaign for the relief of Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>Comrade Morris Ziskind called the conference to order, in the name of the Trade Union Conference, and recommended that a Chairman and a Secretary be elected. Comrade L. Benensohn was chosen as Chairman, and M. Ziskind, Secretary.</p>
   <p>It was voted that the name of the Conference should be: Chicago's Relief Conference for Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>A credential committee, consisting of Comrades Strausman, Witt, and Fagan, was elected, and reported that the following organizations were represented through their delegates:</p>

   <p>An Executive Committee of fifteen was then elected. Following are the officers:</p>
   <p>L. Berensohn, Treasurer</p>
   <p>Dr. Baumstein, Financial-Secretary</p>
   <p>Morris Ziskind, Recording-Secretary</p>
   <p>Trustees: Straussman, Witt, Spitolnick, Golden, Bizna, Fagan, Lurie, Dr. Green, Shapiro, Coblents, Weiss, and Blumenthal.</p>
   <p>Following this, a collection totaling $177.00 was made.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously voted that no organization should conduct its own campaign for Relief-Work in Soviet Russia, without the consent of the Conference.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Conference held its meeting immediately after the conclusion of the General Conference, and elected Sam Golden as Chairman, and M. Ziskind as Secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1026.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It was decided to publish an appeal in the Yiddish and English press, and Committees were elected to go to the Chicago Federation of Labor and other labor-bodies for this purpose.
