   <p>More than two thousand Jewish men and women listened with great enthusiasm and interest to the speeches of the Zionist delegation, headed by Nahum Sokolow. The meeting took place last night at Orchestra Hall. The result was that the Keren Hayesod, the fund by which Palestine is to be built, became forty thousand dollars richer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Shulman was chairman of the meeting. He opened the meeting with a speech in which he thanked the audience for the interest they had shown in the visit to Chicago of the Zionist delegation. He expressed the hope that the audience, together with all the Jews of Chicago, would do their best to help build Palestine as a home for the Jews.</p>
   <p>Mr. William Saltiel, Assistant Corporation Counsel, greeted the Zionist delegates in the name of the Mayor and expressed the hope that the Chicago Jews <pb facs="5423972_7_0838.jpg" n="2"/>would not lag behind the other Jews of America, that they would fulfill their duty to Palestine, the land which is the dream and the hope of all the Jews.</p>
   <p>Speeches were then given by Colonel Peterson, Dr. Goldstein and Nahum Sokolow. [Translator's note: The translation of these speeches is omitted as their contents do not fall within the scope of this project.]</p>
   <p>The Mayor's Speech To The Zionist Delegation</p>
   <p>Mayor William Hale Thompson, in the presence of his entire cabinet, officially welcomed the Zionist delegates, Nahum Sokolow, Dr. Alexander Goldstein, and Colonel Peterson, yesterday afternoon, and greeted them in the name of the city of Chicago. The reception was held at the Mayor's office in City Hall. In his speech of welcome to the guests, the Mayor said: "I am honored to extend to you a hearty welcome in the name of Chicago. You have come to a city which is always ready to receive messages from men like you about an <pb facs="5423972_7_0839.jpg" n="3"/>ideal like the one you represent. I understand fully the great purpose of your visit. I know that you, as representatives of a world movement, bear great responsibilities because the future of your organization depends a great deal upon what you will achieve here.</p>
   <p>"Chicago has a great Jewish community, whose contribution to our industrial and cultural life has been of the greatest importance. Whatever we have built here, has been built with the help of the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>"America, in gratitude to the Divine Providence for the freedom and equality which it enjoys, is always ready to extend help to all oppressed and persecuted people, and to support materially any movement which will lead toward the betterment of humanity. We are proud of your visit, and it gives me great pleasure to extend to you the hospitality and freedom of the city."</p>
   <p>In a brilliant speech, Mr. Sokolow thanked the Mayor for his hospitality. He thanked America for its help in effecting the recognition of a Jewish <pb facs="5423972_7_0840.jpg" n="4"/>homeland for the Jews.</p>
   <p>The delegation was introduced to the Mayor by Mr. B. Horwich, chairman of the Chicago Keren Hayesod committee. Judge Joseph Shulman, Max Shulman, Dr. S. M. Melamed, Thomas Piser, Isidore Liederman and Fred Lubin accompanied the delegation to the Mayor.</p>
