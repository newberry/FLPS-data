   <p>Dr. Abraham Levinson of 3304 Douglas Boulevard, Chicago, has just sent the following circular to all of his Jewish colleagues in America:</p>
   <p>"Dear Doctor: You have, no doubt, heard of the efforts of the Zionists to re-establish a Jewish Homeland in Palestine.</p>
   <p>"One of the pressing needs of Palestine, at the present time, is an adequate medical system to fight malaria and trachoma; both diseases are very common in Palestine. Extensive efforts are being made to maintain an effective system of sanitation. Plans are also under way to establish a university in Jerusalem with an efficient medical department.</p>
   <p>"We believe that every Jewish physician in America, be he Zionist or non-Zionist, should interest himself in the medical problems of Palestine. A committee was recently formed to organize the Jewish physicians of America for this purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1166.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Its aims are:</p>
   <p>"1). To assist in the establishment of a Medical Department of the Hebrew University, and in the formation of its library.</p>
   <p>"2). To encourage the study of the medical problems of Palestine.</p>
   <p>"3). To aid in such other ways as may develop.</p>
   <p>"At a recent meeting of the Executive Committee, it was decided that for the present, all efforts should be directed toward the formation of a medical library for the University of Jerusalem. We, therefore, ask you to send books on medical and allied sciences to the Zionist Organization of America, 74 Fifth Avenue, New York City, or to contribute such amounts as you can to our library fund, such contributions also to be sent to the above address. We invite you to join the Organizing Committee. Signify your interest in the cause by sending the enclosed application for membership to the secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1167.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We appeal to you as a medical man and as a Jew.</p>
   <p>"Hoping that you will permit us to count you as one of us, we remain,</p>
   <p>"Fraternally yours,</p>
   <p>"Harry Friedenwald, president, Baltimore, Maryland,</p>
   <p>"Abraham Levinson, secretary, 3304 Douglas Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois,"</p>
  </body>
