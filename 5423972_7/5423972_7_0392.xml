  <body>
   <p>On Halsted Street, corner of 12th, a labor bureau was founded and is being financed by the order of B'nai B'rith. The superintendent, Mr. Eliassof, is a man who has been well known in Chicago for the last forty years. He is devoted with his soul and body to this useful undertaking in the ghetto.</p>
   <p>Although jobs now are some-what scarce, the bureau has been able to secure two hundred and thirty five jobs in the month of October. These two hundred and thirty five jobless people were not able to secure employment themselves; therefore, the bureau immediately got busy and obtained these jobs for them.</p>
   <p>This bureau was not founded for the purpose of assisting the poor with money; it is strictly an employment bureau only. There is no charges either to the employer or employee.</p>
