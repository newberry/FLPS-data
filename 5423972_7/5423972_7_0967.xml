   <p>Peoples Relief Committee decides to join in the campaign to raise $14,000,000 for the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>Last night's conference was a great success despite the fact that it was called in one day. Many unions and Workmen's Circle branches were represented, also progressive and radical organizations.</p>
   <p>Present, were delegates who had appeared at the previous conferences, held Sunday and Monday. Many new organizations were represented, by their officials, who don't believe in destruction, but construction, and in helping their sisters and brothers across the sea.</p>
   <p>Plans were arranged for carrying on the drive, and for bringing to Chicago, Comrade Ab. Zukor, who has been on a mission to Poland for a long time as one of the main representatives of the Joint Distribution Committee, and <pb facs="5423972_7_0968.jpg" n="2"/>who is very well acquainted with all branches of relief work. The following organizations were represented: International Ladies Garment Workers Union, United Hebrew Trade - Carpenter's Union, Cloakmakers - Locals 5-18-59. Butchers Union, Cleaners and Dyers Union, Cigar-makers Union, Bakers Union, many branches of the Workmen's Circle. The Poale Zion and many Landsman schaften, the City Central S.
