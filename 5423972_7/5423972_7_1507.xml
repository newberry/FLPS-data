   <p>This article deals with contemporary problems in Palestine. The author attributes the present rapid growth of Palestine, materially and culturally, to two factors, first the severe economic losses sustained by the Jews during the first two years of the World War, and second, the fact that the War made the Jews think in terms of independence and autonomy.</p>
   <p>The author urges Jews to do less political bickering and more constructive work. He also points out the weakness of Zionist propaganda.</p>
   <p>"The work in Palestine has triumphed. Palestine was in a state of ruin. She has always been a backward country. Now she is cut off from the world. [There is no commerce,] only a constant flow of requisitioned meat products and materials necessary for war. Thousands of Jews, [the so-called] "fiendish" subjects, have run away. Large numbers of Jews are today subjugated and in need of bread. The danger of military service is imminent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1508.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"There is however a basic difference between the war victims in other countries and those in Palestine. As in all countries, there are thousands in Palestine who are in need of bread. But in Palestine we have a Yeshub (Collective farms) which does not need bread, but workers. This need is neither accidental, nor temporary as is all other social work which is being organized in other countries for the refugees. Let the Russian government dream about settling the Jews in the Siberian regions - the aid which now goes to the war victims of Russia will accomplish nothing. The aid will fulfill its mission if it only affords shrouds to the dead, and bread to the living.'</p>
   <p>"The workers in Palestine are the builders, the creators, the basic constructive element left in Palestine. Palestine has become the home of the Jewish worker and his work there is the basis of the Jewish Renaissance.</p>
   <p>"This work and the autonomous character of the Jewish colony in Palestine make the demand for a homeland invincible.</p>
   <p>"This fact reveals the power of the organized Jews. In these great historic times, <pb facs="5423972_7_1509.jpg" n="3"/>the labor interests arise in the Jewish Yeshub in Palestine. Let philanthropy relieve the distress of those in need of bread. Let the open Jewish hand not become tired, and continue to give charity to save the lives of the destitute Jewish victims of the World War. We must not be satisfied with this alone - it is not enough. Great times call for great deeds. Great distress requires national action. We must not wait until the Jewish soldier breathes his last sigh, or the last firebrand of the world conflagration is extinguished. We must respond now to the call of our workers, and under the thunder claps of the artillery, erect the structure of our homeland.</p>
   <p>"It is no accident, that at the time when the ideals and dreams of many nations and countries are being shattered and destroyed, we should proclaim our demands. We are not [being obstinate in our demands]. Our blood is not water. Jewish need must also be reckoned with.</p>
   <p>"For this reason we do not wish to satisfy ourselves with charity alone. Charity is a temporary aid but prevents the people from helping themselves. Once and for all time [let us end the destitution of our people].</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1510.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Help to continue the constructive work in Palestine. Fortify and strengthen the workers there. Give them the opportunity to create new and progressive forms of work and life. The old world is consumed in the holocaust. Old traditions and concepts have perished in the trenches-- in the ruins which give birth to a new world, illumed by a new sun of freedom and equality for all nations, for all working people.</p>
   <p>"The Jewish people must create a material basis for their demands in order to gain a new roothold in the world which is already in the process of formation."</p>
