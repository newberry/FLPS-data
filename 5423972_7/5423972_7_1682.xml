   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the well-known Jewish philanthropist and millionaire, was the guest yesterday of the Advertising Association of Chicago. The hall was crowded with people who had come to hear his address on the subject of "Charity." He favors a general systematic method of charity, expenditures that would replace the day by day alms giving to beggars in the street.</p>
   <p>He stressed the fact that unsystematic methods of charity accomplish nothing in the way of improving impoverished conditions, whereas on the other hand he cited many facts in which the new way of a better system would do much to alleviate the situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1683.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Charity," he said, "does not simply mean the giving of money, coal and food. It demands a firm idea and the intelligence to understand the aims and directions of such undertakings; the plan of bringing happiness into poor homes by instructing the families in economy; so that they might know how to economize in all forms of household goods, especially in such homes where incomes suffice for sustenance. The lack of knowledge in spending money causes great waste where it is most needed."</p>
   <p>In the end he made an appeal to those present, not only to donate their money, but, also their time to help in the noble work of charity.</p>
