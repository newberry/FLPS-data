<title level="a">UNITED APPEAL FOR KEREN HAYESOD AND HEBREW THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE</title><title level="a" type="sub">No More Dead Bodies In The Synagogue</title></bibl>

   <p>On Wednesday evening there was a meeting at the Anshe Sholom Center of the rabbis of Chicago, headed by Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon, and of the synagogue presidents from all parts of the city. The meeting was well attended. It was resolved to make an appeal in the synagogues, during the High Holidays, in behalf of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] and the Hebrew Theological College. Only one appeal will be made. The money realized from the appeal will be divided; seventy per cent will go for the Keren Hayesod and thirty per cent for the Hebrew Theological College. Max Shulman, Dr. S. M. Melamed, Sam Ginsburg, Meyer Abrams, and Dr. Abramowitz appeared at the meeting as a Keren Hayesod Committee to tell the meeting of the importance of having a Keren Hayesod appeal made in the synagogues of Chicago. Mr. Leizerowich, supported by the Keren Hayesod Committee, appeared <pb facs="5423972_7_0768.jpg" n="2"/>in behalf of the Hebrew Theological College. The meeting, acting on a proposal by Dr. Melamed, adopted the resolution for a united appeal, and acting on a proposal of Mr. Miller, adopted the resolution for the seventy-thirty ratio.</p>
   <p>The meeting also heard a committee from the H.I.A.S. [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society], represented by Mr. Copland. Mr. Ginsburg proposed, and it was resolved, that an appeal in behalf of the H.I.A.S. should be made in the synagogues on the day before the last day of the holidays.</p>
   <p>An important community and religious problem came up before the meeting. Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon pointed out that Chicago's custom of bringing a dead body to the synagogue is a violation of the Jewish law. The meeting decided to refrain from this procedure in the future, and that no more dead bodies would be brought to the synagogue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0769.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon expressed his thanks and satisfaction to the rabbis and synagogue presidents present for adopting the resolution concerning the dead bodies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Weil was chairman.</p>
