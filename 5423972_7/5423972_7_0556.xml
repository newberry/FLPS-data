   <p>Chicago must raise not less than $5,000 for the Medem Fund. This is the decision of the representatives of all Chicago labor organizations, which was accepted at the special conference, Wednesday night, at Douglas Workmen's school, 1224 S. Albany Ave.</p>
   <p>At this conference, delegates of various bodies of Chicago were present. The organizations represented were the United Hebrew Trades, the Amalgamated, the International, the Capmakers, the Workmen's Circle, the Verband, the Forward Association, the Bund Relief Organization in Chicago, the Evanston Club, and many others. The initiative of the movements was in the City Central Workmen's Circle. The conference listened to a report by Comrade G. Ziebert, the delegate from Poland, who acquainted those present with the exact plan and all information regarding the Medem Fund, and suggested organizing a special committee in Chicago, which would carry on the campaign for the Chicago Medem Fund. The chairman of the conference, Comrade S. P. Kramer, accepted Comrade Ziebert's proposal, and a special Medem's Committee, which all organizations present approved, was immediately formed. The committee, at its first session, adopted several important resolutions concerning the work of raising $5,000 for the Medem Fund.</p>

   <p>The Medem Committee also, at the same session, appointed an Executive Board of seven members. S. P. Kramer was appointed chairman, Louis Benenson, treasurer, Comrade B. Smaliard, secretary. The remaining four members of the Executive Board are: A. Kalish, Dr. Z. Lorber, John Mill, and Bialia, of the International.</p>
