   <p>Reflective Jews of late are becoming more worried about the fading vigor of Judaism among the youth in America. Throughout the ages we have maintained our ideals and traditions at the cost of many and terrible sacrifices. In the past we have never felt the lack of courageous workers and fighters in the cause of Judaism, but now the heritage of all these ages of strife and struggle is in danger of being left without appreciative inheritors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0252.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At present here in America, the majority of our youth reaches maturity without forming a proper conception of Jewish cultural aims, ideal or past history. They fail to receive Jewish inspiration in their homes; few enroll in Jewish schools, and of those who do enroll only a very small number retain their Jew-consciousness. The synagogues do not attract them, even those synagogues which have resorted to the practice of providing English-speaking preachers, have also failed to draw the attendance of our youth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0253.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We see our young people frittering away their leisure time among such places as ice cream parlors, drug stores, pool rooms, dance halls, etc. These amusements are not harmful in themselves, but when the youth indulges in them to the exclusion of participation in Jewish activities, they have the effect of lulling the Jew-consciousness of these young people. Thus our youth drifts imperceptibly, but surely nevertheless away from its Jewish moorings.</p>
   <p>Of course it cannot be denied that in the past the Jewish youth also spent its time more or less at various amusements or recreations which had no connection with things of national import. But in those times there was not so much cause for deploring the situation because our field of action was limited then anyway.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0254.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We had no political organization, we had no constructive policy, in short, the Jewry in those times lived only on hopes and visions. But now with all the opportunities we have to further our movement, now when there is a Jewish renaissance of international proportions, it is indeed vital to enlist our youth in this momentous work. And we as a nation have the moral right to require that the Jewish youth interest itself in our undertakings.</p>
   <p>The conditions of our American life as it is constituted socially and economically certainly does not help to encourage our youth to busy, itself with Jewish problems. Therefore it is necessary to employ means of inculcating Jewishness indirectly, to provide an atmosphere through <pb facs="5423972_7_0255.jpg" n="5"/>which the youth may imbibe national (Jewish) culture and pride unconsciously, thus making our young people at least sympathetic to Jewish aims. This idea to our great satisfaction we can find embodied in the new Jewish People's Institute. This new structure is simply yet attractively fashioned both externally and internally. Here are to be found recreational facilities such as gymnasium, swimming pool, billiard room, roof garden, theatre, etc. For educational purposes there are lecture rooms devoted to the purpose of giving instruction in various branches of knowledge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0256.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is obvious then, that there are ample facilities for educational as well as recreational purposes. Such an environment providing as it does, an ideal place for the gratification of the needs and desires of our young people is, beyond doubt, valuable. Add to that an atmosphere of Jewishness, make it pervade the entire building from the basement to the roof, and you have something unique and of inestimable value to our youth.</p>
   <p>This atmosphere is to be found in the new Jewish People's Institute. Let us mention but a few of the remarkable things in this institute: A ceiling patterned in a mosaic of pictures illustrating various phases of ancient Jewish history; various devices and emblems of Jewish significance painted and engraved on lampshades, cigar stands, book-ends, <pb facs="5423972_7_0257.jpg" n="7"/>etc,, rooms named for persons prominent in Jewish history or Jewish affairs such as: Hillel Room, Esther Room, Maimonides Room, Ach'ad Ha'am Room, etc. In short, wherever you find yourself, whether in the swimming pool, the library, the kitchen or the theatre, your eyes are bound to encounter "Mugenduvids," "Menoralis," "Shafers," "Scrolls," etc. There is even a room set aside for the exhibition of all articles used in Jewish rites and ceremonials. The library is especially well-stocked with many, many volumes pertaining to Jewish knowledge. Another interesting department is the kitchen which is divided into two sections, one section for milcheks and one for fleisheks; this division will no doubt stimulate the curiosity of those who may be unacquainted with the distinction.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0258.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Thus it can be seen that the entire scheme is strongly reminiscent of Jewishness at every step, and the amount of curiosity and interest it is bound to arouse will be almost incalculable.</p>
