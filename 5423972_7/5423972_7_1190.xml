<title level="a">GREAT PREPARATIONS FOR RELIEF CONVENTION IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Great preparations are being made by the Chicago Joint Relief Committee for the convention of relief workers from the Middle West, which will take place here Sunday, March 14, at the Sherman Hotel. As has already been announced, the convention has been called for the purpose of organizing the relief activities in this part of the country, as well as of formulating plans for the most effective aid possible for the unfortunate Jews across the sea, in order to help them get on their feet.</p>
   <p>The office of the above-mentioned Committee, 720 West Roosevelt Road, has announced that one hundred and forty organizations have already indicated that they would be represented by delegates at the convention. About forty of these organizations are from Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Nebraska. The rest are from Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1191.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The sooner the various organizations elect their delegates, the easier it will be to make the arrangements for the convention, and the more assured its anticipated success will be. Organizations which have not yet appointed their delegates, are requested to do so at the earliest possible moment.</p>
   <p>In conjunction with the convention, which will consist of two sessions, a banquet will be given in the evening at the Ashland Clubhouse, at which the main speaker will be Mr. Isaac Don Levine, the famous correspondent of the Daily News.</p>
