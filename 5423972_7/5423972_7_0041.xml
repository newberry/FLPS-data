   <p>The annual meeting of the Home for the Aged was held yesterday, at which reports by the officers were read and twelve directors were elected for a three year term.</p>
   <p>The meeting, which brought together the enthusiastic members of the Home, was distinguished by the devotion of everyone. An official discussion decided that the Home for the Aged should not permit any funds to be raised through a mortgage.</p>
   <p>The Home for the Aged, with the annex and hospital which were recently built, has a deficit of $15,000 to date. Several expressed the view that the urgent debts should be met by a mortgage of $15,000 while the majority were of the opinion that the custom of accumulating debts for the Jewish community in Chicago should be abrogated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0042.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Isadore Lasker, one of the directors, expressed his willingness to contribute $500 to a fund of ten thousand dollars, which should be raised within the succeeding ninety days, in order to free the Home from debts. This matter will be taken up at the next Directors' meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order at 3 O'Clock by Mr. Margolis, president of the Home, who gave a brief report of last year's activities in the Home.</p>
   <p>Mr. Siegel, financial secretary, read his report which showed how Chicago Jewry exercise all opportunities to furnish greater convenience for the aged. An annex and hospital were also built in the course of the past year.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0043.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mrs. Benjamin Davis, recording secretary, then read a masterly report treating each activity of the Home for the Aged. She commenced her report by explaining the novel turn taken by Chicago Jewry in the field of charity, through the establishment of the Orthodox Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>The report further relates that there were ninety-four inmates in the Home on January 1, 1912. Throughout the year seventy-nine new applications were submitted to the Home, of which thirty-nine were recommended for acceptance; ten were rejected; two were withdrawn; three are being considered, and twenty-five are being investigated. The Home admitted thirty-four aged and lost thirteen who died; six have voluntarily left the Home and one was suspended. There were 108 aged men and women in the Home by January 1, 1913, among whom a few are paralyzed, blind and feeble, who are now confined to the hospital where medical treatment is rendered them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0044.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The report points out that despite an increase in the number of inmates and an increase in expenses, due to the annex and hospital, the contributions from members have decreased. The annex cost $27,010.85; the wealth of the Home amounts to more than $157,000, on which there remains a debt of $13,000. The total amount of membership dues last year was $10,278.50; - this year only $9,574.70. The Women's Auxiliary contributed $5,400 - $1,200 less than last year.</p>
   <p>The following directors were elected for three years:</p>
   <p>Harris Cohen, Isadore Lasker, H. Kramer, Able Burnstein, B. J. Schiff, B. Margolis, M. Tauer, A. S. Rave, B. Baumgarden, Isadore Siegel, Israel Cowen, and A. Levinson.</p>
