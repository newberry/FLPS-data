   <p>Last Sunday afternoon the Home for Aged Jews on Drexel Ave. and 62 nd st., was publicly dedicated. The grounds upon which the Home stands cost $35,000, the cost of the main building and the annex is $70,000. It contains 45 rooms with the larger ones arranged for two inmates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morris, the president, read and address in which he gave the history of the Home. Dr. A.J. Messing spoke of the origin of the movement to establish a Home for Aged Jews in Chicago. The speaker stated that the first steps were taken by ten Jewish ladies, the remaining members of the Ladies Social Society which he had organized about 15 years ago. These ten ladies met one day at the house of Mrs. A. Perlinsky with the intention of disbanding the Society. When the question was raised as to what should be done with the few hundred dollars in their treasury, one lady moved that this money should be devoted to the establishment of a Home for Aged Jews. The motion was carried and "The Altenheim Society was established. The Society increased in membership <pb facs="5423972_7_0090.jpg" n="2"/>and funds, and these ladies gave material aid to the new institution dedicated Sunday. Other addresses were delivered by Dr. Moses, Dr. Stolz, Rev. A. Nordan, and Dr. Hirsch.</p>
   <p>The officers are Morris Rosenbaum, president, E. Frankenthal, vice-president, B. Lowenthal, treasurer, H.E.Greenebaum, secretary, Mrs. I.L. Bernheimer, financial secretary and Mrs. B.L. David, superintendent.</p>
