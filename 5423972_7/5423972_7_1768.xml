   <p>From an article, "A Truly Practical Philanthropic Endeavor" by A. E. Rosenthal.</p>
   <p>"It may surprise many of my readers to discover that there exists in Chicago, an ideal poor man's loan society. Born, bred and raised in the Ghetto, the 'Rabbi Stzchok Elchonon's G'milas Chasodim (Charitable Institution) thrives and does its weekly round of general good.</p>
   <p>This society was organized about two years ago by members of the Russian Jewish synagogue at Canal and Liberty sts. At first it struggled for life. Money was needed and those called upon were people of limited means. However, the infant thrived and today the society boasts a membership of 350. Each of these members contributes five cents and a few, ten cents a week. No salaries are paid the officers, but a small commission is given a collector for gathering these nickels and dimes.</p>
   <p>The plan of procedure is this - a man concludes that he must borrow money and he goes to the society. Its meetings are held in the vestry rooms of the synagogue <pb facs="5423972_7_1769.jpg" n="2"/>on Sundays from 3 to 6 P. M., a convenient hour. Here he makes application for the loan, stating the amount, seldom less than ten dollars, never more that twenty-five. The application is held until the following Sunday. On this day the applicant returns and receives his loan. He is obliged to sign a promissory note for the amount of his debt and it is also necessary to have a friend sign with him to impress the borrower with the importance of repaying the loan, by making the obligation moral as well as legal.</p>
   <p>Repayment may be made in ten equal weekly installments and no interest is charged. When the debt has been paid, the payer may again borrow.</p>
   <p>Very little money has been lost by bad debts. During the first fifteen months of its existence the society assisted 600 different people. 400 of these have repaid their loans and not applied again. This fact proves that the assistance was, to a degree at least, permanent. Can anyone question the good of such an organization? The patrons are, for the most part, peddlers, and small shop-keepers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1770.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In some instances, the borrowers have accumulated a few dollars in addition to their working capital. To them, apparently, the society appears as a safe bank of deposit for they are loaning their money to the organization and receiving no interest.</p>
   <p>That this loan society is a success is clearly proved by its history. It is no longer an experiment. It is a demonstration of what can be done in truly practical philanthrophy. $3,000 was loaned and repaid the first year, no one was pauperized, 400 were permanently assisted and the community benefitted to that extent. There is food for thought in the history of this society.</p>
