   <p>We are reporting in another part of the Courier about the annual conference of the People's Relief Committee, which dissolved almost in a riot.</p>
   <p>The report of the People's Relief Committee was not accepted; many questions were asked about money matters, about the questionable figures, and the leaders of the People's Relief Committee--mostly professional radicals--were unable to give the proper answer. There was a tumult and an alarm, and the conference, which was supposed to answer all the questions, which we have several times put up, adjourned without giving an accounting, which the delegates themselves expected from them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1063.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What kind of a relief conference is it, that it is unable to give an account of its activities for the year, and cannot state where the moneys went to? The delegates to the conference found copies of an unsigned report at their places. This report is so contradictory that even a person who understands little about figures must recognize it is a fraud.</p>
   <p>The delegates soon became aware of the fact that the report was not only not signed by an auditor but even not by a finance committee, and they, naturally, began to ask questions. Instead of answering these questions, the gentlemen of the bintel newspaper [Translator's note: Bintel is a deprecating reference to the "Letters to the Editor" department in the Forward, where people write of their troubles and are given advice by the editor.] wanted to distort the issue with a proposal that the representatives of the Courier should not be allowed to attend the conference. The proposal was made twice and both times it was defeated, because the public, after all, is not dumb and would not permit itself to be duped by a few crooked politicians, who will have to prove that they have clean hands.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1064.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If the sums, which the People's Relief have handled during the year, had been very large ones, then it would be understandable that an annual conference would be unable to prepare a report in a perfect manner. But the financial baggage of the People's Relief Committee is very light. It deals with a sum of less than thirty thousand dollars. It seems that it should not be difficult to give a specific report about such a small sum, and yet the conference was forced to adjourn without an accounting.</p>
   <p>The delegates learned one thing from the unsigned report, which they did not accept, namely, that the expenses of the People's Relief Committee were about fifty per cent and this is not only scandalous, but theft and robbery.</p>
   <p>The Central Relief Committee in Chicago works with an expense of three per cent. The American Relief Committee works with an expense of four per cent and the People's Relief Committee with an expense of almost <pb facs="5423972_7_1065.jpg" n="4"/>fifty per cent. If this is not robbery, then we do not know what robbery is.</p>
   <p>If a private concern, dependent upon credit and trust, issued such a report as the People's Relief Committee, its administrators would wind up in jail.</p>
   <p>On the credit side of this report, numerous items are missing, whereas there are numerous disbursements of which there are no record.</p>
   <p>On an income of little more than twenty-six thousand dollars, the expenses amounted to over eleven thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Here are authentic figures: The income was $26,238.52; $8000 of this amount should be deducted because it is a refund. The expenses were $11,529.08.</p>
   <p>There was nothing much left after a whole year of begging, picnics, benefits, <pb facs="5423972_7_1066.jpg" n="5"/>donations, operas, and theatrical performances.</p>
   <p>What has become of the money? Into whose pocket did it go? What do the workers, who have saved from their daily meal to give a few cents for relief think? Do they know that almost fifty per cent of the moneys which they give to the People's Relief Committee does not reach the hungry Jews in Europe, but is being expended to administer the funds?</p>
