   <p>The unemployed will be provided for until conditions improve, and the heads of families will secure work from the Jewish Aid Society on Morgan and Maxwell Streets. This decision was reached yesterday at a conference of the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>Present at this conference were Kiss Tousing, superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society and of the Associated Jewish Charities; Mrs. J.B. Malkes, chairman of the Committee to Aid Unemployed Workers; Mrs. Samuel L. Rosenblatt, vice-chairman of the Committee; Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, of the Jewish Courier; and Mr. I. Shapiro, secretary of the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>The names of families of unemployed workers were examined, and it was found that many of them belonged to people of high social standing, people who never <pb facs="5423972_7_1599.jpg" n="2"/>before had applied for charity; others were tradesmen, to whom relief was to be extended for a short time. They considered a way whereby they could get relief without being humiliated. After considerable deliberation, it was decided that Miss Tousing should attend to all cases recommended by the Committee to Aid Unemployed Workers.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Aid Society will shelter these families and provide them with rent, groceries, coal, utilities, and other necessities.</p>
   <p>The committee that fills orders for meals and sleeping quarters had a very busy day. The wide-spread rumor that the committee was dishing out meals to everybody attracted a new element that besieged the office of the United Hebrew Trades. Among the new comers were many to whom the committee thought it would be a crime to give meals that were intended for those who are really in need.</p>
   <p>For some time the committee had to suffer the inroads of the professional meal-ticket parasite, who, on being denied aid, threatened the committee with disorder <pb facs="5423972_7_1600.jpg" n="3"/>and physical injury. The committee, consisting of Mrs. Malkes, Morris Seskind, and I. Shapiro, found itself up against it. Being morally responsible for the unemployed workers, and not being permitted to distribute meals to this new element, Mr. Shapiro spoke to them, saying that their action would only bring chaos and cause relief to be stopped for all. He urged them not to listen to professional agitators and let the committee carry on its work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shapiro's talk cooled off the crowd and things returned to normal.</p>
   <p>Yesterday the Courier received $922.46 as a relief contribution.</p>
