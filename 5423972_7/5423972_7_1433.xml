   <p>With the consent of America and England, Hadassah's medical expedition, consisting of forty-one persons will leave New York shortly for Palestine.</p>
   <p>The expedition is being sent by Hadassah, the Zionist Women's Organization which assigned the sum of $250,000 [as a quota] for its first year's work. Besides the General Director and Representative of the Organization, the expedition consists of a medical director, fifteen doctors, fifteen nurses, an expert on sanitary conditions, two mechanics, two pharmacists and a staff of dentists. The doctors are specialists in eye, ear, nose and throat, as well as skin and children's diseases. A hospital in Jerusalem has been set up for the expedition. In addition the expedition will open a dispensary and a school for nurses. The expedition carries over $40,000 worth of medical supplies.</p>
   <p>Together with the medical expedition, Hadassah is forwarding seventy big-sized trunks of clothing for the poor of Palestine. The clothing is <pb facs="5423972_7_1434.jpg" n="2"/>collected by the Hadassah branches all over the country, and the collections are still continuing. Later, more clothing and supplies will be sent to Palestine. The money for the expedition came from the following sources: $120,000 from the Provisional Zionist Committee, $100,000 from the Joint Distribution Committee and $30,000 through individual donations. Two tons of soap were donated by Mrs. Felz.</p>
