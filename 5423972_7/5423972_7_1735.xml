   <p>This is an appeal to the Jews of Chicago to assist this charity society in helping the poor this winter. We found 120 families consisting of old and young, widows with orphan children some of whom are sick. All are in great need and distress. They need warm shelter, warm clothes and food. Do you realize who is taking care of these unfortunates? You and your friends are cordially invited to come to our headquarters, 152 Maxwell St. every Thursday 8 P.M. and see for yourself what the society is doing for the poor. We bought 120 tons of coal, for distressed families. The expense is enormous. We must contribute $40.00 per week for bread and meat, and 600 dollars for coal. Our present income is small and unless the Jewish people of Chicago come to our rescue, we will be compelled to close this charity undertaking. Therefore we have decided to call a massmeeting of our members to discuss methods for carrying on our good work for the poor. The meeting will take place Monday, Dec. 7th at Pritkin's Hall, Corner Halsted &amp; Maxwell Sts. We appeal to you again, we need members, friends, and all Jews of Chicago to help us formulate suitable plans to keep on with our good work for the poor. In conclusion, we tank the donors who helped us necently, the amount collected is $82.31</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>E. Wolph, President</p>
   <p>Lipman Weiss, Vice-pres.</p>
   <p>Sam Halperin, Sec.</p>
