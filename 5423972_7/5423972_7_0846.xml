  <body>
   <p>Although we are busy with the great and sacred work in behalf of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of the World Zionist Organization] we must not, at the same time, forget the great traditional Jewish duty of Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy]. This duty has a special significance this year.</p>
   <p>Passover arrives this year in the midst of a great economic crisis, a crisis of unemployment, a business crisis which has had a particularly severe effect upon the small businessman. Unfortunately, the number of recipients this year will be much larger than last year, while the number of contributors will be much smaller because many people who in past <pb facs="5423972_7_0847.jpg" n="2"/>years gave generously for Ma-oth Hitim, will not be able to do so this year, as many of them will be recipients this year.</p>
   <p>The duty of those who are in a position to give, will be much greater this year. Also greater will be the duty of all civic and social workers to organize the work of collecting the Ma-oth Hitim and of distributing it to the needy, particularly to those who, for the first time in their lives, stretch out their hands for charity. The work ought not to be postponed; it must begin at once so that no poor Jew of Chicago will lack the essentials for the proper observance of the great holiday, and so that every Jew in Chicago who is in a position to give, may sit down at the Seder [Translator's note: the religious ceremony and feast celebrated in Jewish homes on the first and second nights of Passover] table, realizing that he has done his sacred duty toward the needy of his community.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jewry has a reputation for its welfare work and it is to be hoped <pb facs="5423972_7_0848.jpg" n="3"/>that this splendid reputation will be strengthened by a prompt response to the appeal for Ma-oth Hitim, the most noble form of Jewish charity. Let us hope that Jewish Chicago will do its local Jewish duty as it has done its national Jewish duty up until now. Let us hope that it will do its duty immediately because the time is short and there is much work to be done.</p>
