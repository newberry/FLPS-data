   <p>The rain yesterday did not hinder the Chicago Jews from doing their duty toward their unfortunate brothers and sisters in the war-ridden countries. Heartbreaking scenes took place and played a great part in practically all the synagogues in the city....</p>
   <p>At the B'nai Ruben synagogue, when Cantor Teitlebaum sang the memorial hymns for the dead Jewish warriors, a half dozen Jewish women fainted.</p>
   <p>At the Kneses Israel synagogue, Judge Hugo Pam delivered a very impressive address, appealing to the audience for support of the noble cause. He was the first to empty his purse and when he discovered that the sum was not sufficient, he presented his gold watch to the relief fund.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1521.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Immediately after this, money and jewelry began to pour into the relief coffers. Mr. Benjamin and his son donated $570 in cash.</p>
   <p>The tag day was a great success. Late in the evening when all the cash was counted, it approximated $10,000. A resolution was passed, to extend thanks to the president for designating this special day for collecting relief funds for the war-ridden Jews. The general subscription committee reported that approximately $30,000 was raised by monthly subscriptions. It seems that this Jewish day will be a phenomenal success.</p>
   <p>At the Shaarah Torah synagogue an unemployed painter, who for the first time in three months had obtained employment, donated his first day's wages to the relief fund. Similar scenes took place in many other synagogues. Nearly all moneys collected for the fund were donated by Jews....</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1522.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Among the contributors one could find many non-Jewish people who contributed liberally to the Jewish war victims' fund. The well-known actress, Blanche Bates, sent a check for $100. Rose Stahl, another noted actress, sent a check for $50 for this worthy cause....</p>
   <p>At the office of the Jewish Courier, a letter was received, which speaks for itself. It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Please hand over the enclosed check for $3.70 to the Jewish relief fund for war victims. This sum was collected by some twenty-odd patients of the Cook County Consumptive Hospital and Oak Forest Sanitarium. It represents every cent these poor patients possessed."</p>
