   <p>A mass meeting that has been organized to welcome the workers' delegation from Palestine and Dr. Judah Leb Magnes of New York, will take place in Chicago next Sunday. At that meeting, an appeal will be made to the Jewish workers of Chicago in behalf of a Jewish Workers' Bank in Palestine. The yellow Socialists [Translator's note: "yellow" here has the meaning of "pseudo"] who were afraid that the meeting would be well attended and successful, arranged to hold a Socialist meeting on that day, at the same hour, so as to draw away the workers from the meeting in behalf of Zion. Their machinations will do them little good. The biggest organizations of Jewish workers, and many important Workmen's Circle branches, have already promised that they would attend the meeting next Sunday to hear the addresses of Dr. Judah Leb Magnes and Berel Katzenelenson.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0909.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Despite all the tricks of the "yellow" comrades who are afraid of the word Palestine, because the Jewish workers who are interested in Palestine will not be duped by the "yellow" grafters--the mass meeting next Sunday will draw a large crowd. There are a great many Jewish workers in Chicago, who are intelligent and sympathetic, who realize the importance of such a great undertaking as a Jewish Workers' Bank in Palestine.</p>
   <p>It is high time that the Jewish organizations in Chicago, particularly the synagogues and the lodges, began to prepare for the reception of the Zionist delegation that is due to arrive here on March 5. The Jewish organizations in Chicago did excellent work in preparing the reception of Dr. Weitzmann. Everything done in connection with the reception was successful: the greeting of Dr. Weitzmann at the Congress Hotel, the demonstration, the banquet, and the mass meeting at the Auditorium. Nahum Sokolow deserves as fine a welcome as Dr. Weitzmann received. One man is an honor to the Jewish nation; the other <pb facs="5423972_7_0910.jpg" n="3"/>is one of its pillars.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jews would start right now to organize the reception for the delegation.</p>
