   <p>American Jewry will soon make another effort to secure fourteen million dollars for relief purposes. The National Relief Conference, held a few days ago in Chicago, has decided to embark upon a fourteen-million-dollar campaign, and we are sure that the decision will be carried out, and that when the campaign is over the fourteen million dollars will have been collected. We admire the courage of our leaders for we know that conditions are not very favorable at the present time, and that even the wealthy ones among our people complain of bad times. Our leaders know perfectly well that it was much easier to collect fifty million dollars two years ago than it will be to collect fourteen million dollars today, but still they have decided to inauguarte this campaign, because they know that without American Jewish relief, millions of our people in Eastern Europe are doomed. It is interesting to note that many delegates to the Conference came here with <pb facs="5423972_7_0997.jpg" n="2"/>clear instructions from their districts not to agree to participate in any campaign, because these districts are tired of giving and are, so to speak, philanthropically exhausted. After the delegates had heard the reports or Mr. Felix Warburg, head of the Joint Distribution Committee, Dr. Bogen, Mr. James Becker, Mr. Howard Gans, Dr. Fran Rosenblatt, and many other experienced and well-informed relief workers, they had to agree to the plan of the American Jewish Relief Committee to inaugurate a new relief campaign. The situation in Eastern Europe is still too horrible for words. This is somewhat similar to the condition of the Jews in Poland two years ago, although matters in Poland are not so bad now, for we can at least communicate with the Polish Jews and this means a great deal; but in Ukrainia and in Soviet Russia the position of the Jews is as bad, if not worse, than that of the Polish Jews two years ago. They are constantly being pogromed, and are suffering from acute famine. While the Joint Distribution Committee could discontinue relief work in Poland, it has to provide immediate relief in Soviet Russia and in Ukrainia, because the situation there is beyond description. Besides, there are five hundred thousand Jewish refugees in all <pb facs="5423972_7_0998.jpg" n="3"/>parts of Eastern and Central Europe who must be repatriated, and there are two hundred thousand Jewish orphans, both war and pogrom orphans, who are dependent upon our help. We will have to care for them for the next five or six years, and we will have to spend from five to six million dollars a year to help from fifty to sixty thousand war orphans grow up to manhood and to womanhood.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances we can hardly discontinue our relief work. The fact of the matter is that we will have to continue it in one form or another for the next decade. We will have to spend at least another one hundred million dollars before Eastern European Jewry will be self-supporting.</p>
   <p>The Eastern European Jews are as much in dire need today as they were two years ago. They are absolutely dependent upon us. Their economic situation cannot be improved without our help, and their political situation cannot be improved without the betterment of their economic situation, for as long as millions of Jews in Eastern Europe are condemned to beggary and to famine, <pb facs="5423972_7_0999.jpg" n="4"/>they cannot be held in respect by the peoples sheltering them, even if these peoples were not imbued with anti-Semitism. There can, therefore, be no thought of discontinuing our relief work, and we have to carry the burden of relief for many more years to come, and none of us should think that he is giving now for the last time. We will be called upon many times to give, and we will have to do it, for the very existence of our people in Europe is at stake, and unless we are not in a position to give, it is our plain duty to come to the aid of our tortured people in Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>The Chicago quota in the fourteen-million-dollar drive to be inaugurated November 6, this year, will be one and a half million dollars. The drive will be entirely Jewish, and every Jew and Jewess in the city of Chicago will be called upon to give his or her share toward the relief fund. Per capita it will be five dollars. We are convinced that Chicago Jewry will give its quota this time as it has each time before. Chicago Jewry has a set of splendid relief workers, all public-spirited and serious-minded Jews <pb facs="5423972_7_1000.jpg" n="5"/>and their leadership and guidance, we hope, will inspire Chicago Jewry to give all they can to the great cause.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews in the city of Chicago will have to do better this year than they did last year. We expect that the sum to be raised by the leaders of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee, with the help of the Rabbis and the presidents of the Synagogues, will amount to at least one quarter of a million dollars. The Orthodox Jews in Chicago have to set the example, and must be a source of inspiration to the community at large. The leading figure in the Chicago drive, Mr. James Becker, has already served notice on the workers of the Federated Charities that he expects them to do all they can in connection with the fourteen-million-dollar campaign, and it is our sincere wish that every Orthodox Jew in Chicago will do his duty, both as a donor and as a solicitor, to make the coming drive a success in Chicago. If it is a success in Chicago, it will be a success in the Middle West too, and then the East will, of course, have to fall in line.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1001.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>In spite of the bad times, we are very optimistic regarding the outcome of the drive, mainly because the leaders in the relief campaign will work with enthusiasm and determination, and will inspire others to do their bit.</p>
