<title level="a">OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS RAISED AT A BANQUET FOR MR. JACOB LOEB: ROSENWALD GIVES ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS</title></bibl>

   <p>Over three hundred of the most prominent Jewish men and women of Chicago attended a banquet given in honor of Mr. Jacob Loeb, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of his presidency of the Hebrew Institute. The banquet was given at the Standard Club last night.</p>
   <p>Over two hundred thousand dollars was raised on this occasion for the building fund of the institution on Taylor Street, which will soon have a branch in the Lawndale district. One hundred thousand dollars was given by Mr. Julius Rosenwald, who was toastmaster of the banquet. Another hundred thousand dollars was presented by General Abel Davis to Mr. Loeb for the building fund in the name of some of Mr. Loeb's friends. The women's auxiliary, through Mrs. J. B. Lassers, gave five thousand dollars. No appeals were made.</p>
   <p>The speakers of the evening were: Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, David Brown of Detroit, <pb facs="5423972_7_0208.jpg" n="2"/>and Dr. Stephen Wise of New York. They all spoke of Mr. Loeb's significance as a Jew and as an American, and expressed sincere hopes that the million dollars needed for the building fund of the institution, would be raised in honor of Mr. Loeb. Dr. Wise and Dr. Hirsch pointed out that the Institute should stand for Judaism, otherwise it would not be what it was supposed to be. "Judaism and Americanism," they said, "go hand in hand." Those present enthusiastically applauded the speakers.</p>
   <p>The contributions were announced and then Mrs. Julius Stone, secretary of the Institute, presented Mr. Loeb with a beautiful album.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor replied with an appropriate speech, assuring the audience that he would continue, in the future, to fulfill his duty to the Institute. A thunder of applause broke out. The beautiful banquet, which had been so carefully arranged by Mrs. Julius Stone, with the assistance of Mr. Philip Seman, came to an end.</p>
