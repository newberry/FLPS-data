   <p>Report of Executive Director (Samuel D. Schwartz) of Sinai Social Center.</p>
   <p>That our Monday Evening Lecture Course with a regular membership this season of 1,721 members and a weekly attendance that taxed the capacity of our Temple, has been a success financially to the extent of almost $5,000.00 profit, you all know.....We have had, as you know, speakers of all shades of opinion, radicals like Scott Nearing and Margaret Sanger, and conservatives whose message aided in an understanding of present day thought. Organizations in a number of other cities have sought our aid in the promotion of similar lecture enterprises in their respective communities.</p>
   <p>Our Sunday Evening Concerts, given under the conductorship of Mr. Dunham by thirty artists of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra were not a success <pb facs="5423972_7_0197.jpg" n="2"/>financially, but were the source of unmeasured happiness to many..... The children of the Chicago Home for Jewish Orphans, the disabled veterans from the United States Government Hospital, and the blind, were also among those who came week after week to listen to the wonderful music rendered.</p>
   <p>The many study groups - classes in the study of psychology, psycho-analysis, English, the history of civilization, the development of modern culture, the course in great contemporary writers, were well attended. Our children's work was carried on successfully. The Children's Department of Expression and Dramatic Art....our classes in dancing, of which there are sixteen, our piano and violin work, all met with a very hearty response. The Opera Club, our Center Orchestra....brought pleasure and recreation to those who participated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0198.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have maintained a dramatic department, whose work has been of an unique character....</p>
   <p>The Athletic Department, the largest of all of our activities, with a membership of approximately 2,000....our swimmers have held the Amateur Athletic Federation championship for eleven years.</p>
   <p>About twenty per cent of our membership is non-Jewish. The Jewish Educational Center, an orthodox organization, has maintained a daily Hebrew school of about 200 children in our building. The Zionists have held meetings in our rooms and programs in this Auditorium.</p>
