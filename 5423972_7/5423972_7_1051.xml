   <p>The Annual Convention of the Joint Relief which was held yesterday in the auditorium of the Sherman Hotel, was so scandalized that the convention was just saved from breaking up. Mr. B. Horwitz, the Chairman of that particular session, simply told the delegates that he had received a message from the management of the Hotel, informing him that the convention would have to adjourn if the delegates would continue so to yell and shout that the noise penetrated throughout the building.</p>
   <p>The blame for all the fuss rests upon the Courier group, who came to the convention to avenge themselves upon the rabbinate and certain large synagogues which had opposed the Courier's policies.</p>
   <p>The storm began soon after the chairman had read the names of the Resolutions and Nominations committees. Immediately a delegate asked - Who Prepared the Slate in Advance? And why not a single rabbi or even a congregation president had been named, despite the fact that the Relief secured its main support from the synagogues.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1052.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Soon many of the delegates were shouting their protest. The chairman was unable to cope with the situation, and bedlam arose.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher and Mr. Max Shulman, came to the assistance of the chairman, but their efforts also proved unavailing. The delegates kept shouting, "We want no slate! We want to elect our own committees"</p>
   <p>The result was that the delegates emerged victorious. The prepared slate was rejected and new nominations were made by the delegates. Among the new nominators were several rabbis and a few congregation presidents, who are known as the bitterest enemies of the reactionary Courier cabal.</p>
