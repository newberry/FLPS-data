   <p>Peoples Relief Convention Unanimously condemned by the Dark "Courier." Net Profit of the Bazaar - $26,000.</p>
   <p>The reactionary clique from Halsted St., which has attempted to poison public opinion against the Peoples Relief and against the war victims, (whom the Peoples Relief is working to protect) received severe censure from the representatives of more than sixty labor organizations that convened at the Peoples Relief Conference in the Ashland Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The delegates of thirty-three workmen circle branches, countrymen vereins, trade unions, central labor memberships, volunteers and other organizations congregated to hear a report on the activities of the Peoples Relief and were convinced, that the howling and cries from the dark clique who are assembled on Halsted St., were the voices of a reactionary element that wants to destroy everything that is in their way and to destroy those who do not permit their tyrannical reign.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1068.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>While Comrade Rosenblum, chairman of the conference, read the agenda of the executive, he proposed that certain clauses should be altered and that the reports from the countrymen and the bazaar should be heard and when completed, other business should be transacted. The delegates have agreed to this and Mr. Yukelson, manager of the Peoples Relief read a report about the relationship of the countrymen vereins to the Peoples Relief and the position of the Ukranian Society which worked harmonicusly with the Peoples Relief for the benefit of general relief work.</p>
   <p>The Credentials Committee, consisting of Comrades Haynok, Ruden, Fedreyman, Sachs, and Silbert, reports that 120 delegates were present, representing 33 workmen circle branches, and 29 vereins, and other organizations. A final report of the bazaar showed a net profit of $26,014.91 and the expenses were $18,472.11. $3,000 was given to the Bialstok, Zitomir, and Lithuanian Vereins, for participating in the work at the bazaar. $23,000 will be sent to the Joint Distribution Committee for the Charity Fund of the European Orphans.</p>
