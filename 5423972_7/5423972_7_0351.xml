   <p>One of the greatest centers of culture, that the Jews of the West have yet founded, is to be established by the Chicago Hebrew Institute on the West Side. Negotiation were vertually completed last week, where by the building and grounds comprising the old covent of the Catholic Order of Nuns at 485 W. Taylor St. are to become the property of the Institute.</p>
   <p>The money with which to buy the property was obtained in a comparatively short time. The sum of $110,000 was needed and Julius Rosenwald offered to make a loan of $75,000, without interest or other charges, provided the additional $35,000 was subcribed at once. Mr. Rosenwald then headed the subcriptions by contributing $5,000 and cash was raised within a few minutes.</p>
   <p>Probably $50,000 will be obtained from others to meet the expense of reconstructing and remodeling the building Bowling alleys, billiard rooms, swimming pool and a gymnasium are to be established. Books and reading matter of all kinds will be supplied. Nathan Kaplan, head of the C.H.J., mentioned that the idea was to establish a center modeled on the central Y.M.C.A., There will be classes for the youth who has just landed in Chicago and for those who have been here for some time but who require education.</p>
   <p>Among the Jews in Chicago who actively participated in the movement to establish the new center were Dr. Hirsch, Rabbi Stalz, M. Philip Gersburg, A. Baumgarten, Dr. E.A. Fishkin, Max Klee and Dr. Jas. Frank.</p>
