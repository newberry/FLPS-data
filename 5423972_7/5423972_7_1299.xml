  <body>
   <p>Mr. Harris Dick's funeral was a large one; it was attended by businessmen and workers, by young and old. He was the president of the Western Dairy Company.</p>
   <p>His body lay in state first in the Wilna Synagogue for which he had done a great deal. Elegies were given by the magid (preacher) and by Rabbi Heimovitch: From there his body was moved to the Kahiloth Yacob Shul (Congregation of Jacob synagogue) where elegies were delivered by Rabbi Shach and Rabbi Silver.</p>
   <p>At this opportune moment Mr. Dick's children donated two thousand dollars to charitable institutions. Those receiving two hundred dollars were the <pb facs="5423972_7_1300.jpg" n="2"/>Federated Jewish Charities, Beth Machseh L'eisomim (orphanage), Beth Moshev Zekanim (old people's home), Joint Relief for War Victims, and the Wilna Synagogue. The Kahiloth Yacob Shul received one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

The Yisheva Aitz Chiam (theological seminary), Beth Hamedrosh L'Rabbonim (rabbinical college), Douglas Park Day Nursery, Gemiloth Chesid Anshe Wilna (charitable loans of the Wilna congregation) each received fifty dollars. The North Side Day Nursery received twenty-five dollars, the rest of the money going to other institutions.</p>
   <p>Upon the appeal of Rabbi Silver, those present, as a symbol of respect for the deceased Mr. Dick, donated six hundred dollars for the war sufferers.</p>
