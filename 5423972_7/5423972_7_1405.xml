   <p>The Jewish soul has been resurrected. Slowly, but unceasingly, a stream of self-mobilized, strong Jewish young men is flowing through all parts of the country to the Jewish army of liberation. It demonstrates to the world that neither the long Diaspora, nor even the centuries of terrible persecution which our people have had to suffer over the entire globe have been able to deaden our spirit and our strivings for liberty. The solemn and determined faces of our legionnaires, groups of whom are leaving for the Near East with gun and sword to defend and assist in regaining the land which belonged to us long ago, bear witness that we Jews of the twentieth century are but a small link in a long chain emanating from our past. The combat in which our legionnaires are now engaged on the hills of Judea, is a historical continuance of the struggle for liberty fought by our Maccabees and Bar Kochbas. The assertions of both extremes of our assimilationists are basically false, i. e., (1.) that Jewish chronology begins with the time of the appearance of the first Bund (Jewish wing of the Social-Democratic party) proclamation; (2.) that <pb facs="5423972_7_1406.jpg" n="2"/>Jewish history begins with Germany's reform of Judaism.</p>
   <p>Our modern heroes bind us to our past and also create for us a free and independent future on our own soil in Palestine. These young and heroic Jews, whose life ambition is the regaining and liberation of the Jewish land for the Jewish people, and who are willing to pay for it with their blood and their lives, must be admired and respected by us. We must consider them as saints offering their young lives on the altar of national liberation. It should be our pleasure to do everything in our power to help lighten their miseries, cure their sick and wounded, visit their crippled, and support their beloved ones, as their wives and children and old parents, who have been inadequately provided for. If these latter merited having a husband, father, or son among the reclaimers of our old-new country, then they should not be humiliated for it and compelled to apply to the charities for assistance.</p>
   <p>No nation, small or big, neglects its self-sacrificing, heroic children. Its solicitude continues in the noble healing and rescue work among its armies by national organizations, like the Red Cross and others. We, also, have a <pb facs="5423972_7_1407.jpg" n="3"/>similar organization, created under the name "Red Shield of David". Since our legionnaire movement began among nationalistically-conscious elements, like the Poale Zion, Jewish National workers Alliance, and Zionists, it is only natural that these same elements should have created the Red Shield of David and directed its activity. The character of the legionnaire movement, however, is expanding into a broader and greater national one. Jews of various classes are joining, such as storekeepers, workers, peddlers, American-born socialists, and Jews at random who never belonged to Zionism, and it is therefore necessary to change the character of the Red Shield of David also.</p>
   <p>The Red Shield of David and the form of its activity at present bear a partisan character. Among the general public it is considered a party fund to which only the members of a certain party are obligated and since its founders and leaders came from only one element--those nationalistically conscious--it therefore matters not how big in number and influence that element might be. Regardless of the ability, loyalty,and devotion with which the leaders are conducting their work, the Red Shield of David cannot gain in popularity and <pb facs="5423972_7_1408.jpg" n="4"/>prestige and cannot permanently carry on its colossal activity so long as it is being supported only by a certain portion of Jews. Our legionnaires who are marching happily to fight for our rightful claim upon the Jewish homeland are not doing so for any particular element of our people; they are fighting for the whole of our people. Therefore, we must take upon ourselves the responsibility of alleviating the struggle of our battalions,and of their beloved ones who are in need of the assistance of all of us.</p>
   <p>The relief work for our war-suffering brethren in Europe would have never attained the moral success, nor reached the height of brotherly sympathy and mutual assistance that it did, if it had been conducted by this or that party, by one or another element or even by each party separately. A united front of the different factions has made it possible for American Jewry to render to European-destroyed Judaism, nationalistic assistance which has no equal. This achievement will be noted as one of the finest chapters in the history of American Judaism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1409.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>If we actually wish the Red Shield of David to continue its relief work properly and to maintain it on an appropriate scale among and for our modern national heroes, then we must enlist the interest of Jews of all classes in this work and gain their support. Therefore, it is imperative that a conference of all classes of Jews in Chicago be called. This conference should elect a committee to represent a federated union of all sects of Jews in Chicago for the purpose of proceeding with the work of the Red Shield of David. Then the work could be labeled a national one which will be in a position to stimulate the entire Jewish people for the purposes of the Red Shield of David, and which will also be in a position to render nationalistic assistance to our Army of Liberation. This should be an honor for us and for coming generations.</p>
