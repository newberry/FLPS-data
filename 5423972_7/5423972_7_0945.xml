   <p>Chicago Jews must hurry if they want the [relief] drive to be entirely successful, and an inspiration to all of American Jewry. Chicago must contribute two million dollars towards the fourteen million dollar drive, but up to now only one million has been collected. The second million must be collected within the next few days, and not in large amounts but in small amounts. Those who had to give large sums, from five hundred dollars up to a quarter of a million dollars, have already contributed their share, and the second million, therefore, must be made up of small sums. It is obvious that it is harder to collect a million dollars from small sums than from large ones. If the relief workers intend to collect the second million dollars, they must triple their work and use every active force they have.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee, Mr. Isidore Lieberman, is responsible for the statement that up to now, only every third Jew of the middle <pb facs="5423972_7_0946.jpg" n="2"/>class has given something for the relief. We do not know what the Jewish workers have done for the relief this year, but much cannot be expected from them because, as far as they are concerned, the times are not so good. Maybe the majority of them cannot give anything at all, but the middle class can and must give.</p>
   <p>If what Mr. Isidore Lieberman says is true, that up to now only every third Jew of the middle class in Chicago has given something for the relief, then the relief workers must triple their efforts because not only is a million dollars at stake--the whole success of the entire drive, fourteen million dollars is at stake. If the drive in Chicago is a failure, then it will be a failure throughout the entire country, and the blame for such a catastrophe will fall upon Chicago.</p>
   <p>All of the so-called German Jews, with a few exceptions, have done their duty. They all gave generously. Now we must do our share. We must not permit anyone to be a slacker. We must compel everyone, by legitimate means, to do his duty, because the whole relief work in Eastern Europe is at stake.</p>
