<title level="a">"FORTUNATE ARE THOSE WHO CAN GIVE", SAYS ROSENWALD IN HIS APPEAL FOR WAR RELIEF</title></bibl>

   <p>"We, the Jews in America, are in the fortunate position of being able to give and not having to ask. This, in itself, puts everyone of us, man or woman, under an obligation to give. Everyone of us must respond with an open hand to the appeal that is being made to raise fourteen million dollars for relief."</p>
   <p>This statement comes from Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the well-known Jewish philanthropist, a man who is not satisfied with words alone, but who practices what he preaches. He gave a million dollars for the first relief campaign in 1918, and he has given a quarter of a million dollars to each successive campaign.</p>
   <p>"We are all lucky," writes Mr. Rosenwald, "lucky because we are not in the war countries, lucky because we are in a position to give and do not have to beg. It was our good fortune that we, or our parents, came over here before the conflagration in the Old World burst out. Were we there today, we, too, would have to stretch out our hands for help.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0955.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"How would we have felt towards these Jews if the situation were reversed, if we had been in their place and they in ours? How would we have felt toward those fortunate people in America if they had refused to help us?</p>
   <p>"If we want to keep up our self-respect. We must do everything within our power to help our poor brothers and sisters across the ocean, who have nobody to turn to for aid except us. After all, we do have enough to eat. Our families do not know want. The times, perhaps, are not as good as we would like them to be. But there are no such hardships in America as there are in Europe. What is the obvious duty of those who, in America, enjoy the blessings of God? It is to do everything we can; not only must we, ourselves, give, but we must urge others to give as much as possible so that our brothers across the ocean may become self-supporting.</p>
   <p>"The Jews for whom we appeal are not beggars. Before the war, they did not ask anything from us. It is not their fault that their present conditions are terrible, just as it would not have been our fault had we been in their place, or if America had become the battleground of the war. If we gave up a few of <pb facs="5423972_7_0956.jpg" n="3"/>our luxuries, and gave that money for relief, could the slight inconvenience which we would experience be compared to their suffering? Can we do a greater thing for our own happiness, for our own honor, than to help our brothers in need? We cannot preserve our honor if we do not help our brothers when they are hungry."</p>
   <p>Chicago's quota of the fourteen million dollar drive is two million. The drive began last Sunday evening and it will end on December fifteenth. Mr. Rosenwald is giving a dollar for every seven dollars collected. Have you already contributed your share of the money that Chicago must raise?</p>
