<title level="a">JEWISH JUNK AND RAG PEDDLERS PERFORM PATRIOTIC SERVICE</title><title level="a" type="sub">Buy $500 Worth of Red Cross Stamps at the Meeting Last Night</title></bibl>

   <p>Over 600 Jewish peddlers came to the meeting last night at the Hebrew Institute. A report was given on the results of the first four days of the campaign [to raise money for the Red Cross] by paying for old clothes with Red Cross stamps. With few exceptions the reports given were highly satisfactory.</p>
   <p>There are still some people--they are not Jews--who don't realize that the peddlers do not make any extra profit by paying for the junk with Red Cross stamps, but instead are helping to buy bandages and medicine for our wounded soldiers at the battlefront.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. B. Horwitz, and the speakers, Judge Harry M. Fischer, Rabbi Saul Silber, and Mr. Murphy of the Red Cross, delivered fine speeches. They praised the patriotism of the peddlers and the good work that they are doing in helping the government by raising money for the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The peddler buys the Red Cross stamps at cost price, and with these stamps <pb facs="5423972_7_1395.jpg" n="2"/>he pays the housewife for the old clothes and junk that he buys from her. Neither the peddler nor the housewife loses anything thereby, but the Red Cross gains a great deal. The Red Cross gets so many more hundreds of dollars with which to buy bandages and with which to send nurses and medicine to the battlefronts of France for the wounded American soldiers. As soon as the speakers were finished, $500 worth of stamp books were sold. Those who helped sell these books were: Mr. Deitch, Mr. Lowenthal, and the four presidents of [the locals of] the Peddlers Association.</p>
   <p>The committee which is carrying on the campaign among the junk and rag peddlers appeals to the junk shop owners not to buy any junk from private persons, and urges them when they receive calls to send peddlers who buy junk with Red Cross stamps. In this way they will encourage the peddlers to sell more stamps.</p>
