   <p>The financial report given here shows the relief work undertaken by the Central Workmen's Committee upon the initiative of the Federation of Jewish Unions.</p>
   <p>This work lasted four months and was very difficult and unappreciated. More people applied for relief than it was expected. Hundreds crowded our relief office. Each and everyone related a different story. Some cases were extremely pathetic and revealed the condition of misery and suffering in which many Jewish families are living at the present time. The whole depicted the weakness and submissiveness of human nature and its helplessness in a movement of distress. Once proud and satisfied, these citizens came for donations with their heads bent. Man, king of the universe, has stooped down before poverty. He cannot find any other means or ways to sustain life. Is not that the biggest tragedy?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0436.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It made the social workers shiver to observe this dreadful scene. Many times their minds became heavy and tears of sympathy rolled down their cheeks. The applicants who came to apply for relief were treated very friendly. Everybody was treated cordially and sympathetically. The social workers were extremely careful not to insult anybody.</p>
   <p>Everyone who came for relief received it without going through much red-tape. Some were helped with rent; others with foodstuffs, with coal, gas and electric bills, etc.</p>
   <p>A good portion of the money was contributed to the Free Kitchen on Roosevelt Rd.; some went to the Ogden Ave. Food Shop and to the Northwest Side Food Shop. This relief work lasted four months and we were forced to stop it, not because the troubles and sufferings ended for the Jewish Communities in Chicago, but because we ran short of funds. This work is very important at such a deplorable time. We made many appeals for relief but the public did not respond to our calls.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0437.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At this moment we take the opportunity to express our gratitude and sincere thanks to the Forward. We wish to thank the Forward for its help, both in ready cash and in advertising worth hundreds of dollars.</p>
