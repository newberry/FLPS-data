<title level="a">THE MENORAH APPEAL FOR JEWISH STUDENTS IN EUROPE</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial In English)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The executive of the Menorah Association has issued an appeal to the American Jews, especially to the Jewish academic youth, to come to the aid of the Jewish university students in Europe, whose economic position has become untenable. Hundreds of them are simply starving because their parents or relatives have been ruined by the war and pogroms, and cannot afford to support them any longer. In many cases the parents and relatives have died and the youngsters are without support altogether.</p>
   <p>There must be at present some ten thousand Jewish university students in Central and Western Europe. Most of them are of Eastern-European origin. Even in days gone by, the lot of these Jewish students was not a very enviable one. The parents could not provide them with sufficient means, and a great many of them were depending on stipends. In addition, their <pb facs="5423972_7_1130.jpg" n="2"/>Gentile colleagues were never too friendly to them. In many universities, especially in German-Austrian universities, they had actually to fight for their very lives in battles with their anti-Semitic colleagues. The "Rampe" of the Vienna University was for years the battleground of anti-Semites and Jewish students. Government, society, and press, were not too friendly to them either. The poor fellows had to fight against terrible odds to attain their aims, that is to say, finish their studies and get a diploma. A great many of the examining professors in Central Europe are anti-Semites and they too do all they can to destroy the careers of the Jewish students. The Jewish undergraduate, appearing before the body of examining professors, had to know double as much as the Gentile undergraduate, and then he was not sure whether the professor would pass him or not. One can thus readily see that even in ante-bellum days, the lot of the Jewish university student was not an all too happy one; and in hundreds of cases it was too tragic for words.</p>
   <p>But now, the trials and tribulations, the troubles and sorrows, of these thousands of Jewish young men scattered all over Central and Western Europe <pb facs="5423972_7_1131.jpg" n="3"/>have trebled. Struggling hard to attain their noble aim--they suffer not only from anti-Semitic attacks, and from the hostile attitude of the surroundings, but they suffer from hunger too. There was in Germany a Jewish society in existence to support hundreds of these students. Now this society is out of existence, for it cannot raise any funds. German Jewry is pauperized, and so is Austrian Jewry. Both have plenty to do to provide for their own poor, and they cannot possibly take care of newcomers and strangers. Eastern-European Jewry is certainly not in a position to support them, and if these thousands of Jewish students in Eastern Europe should not die from starvation or become demoralized, and thus become destructive forces, they must be supported, for the time being at least, by American Jewry.</p>
   <p>American Jewry is their only ray of hope, and they have appealed to American Jewry, through the Menorah Association, to come to their aid. The Menorah Association will render a great service to the Jewish people by organizing a special fund to support these Jewish students in Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1132.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There are from fifteen to eighteen thousand Jewish university students in the United States. Of course, a great many of them are poor, who could scarcely contribute very much to a fund for the European students, but thousands of them can. From fifteen to eighteen thousand Jewish university students in America should not find it hard to collect a sum of two hundred thousand dollars, with the object of helping their poor colleagues abroad. They should display Jewish academic solidarity, and should not desert their colleagues at this moment. The Menorah Association on its part, should do more than issue an appeal to the American Jewish press. It should organize a special campaign for the purpose of raising the fund. We are sure that American Jewry, and especially the American Jewish academic youth, will respond nobly to such an appeal. Not only the university students, but all the educated classes, no matter what their attitude to Judaism may be, will respond to such an appeal, and will gladly give their share, if approached in the right spirit, and in the right way. Mr. [B.] Horwich, the chancellor of the Menorah Association, is an energetic and able man, and we hope that he will do everything in his power to organize such a campaign.</p>
