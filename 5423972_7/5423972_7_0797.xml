   <p>Yesterday at 12:40 in the afternoon, Mr. Sokolow left Chicago for New York. The local Zionist workers were at the depot to bid him goodbye. I asked Mr. Sokolow whether he was satisfied with the results of his visit to Chicago. He replied yes and--no. He is satisfied with the work of the few Zionist workers who were extremely active and worked day and night to make the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] drive a success. He is not satisfied with the large Jewish public of Chicago. The Chicago Jewish public did not do its duty. Chicago should have given at least a quarter of a million dollars in cash during the drive, and a quarter of a million dollars during the year. But what did it actually give? When the drive comes to an end, Chicago will have raised from a hundred to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars, which means thirty cents for every Jew in Chicago. Chicago Jews can well afford to give three dollars per capita.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0798.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nahum Sokolow looks upon the results of the Keren Hayesod drive as a beginning, and hopes that we will do better during the year. I sincerely hope so.</p>
