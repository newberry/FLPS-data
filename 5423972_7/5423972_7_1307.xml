   <p>Mr. B. Horwitch, one of the commissioners sent to Poland, Lithuania, and Galicia by the Joint Distribution Committee for relief work in behalf of the war sufferers, is now on his way back to America, having spent four months in the above-mentioned lands.</p>
   <p>Being convinced that all Chicago Jews are greatly interested in hearing about what Mr. B. Horwitch saw and did in those unfortunate war-torn countries, the Chicago Relief Committee has decided to call a huge conference of representatives from all congregations, lodges, Vereine, societies, unions, and other organized Jewish bodies in Chicago and the Middle West, the meeting to take place Sunday, July 13, in the large gymnasium of Chicago's Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>Each group is invited to participate in the conference. Each may send three delegates for every one hundred members, and two delegates for a membership of less than a hundred. The groups sending delegates are requested to forward <pb facs="5423972_7_1308.jpg" n="2"/>immediately the names and credentials of their delegates to the office of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee, 720 West Twelfth Street, Room 38, so that seats may be reserved for them. Those persons desiring to be guests at the conference may secure free tickets at the above-mentioned office.</p>
   <p>All groups are requested to call meetings immediately for the election of such delegates. If such a meeting is impossible at this time, the officers may act as delegates of their respective organizations. Mr. B. Horwitch has much to tell of his experiences. Plans for further work will also be discussed at the conference. If any organization needs a speaker for its meeting, it should call the Relief Office at 720 West Twelfth Street, and one will be sent to them.</p>
   <p>With heartfelt greetings,</p>
   <p>The Chicago Joint Relief Committee</p>
   <p>S.J. Rosenblott, acting chairman;</p>
   <p>Isadore Liederman, general secretary;</p>
   <p>Samuel Phillipson, treasurer;</p>
   <p>Julius Sovitski, executive secretary</p>
