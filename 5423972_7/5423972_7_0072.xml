<title level="a">6000 DANCERS RAISE $20,000 FOR CHARITY AT THE B. M. Z. BALL JEWISH HOME FOR THE AGED IS BENEFITED</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Six thousand persons danced away the fast flying hours last night - danced far into the morning at the annual B. M. Z. Charity Ball in the Auditorium - until, when the last strain of music had died away and the last couple had waltzed over the waxen floor, more than $20,000 had piled up at the box office for the benefit of the Orthodox Jewish Home for the Aged.</p>
   <p>Nearly all the socially inclined Jewish people of Chicago were present. Before the ball was closed, A. Margolis, president of the B. M. Z. declared the experiment was so great a success that the charity ball would be made an annual institution. All minor affairs in the way of entertainments for the benefit of the home will be discontinued for the future.</p>
   <p>The big Auditorium hall itself bore little addition in the way of ornament save its own customary decorations. The leaders of the ball committees decided it would be far better to pile up the funds for the benefit of the home than to make extra expenditures. <pb facs="5423972_7_0073.jpg" n="2"/>Despite this fact the ballroom was very attractive.</p>
   <p>Flower Girls Sell Wares</p>
   <p>The band was at the middle of the east wall. A mammoth flower booth, decorated with roses, chrysanthemums, carnations and greenery formed the chief ornament. The booth was in Charge of Mrs. Abe Cohen, who sent a number of flower girls through the dancing throngs to vend boutonnieres and bouquets for charity. Among the flower girls were: Miss Hattie Stern, Miss Ray Jackson, Miss Anne Davis and Miss Annie Lebensohn.</p>
   <p>Bernard Baumgarden, chairman of the ball committee, and Mrs. Baumgarden led the grand march. Mr. and Mrs. Margolis assisted them in directing the intricacies of the figures.</p>
   <p>A buffet luncheon was served throughout the ball and appropriate souvenirs and favors were distributed among the guests. Eight thousand tickets were sold to the ball at $2 each. In addition there were a number of patrons who paid large bonuses for tickets. The highest priced ticket was purchased by Marshall Field at $100. A number of others were sold for approximating sums.</p>
