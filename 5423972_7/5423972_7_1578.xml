   <p>Moes Chitim (the committee established for the purpose of providing food for the needy on Passover) brought in a favorable report. The Agudath, Moes Chitim held a meeting last night at the Waller Street Talmud Torah. The report of the committee was very favorable and encouraging. An organization was formed of eight synagogues and since its organization it has taken in nine more, which makes a total of seventeen synagogues. They were represented in groups and made their financial reports, which were very gratifying.</p>
   <p>The Agudath, which is the new Moes Chitim organization informs us that this year much more money will be needed to supply the Jewish poor with the necessities with which to celebrate the Passover holidays. The number of Jewish poor this year is much larger than ever before, hence money is needed......</p>
