   <p>The first work that was taken up at the meeting of the Federation was the question as how to help the massacred Jews in the Balkan countries. As soon as the chairman, Mr. B. Horwich, called the meeting to order, Mr. Barnett made a proposal to the effect that the Federation should do something to help those Jews financially, and a committee should be appointed, for this purpose, tocall a mass meeting, where a fund should be raised. The chairman, Mr. B. Horwich, put the proposal to a vote, that those present should be the first to respond, and announced that he would start the fund with a fifty dollar contribution.</p>
   <p>Almost all who were present immediately responded with donations, and $265 was raised.</p>

   <p>A committee will be appointed, by the chairman, to call a mass meeting, or to adopt other methods, for raising a suitable sum of money for the unfortunate Jews in the Balkan countries.</p>
   <p>The chief question at the meeting concerned the constitution and by-laws of the Federation which was read by Judge Harry M. Fisher, the chairman of the sub-committee. Mr. Lasker proposed that a copy of the constitution should be sent to every institution that will enter the Federation, and every institution should discuss the constitution separately and then forward its approval to the Federation. The proposal was accepted and special meetings for this purpose will be called by all institutions.</p>
