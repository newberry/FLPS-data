   <p>Yesterday, at 2 P. M., Dr. Hyman Davis arrived in Chicago. He has just returned from Eastern Europe, where he was sent as one of the members of the American Red Cross Commission.</p>
   <p>He brings us tragic and heart-rending news of our brothers and sisters. "They are dying by the thousands--victims of hunger and of diseases resulting from hunger," was his first reply to a question regarding their condition put by a Courier reporter in the Michigan Central train on which the Doctor arrived. The Courier reporter and Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt welcomed the esteemed guest by boarding his train at 63rd Street and riding with him to 12th Street and Michigan Boulevard, where a committee of rabbis and prominent men awaited him.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis was wearing the uniform he had on when he left on his mission <pb facs="5423972_7_1345.jpg" n="2"/>some eight months ago. He looks well in spite of all his traveling and all the things that he witnessed with his own eyes--the appalling misery and wretchedness in the countries where war had raged and still rages to some extent in various areas.</p>
   <p>He visited many cities and villages in Galicia, Poland, the Ukraine, Warsaw, Provorsk, Trisk, Vladimer Valinsk, Chelm, Pinsk, Roveruska, and other areas. He saw these villages and towns and observed the condition of the people there. He was deeply moved by what he saw. "They are poor, very poor, so weak and sick that they lack strength even to beg. Hospitals are crowded with patients afflicted with typhoid and other diseases resulting from hunger. Numerous funerals occur daily."</p>
   <p>"I shall never forget the long, unending lines of Jewish children in Warsaw who were waiting for a piece of bread and some hot coffee in front of a "National Kitchen," said Dr. Davis, with a deep sigh. "Neither shall I <pb facs="5423972_7_1346.jpg" n="3"/>forget the groups of Jews I encountered as they were returning to their homes from which they had been driven. They proceeded slowly, weak from fatigue and hunger, stretching out their hands for bread.</p>
   <p>"You find the same misery in every town and village, the same wandering everywhere," the Doctor continued. "I saw aged people, women, young men, girls, and children wandering about aimlessly, listlessly. They have no homes and no clothes: they are weary and exhausted. Many wanderers die on the way and their bodies lie on the ground for days before they are buried."</p>
   <p>"There were moments when I had to run away from all this suffering and want. If I had enough money I would have given something to each of these weary people--enough to enable him to keep body and soul together. Many a time I returned to my hotel or station with empty pockets. Every penny an American Jew gives for these unfortunates helps provide a days sustenance for some person; every dollar supplies a week's sustenance for a family."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1347.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Dr. Davis also told of the great misery prevailing in Vienna among the Jewish population, most of whom were war refugees from towns and villages of Galicia.</p>
   <p>He also brought greetings from Mr. B. Horwitch, who is now in Paris, and from all the members of the Joint Relief Committee except Dr. Boris Bogen, who is at present in Warsaw.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis made notes of sad events affecting the majority of Jews in various cities and villages that he visited. He learned and experienced many things about which he will speak at a mass meeting arranged by the Joint Relief Committee for next Sunday afternoon in the Anshe Keneseth Israel synagogue. Dr. Davis will deliver the principal address, so that the Jews of this city will have the opportunity to learn of conditions in Eastern Europe. A huge attendance is expected. No collections for the relief fund will be made.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1348.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>At the depot, Dr. Davis was greeted by his relatives and a committee consisting of the following: Ephraim Epstein, Eliezer Muskin, Kordon, Rabbi Silver, Judge Horner, Judge Fisher, Dr. S. H. Melamed, Samuel Philipson, N. D. Kaplan, Israel Lederman, Arthur Horwitch, J. Sovitzky, and others. Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt was chairman of the committee.</p>
