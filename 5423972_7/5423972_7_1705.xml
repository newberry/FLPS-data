   <p>The peace at the Hebrew Sheltering Home which is, without a doubt, a definite victory for the Federation of Orthodox Jewish Charities, over those who cannot keep up with the times and would keep those old learned Jews in that chaos which existed before the Federation came into being.</p>
   <p>The Federation was drawn into these disputes quite unwillingly. The Federation, as a body, does not as a rule interfere with the regulations of any institution. The duties of the Federation are to collect all moneys for charity and to allot the sums of money due the different charitable institutions. But when a dispute arises among the Board of Directors of an institution, both sides may appeal to the Federation as a third non-partisan party to establish rules to the satisfaction of all the members in the dispute.</p>
   <p>Such an event recently occurred in the Marks Nathan Orphange. The Federation delegated Mr. James Davis and Judge Harry M. Fisher to sit with the investigating committee of the orphanage. All disputes were taken up by this body and settled so satisfactorily that it was indeed a credit to the Jews of Chicago. In the Hebrew Sheltering Home there were two sets of boards of directors, each having its own officers, each insisting that its board was the official one. The Federation did not go into this matter even at the request of the newer board of <pb facs="5423972_7_1706.jpg" n="2"/>directors until the old board also came to them in the matter of this dispute.</p>
   <p>No one knows the reason for the origin of these disputes, but, as it now appears, there seemed to have been several unresponsible persons who somehow influenced the old board to break away from the Federation since it would suit them more to send out their own collectors. Thus they would do away with the Federation which truly is an honor to Chicago Orthodox Jewry, who would certainly regret such an act. But the old board permitted itself to be influenced against the Federation.</p>
   <p>Nothing remained for the Federation but to enter this war, and much can be said to the credit of Chicago Jews for their stand on this matter. When the heat of battle cooled most of the old board of directors realized their error and became staunch supporters of the Federation. Amongthese were the vice-president, Mr. Iglovitz, Mr. Rosenthal, and also a large majority of the old board. Just a few held out because of personal grudges and their desires to run things in their own way.</p>
   <p>Thus when the Federation gave its declaration to the Chicago Jewish public, nickle and box collections were automatically disbanded. The more belligerant antagonists, however, brought the matter to court. Again they lost their cause, <pb facs="5423972_7_1707.jpg" n="3"/>but, were permitted to use charity money already in their possession to pay for lawyer fees and the like.</p>
   <p>When the minority could do no more they permitted a unanimous vote in favor of the Federation as the most suitable organ for collecting and distributing charitable funds. Last Monday they voted for Mr. Philipson, the vice-president and for Mr. Schiff, the treasurer of the Federation, to act as trustees of the building fund for the Hebrew Sheltering Home.</p>
   <p>This was one of the greatest moral victories the Federation has won. Thus the Federation established the right to collect and distribute this money and to expand as necessary, providing it adheres to its principles. No one is permitted to slander it or to hinder its activities.</p>
