   <p>In the neat lecture at the Jewish People's Institute, Dr. A. Levinson, eminent Chicago pediatrician, will discuss in his next lecture on Monday evening, April 6, "Children of Various American Groups."</p>
   <p>He will consider the Negro child as influenced by racial and economic factors, the children of immigrant parents, a study of their special status, dietary habits, national customs, and adaption to American life.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Hugo Feldman, instructor at Crane Junior College, will speak on Saturday evening, April 4, on "Rabelais - Jester at the Court of Heaven." This talk was scheduled originally for Wednesday, but because of the holiday, is being given on Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>The next speaker at the Five O'clock Jewish Forum at the Jewish People's Institute will be Dr. A. B. Yudelson, eminent physician of the city. His topic will be "Romance in the Nervous System." While the speaker will present the scientific aspects of his subject, he will also illuminate thoughts entertained and held on this subject by the ancient Jews as expressed in the Talmud and <pb facs="5423972_7_0137.jpg" n="2"/>in other studies made by our people. Dr. Yudelson is a man of very solid attainment and we urge the public, which is cordially invited, to come as early as possible to be assured of admission.</p>
