  <body>
   <p>A branch of the American "Ort" has been established in Chicago here of late, with the well known inventor and social worker, Jacob M. Spitzglass, as chairman. The well known manufacturer, I. Horwin, was elected as treasurer and I. Segalar, secretary.</p>
   <p>The office of the Chicago branch of the "Ort" is located at 30 West Washington Street.</p>
   <p>A huge campaign for membership is being planned in Chicago, which will be the first undertaking in this city for the Chicago "Ort" branch. For this purpose, Dr. Leon Brahmson, president of the World organization "Ort", and Dr. Henry Moskovitz, one of the leaders of the American "Ort", will be here in the near future.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0445.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A ladies' branch has also been established in Chicago with Mrs. Max Adler, sister of Julius Rosenwald, as chairlady.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the Chicago branch of the "Ort" with their good work will be of great assistance to the World "Ort" in their undertakings for the declassed Jews in Russia as well as for Jews in other countries.</p>
