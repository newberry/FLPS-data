   <p>The objectives in the program of Jewish work to be carried on by the Institute are, first to create a healthy and dignified Jewish atmosphere, an atmosphere that will not fail to impress all who enter the Institute. This point has been fully developed in the forepart of the report. Secondly, to imbue the youth that come within our contact with a consciousness and interest in things Jewish, to help the young people to grow up as active and responsible members of the Jewish community. Third, to strengthen the minds of those who are already Jewish conscious, and to direct them into constructive activity. Fourth, to take the lead in fostering, through cooperation with similar institutions, an active interest in Jewish culture, on the part of the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>As a further means of developing a Jewish atmosphere, in a physical way, it is our plan to decorate the walls with pictures of Jewish great men, and art work by Jewish artists. It may be possible, through our Jewish Art-Craft <pb facs="5423972_7_0160.jpg" n="2"/>Department, to display, in connection with the various Jewish holidays, Jewish customs, made of life and values, in a manner which will not fail to impress itself on the minds of all those who come in contact with it.</p>
   <p>In order to give you an idea how best this can be accomplished, let us discuss the several holidays, for example, Passover: Beginning with the eve of Passover, and throughout the entire week it is our plan to arrange an impressive holiday exhibit, consisting of an attractive arrangement of the Seder on a miniature scale. This will include all of the traditional Jewish table decorations. There might also be a tableau of the ancient Hebrews throughout Palestine to the Temple Jerusalem. A tableau like that must be made very elaborate. Such a display may take the Art-Craft Department many months to prepare, but the results will be fully worth while.</p>
   <p>On Log B'Omer, a tableau depicting a merry scene of youngsters in a green field, equipped with bows and arrows, and other tableaux may be arranged, <pb facs="5423972_7_0161.jpg" n="3"/>based on legendary material relating to the semi-holiday, and the story of Rabbi Akibas' life and tragic death.</p>
   <p>On Shevuoth, the story of the Burning Bush can be portrayed vividly by means of painting on glass, picturing the Burning Bush, lit up from behind by electric lights, so arranged that the thorn bush on glass may seem to be constantly burning. Moses can be shown standing by the bush, lost in reverence and worship of the unusual phenomenon. The lobby to be decorated throughout with green branches, leaves and garlands of flowers.</p>
   <p>On Rosh Hoshonah, the New Year, the display will take the form of a pageant of Jewish history, beginning with Abraham, and ending with modern Jewish life in Palestine or America. This display would of course require careful planning, as well as a great output of energy and time.</p>
   <p>Succoth can be graphically pictured in tableaux of Jewish encampments as related in the Bible. This would take the form of a model camp, on the <pb facs="5423972_7_0162.jpg" n="4"/>order that the average Boy Scout is expected to construct; however much more elaborately and artistically finished.</p>
   <p>A harvest scene, in tableau arrangement, may be another way of illustrating the significance of this holiday. The display for Chanukah might consist of tableaux, depicting scenes of Jewish martyrs, who gave up their lives for the Jewish people before and during the Maccabbean Revolt, or a tableau relating the story of Hannah and her seven sons.</p>
