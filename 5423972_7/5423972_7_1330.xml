  <body>
   <p>Jews of Pinsk sent the following plea to Jews over all the world:</p>
   <p>To our Brothers. Mercy, merciful brothers wherever you may be in Europe or across the ocean. With a bitter aching cry we appeal to you. The old Jewish city of Pinsk, now sinking in the blood of her finest children, turns to you for aid. The misfortune that has befallen us is great, unwritably great. Our martyrs who met such tragic fates shall not return from the graves, but to those still living life is worse than death. The entire city,outside of few exceptions, is starving. All charitable institutions are closed because of lack of funds. Those still functioning will be closed very shortly for the same reason. There is no commerce; factories are closed; <pb facs="5423972_7_1331.jpg" n="2"/>no work, and no earnings. The promised aid from our brothers in America has not yet been received. In the city it is said that we shall not get it at all. Our land, which was in a sad condition during the five years of War, has now reached the very summit of misery and want. It is not living people that you meet on the Pinsk streets, but shadows, half dead, dark and bent. Many persons die daily. Contagious diseases sweep the city. In almost every house someone is deathly sick. Bitter is our condition, exceedingly bitter.</p>
   <p>Brothers! All you who still have a heart for brotherly feelings, who still have a spark of pity in your hearts, you who know our misfortune and misery, will you please come to our aid? Rescue as many as you can. Help while it is not yet too late. Do not forsake our City Pinsk, it was ever the first in all charitable purposes. Do not permit the old Jewish city to fall completely.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1332.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With tears and blood we sign:</p>
   <p>Jacob Meyer Halevi Hurwitz, Abraham Eizenbers, Shimon Beiser, Nathan Gasshanski, Alexander Balaiev, Abraham Usher Feinstein (In name of the Pinsk Zionist Committee)</p>
   <p>Zav Lipshitz</p>
   <p>Pinsk, - 26th day of Nissan, 5679.</p>
   <p>(Translators Note: According to the English calendar this date corresponds to sometime late in March or early in April of 1919.)</p>
