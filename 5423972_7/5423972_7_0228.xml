   <p>The building at 3322 Douglas Boulevard which, for several years, was a disgrace to the great Jewish West Side because of the incessant card playing there, is now being transformed into a cultural center. Credit is due to our national socialist elements for undertaking this task. They purchased the building, and last night celebrated the formal opening of the center.</p>
   <p>We include the Poale Zion group and Chicago members of the Jewish National Workers' Alliance in the national socialist group. They do not number a thousand, yet we must say to their credit that they do a great deal to spread our national ideals among Jewish workers who have been taught to break away from everything pertaining to the Jews as a race.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If, at one time, we quarreled with the Poale Zion, it was because some of their leaders had proved to be unreliable. They printed and uttered statements harmful to the Jews of America and Poland. We have always maintained a great respect for the great Poale Zion masses and have derived strength from their earnestness, and their pursuit of an ideal which is not wholly impossible.</p>
   <p>Chicago's Poale Zion members, with but few exceptions, are part of the above-mentioned group. They represent a great creative force in the national Poale Zion party. They have transformed the above-mentioned building into a most welcome center. We shall endeavor, to the best of our ability, to strengthen the people's confidence in them and their undertaking.</p>
   <p>We object to only one point in their statement of purpose; "the national socialist institute will be a public cultural and political center for <pb facs="5423972_7_0230.jpg" n="3"/>the Jewish workers of Chicago and especially for our friends." What do they mean by the word "political"? What politics do they have to advocate? What candidates will they support in a campaign? What in the world do they need politics for?</p>
   <p>Awaiting their answer, we heartily congratulate them on the institution which we hope will not only fulfill the needs of the people so far as Jewish interests are concerned, but will also take into consideration the fact that besides being Jews we are American citizens--and let them stop dabbling in foreign affairs and policies.</p>
