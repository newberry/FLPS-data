   <p>Before the end of the week it is expected Chicago will have raised $100,000 for the relief of the Jews in Russia. The subscriptions are now in excess of $20,000 and are being increased daily.</p>
   <p>Arrangements are almost completed for a benefit to begin at the Auditorium, December 12.</p>
   <p>Benefit At The Auditorium</p>
   <p>The lessees of the Auditorium and many of the leading theatrical managers of the city were approached on the proposition of a benefit matinee for the sufferers and the committee, headed by I. A. Loeb and Alderman Foreman, met with really enthusiastic acquiescence in the matter.</p>
   <p>December 12 has been selected as the date, and volunteers from every company playing in the city that week are expected and will make the affair one of the most pretentious offerings of the season.</p>
