   <p>The National Relief Conference was held in Chicago a few days ago, and was a great success. All the prominent relief workers of the country, including Louis Marshall, Felix Warburg, Julius Rosenwald, and Jacob Billikopf, participated. It was a triumph for the great cause of relief. The representatives of the Joint Distribution Committee were not permitted to express themselves clearly on the danger and political situation of the Jews in Eastern Europe. They had to be content with hints, suppressing their thoughts. But from the hints and suppressed thoughts it was possible to draw a clear picture of the tragic situation of our people, and the circumstance is such, that if we do not exert ourselves to the utmost to help our unfortunate people across the sea, masses will perish. The leaders and representatives of the Joint Distribution Committee, who have first-class and accurate reports about the <pb facs="5423972_7_1007.jpg" n="2"/>situation in Eastern Europe, have realized that the only way to relieve the dire need of millions of Jews in Russia and do constructive relief work in the other Eastern European countries, is to launch a new campaign.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the relief work are the last ones who wish to insult the Jewish public, and they certainly would be happy if they were able to inform the Jewish public that our people in Eastern Europe are no longer in need of our aid.</p>
   <p>But when the men who are conducting our relief work insist that a new relief campaign must be organized, with a goal of fourteen million dollars, then everyone can easily surmise how desperate the situation is across the sea.</p>
   <p>The National Relief Conference did not care for any lengthy explanations. It listened to the sad reports of Felix Warburg, who recently returned from <pb facs="5423972_7_1008.jpg" n="3"/>Europe, of Dr. Bogen and Dr. Frank Rosenblatt, as well as the reports of the executive, and accepted the proposal to organize a drive for fourteen million dollars. The undertaking is an enormous one, because the public has been approached repeatedly and is getting tired of giving. Nevertheless, the Conference unanimously decided to proceed with the undertaking, and elected a campaign chairman in the person of Mr. David A. Broun, of Detroit, who is an experienced relief worker and a brilliant organizer. The Conference was so firm in its decision and adjourned with such a determination of carrying out the resolution, that we don't doubt for a moment the success of the drive.</p>
   <p>When we say that the Conference was a triumph for the cause of relief, we mean the determination of the delegates to carry out its resolutions, and the ardent enthusiam of the entire Conference for the great cause.</p>
   <p>During the Conference several matters were clarified: first, that the <pb facs="5423972_7_1009.jpg" n="4"/>distribution of relief in the form of donations is absolutely necessary in Russia and not in the other Eastern European countries; second, that there are in Eastern and Central Europe five hundred thousand refugees who must be returned to their homes, if they shouldn't perish; third, that it is impossible to transfer a hundred thousand war orphans to other countries. A few thousand war orphans can be brought to America or Palestine, but the majority of them must remain in the countries of their birth and troubles. This puts before us a certain and clear purpose. For the next five or six years we will have to provide for a large number of these orphans. The Jews in the Eastern European countries proper will have to assume the responsibility of the upbringing of another group of the orphans, and a system of co-operation between the Jews of the West and the East will have to be agreed on in order to fulfill the great mission of rearing two hundred thousand orphans.</p>
   <p>This question of five hundred thousand refugees is not an immigration question, <pb facs="5423972_7_1010.jpg" n="5"/>because the majority of the refugees desire only to return to their old homes and do not care to emigrate from the countries of their birth. Their homes though are destroyed. In many instances the refugees will not even know where their homes were located, because entire cities have been completely wiped out. Their question is one of repatriation, and this is not an ordinary question. Many millions are necessary to solve this problem.</p>
   <p>But most urgent of all is the relief work in Soviet Russia, because the Jews there simply perish from starvation. Their condition can be compared to that of the Jews in Poland in the year 1915, and they simply must be saved from starvation.</p>
   <p>The relief workers have gathered in Chicago, because it is known to them that Chicago is the most important center of relief work in America. We hope, therefore, that when the campaign begins, the Jews of Chicago will act so as to enable Chicago to keep its reputation as the greatest Jewish relief center in the world.</p>
