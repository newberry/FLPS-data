<title level="a">BIG RED CROSS MEETING SUNDAY AT HEBREW INSTITUTE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Chapter of the American Red Cross is arranging a mass meeting for next Sunday at 2 P. M. at the Hebrew Institute, Taylor and Lytle Streets, to which Jewish rag and junk peddlers are mainly invited, and whose co-operation in the Red Cross campaign is earnestly desired.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of the rag and junk peddlers last Sunday, it was decided that they would purchase Red Cross Stamps at cost and use them as money to pay with when buying waste material, according to certain fixed prices which are under the supervision of the Local Chapter of the Red Cross. This is a remarkable plan, whereby every junk and rag peddler can do his full share toward the Red Cross without any trouble or expense. After Rabbi Saul Silber's eloquent address in which he explained the purpose of this organization and the duty confronting every one to support it, a resolution to co-operate with the Red Cross was unanimously adopted. At the same time the Red Cross assures the rag and junk peddlers that their interests will not only be properly guarded, and that this plan will also help them greatly to expand their business.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1413.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is expected that when the public becomes aware that it can sell its discarded articles for Red Cross stamps, it will do so more than ever before. Everyone will dig up whatever junk one has, and sell it for Red Cross stamps. It will be the obligation of everyone to do so and in this manner to fulfill his patriotic duty to the American Red Cross and American army.</p>
   <p>The plan of the campaign was formulated by the following well-known businessmen, with the assistance of the officers of the local branch of the Red Cross: Victor Lowenthal, Samuel Deutsch, Moe Rosenberg, B. Hurwitz, Julius Cohn and Oscar Gumbinsky.</p>
