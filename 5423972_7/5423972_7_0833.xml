   <p>It is very likely that Nahum Sokolow and the other members of the Zionist delegation that is now visiting the city will leave Chicago ashamed, because the Jews in Chicago have not given one-fourth of the amount they were expected to give to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. The Zionist leadership in Chicago is blamed for this state of affairs. I think that is unjust. The blame should be placed on the nationalist Jews who do not respond to an appeal in behalf of Palestine. The Jews are indifferent not because they do not like Palestine, not because they do not understand and feel the need of a Jewish home in Palestine, but because they are simply getting tired of giving.</p>
   <p>We have too many beggars, for too many purposes. Some of those purposes <pb facs="5423972_7_0834.jpg" n="2"/>are not worth a damn. The Keren Hayesod does not meet with the response it deserves because we are constantly besieged by appeals for Palestine, for some institutions there that have never existed and do not exist now, for institutions that exist but are unnecessary. Half of the sums collected remain in the pocket of the collectors.</p>
   <p>You will be astounded to learn that the Chicago Jews give more money annually for various institutions in Palestine than was raised in this campaign for the Keren Hayesod, a campaign headed by Mr. Nahum Sokolow. The same thing happened in New York and in other American cities.</p>
   <p>With the money that has been collected up to now for the Keren Hayesod, we will not be able to rebuild Palestine. However, the Zionists will be guilty of a crime if they give up the campaign for the Keren Hayesod, although under the present circumstances, the campaign cannot be a success. A radical solution to these difficulties must be found.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0835.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>One general treasury should be created for all the work in Palestine, and out of this treasury, all the necessary institutions in Palestine should be maintained.</p>
   <p>Zionism must take under its wing all the activities in the Holy Land. The rights and ideas of the various groups there should be respected. No exception should be made in behalf of any institution or undertaking, [even] if such an institution or undertaking benefits the country, the Jewish population, or Jewry in general.</p>
   <p>The world Zionist leaders are prominent, trustworthy Jews and the nationalist Jews will support them if they, the leaders, introduce this plan--one treasury for all activities in Palestine.</p>
   <p>We do not see any other way to realize our plans to rebuild our country. Demand one treasury for Palestine!</p>
