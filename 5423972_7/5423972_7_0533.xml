<title level="a">THE ANNUAL BANQUET AND MEETING OF THE UNITED JEWISH CHARITIES</title><title level="a" type="sub">by D. Loebner</title></bibl>

   <p>It is a physical impossibility for all the subscribers and friends of the [United] Jewish Charities of Chicago to attend the meeting and annual banquet next Sunday evening at the Hotel La Salle. The hall is not large enough to accommodate everybody. We believe, however, that the absent subscribers will be present in spirit; otherwise, they would not be subscribers.</p>
   <p>The banquet will begin at six-thirty and the meeting at eight o'clock. The tables will be pushed close to each other, after the banquet is over, to make room for those who did not want to or could not attend the banquet, and for those who could not obtain a place at the banquet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0534.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>No money collection will be made. A report will be given on the activity of the [United] Jewish Charities of Chicago. Some amendments to the constitution of the central charity organization will be proposed. Directors for the various institutions will be elected. It will be an interesting meeting. The more Jews there are present at that meeting, the greater will be the benefit to the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This is the place to remind you once more that the Jewish Charities of Chicago provides funds for two hospitals, two orphan homes, the Winfield Sanitarium, the Chicago Consumptive Relief Society, the Home Finding Society, the Social Service Bureau, the Jewish Free Employment Bureau, the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society, the Jewish department of the Oak Forest Home for the Incurably Sick, as well as some of our educational institutions. Its annual budget amounts to [Translator's note: the amount is not clear]. What Jew who has benefited from God's mercy, will refuse to contribute his share to the Jewish Charities of Chicago if the right people approach him <pb facs="5423972_7_0535.jpg" n="3"/>properly?</p>
   <p>The annual banquet and meeting of the Jewish Charities of Chicago surely reminds you of your duty to provide for the poor, sick, lonely, and helpless widows, orphans, and old people. Get ready then for the signal which will be given at the meeting for the beginning of a campaign to raise the funds necessary to keep up the institutions whose names I have mentioned. All those who are not subscribers, all the subscribers who are behind in their dues, and all the regular subscribers--they all should open wide their hearts and pocketbooks and give generously to the charity drive.</p>
