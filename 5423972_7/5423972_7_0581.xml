   <p>With this declaration of the psalmist, the solicitors and workers of the two and a half million dollar drive for Jewish charity in Chicago will officially open the campaign tonight at the great mass meeting in the Auditorium Theater under the chairmanship of Julius Rosenwald. This will be a historical meeting of the Jews, according to its essence and its sacred objectives. Historical, according to its essence, because by this mass action for productive Jewish charity and social needs, the great Jewish community of Chicago will manifest for the first time solidarity and a united front on the field of social activity and moral progress of Jewish communal life; historical, according to its objectives, because this enterprise of the people will set an example of productive and grandiose social activity for all Jewish communities of America, which seek to improve the health, <pb facs="5423972_7_0582.jpg" n="2"/>the spiritual life, and the social progress of the Jewish citizen through a good education.</p>
   <p>The two and a half million dollar campaign has in view (1) to build a nurses' home and training school for the Michael Reese Hospital, (2) to enlarge and reconstruct the Mt. Sinai Hospital, (3) to establish a branch of the Jewish People's Institute in the Lawndale District, where nearly half of the Chicago Jews live, and to enlarge the institute on Wood Street, (4) to improve the Jewish institutions and to carry on, on a large scale the movement for the moral progress and Americanization of the Jewish citizenry.</p>
   <p>The task of the workers of the drive, headed by Jacob M. Loeb, consists of the most important objectives, which the community leaders are obligated to carry out. Tonight's mass meeting at the Auditorium, which will be addressed by Rabbi Dr. Louis Mann, of Sinai Temple, Judges [Henry] Horner, [Harry M.] Fisher, and General Abel Davis, should strike the signal for the grand <pb facs="5423972_7_0583.jpg" n="3"/>charitable movement, which will function during the entire month of May and will bring countless advantages and many blessings to the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The duties of the community to the local social needs, to the poor of this city, who have been neglected due to the campaigns for the war sufferers, must now be renewed and carried through with doubled energy and inspiration by all classes of Jews, by Orthodox and Reform, by Zionists, by the rich and by the masses, because the work is nationalistic, and for the good of all, and every Chicago Jew must contribute his share, his will, his energy, and his means.</p>
   <p>The greatest Jewish opera singers, Rosa Raisa and Giacomo Rimini, with their appealing voices and divine songs will accompany the sentiments of the Jewish hearts, the mute melodies of the Jewish soul for the ideal of brotherly love and justice.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_0584.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Tonight the Auditorium should be overcrowded with devoted, generous, and sacrificing Jews!</p>
   <p>At tonight's mass meeting, the Chicago Jewish community will stand before a historical test of its maturity and ability to do productive public work. Mr. Loeb hopes and expects that the local Jews will stand the test, because on this success rests a large portion of their own present and the physical, spiritual, and cultural future of their succeeding Jewish generations.</p>
   <p>Out to the great mass meeting in the Auditorium Theater!</p>
