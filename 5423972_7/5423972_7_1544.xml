   <p>Americanization Day was solemnized last week throughout the country. The immigrant became acquainted with the idealism of our land and was invited to participate in the rights and duties of our American national life.</p>
   <p>This Americanization, began with the cultural possession, which he (the immigrant) brought over with him, and which he contributed to our American progress. - In the case of our Jewish people, in order for them to become good Americans, they must be first good Jews. - The American ideals of democracy, of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are also the basic principles of Judaism. Our ancient prophets proclaimed these principles hundreds of years ago, and our present day efforts should be <pb facs="5423972_7_1545.jpg" n="2"/>to see the realization of these principles, in this, our adopted country. American progress will be advanced through the development of our Jewish spiritual greatness, coupled with this country's best influence upon the Jews.</p>
   <p>The Jewish characteristic to give charity with a full hand is one of the fine habits, which we contributed to the American life. No other nationality in this country has donated so freely for its own, or the general poor. The Jews can be proud of their position in the realm of philanthropy. They paved the way, and all the rest follow.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1546.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Jewish charity in the United States helps a great deal to guarantee equality for the Jewish immigrant and his children. While thousands upon thousands, who ran away from the persecutions of Russia, Galicia and Roumania were fortunate in gaining a foothold here, many others, less successful, fell in their struggle for existence and were forced to beg for help - and this they always got.</p>
   <p>Very often the successful and unsuccessful ones came from the same family, or from the same town or city. They were members of the same synagogue and united in the same activities. Their coming to America only changed their personal circumstances, but the memories of the past remained. Even now they long to be in the same synagogue, the same lodge or mutual benefit <pb facs="5423972_7_1547.jpg" n="4"/>society. The synagogues and lodges built numerous institutions and were pioneers in their development. The synagogue and the lodge were the places, where care of the orphan and widow, the aged and the sick originated. The great work undertaken by these pioneers is now being cared for through the Federated Charities.</p>
   <p>The Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities finds itself "at the parting of the roads." It undertakes the burden of these early endeavors, with a view of their realization. It magnifies the use of charity, by removing it from the limited circle, under whose guidance it was, and tries to adjust it to the circumstances, which are necessary for a community of hundreds of thousands of Jews, like Chicago. It has founded in principle, as well as <pb facs="5423972_7_1548.jpg" n="5"/>in parctice the idea, that Jewish charity is a matter, which concerns the entire Jewish community; those, who just arrived, as well as the old time settlers, reform as well as orthodox. It is trying to unite all the branches of Judaism, stressing the importance of making all the Jews responsible for the welfare of their poor. This solidarity and unison in our Jewish life, which the Federation is trying to achieve, will increase our strength to follow the problems, which are interwoven with the welfare of the entire Jewish community.</p>
   <p>This united Jewish solidarity and strength is especially important in the present day crisis, for seldom has our destiny been in such a predicament.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1549.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Well planned action can accomplish a lot for our people here now, more so than ever before, and especially for those, who find themselves in other countries. Our first thought here in America should be to organize, and extend help, thereby alleviating the hardships of the Jews here and in other countries.</p>
   <p>The Federated Charities is the organization, through which the orthodox Jews support their institutions, which are supervised according to orthodox principles. The officials and machinery have been there for years and are well prepared to meet the crisis with the aid of long experience.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1550.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>But experienced officials and a good organization can do nothing without funds. In order to serve the community properly, money is necessary. The Federated Charities must have $11,000 per month to be able to: care for the orphans in the Marks Nathan Home with food and clothing; provide the aged with a plain, but satisfactory existence; furnish the sick in the hospitals with medical care; take care of those who suffer with consumption in their homes; instruct the growing young Jewish generation in the four schools; provide for poor families; protect Jewish itinerants; and bury the dead of the poor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1551.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>As Americans, and as Jews, we are responsible for the welfare of the needy Jews. Until now we performed our duty by taking care of the Jewish charities, but much more must be done now. The Federation needs your support and encouragement in order to be in a position to maintain its twelve institutions. Let us have your support now, with all the means, which your circumstances permit.</p>
   <p>The Federated Jewish Orthodox Charities.</p>
