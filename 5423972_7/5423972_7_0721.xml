   <p>I read in the newspapers that the theological students in Slobotka [town in Lithuania famous for its theological college] have walked out on strike. They have taken their Talmuds [text books] home to resume their studies. They are not striking for higher wages or less hours nor because their bosses do not suit them, but because they are not getting enough rye bread. They do not even demand white bread. Their strike slogan is, "No food, no Torah"....and nobody can say that they are wrong. Against whom are they actually striking? They are striking against us American Jews, and they are quite right. Not only could the American Jews--the Jews in the Lawndale District of Chicago could have averted this strike. What is the question involved? It is a matter of a thousand dollars a month!!! The Jewish women in the Lawndale District spend more money in one day on cosmetics than it would take the Slobotka Seminary to feed its students rye bread for a whole month. I propose <pb facs="5423972_7_0722.jpg" n="2"/>that an emergency strike committee to aid the strikers should immediately be organized in Chicago. Let Mr. Salk, president of the Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel, become the chairman of this committee. Whoever is in favor of my motion should give who regular sign by writing a check and forwarding it to Mr. M. Salk, chairman of the Emergency Relief Committee for the strikers of the Slobotka Seminary.</p>
   <p>If you don't study yourselves, then, at least, per it others to study.....</p>
   <p>I have the greatest respect for Mr. [J.] Rosenwald, but I cannot recognize him as an authority on questions of Jewish religion. If Mr. Rosenwald wishes to raise a question concerning the Jewish religion, he knows, or should know, to whom to go. Whether the Jewish religion requires genuine wine or grape juice for Kidush [Editor's note: Ceremony of blessing the wine] and Havdalah [ceremony on Sabbath night to divide the holy day from the week days] is a matter which only the Orthodox rabbis can decide. Reform rabbis are no authorities on the Jewish religion. If we were to follow the Reform rabbis, we would have <pb facs="5423972_7_0723.jpg" n="3"/>neither a Sabbath nor a holiday, neither kosher nor unkosher laws. What the Reform rabbis say about religious customs, laws, and traditions doesn't mean a thing. Not at a congress of Reform Jews, but at a convocation of Orthodox rabbis should Mr. Rosenwald have made his proposals [on religious issues]. There is no harm in offering a proposal, even if the proposal is out of order. If Mr. Rosenwald had made his proposal at the proper place, he would have received an authoritative reply and a true explanation.</p>
