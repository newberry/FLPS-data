   <p>The "Courier" and his "black cabal" has evidently set itself the task to create every morning, new lies, and to stop at nothing which will harm the People's Relief Bazaar, which is to open, Nov. 13th.</p>
   <p>According to the opinion of the reactionary "Courier Cabal", the Bazaar, which is being run to bring to America as many as possible of the 50,000 Ukrainian Jewish war orphans and to organize a medical unit to fight typhoid fever and other epidemic diseases in the war torn lands, is not a relief for the Jewish war and pogrom victims, but is simply a political bazaar.</p>
   <p>The People's Relief Committee of America was the first and only society in America which took upon itself the task of bringing to this country the 50,000 war orphans, despite the disapproval and opposition of the Joint Distribution.</p>
   <p>Yhe "Courier" and his black "cabal" has taken upon itself the task of feeding to its readers with his manufactured tales, anything to harm the success of the Bazaar.</p>
