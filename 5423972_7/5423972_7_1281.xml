<title level="a">B. HORWICH AT HIS DESK IN THE RELIEF OFFICE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Returning from his travels in Europe to his position as president of the United Jewish Relief Committee with offices at 720 Roosevelt Road, Mr. B. Horwich busied himself yesterday dictating letters to the various agents of the organizations composing the committee. He asked them to continue with renewed energies to secure aid for the unfortunate Jews in the devastated war-countries.</p>
   <p>The regards and letters which Mr. Horwich brought back from his sojourn in Lithuania and Poland, and which are now being carefully distributed to the addressees, are further proof of how great the need is there. The sooner we hurry with our contributions the more lives will we save from death.</p>
   <p>Besides dictating letters, Mr. Horwich is formulating an appeal which should reach every Jew in Chicago that the ship of food for the starving, which was decided upon at the conference, shall be sent on its way as soon as possible. The plan is to send a ship laden with flour, oil, beans, rice, condensed milk and meat.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1282.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the meantime please remember the office address of the United Jewish Relief Committee and send in your contribution.</p>
