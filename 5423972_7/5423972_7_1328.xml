   <p>The People's Relief Committee appeals to the Jewry of Chicago to render aid to the most unfortunate Jews in Poland, Latvia, Ukrania, Galicia, and Rumania.</p>
   <p>Jews of Chicago:</p>
   <p>Awake all Jews of this city! May your hearts respond to the bitter cries of our unfortunate fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who are wrestling with the pain of hunger and plague in Poland, Galicia, Latvia, Ukrania and Rumania! Arise promptly and save those who remained victims of the World War! The impoverished and destitute, upon whom is poured the wrath of nature, are in need of a little subsistence - and you must bring that subsistence to them! Those, who were saved from the sword, are now dying of starvation - and you must obliterate their hunger! They beg for bread - and may you bring unto them that bread.</p>
   <p>Jews of Chicago:</p>
   <p>May the cry for help of those unfortunate not remain a call in the desert, because they are, still, blood of our blood, flesh of our flesh. The recent reports picture before us how the Angel of Death dances his devil's dance <pb facs="5423972_7_1329.jpg" n="2"/>free and undisturbed among our beloved and dear ones. All the execrations in the world are hurled upon them. Mothers are driven insane upon seeing their infants without a morsel of food. They search for worms and mice to eat, although that is difficult to find. Will we, at this moment, remain oblivious to their cries? Let us all remember that, while we refresh ourselves with our good meals. Let us share part of our food with them. Can we digest our food upon considering the misfortune that overwhelms our sisters and brothers abroad? Or do we have a right to dress in fine clothes when our dear ones abroad have no rags to cover their bodies?</p>
   <p>Jews of Chicago:</p>
   <p>The People's Relief Committee for Jewish War Victims, therefore, states on behalf of those, who are affected with sickness, disaster, hunger and pogroms, to set aside the week of June 22 to June 30, in order to help the war victims, by denying ourselves one meal a day during this week and giving it to them. Save money from food! May our sympathy be carried through to bring them courage and hope. May our sorrow materialize into success! From the 22nd until the 30th of June, is the week! Come to help our brothers, who will perish without your aid! Save those who can be saved, from death-hunger!</p>
   <p>- People's Committee for Jewish War Victims. -</p>
