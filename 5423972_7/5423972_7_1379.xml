  <body>
   <p>Mr. Samuel Neveleff returned yesterday from a very successful tour of the whole country to collect money for relief. Through his initiative, four hundred thousand dollars was raised in eight cities, for the relief fund for the Jewish war-sufferers. This time he worked hand in hand with the American Relief Committee, and he received a letter from the general manager, Jacob Billikov, in which his good work and great accomplishments are highly commended.</p>
   <p>Here are the names of the cities which Mr. Neveleff visited, the sums collected, and the arrangement with regard to distribution:</p>
   <p>In Duluth, Minnesota, fifty thousand dollars was collected; thirty thousand will go to the American Relief Committee, and twenty thousand dollars, to the <pb facs="5423972_7_1380.jpg" n="2"/>Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>In Chisholm, sixty-five hundred dollars for the Central Relief Committee was collected.</p>
   <p>In Hibbing, five thousand dollars was collected for the Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>In Virginia, fifty-five hundred dollars was collected, of which the Central Relief Committee will receive twenty-seven hundred.</p>
   <p>In Superior, eight thousand dollars was collected, of which five thousand will go to the Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>In Fargo, nine thousand dollars was collected, of which forty-five hundred dollars will go to the Central [Relief].</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1381.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And in Grand Forks, four thousand dollars was collected, of which three thousand will go to the Central [Relief Committee].</p>
