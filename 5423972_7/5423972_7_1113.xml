  <body>
   <p>If the American Jews had had older traditions and had built a greater social unity, one relief committee would have been enough. In all countries where relief work is being done, there is only one relief body. Such is the case in England, France, Italy, etc. In America there are three relief organizations because the American Jews are not yet united, and still speak three different languages: the language of the proletarian, the language of the Orthodox, and the language of the Reform Jew.</p>
   <p>The contrast between these three groups is so powerful that even in the field of philanthropy they cannot work together. As a result, there are three different relief committees which make three different appeals to the three different groups of Jews. All three, however, are allied in the Joint Distribution Committee-a body composed of representatives of all three organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1114.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Joint Distribution Committee is not and cannot be a democratic organization. When a house is burning, and it is imperative that the flames be extinguished, very little concern is shown about democracy, and, therefore, the Joint Distribution Committee cannot be democratic because the three different relief groups which are represented there, do not contribute equal sums. A person who contributes some money, wishes to have some voice in its distribution, and since the rich contribute more than the poor, they wish to have more authority, and they cannot be condemned for this. The American Joint Relief Committee is the richest, and, therefore, the most influential of the three. Then comes the Central Relief Committee, which anually collects several million dollars. The representatives of the Central Relief Committee also claim that many semi-Orthodox Jews donate to both of the other Committees, thus the relief contribution from the Orthodox element is much greater than it is actually given credit for.</p>
   <p>The smallest and poorest relief body is the People's Relief Committee because its contribution is the smallest. Were it not for the credits which the People's Relief Committee receives from the national drives, its contribution would be <pb facs="5423972_7_1115.jpg" n="3"/>very small. Thus, for instance, the People's Relief Committee received credit for sixty thousand dollars in a western state, when it only collected nineteen dollars last year.</p>
   <p>The People's Relief Committee should not have been the smallest and poorest relief organization, even though only the workers contribute to it. There are a half million Jewish workers in America, and if each one of them gave five dollars a year for relief, the People's Relief Committee would have a direct income of two and one-half million dollars, and with its indirect income, i.e., with its credits, it would have an income of between four and five million dollars a year, and would thus have a substantial influence.</p>
   <p>Now, however, when it collects very little, it has very little influence, and the leaders of the People's Relief Committee are very angry about the situation and are planning to break away from the Joint Distribution Committee.</p>
   <p>We believe that the People's Relief Committee, which can only exist as long as it <pb facs="5423972_7_1116.jpg" n="4"/>belongs to the Joint Distribution Committee, should not have made such a poor showing. The fact that it is small and poor, with very little authority, can only be blamed on the comrades who have monopolized the People's Relief Committee. The People's Relief Committee should not have been a comradeship business, nor should it have been the center of political intrigue; then it would have had the support of all the Jewish workers. It lacks the support of all the Jewish workers, of even half the Jewish workers, because it is a morass of political intrigue and because it consumes what little authority it has, in intimidating the nonradical elements in Eastern Europe. The People's Relief Committee tries to use what little influence it has, not to give more bread to the hungry, or more medicine to the sick, but to strengthen radical institutions in Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the People's Relief Committee are always demanding more cultural work in Eastern Europe, but when they speak of cultural work, they actually mean the support of radical Yiddish institutions, which should not be in existence at all. The American Jews certainly have neither the right nor <pb facs="5423972_7_1117.jpg" n="5"/>the duty to spend the money collected for the naked and hungry, on Yiddish propaganda. We suffer enough criticism of the radicalism in our own camp from the outside world. Radicalism, even a suspicion of radicalism, has cost us tens of thousands of human lives and has helped to destroy the historical Jewish order. Why, then, should the American Jews spend relief money to help radical propaganda? It would have been a crime if they had done it, and they deserve no credit for not having done it.</p>
   <p>The Central Relief Committee also has reasons to be dissatisfied with the Joint Distribution Committee. The Central Relief Committee wants the Joint Distribution Committee to give more money for Orthodox purposes. Nevertheless, it does not threaten to withdraw, but is attempting to do the best that can be done under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>It must also be admitted that the representatives of the American Jewish Relief Committee, who have the greatest influence in the Joint Distribution Committee, are now more nationalistically inclined than they were five years ago. Their <pb facs="5423972_7_1118.jpg" n="6"/>great responsibility has brought them closer to Jewish life and they are not working against Jewish interests. If they are not as sympathetic Jews as the Orthodox or the Zionists, it is because until a few years ago, they knew very little about Jewish matters. One can generally agree with them now; they are not wicked, even though they do make mistakes.</p>
   <p>We hope and wish that the People's Relief Committee will be what its name indicates and not a feed bag for the comrades. If it must remain as it is, then let it withdraw from the main organization, and remain aloof. Only then will the comrades realize their complete impotency.</p>
