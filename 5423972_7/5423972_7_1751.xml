   <p>Within thirty minutes yesterday afternoon at the Standard Club $15,000 was raised for the relief of suffering Jews in Russia. The members of the Standard Club were augmented by delegates from various Jewish organizations of Chicago sent to the meeting to assist in a national movement which had its inception at New York last week. Inspired by an impassioned speech by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, those present rose to the occasion and contributed as they felt they could to the need of their compatriots abroad.</p>
   <p>Among those identified with the movement are many whose names are associated with the commercial progress and welfare of the whole civilized world. Primarily the movement to relieve the condition of the Jews in Russia was inspired by representatives of the race in this country. Since the relief committees of the various cities of the United States have cooperated to give assistance to the Jews at Kishineff and other places abroad, all nationalities have agreed to contribute and their donations are now being added to the general fund to an extent that indicates that Chicago within ten days will be able to send to Baron Rothschild at London $150,000 for <pb facs="5423972_7_1752.jpg" n="2"/>distribution among the needy in Russia and Poland.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago have expressed in public and private meetings the desire to aid the members of their own race, but not to participate in revolutionary conditions.</p>
   <p>According to Dr. Hirsch the Jewish sentiment has extended to Chicago in a manner that pervades no other city in the United States.</p>
   <p>Probably the most sensational feature of the Jewish efforts to aid their brethren abroad was the receipt of a letter from Baron Schlippenbach, Russian consul at Chicago, a gentile contributing $10 to the relief fund. In the letter the baron declares the outrages in Russia have gone beyond the point of human endurance.</p>
   <p>Presiding at the meeting yesterday was Adolph Kraus, president of the B'nai B'rith. He was assisted by Solomon Friedman, who was elected permanent secretary of the relief committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1753.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Members of the Standard Club declared that so far collections had been solicited only from the wealthiest Jews of Chicago and that the list of donations already received was no indication of what might be expected within a week. The Jews of the west side are, however, known to be liberal givers when such circumstances as the present arise and from them a fund of nearly $500,000 is expected within a short time.</p>
   <p>Following Dr. Hirsch's speech subscriptions were made as follows:</p>
