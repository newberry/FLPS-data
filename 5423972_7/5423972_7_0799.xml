   <p>Now, a few days before Passover, I reserve my "Good Morning" greetings for those Chicago Jews who have given something for Ma-oth Hitim [Translator's note: practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy]. To them I extend a hearty greeting but for those Jews who have not given anything for Ma-oth Hitim, I have only a cold stare. Such Jews do not deserve anything better.</p>
   <p>A Jew should act like a human being, not like a donkey. A Jew should know what it means not to have mazoth for Passover, not to be able to observe the Passover, to be hungry during Passover. The difference between a human being and a donkey is that a human being can imagine himself in the position of another human being, can realize that the other man suffers and can try to help him, while a donkey cannot imagine himself in the situation of another donkey or of any other creature. A donkey thinks only about himself and never about anybody else, and, therefore, one does not say "good morning" to a donkey.</p>

   <p>There is no reason in the world why a Jew who earns a living should not give for Ma-oth Hitim. Big sums of money are not demanded of him, only a few cents and, surely, if he earns a living he can afford to give a few cents for such a noble undertaking as Ma-oth Hitim. If such a Jew does not give, he is a.... and maybe even worse than a.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Some liberty was taken in translating this article as Dr. Melamed uses a very idiomatic Jewish.]</p>
