   <p>Jewish Shelter Society.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish person here in Chicago knows and realizes the importance of the Jewish Shelter. This institution was founded for the purpose of feeding and sheltering the unfortunates, particularly immigrants, who are in need of immediate relief, such as food and a place to sleep. Because of the great number of immigrants who came to Chicago during the last twelve months, the institution is running low in funds, the expense is considerably larger than usual, and we are having a $400 deficit.</p>
   <p>It is also predicted that we will have a very severe winter and the burden of making both ends meet will no doubt be rather heavy. In order to meet this deficit and our further expenses, we have decided to take over the Haymarket Theater, Tuesday, December 19th, for a theater benefit. There is not a more charitable deed, than to help this institution, and if you Jews of Chicago desire this good work to go on, we urge you to come to this theater benefit and help the worthy cause.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
