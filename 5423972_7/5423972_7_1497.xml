   <p>For the past fifteen years, ever since the Jewish National Fund and the Zionist Congress were founded by Dr. Theodore Herzl, it has been customary for all Jews who hope for an establishment of a Jewish homeland and a settlement for the Jewish people to appeal on Tishah b'ab (fast day in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem) for the support of the National Fund. The mission of the National Fund is to purchase land in Palestine in order to lay the groundwork for Jewish immigration. Under present conditions, however, the younger people in Jerusalem proper, who want to live by the sweat of their own labor, have no opportunity to do so. The Yar (Forest) Herzl and other land and institutions to which the National Fund lays claim, belong to all the Jewish people, and, at the same time, enable many Jewish families to eke out a livelihood from them. These activities therefore <pb facs="5423972_7_1498.jpg" n="2"/>attain the chief objective of this huge people's movement, viz., to lay claim to more land in Palestine for the Jews. The National Fund is a help to many Jews in war-ridden countries. After the war a large Jewish emigration from war-torn countries will begin, and there can be no undertaking of greater importance than that of preparing as much space as possible in Palestine for those Jews who may desire to go there after the war.</p>
   <p>At the present moment the paramount task confronting the Jews is to strengthen, by all possible means, the Jewish position in Palestine. There is no doubt that after the war the relationship between the Jews and their historical land, and the historical claim by the Jews to that land, will come before the League of Nations. On the twenty-first of last month, the British Government made an official declaration through its foreign minister Sir Edward Grey, that after the war the Powers will be inclined, to turn Palestine over to the Jews. He said that Jewish interests will not be neglected after the war is ended.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1499.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is a statement that is consistent with British tradition, originating in the Bible. Preparedness on the part of the Jews is, therefore, most essential to us. Every piece of ground which is procured for us, and every Jewish institution which is strengthened, means more independence, more prestige, and a strengthening of the claim that Palestine should belong to the people of Israel. This is the goal; this is the task of mankind.</p>
   <p>Owing to the large demand for aid coming to us from our unfortunate brethren in war-stricken countries, the National Fund has been terribly neglected in the last two years. It has also suffered heavily in losing its support from war-ridden countries. Therefore, if we in America ignore the National Fund, we commit a crime against the Jewish people. Of course it is of vital importance to help our suffering brethren in the belligerent countries in their present misfortune, but we must also prepare something for them against the time when hostilities will cease. If, after the war, Palestine is able to absorb a few thousand immigrant families, it will be a great help as well as <pb facs="5423972_7_1500.jpg" n="4"/>a great accomplishment. It is important to render immediate aid to people, but it is far more important to do something for them that will last permanently.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the National Fund made no collections of its own on last Tishah b'ab in order that our brethren in war-stricken areas might have the total proceeds of the collections made at that time. It would be wrong, however, to let this year pass by without giving aid to the National Fund. The Relief Committee, has therefore decided to make appeals this Tishah b'ab in the synagogues, and the War Relief Committee will be active this Tishah b'ab in the cemeteries only, leaving the other field open to the National Fund.</p>
   <p>Both undertakings, i. e., the collection in behalf of the National Fund by the Relief Committee in the synagogues, and by the War Relief Committee in the cemeteries, will find a generous response in the hearts of Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1501.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The day of our destruction [Translator's note: referring to Tishah b'ab, the day on which Jerusalem was captured by the Babylonians] will be the day of our reconstruction. The work of the National Fund is constructive work, embracing a goal. The work for war-sufferers means immediate relief to our brethren in great need. Both are essential. Both should be supported.</p>
