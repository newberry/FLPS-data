<title level="a">SCHIFF STATE BANK SENDS MR. GOLDMAN AS EMISSARY TO EUROPE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Schiff and Company State Bank, Twelfth Street near Halsted Street, the largest and oldest Jewish state bank, is sending an emissary to Europe, who will personally visit Poland, Galicia, Lithuania and Rumania. Mr. Jacob Goldman, manager of the bank's foreign-exchange department, has been chosen by the latter as the suitable person to represent them.</p>
   <p>This great Jewish institution could not find a more capable, more suitable and trustworthy person than its emissary. Mr. Goldman possesses all the qualifications necessary; he is reliable and dependable.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldman has been engaged in the foreign-exchange and steamship ticket business for fourteen years, and for the last four years has served as manager of the foreign department of Schiff and Company State Bank. Having varied experience and knowledge in this field he will have the proper background to <pb facs="5423972_7_1223.jpg" n="2"/>accomplish his mission perfectly.</p>
   <p>The news that the Schiff State Bank is sending an emissary to Europe was received with enthusiasm by Chicago Jews. They know that this great Jewish institution with an honorable reputation of twenty-seven years behind it is one of the most reliable and safest banks. It means help of great importance for the tens of thousands of Jews in Poland, Lithuania, Galicia and Rumania.</p>
   <p>Hundreds and thousands of Jews from all parts of the city are coming to the bank to forward money, letters, and personal regards to their near ones and dear ones through Mr. Goldman, who will deliver them personally to each suffering family across the sea. Entire organizations are taking advantage of this opportunity and are sending money to their native cities. Truly, this is an opportunity of a lifetime! The emissary is a responsible person and represents a responsible bank.</p>
   <p>The Schiff and Company State Bank is sparing no expense in order to carry out <pb facs="5423972_7_1224.jpg" n="3"/>everything properly and punctually. No extra charges will be made, for the bank assumes all the expenses of Mr. Goldman's journey. Even his special transportation while traveling from one city to another for the "landsleit vereins" (countrymen organizations) is assumed by the bank.</p>
   <p>In Europe,Mr. Goldman will make direct connections with numerous cities in Poland in order to speed up and guarantee the delivery of monies. Representing a big financial institution like the Schiff State Bank with an influential reputation, Mr. Goldman will enjoy the opportunity of carrying out his mission in the proper manner, and that means a great deal for Chicago Jews who are willing to extend aid to their families and relatives in Europe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldman will leave next Thursday evening, January 8. He will embark for Europe from New York harbor on January 14. During his journey through Poland, Lithuania, Rumania and other countries he will communicate with the Schiff State Bank by cable.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1225.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is in place here to congratulate the Schiff and Company State Bank for their sensible choice of Mr. Goldman as their emissary for this mission. The latter is no author, doctor, or lawyer, but an experienced foreign-exchange person who will be interested only in the fulfillment in a suitable manner of his special mission.</p>
