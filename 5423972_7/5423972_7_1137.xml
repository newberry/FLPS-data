   <p>The South African government, so a Johannesburg dispatch runs, has granted permission to bring two thousand Ukrainian Jewish war-orphans to South Africa, and a South African Jewish commission is already on its way to the Ukraine to get the children.</p>
   <p>There are only 150,000 Jews in South Africa, and a great many of them are scattered in villages and little hamlets. The South African Jews, though mostly well-to-do, are by no means rich, and their economic structure does not differ very much from our own, in this country. But still, the South African Jews undertake to care for two thousand Jewish war-orphans, without making much ado about it. A representative South African Jew stated recently that as soon as these two thousand unfortunate ones will be provided for, it may be possible to bring over another two thousand of these orphans from the Ukraine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1138.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If South African Jews, numbering only one half of the Jews in Chicago, can care for two thousand children, the Jewish community of Chicago ought to be able to care for four thousand Ukranian war-orphans, and American Jewry at large for at least sixty thousand. Though the question of bringing over Ukrainian Jewish war-orphans is being discussed in the American Jewish press, no one thinks seriously of solving the problem immediately. We do not know, of course, what the Joint Distribution Committee is contemplating doing in the matter, since nothing has been heard from the Joint Distribution Committee on the subject; but it may be taken for granted that it does not deem it advisable to take up the question right now, probably because it is too busy with solving the problems arising out of the Russian-Polish war. We do not blame the Joint Distribution Committee for its present attitude. We suppose that there is plenty to do now, without doing constructive relief work. Its first duty is to bring aid and relief to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who have been ruined by the Russian-Polish war. Nor should we expect the Joint Distribution Committee to do everything in the way of relief. As long as wars are going on in Europe, its greatest duty is to do temporary, not constructive relief work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1139.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But we do blame the leaders of the large Jewish communities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, etc., for not taking any action, for postponing the solution of the problem of our Ukrainian war-orphans until it may be too late.</p>
   <p>There are some four hundred thousand Jewish war-orphans in Eastern Europe. The Eastern European Jews will do their very best if they can provide for two hundred thousand--of course, with the financial help of American Jewry and other well-to-do Jewish groups in Europe. But the other two hundred thousand Jewish war-orphans must be taken care of by American and Anglo-Jewry. It will take us years before we accomplish the gigantic task of organizing the work, but we have to make a beginning right away. At least those Jewish war-orphans in various parts of the Ukraine and Poland who can be shipped to this country, should be brought over without delay.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt in our mind that the American government will grant the necessary permission for bringing them over here. Most of the children will have to be distributed all over the country, and taken care of by Jewish families.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1140.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We are sure that there are from thirty to forty thousand Jewish families in the United States who would take upon themselves the adoption of a Jewish war-orphan. If one of the communities should start to do something, say to form an organization with the object of inducing Jewish families to adopt Jewish war-orphans, other communities will do the same.</p>
   <p>We feel that the Chicago Jewish community, one of the leading Jewish communities in the country, is in honor and duty bound to give a good example and to take the lead. The cause is such a popular one that whoever will undertake to do the work will be successful and accomplish wonders.</p>
   <p>We beg to propose that a provisional committee, consisting of Jewish public workers, be formed at once in Chicago, and that this committee communicate with Washington authorities with the view to getting permission to bring over the Jewish war-orphans from Eastern Europe. And as soon as the permission is granted, it [provisional committee] should begin an active campaign among the wealthy classes of the Jewish population for the purpose of placing Jewish war-orphans <pb facs="5423972_7_1141.jpg" n="5"/>with private families. We are sure that the Chicago Jewish population will respond nobly to an appeal on behalf of our war-orphans, and that hundreds of families will declare their willingness to adopt the unfortunate ones and to bring them up as their own children.</p>
   <p>If we in Chicago start to work right away, other communities will follow our lead.</p>
