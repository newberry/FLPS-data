   <p>A committee from the local Joint Relief office yesterday greeted the well-known New York welfare worker, Mr. Harry Fischel, treasurer of the Central Relief Committee. Mr. Fischel came here to attend the wedding of a niece, Miss Frieda Fischel. The committee included Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Mr. B. Horwich, Mr. Harris Horwich, Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, Mr. Isadore Liederman, Mr. Julius Savitzky, and Miss Bella J. Yerosalimsky.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fischel told the committee of the great work the Central Relief Committee had done to raise funds with a minimum of expense. He also spoke of the work of the Joint Distribution [Committee].</p>
   <p>During its existence, the Central Relief Committee has raised over three million dollars, while showing an expenditure of something over two per cent <pb facs="5423972_7_1384.jpg" n="2"/>for expenses, whereas it costs the American Relief Committee over five per cent to raise money for relief.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fischel admitted that the reason that it costs the Committee so little to raise money, was the fact that he pays half the office expenses out of his own pocket, and does not charge the committee any rent for its offices, which are located in his building.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fischel gives a great deal of time to relief work. Mr. Fischel is one of the few millionaires in America of Russian birth. A few years ago he turned over his business to one of his sons-in-law, and since then he has devoted all of his time to relief work.</p>
   <p>Particularly interesting was the story which Mr. Fischel told the committee about the system in the Central Relief office.</p>
   <p>"We have a complete record of every cent that we receive for relief. One record is kept in a book, and a second record is kept on a card. Every cent <pb facs="5423972_7_1385.jpg" n="3"/>that comes into our office is recorded daily in the manner mentioned above. The money is not held in the office more than one day, and the following day it is deposited in the bank. All letters with money in them are opened once a day, and in the presence of my cashier, one of the two managers in the office, and a clerk.</p>
   <p>"Recently," he continued, "a representative of the New York Times came to me and asked me whether I could give him a complete statement of all the money that we had received and paid out since the office was opened. When I answered that I could give him such a statement in a few minutes, he was astonished. This is our system, and this is the reason for our success."</p>
