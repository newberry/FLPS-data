   <p>There is no specific time at which a young girl must begin to wear long dresses or a young lad, his long trousers.</p>
   <p>All depends on the weight and development of the child. As the children grow, the parents visualize them, regardless of age, in their long dresses or trousers that they may look and act as men. The saying goes, "Clothes make the man."</p>
   <p>The Federation as the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities is called, is the "long clothes" of the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1660.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Since its development there is this expressed desire that it possess the proper clothing, that it may not appear nor act childish. Parents are forever grieved when grown children behave as babies. So too the Chicago Jewish social workers felt that the Chicago Jewish community should discard the childish attire it has worn since infancy.</p>
   <p>Thus began, some years ago, this movement to clothe the growing child accordingly.</p>
   <p>Everyone vitally connected and concerned turned their attention to the matter, finally arriving at the conclusion that if the Chicago Jewish community should be suitably adjusted there remained but one procedure, <pb facs="5423972_7_1661.jpg" n="3"/>that of uniting, forming a unity that would be mature, one with a sense of responsibility. We must, once and for all discard our playfulness, lolly-pops, and sand-box, and clean house thoroughly.</p>
   <p>In almost every institution this question was discussed at meetings of their respective Boards of Directors. The Old People's Home had a permanent committee that was to adopt a plan for the Jewish community. The Orphanage, which more than any other institution suffered from lack of responsibility and childish administration, had more than once debated about this unity of the institutions and the accomplishments of a common hand-in-hand work by the entire large Jewish community. The Maimonides Hospital knew the impossibility of maintaining a first class hospital with an unorganized <pb facs="5423972_7_1662.jpg" n="4"/>group financing its good-will with nickles and dimes when thousands were needed. The Hebrew schools had to struggle for existence - they were unable to install any system, they could not get a capable principal nor competent teachers, they were the laughing stock of the country. At the "Bread for the Hungry" (Lechem Leravim) when a ton of coal was needed for a poor family, one had to "blow a trumpet," so to speak, to make a deafening noise. The "Hachnesses Urchim," (Home for the Visitors) knew that a pious Jew needed the fringed garment as well as the washing of the hands before eating, but food and a place to sleep were lacking. The only group whose clients never complained was the burial "Chesid Shell Amus." Shrouds were generally found and dead men carry no resentment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1663.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>With such disorder in every corner of the Chicago Jewish community it is no wonder that the heads of every institution, especially the more capable ones, sought means to organize in a more civilized way....</p>
   <p>But from theory to practice is a long way. The greatest and best of Chicago's Jews devoted their time to a particular institution. Due to the long years of service to their institutional specialty they became,more or less, limited in seeing the needs beyond their favorite one.</p>
   <p>Each deemed his institution important, all others secondary. A plan was suggested by the committee of the Old People's Home as follows: The Old People's Home would head all needs of Chicago's Judaism, other institutions being dependent on it. The envy of one against the other slowly developed into hatred so that it was almost impossible for representatives from any two of them to tolerate each other. In polite messages between the various presidents one heard only grievances and complaints regarding the rest of them....</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1664.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It was feared that a unity was beyond accomplishment. Chicago's Jewish community was like an orphan with many foster-mothers; each one administered advice but none gave food or proper clothing....</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewish community is very young. Since the body grew rapidly the head was unable to develop accordingly. The Jewish group appears to be over-grown and childish, so that it needs a nurse's care, yet where can one get immediately a good dependable nurse?</p>
   <p>Chicago's Jewish community, consisting of a great foreign element has not yet been settled or mellowed by time.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1665.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Everyone feels the need of a Federation. As soon as the proper persons can be selected who will not be childish or partisan, who will rise above institutional squabbles, who will not be narrow-minded or limited, a Federation can be founded.</p>
   <p>This general wish of all the representatives of every institution, this necessity, is the true origin of the Federation. No one can demand credit for its existence since it was a natural development arising from these conditions.</p>
   <p>The people found themselves......</p>
   <p>Alef.</p>
