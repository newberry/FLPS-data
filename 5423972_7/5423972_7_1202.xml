   <p>An important meeting was held yesterday at the offices of the Joint Relief Committee between members of the committee and representatives of the matzoth bakers, who gladly answered the call to attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a contract was signed between the committee members and the matzoth bakers, according to which the latter pledge themselves to place a two-cent relief stamp on five-pound packages of matzoth, and a four-cent relief stamp on ten-pound packages.</p>
   <p>It was also arranged at the meeting that the convention committee should meet at four o'clock on Thursday at the office of Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt to formulate final plans for the organization of the seven western states.</p>

   <p>At the meeting it was also announced that about two hundred cases of clothing will soon be shipped to Poland via Danzig. The clothing is being collected and packed under the supervision of a committee composed of B. Horwich, S. Rosenblatt and B. J. Bronstein.</p>
   <p>Mr. Samuel Nevelev, field representative of the Relief Committee, returned recently from a trip through Michigan, where he had successfully organized the relief work.</p>
