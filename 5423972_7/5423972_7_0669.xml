   <p>The greatest curse of American Jewry is not the fact that its forces are disorganized, but rather that the sense of responsibility of the individual to society is not developed. Very few Jews in America concern themselves with Jewish problems, and those that do take an interest in Jewish affairs, are not always trustworthy.</p>
   <p>It is always interesting to follow the development of a campaign among the Jews, from the standpoint of the reliability of individuals. In the early stage of the campaign, an overwhelming enthusiasm prevails among the rank and file, and if we were to take the promises of our welfare workers seriously, we would soon arrive at the conclusion that the campaign was going to be a brilliant success. Seldom, however, is a Jewish campaign in our beloved America a complete success because the enthusiasm soon dies out and nothing <pb facs="5423972_7_0670.jpg" n="2"/>comes of the many promises. Only a few devoted welfare workers do their full duty. The others prove to be windbags. They mean well, but they lack the sense of duty to hold out until the end.</p>
   <p>When a Jew in Berlin, Vienna, Paris, or London promises to do a certain thing for the Jewish community, he keeps his promise under any circumstances. But when a Jew in America promises to do something, we cannot always rely upon his word. The leaders of movements, organizations, and institutions of Jewish life in America have experienced this. The most distressing experiences in this respect, however, have been encountered by the Orthodoxy and by the Zionists.</p>
   <p>In America there is a Union of Orthodox Synagogues. This Union holds a convention every year, adopts resolutions, acts, does things--and an outsider, reading the newspaper reports of these conventions, might believe that everything was in the finest order. In reality, however, everything that he reads is full of hot air. The American Jewish Orthodoxy is not organized. There <pb facs="5423972_7_0671.jpg" n="3"/>exists neither a firm will nor a fixed policy among the Orthodoxy. Everyone does as he pleases; everything is a free-for-all, everything is hot air. The few leaders [of the Orthodoxy] are either weaklings without any power of endurance, or downright windbags. Perhaps it is not nice to say this, nevertheless, it is true, and the truth is not always nice.</p>
   <p>The Zionists in America have had similar experiences, and that is the only reason why American Zionism has not progressed. It cannot be said that the American Jews are hostile to Zionism. The truth of the matter is that in America there are many Zionists voices, but there is little Zionist activity because, among the Zionists, there are also many windbags.....The enthusiasm lasts one, two, or three days, and then everything dies out.</p>
   <p>Why hasn't the American Zionist organization one hundred thousand members? Aren't there one hundred thousand Jews in America who are sympathetic to <pb facs="5423972_7_0672.jpg" n="4"/>Zionism, and willing to spend six dollars a year on Zionism? No one can say that there aren't. If the Zionist organization in America has, after thirty years of work only thirty or forty thousand members, it is because the American Zionists lack a consciousness of their duty. Of the forty thousand organized Zionists in America, there aren't even tree thousand who possess a strongly developed sense of duty. All of the hard work is done by a small group of people. The overworked Zionist leaders are forever complaining, "There is a shortage of workers." Whenever a great Zionist affair takes place, whenever Zionist banquets and mass meetings are held, whenever a great Zionist figure makes a personal appearance, huge crowds manifest great enthusiasm, applaud, sing Hatikvah [Jewish national anthem], make pledges, and do everything. But as soon as the affair blows over, they all disappear and are not seen again for another year. The reason for this is because they lack a sense of duty, because they are windbags. All who attend a great Zionist affair are good Zionists. They certainly have good intentions toward their people, but they lack backbone, character, <pb facs="5423972_7_0673.jpg" n="5"/>and will power, and without these characteristics, we cannot raise millions for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], nor can we build a strong Zionist organization.</p>
   <p>Jewish life in America is theoretically beautiful, but in reality it is not. If the American Jews were more conscious of their duty, and more sincere; if they had more backbone, the Jewish situation today would be much more favorable because among the Jews of America there are great philanthropic and nationalistic forces. But there is a lack of responsibility about organizing these forces. That is why we always have to organize affairs. In order to launch a Keren Hayesod campaign, the presence of Dr. Weizmann in America is necessary--then great excitement prevails, but little money is raised. In order to launch a Relief Campaign, the presence of Louis Marshall from New York is necessary. Without "affairs," without excitement, we can't do anything because, as far as Jewish community work is concerned, we are a bunch of windbags. As long as we American Jews are not conscious of our duty--are <pb facs="5423972_7_0674.jpg" n="6"/>not sincere and serious in our attitude toward Jewish affairs, so long will our people, as well as Palestine, suffer.</p>
