   <p>Three hundred and forty-eight Jewish young women, members of the Hebrew Institute's War Service Club, pledged themselves to help in the campaign of the local Joint Relief Office to gather old clothes for the benefit of war-suffering Jews. In a few days these beautiful and devoted Jewish young women will start on their rounds in Jewish neighborhoods to canvass homes for old clothes. It is expected that every Jewish housewife will welcome these Jewish girls, and promise to give them whatever old clothes she may have for the unfortunate Jewish men, women, and children in the war countries.</p>
   <p>Two thousand dollars' worth of old clothes have already been collected, and one can easily imagine how large a quantity of old clothes will come in later. The Joint Relief has opened a special office at 932 West 12th Street for the checking and sorting of the clothes collected. Anyone having old clothes to donate for the unfortunate Jews in the war countries is requested to call Monroe 1371, and a truck will be sent for the bundle. Many, who are trying to <pb facs="5423972_7_1411.jpg" n="2"/>curtail expenses of the Relief Office, deliver the bundles themselves. The Michigan Dye House and the Mermond Motor Truck Company have furnished automobiles free for one day for the collection of bundles from Jewish homes. The Relief Office expects that other Jewish firms or individuals will follow their splendid example and offer their motor cars on designated days for the collection of old clothes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berger and Mr. Simbroff were the first to canvass the Jewish homes in Englewood, and according to the statement of Mr. Edward Shulman, manager of the old clothes campaign, they collected more than five hundred dollars' worth of clothes. The War Service Club, whose members will shortly begin the canvass for old clothes,has elected the following committee which will supervise the canvass: Miss E. Rosenberg, chairman; Miss Lillian Rassman, Miss Lottie Shine, Miss Rose Youngerman, and Miss Etta Sheiner.</p>
