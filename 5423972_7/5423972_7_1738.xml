   <p>They Need help.</p>
   <p>Our great learned people of Tzfas (Safed) in the Holy Land, write requesting that the Jews of Chicago send whatever financial aid possible to assure the continued existence of the Theological College and the Preparatory Schools of that city. Heretofore the people of Tzfas have never appealed to the Jews of this country for financial aid. However, now since the renewal of pogroms in Russia, that sources of income has been greatly our-tailed and is very many cases completely stopped. The rich Jews of Russia have been compelled to help their own people and many of them are now in need themselves. Therefore there are none today to support the Talmudic institutions of Tzfas. If aid is not immediately forthcoming, these noble institutions of learning will be compelled to close their doors. We therefore beg our worthy brethren of Chicago to respond whole-heartedly to the appeals now being made throughout the city. Contributions may be sent to the Chicago treasurer, L. Witterberg, at 580 S. Canal St.</p>
