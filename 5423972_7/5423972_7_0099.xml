   <p>The first annual meeting of the members of the Home for Aged Jews was held last Sunday afternoon in the vestry rooms of the K. A. M. Temple. The attendance was large. Mr. Morris Rosenbaum presided and Mr. Harry Hart officiated as Secretary.</p>
   <p>The donations are as follows: A. Slimmer, $50,000, donations of others, $66,365, total $111,365. Of this amount $75,327.50 has been paid. Dues to the amount of $3,925 have also been paid, making a grand total of $79,252.50. The Home has 115 patrons paying $25 yearly and 318 members paying $10.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Lowenthal, as chairman of the committee on buildings and grounds reported that a purchase has been made of the premises on the northwest corner of Drexel Ave. and Sixty-second street, having a frontage of 347 feet on Drexel Ave. and 207 feet on Sixty-second street. The total cost of the grounds was $39,988.58. The total cost of the building is estimated <pb facs="5423972_7_0100.jpg" n="2"/>at $60,000. Ground was broken last week, and it is expected that the building will be ready for occupancy by Jan. 1, 1893. The dimensions of the main building are 155 by 42 feet. Three stories, attic and basement will furnish ample accommodation for at least fifty inmates and the required help.</p>
