   <p>Peoples Relief Starts Campaign For Ten Thousand Yearly Membership</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the propicious hour has not as yet struck in the relief work. The deep and horrible wounds, which our people inherited from the war, will not heal so quickly. The weary and hopeless eyes of the hundreds of thousands of orphans, widows, aged, sick, and destitute of Poland, Latvia, and Romania, who are attempting to escape murderous hands, turn to us.</p>
   <p>The numerous childrens schools in Europe await our help. If we withdraw our helping hands, they will perish.</p>
   <p>All those helpless children are of the lowest strata in our race. It is therefore the religious duty of even the poorest of our people to support, the relief work with the greatest energy.</p>
   <p>Since the condition is so desperate, our relief work must be placed on a sound basis.</p>
   <p>We must not rely upon the petty collections of pennies, that carries a shameful charity character, and we must not depend upon our wealthy contributors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1038.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Peoples Relief is, therefore, starting a campaign to obtain in Chicago, amongst the 300,000 Jews, 10,000 who will contribute a certain sum of money annually to the Peoples Relief in which they will become members.</p>
   <p>We trust that every Jew will voluntarily donate a few dollars a year for relief work as a subsidy and not as a donation.</p>
   <p>In addition to this, the Peoples Relief will undertake a novelty, which may be a great relief remedy. It will publish a year-book in which every member will have address, and personal memorandum recorded. Everything will be filed alphabetically. The books will be mailed through out the world, wherever Jews are living. Every member will pay twenty-five cents for this privilege to cover expenses.</p>
   <p>Every member will, also, have a membership card, which will exempt him from casual drives.</p>
   <p>The campaign commences this week. We will not rest until we reach our goal. Our voluntary army is ready for work. The first street canvasing will take place June 4.</p>
   <p>Do not wait for the volunteers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1039.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Be amongst the first to point out the way for others. Decide upon your contributions and notify the office of the Peoples Relief committee, 1126 Blue Island Ave. Tel. Monroe 3022.</p>
   <p>Lead and help bring about success.</p>
   <p>Peoples Relief Committee</p>
