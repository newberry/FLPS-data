   <p>If the Chicago rabbis and Orthodox leaders would establish a rule to prohibit agents from collecting money throughout the city without a permit from a recognized authority of the community, many agents who collect money for legitimate institutions would not be suspect and many pseudo agents, who collect money for very dubious institutions under very dubious conditions, would not extort so much money from the public. I have reference to a certain agent who is now collecting money in Chicago for the Ukrainian orphans, although none of those authorized to solicit for the Ukrainian orphans has given him a permit to do so. This man who sails under various aliasis can be found everywhere. He wanted to make an appeal at the Congregation Kehilath Jacob, but Max Shulman recognized him....and then, he wanted to make an appeal at the Congregation Anshe Liebawitcly, but there they told him that if the Rabbinical Association would recognize him, he would be given two hundred dollars for his institution. He did not accept this offer, but he is still going about the city collecting money. Rabbis and Orthodox leaders, do you think this is right? Chicago spends several thousand <pb facs="5423972_7_0715.jpg" n="2"/>dollars a year on fake charities, while our own institutions are in dire need.</p>
   <p>[Cantor] Joseph Rosenblatt will officiate at the services this coming Sabbath at the Congregation Anshe Liebawitch. If our Jewish fathers have all their wits about them, they will take their children to the synagogue to listen to the great Rosenblatt, because the melodies he sings have a definite educational value. Everybody is familiar with the legend of the converted Jew who, after living for many years as a Christian, returned to Judaism because, as the story goes, he passed a synagogue and heard a cantor singing the beautiful melodies that he [the Jew] had known in his youth. These melodies moved him so deeply that he because a Jew again. In this legend, the cultural value of the melodies heard in the Jewish synagogue is tellingly revealed, and that is particularly true when they are sung by such a noted cantor as Rosenblatt. These melodies are precious because they arouse profound Jewish emotions, which become deeply rooted in the soul of a child. Therefore, if you intend to listen to Joseph <pb facs="5423972_7_0716.jpg" n="3"/>Rosenblatt, don't forget to bring your children with you.</p>
