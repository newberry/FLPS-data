   <p>Chicago Peoples Relief is now accepting food parcels for Soviet Russia. A special bureau is open for that purpose; food drafts are sold from $10 to $50. Women's committee of the Peoples Relief, start working for the drive.</p>
   <p>At 12 o'clock Sunday, the Peoples Relief committee will open its transmission bureau, and will begin accepting cash for food parcels, which the relatives in America wish to send to their relatives and friends in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>It is known that the Joint Distribution committee has come to an agreement with the American Relief Administration who have authorized the Joint Distribution committee to sell the original food drafts of the Hoover Administration among the Jews in America and the Peoples Relief committee which is a part of the Joint Board, is understood to have the same privileges.</p>
   <p>We wish to call to the attention of the Jews in Chicago that all food parcels will be sent to Soviet Russia, absolutely free, and every Jew who wishes to send a food parcel to his father or mother, brother or sister, relative or friend, to any part of Soviet Russia or Ukrania, can do so by contacting the <pb facs="5423972_7_0948.jpg" n="2"/>office of the Peoples Relief, 128 Blue Island Ave., and paying the sum of from ten to fifty follars. Food amounting to that sum will be shipped to the addressee mentioned by the sender, with the assurance that if for any reason the person to whom the parcel is addressed cannot be found, the American Relief Administration will refund to the person the full sum that he paid here.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ab Zuker, manager of the Chicago Peoples Relief, has recently returned from various countries in Europe where he worked in the interests of war sufferers across the sea. Mr. Zuker will be pleased to give you any information regarding steamship tickets, affidavits, food or clothing, that you wish to send to Europe.</p>
   <p>The office of the Peoples Relief is open daily from 9 to 6 - Sunday to 1, for information.</p>
