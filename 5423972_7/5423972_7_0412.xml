   <p>A bomb tore asunder the shoe repair shop of Morris Newsbond, 3638 W. 16th Street, causing heavy damages. Mr. Newsbond's brother told a representative of the "Forward", that the source was not labor trouble.</p>
   <p>He also told the "Forward" representative that two weeks ago Mr. Sandler, representative of the West Side Shoe Repair Bosses Association, entered his store (Mr. Morris Newsbond's) and asked him for $8, for dues. Mr. Newsbond refused to pay.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sandler located his wife and asked her for $25 admission-fee, for her husband, to the Bosses' Association. Mrs. Newsbond told him that they do not employ any workers and have no need of becoming a member of their organization. Mr. Sandler then told her it would cost her much more than the entrance fee.</p>
   <p>The Shoe Repair Bosses' Association broke away from the Shoe Repair Union.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morris Newsbond's brother believes that the Shoe Repair Bosses Association were involved in the bombing.</p>
