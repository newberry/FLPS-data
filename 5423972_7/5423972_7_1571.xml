   <p>At the last meeting of the managing committee of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities, most of the members of the committee were of the opinion that the recent small income of the Federation was due to discontinuing its publicity which it has had in such bountiful quantity in the past. Almost all of the members declared that something must be done to give it more publicity, both oral and written.</p>
   <p>We believe that fabricated publicity can not last very long and can not bring desirable results. Artificial publicity is like a painted face which can perhaps be deceiving from a distance, but in which, upon closer observation, the defects can be clearly seen. Natural publicity is <pb facs="5423972_7_1572.jpg" n="2"/>inevitable if the managing committee will do its work. The newspapers will publish anything worth while. The public will attend mass meetings if an important message is delivered. The Federation was very active last year. It financed all charitable institutions, which did not surprise the public. It is entirely different now. Practically all of the institutions are either forgotten or forsaken.</p>
   <p>The Jewish public is not interested in such "news." Thus the papers refrain from printing it. Those who are interested in charity know that help can not come from the meetings of the Federation, because when 52 members of the managing committee are urged to attend a meeting less than 10 show up and three out of 62 presidents of synagogues attend.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1573.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The masses will not allow themselves to be deceived. The Chicago Jews are for the Federation, they will not let it fail. But, it must be a Federation of the West Side Orthodox Institutions, for the West Side Orthodox Institutions. Such a Federation will exist, if it would only be conceivable to the present leaders.</p>
