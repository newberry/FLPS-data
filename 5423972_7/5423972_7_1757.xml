   <p>Plans for a general organization to raise for the relief of the Jews of Russia at least double the amount of Chicago's contribution to aid victims of the Kischineff massacre two years ago were drafted yesterday afternoon, and in the evening the West Side Auxiliary Jewish Relief Association was formed and raised more than $600 as the first contribution to the fund. At the west side mass meeting, held at 47 Johnson Street, Alderman Harris of the Nineth Ward announced that he would ask Mayor Dunne to-day to issue a proclamation asking general contributions from the people of Chicago, and would introduce a resolution in the council Monday night on the subject.</p>
   <p>At the general conference in the afternoon at the Bismark Hotel Adolf Kraus presided Dr. Joseph Stolz, rabbi of Isaiah Temple, secretary. The others present were Dr. Emil G. Hirsch; Dr. Aaron J. Messing of Temple B'nai Sholom, Dr. Emanuel Schreiber <pb facs="5423972_7_1758.jpg" n="2"/>of the Emanuel Congregation, Dr. A. R. Levy, Dr. Tobias Schanfarber, Harry Hart, M. Ginsberg, editor of the Jewish Courier: B. Horwich; Mr. Ehrlich, Issas A. Loeb, J. C. Lebosky and Leon Zolotkoff, who was the Chicago representative at the seventh Zionist conference at Basie, Switzerland, last June.</p>
   <p>Will Use Canvassers</p>
   <p>The general organization, which will create a working basis at the Standard Club, to-morrow afternoon, will appoint committees to canvass the business and professional interests downtown and will call on every Jewish society, club, and congregation to aid in the work.</p>
   <p>At the west side meeting permanent organization was effected by the election of B. Horwich as chairman; M. Schulman, secretary and H. Krulewich, treasurer of the association. Most of those present were residents of the West Side and many had relatives in Russia of whose fate in the two weeks of massacre they were in doubt. Addresses were made by Israel Cowen, H. Harwich, Alderman Harris, M. Elijoshev and M. Lippmann. An executive committee to direct the soliciting of subscriptions was appointed.</p>

   <p>Kraus Tells of Method</p>
   <p>After the conference on the general organization in the afternoon, Adolph Kraus said:</p>
   <p>"It has been decided that the general organization shall conduct its work among individuals and through organizations already existing. It will not undertake any affairs, benefits or kindred enterprises. Individuals desiring to aid in that way, however, need not be deterred on account of our determination, which is based on consideration of expediency. All money received by the Chicago organization will be forwarded promptly to Jacob H. Schiff at New York, treasurer of the international association. For the Kishinev victims $32,000 was raised in Chicago. We shall double that if possible."</p>
