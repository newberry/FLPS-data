   <p>Coming in contact with a great many of the club workers, both locally and nationally, we are confronted with the same statement that the Jewish children make the best club material. I think to a considerable extent this this is true though not entirely true. I believe any group of children properly guided and properly supervised, if intelligently supervised, make good club material. However, as far as the Jewish children are concerned, we are told that they seem naturally and inevitably to recognize the need of an association and that this sense of orderliness and respect for authority which has been the age old trait of the Jewish character, results in the formation of clubs with good objectives. We have been grappling with this problem for all of these years and while we can point with a great deal of pride possibly to the fact that a great many clubs have been functioning, some of them for years, and even in the instance of clubs that have been disbanded, a good many of the membership in these clubs have been influenced along positive constructive lines, we are still of the belief that not even the surface has been scratched nor have the possibilities been touched. With this fact in mind it is our sincerest hope that in this Lawndale District section, with its enormous population, more definite work along these lines will be accomplished.</p>
