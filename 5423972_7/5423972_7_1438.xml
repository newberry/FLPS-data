   <p>The Jewish workers of Chicago are not as close to the relief work as are their brethren in the East. The reason is that in Chicago, the United Relief rests in hands in which the race has no faith. Should the relief be segregated from the West Side Auxiliary, it would be certain that its influence on the Jewish life would be greater and the work more fruitful. At present the People's Relief is suffering from the sins of the West Side Auxiliary, which is closely related to the very reactionary elements of Jewry.</p>
   <p>The name, Joint Relief, was not often used by those creatures, whose association with Judaism and Jewish idealogy is only based upon how much they can utilize it for their political careers.</p>
   <p>We remember the relief convention, where all committees went prepared in advance, in accordance with the command from the reactionary element. At that time, it proved that the officials and the employees of the Joint Relief office are completely under the influence of the Halsted street politicians.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_7_1439.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Although one may be of the opinion that it is a thing of the past and that now the Joint Relief office is an impartial institution, the events of the last few days have proved that its policies remain unaltered.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the representatives of the People's Relief and especially the volunteer workers to free the relief from politics.</p>
