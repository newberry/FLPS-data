   <p>Samuel Phillipson donates $3,000.00 to Jewish Home for the Aged.</p>
   <p>Chicago's West Side merchant prince and philanthropist donates $3,000 to build a new dining room to the Jewish Home for the Aged. Preparations are being made for the laying of the corner-stone to the new annex to this Home for Aged, next Sunday afternoon.</p>
   <p>The Hon. Samuel Phillipson of the well known firm, Samuel Phillipson and Co., corner, 12th St. and Johnson, made known at a directors meeting of the Home, that he would donate a sum large enough to build a new dining room, to add to the comfort of the old people in the Home. It is, as a result of the superintendent Dr. Switon's ideas to secure donations, that the Home was able to build this annex. He appealed to Mr. Phillipson for help and Mr. Phillipson promptly responded with $3,000 for the cause.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Margolis, the president of the Home for the Aged, will open the ceremony <pb facs="5423972_7_0054.jpg" n="2"/>of laying the corner stone. The other speakers on this occasion are as follows: B. Baumgarden, chairman of the committee; A. S. Roe, chairman, of the cornerstone committee; Rabbi Fisher of "Ahvas Achim," Yudelson, Stoltz, and Israel Koven.</p>
   <p>The ex-congressman and well known auctioneer, S. Winternitz, will auction off the bricks which go into the corner stone. The privilege of having their names inscribed in a "Magilla" (scroll) which will be placed in a stone box, will be given to any one donating $500.00 or more. All who donate $25.00 or more will have their names written in "Sefer Hachaim" (Book of Life). All who donate less than $25.00 will have their names written on the records of the Building Committee.</p>
   <p>The Corner-stone Committee consists of the following well known gentlemen: A. S. Roe, Chairman, H. A. Lipoky, Sec'y., and Driectors Blonder, Epstein, Davis, Wiesberg, Lonsky, Frank and Schieff.</p>
