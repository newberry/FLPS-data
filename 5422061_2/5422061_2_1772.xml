   <p>A few weeks have passed since--terribly unhappy days for Hungarians--the Rumanian hordes in Nagyjarad cruelly attacked Hungarian residents. They killed and wounded many of the unprotected Hungarian population. All this happened while the Rumanian soldiers and police were present, who instead of putting a stop to the massacre laid their guns at their feet and watched the gruesome spectacle with amusement.</p>
   <p>Any individual endowed with humane feelings must cry out with pain and with clenched fists demand retaliation.</p>
   <p>And we Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity have done nothing yet. We are standing by idly, with folded hands, as if it didn't interest us, as if we weren't at all concerned.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1773.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are more than forty thousand Hungarians in and around Chicago, and we must admit shamefacedly that we didn't even hold a meeting protesting such barbarous treatment of our brethren. Not once did we call the attention of the public and all National groups to this unheard of, terrible, hair-raising attack against the Hungarians and civilization in general. And yet this was our opportunity to show the people of the world the injustice done to our mother country when the most beautiful parts of Hungary were given to a semi-wild, brigand country. [Translators note.--The Treaty of Trianon gave Rumania a large part of Hungary, including all of Transylvania, after the World War.]</p>
   <p>Where are the numerous societies? Where are the bulwarks of the American-Hungarians, the churches and their pastors? Why don't they toll the Hungarian bells in their belfries?.... They should toll these bells loud enough to be heard in Washington. In the interests of our mother country, Hungarians should unite in one body, regardless of religious belief.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1774.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is advisable that the church and society leaders call a meeting to prepare plans for a gigantic, protest mass meeting in a central location of the city.</p>
   <p>Onward Hungarians! Do something for your mother country. Gather in large numbers for a protest mass meeting in order that your voices may be heard in the proper places in behalf of the country of our birth.</p>
