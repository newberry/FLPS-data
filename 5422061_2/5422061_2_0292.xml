   <p>Last Saturday the Hungarian branch of the Industrial Workers of the World held a successful theatrical performance and dance at the Wage Earners Home, 1961 North Halsted Street. This was the first theatrical evening of the season. On this occasion all the performers excelled in their roles, which was highly appreciated by the audience, the more so as the play was taken from real life [Translator's Note: The article does not mention the name of the play, or the nature of its plot]. The performers very often made the audience laugh and then again to cry. Everybody had an instructive and enjoyable evening, even the youth, who danced until early in the morning the Csardas and other dances to the music of the gypsy band of Pista Kardos.</p>
   <p>Those supporting this organization will have more such surprises during the course of this winter, since the organization is trying to improve its performances as the season progresses. This is the reason why a movement is afoot to reorganize the Modern Theatrical Circle, and why an appeal has been made to all those who, in the interest of promoting the workers' movement, should be willing <pb facs="5422061_2_0293.jpg" n="2"/>to do their part. Those wishing to help this movement should come to the Theatrical Circle Evenings, held every Wednesday evening at the Wage Earners Home.</p>
