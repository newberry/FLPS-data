   <p>The Chicago and district sick benefit lodges finally held a convention last Sunday. This convention was supposed to have been held several weeks previously, but due to the extreme cold weather and heavy snowfall at that time the convention was postponed.</p>
   <p>The convention was held in the West Pullman community house and practically every lodge and sick benefit association in the Chicago district was represented.</p>
   <p>Many problems were discussed but foremost was the problem of attaining members to the different organizations because there has been such a heavy loss in memberships in the past year.</p>
