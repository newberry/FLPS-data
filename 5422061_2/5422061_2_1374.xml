  <body>
   <p>It is my duty to give an account of my experience at the Buffalo National Conference to the readers of the Magyar Tribune.</p>
   <p>The publisher of the Magyar Tribune appointed me to represent the paper, and I felt that this appointment meant that I was also representing its readers. Besides representing the Magyar Tribune, I was the appointed delegate of the Sasfeszek [Eagle's Nest, a Chicago social club] and the United Hungarian Jews of America.</p>
   <p>Without the usual exaggeration, the Buffalo National Conference was a great demonstration of the American-Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The close-to-a-thousand American-Hungarians who gathered there did not make an <pb facs="5422061_2_1375.jpg" n="2"/>impression on me with their number. What impressed me was their seriousness, their mental capacity. In this respect the convention far surpassed other American-Hungarian meetings. I believe it would have done credit to any national group.....</p>
   <p>Great human feelings and great human conceptions encountered each other there. And in these encounters, the best, the most beautiful, the most just aims were victorious.</p>
   <p>The influence of three great factions was felt--that of the conservative element led by the clergy; the liberals, in the center, represented by the press; and the Socialist-Democrats, represented by agents of the radical group.</p>
   <p>We went to the Conference to create and bring results, not to fight or make speeches.....We did not waste time in day dreams, but came off our high horse and made our bargain with reality and facts.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1376.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We were in accord--regardless of sex, age, religion, and political differences--on the question of aiding from America the movement for the revision of the peace treaty of Trianon. And now the American citizens of Hungarian origin stand as a body behind the best friend of the Hungarian people, Lord Rothermere, and will give their moral and financial support to the revisionist movement. The American-Hungarian press, the clergy, and the Hungarians belonging to different political factions are welded into a unit--all united for revision.....</p>
   <p>Not that the revision of the Trianon treaty is the only problem that draws together our leaders and people at Buffalo. The educational development of the Hungarians living in America must forge ahead. Provision will be made for the care of our orphans and the aged; for a Hungarian education for our children; for a solution of the weighty problems that overburden our struggling Hungarian theaters. Steps will be taken to bring about a consolidation of our large organizations.</p>
   <p>At last the American-Hungarians will have a forum of their own under the name <pb facs="5422061_2_1377.jpg" n="4"/>of National Federation of American-Hungarians and with the motto of "Justice for Hungary and peace to the world". This federation will represent us officially and rightfully, so that in the future no uninvited, self-appointed intercessor will be able to speak for us and sell us out.....</p>
   <p>Besides these positive results, we reached some negative ones also.</p>
   <p>There was no one to disturb the public conference or the committee meetings. Every word that was uttered was respectful and sober.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the Conference did not send any greetings to Nicholas Horthy, Hungary's regent, or to the Hungarian government. The Hungarian government sent no representative to the Buffalo National Conference.</p>
   <p>This was a conference of independent Hungarians who did not have to be hypocrital to show their patriotism, loyalty, and solidarity. What we did in the <pb facs="5422061_2_1378.jpg" n="5"/>interests of the liberation of the Hungarian people and for the resurrection of Hungarian justice shows clearly to the world what we never for a moment disowned our poor mother country.</p>
   <p>The Conference sent greetings by wire to President Hoover, to the Hungarian Parliament, and to Lord Rothermere, the benefactor of the Hungarian people.....</p>
