   <p>Before this sports meet started, however, a national Hungarian American Athletic Association was formed. The purpose of this organization will be to develop and promote athletic organizations in different cities. It will also promote athletic events to bring the different athletic organizations together.</p>
   <p>Election of officers was held and the following were elected: Dr. Endre Csarna, who is editor in chief of the Hungarian newspaper "Szabodsag," was elected president; Bela M. Mark, editor of the Hungarian ladie's paper became vice-president; Joseph Rothy, post editor of the Hungarian paper "The Free Speech," elected secretary and Frank Foldy from Chicago, corresponding secretary. There were two men from Chicago elected for the managing committee.</p>
   <p>This meet was won by the athletes who represented Chicago. Chicago Hungarians should feel proud of these men especially of Frank Foldy who was the outstanding hero of this Athletic meet.</p>
