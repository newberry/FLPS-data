   <p>The proverb, "That every man is the fabrication of his own success," is very true, and can be applied to Frank Zurik, our compatriot. We learned that although he started out as a printer, he has now become an artist.</p>
   <p>A short while before the World War, he came to the United States from upper Hungary, and as a printer, he started to earn his livelihood. For quite a long time, he was employed in our plant. Frank Zurik is not the type of the average young man who uses his spare time in a wasteful manner. He worked during the day, and at night and other spare hours he would busy himself with art work in order to become an artist. Now he has mastered it, and has become successful. We learned that beginning with April 1, he is to work for the Museum's Artist class. We are happy to learn of this, in fact, we wish to offer him our congratulations, and wish him luck in his new adventure. We only ask him to put forth all his effort in order that his art will bring glory to the Hungarians.</p>
