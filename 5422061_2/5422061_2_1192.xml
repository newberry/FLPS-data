   <p>Honorable Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, and Chairman of the National Council of Defense, in his letter addressed to President Wilson, summarized with great appreciation the different work done by the different state councils for successful continuation of the War. The Secretary of War gives account of the work of the various state councils, the activity also which was rendered to the organization of the foreign born. The Secretary of War in his letter stated word for word, the following.</p>
   <p>"In states with a considerable population of foreign origin, the State Councils of Defense are important in the work of organization establishing war information bureaus correlating existing organization agencies, increasing as far as possible the educational facilities, available to the foreign born and seeing that such facilities are used.</p>
   <p>The President of the United States, Mr. Wilson, replied to this letter, written about the work of the State Councils, to Mr. Baker, the Secretary <pb facs="5422061_2_1193.jpg" n="2"/>of War and Chairman of the National State Councils, a praising letter in which we can read among others the following lines:</p>
   <p>"I have read with great interest your account of the achievements of the State Councils of Defense and your general summary of the activities in which they are now engaged. It is a notable record and I shall be glad to have you express to the State Councils of Defense my appreciation of the service they so usefully render."</p>
   <p>We are not simply taking notice of the appreciation, out we add to it our appreciation and gratitude, who have to thank the State Council of Defense of Illinois, that the impossible dream is fulfilled. At the present time the Hungarians of the State of Illinois, irrespective of the unimportant personal quarrels are totally united to work for this country, the victory of which, over its enemies, we want to promote with words and deeds, because we are convinced that the victory of this country serves to the advantages of the entire human race, because we <pb facs="5422061_2_1194.jpg" n="3"/>believe that only by victory of this country can the monster of militarism be defeated, which regardless of consequences inflamed the whole world.</p>
   <p>We Hungarians as evidence state that the State Councils were in many ways entitled to the appreciation of the President and Secretary of State, because we are the living example that the State Council of Illinois did useful educational work among us and for us.</p>
