   <p>A new Hungarian weekly was released from the press in the last few weeks in Chicago, which to judge by the first four numbers is really a first-class product, both in form and in content. Its editors are Frank J. Kovach--who is known by the Hungarians of all America as Radio Kovach and is the director of the Hungarian radio hour at Gary--and Leslie Szegedy, a noted Hungarian publicist, who in his time was the editor of the Nemzet in Budapest, a weekly containing articles from the pens of none but Hungary's best writers. Not only does Radio present articles which are connected with the radio, but one can find in it other articles of all kinds, some with educational value and others entertaining. It has no political tendencies whatever; it does not allow in its pages any kind of personal controversy to appear; so it gives every sign of becoming in the near future the most widely read weekly newspaper in the Hungarian language, with the biggest circulation, since its content interests not only the Hungarians in Chicago but also the Hungarians all over America, even far away from Chicago. The subscription price is one dollar per year.</p>
