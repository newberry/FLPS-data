   <p>The Hungarian immigration problem is a rather new problem. Hardly fifty years have passed since Hungarian immigration has been of any consequence at all. During the years directly preceding the World War, Hungarian immigration quota reached its height. Immediately after the World War, emigration from Hungary to the United States reached its peak again, but laws were enacted and quotas were set, which lessened the immigration work somewhat. The immigration laws of 1924 lowered the Hungarian quota to a minimum.</p>
   <p>When we speak of Hungarian-Americans, we must divide them into two groups; namely, those who immigrated before the War, and those who immigrated after the War. There is a great difference between the so-called old <pb facs="5422061_2_1607.jpg" n="2"/>Hungarian-American and the new Hungarian-American. We find such a great difference between these two classes that it almost seems incredible. The first Hungarian immigration was caused by political activities in Hungary. So we can regard those immigrants who came to this country fifty or sixty years ago as political refugees. During the ten years previous to the War, economic conditions caused emigration from Hungary in large numbers, and naturally these immigrants were those who were hardest hit by economic conditions. During the ten years previous to the War, the immigrants from Hungary were the ordinary tillers of the soil, the peasant type, those who were accustomed to hard work, and these came in great numbers.</p>
   <p>We are now speaking of proven facts that after the World War the large majority of emigrants from Hungary were the better educated class in comparison to those who came previous to the War.</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that the old immigrated Hungarian-Americans were <pb facs="5422061_2_1608.jpg" n="3"/>tillers of the soil in the old country, upon their arrival here, they sought the faster moving and easier jobs in the factories. We will find very few Hungarian immigrants on farms. Naturally, the larger majority of them have settled in and around manufacturing centers, in certain industries such as: iron, steel, and in cotton mills where some are excellent workers.</p>
   <p>The old Hungarian-Americans were very slow in Americanizing themselves, quite unlike those who arrived in the more recent years. In some instances, we can still find the same Hungarian life existing in Hungarian societies which existed previous to the War, although the social life of the Hungarian-Americans has slowly changed. If we would study the different Hungarian communities in the United States, we would find non-sectarian sick benefit, religious, and theatrical societies, but among them we would note that the older immigrated Hungarians have very few <pb facs="5422061_2_1609.jpg" n="4"/>representatives in these societies. They have been replaced by those immigrants who arrived in this country more recently, and those who possess the will and ability to share the worries and cares of organizational work. They have become tireless workers, because most of these people work hard during the day, and devote their spare time to work for the common interest of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The old Hungarian societies which were originally organized to create jobs of a common interest are still in existence. In considering the number of new and old immigrants and their activities, there is no comparison. The newly arrived immigrants are instilling new blood and new strength into the veins of the social life of the Hungarian-Americans, while the old immigrant is satisfied with his present state.</p>
   <p>Another fact which should be given attention concerns those immigrants who <pb facs="5422061_2_1610.jpg" n="5"/>were very slow in becoming Americanized. They remained pure Hungarians for a long while after arriving here, and many could not speak the English language. It was seldom that one could meet a native Hungarian who could speak the English language fluently.</p>
   <p>Today, we find that immigrants who have arrived in this country a few months ago able to speak English fairly well. We are certain that within a very short time these people will be able to speak English very well.</p>
   <p>Since the World War, immigration laws have been enacted with many restrictions. Very often it is necessary for those who have made known their intention to come to this country to remain in the old country for two or three months longer, and during this time, they decided to learn the English language. After being in the United States for one or two years, it would not be unusual to see these immigrants reading English newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1611.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is interesting to note the ease with which these Hungarian immigrants adopt the customs and habits of this new land, while the old Hungarian immigrants took decades to change, or never adapted themselves to American society. The new Hungarian immigrant has found it much easier to break into the social life of the American people.</p>
   <p>There was a very good article in the New York Times on October 26, 1924 whose title was "Hungarians Be Upon Us," with the sub-title: "Budapest, Like Moscow and Berlin, Undertakes to Monopolize the New York Stage." This article deals with the activities of Hungarian-American Theatrical companies which have presented plays on the stages of fourteen theatres of Broadway.</p>
