   <p>In the Youngstown Amerikai Magyar Hirlap (American-Hungarian Journal), an interesting item appeared which concerns not only Youngstown Hungarians, but Hungarians all over America. Chicago Hungarians, too, must take notice, because there are many unemployed Hungarians here.</p>
   <p>"In certain cities a fund was created for the aid of families of the unemployed. Food, fuel, clothing, and shoes are provided during the winter for those who apply for aid.</p>
   <p>"Those Hungarian unemployed who have not been in this country five years and therefore are not naturalized, must exert great caution if they are in need of aid. Under no circumstances must they ask for city aid, because it can easily happen that although relief will be given, deportation proceedings may be instituted against them on the grounds that they have become public charges within five years of their arrival. If, in cases like these, <pb facs="5422061_2_1031.jpg" n="2"/>deportation proceedings have been instituted, it is difficult, even impossible, to save them from deportation.</p>
   <p>"In these crucial times, it would be well for the Hungarian churches and organizations in every Hungarian colony to consider it their duty to provide a fund for the aid of their fellow countrymen who cannot apply for county, state, or city aid without danger of deportation."</p>
