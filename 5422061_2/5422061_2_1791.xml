   <p>The world's most renowned scientists have tried to find ways and means by which luck may be changed, but all this [effort] has been without result. So it might be with a soap manufacturer--he may make the finest soap in the world, but he would be unable to make a soap which would cleanse the faces of those who belong to the army of Horthy.</p>
   <p>An organization whose life has been filled with trials and tribulations, whose history is fascinating, the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society has taken it upon themselves to attempt the impossible; the cleansing of these ungrateful ones. At their meeting we waited for them to vote to have a banquet in honor of those decorated Hungarians belonging to the Horthy machine in Chicago. Another Hungarian organization had already volunteered to sponsor this banquet; this Hungarian organization <pb facs="5422061_2_1792.jpg" n="2"/>advertises itself as the oldest and most patriotic Hungarian organization in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A few of the paid friends of Horthy volunteered to sponsor the banquet in honor of their puppet king and his decorated warriors. In this respect they beat the Song Society. At the last meeting of the Song Society the committee in charge of the program of this banquet made its appearance and extended an invitation to the members of the Song Society. This invitation was enthusiastically accepted.</p>
   <p>The most beautiful feature of this meeting appeared when one of the members who is in the business of sending money from the United States to Hungary, and it is therefore essential that he remain in the good graces of Horthy, recommended that the Magyar Tribune be repudiated and ignored by the Song Society. This was uttered by a man who for years has made a living by virtue of the Hungarian press. He is a Hungarian-Jewish man whose people were slain by Horthy and his henchmen. This is the pusillanimous type <pb facs="5422061_2_1793.jpg" n="3"/>of person who is fighting for the cross-bearers of Horthy.</p>
   <p>In the first place it is amazing to know that an organization whose membership is Jewish, whose people have been driven out of Hungary by the Horthy bandits, accepts an invitation to honor the very people who whole-heartedly support the Horthy flag. In the second place it is amazing to know that the members of this organization, intelligent and learned people, allow certain individuals to use this cultural organization as a tool in the effort to cleanse these unworthy Hungarians. The Song Society injured its own standing when they decided to bar the Magyar Tribune.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune wrote truthfully in the past and will continue to do so in the future. The Song Society has been supported by good patriotic Hungarian Jews. We do not believe that these people will support an organization in the future which is a nest of Horthy intrigue.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1794.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>To show how much reason the Jewish people have for concern, it is unnecessary to mention the wholesale murders, the property confiscations the suppression of the Horthy puppets. We will examine one of the latest shameful deeds of these bandits.</p>
   <p>Oscar Beregi, one of the foremost Hungarian actors, is planning a tour of the United States this fall. He had been invited to attend a song festival in Budapest, which was sponsored by the Hungarian Actors Society. His appearance was made impossible by the Horthy government for the simple reason that he was of Jewish descent.</p>
   <p>In art, religion or nationality means nothing. We are not applying this to the patriotic Hungarian-Jewish population alone, but to the entire Hungarian population of Chicago. We believe that they should ignore all organizations who are in favor of Horthy activities, or support celebrations in honor of the Horthy cross-bearers.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1795.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Horthy bandits are not passing out any more crosses of distinction, so they are using the priests and ministers who are in constant contact with the people to spread their propaganda.</p>
   <p>Hungarian Americans! We want your attention. It won't be long before all reformed ministers will be made bishops. They have even promised to make a Cardinal out of the Burnside Hungarian-Catholic priest, Stephen Soltesz. The hand of Horthy has even reached into Rome. And you Hungarian Americans honor him with banquets and other celebrations.</p>
   <p>Why don't you ask your priests and ministers their reasons for accepting these honorary distinctions? Ask them why they signed a petition in your name, demanding that Mihaly Karolvi be deported as a menace to the American people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1796.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Hungarian Americans! Is this the reason our forefathers died, so that we might honor the people who are gradually killing our nation?</p>
