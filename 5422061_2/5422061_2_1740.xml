   <p>Two weeks ago a cablegram was circulated around the world to the effect that Dr. Emil Schreiner and his wife had been shot to death in Banfalva, Sopron County, Hungary, while riding in their automobile. Dr. Schreiner was a retired consul-general, formerly Hungarian Consul in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the course of the investigation, it was found that Antal Haner, a young brick-layer, was the murderer. The cablegram went on to say that Hungarian villagers hate automobiles so much that this was the direct cause of the killing.</p>
   <p>We were so upset and resentful about this case that we thought it best not to write about it until we had read the Budapest newspapers' version of the tragedy.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1741.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Chicago Hungarians blushed for shame before our American friends when the American press reported this affair. Our only defense was the hope that this was an isolated case or that it was an accident or personal vengeance.....</p>
   <p>The arrival of newspapers from Budapest confirms the original news in the cablegram. They add that two years ago, at the same place, someone fired a shot at another automobile.</p>
   <p>We remember that last year there was a case in which a physician, racing to the bedside of a seriously sick patient and not making way for an ox cart was beaten to death by a mob of angry peasants.</p>
   <p>A policeman in Budapest drew his sword and wounded the driver of an automobile for not obeying a minor traffic regulation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1742.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Looking at these events from here, it seems that the rural Hungarian people are still living in the darkness of the past centuries and view the automobile as dangerous black magic.</p>
   <p>The automobile has become a necessity to all classes of people here in America. Its manufacture provides the daily bread for a great many people. To try to kill, to hate, and persecute this most important invention of the twentieth century is as much as to hide oneself in a dark cellar, terrified by progress, detesting the rapidly developing technical civilization, and wishing to be back in the Middle Ages, jogging along in an ox cart.....</p>
   <p>Sopron County suffered great losses on account of the peace treaty of Trianon. The city of Sopron became part of Burgenland, Austria, and it was a virtual death blow. Its people made their living by hauling with teams before the advent of automobiles. The poor teamsters couldn't buy motorized vehicles.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1743.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The poor Hungarian peasant was harrassed on three sides--Trianon, the twentieth century civilization, and the terrible economic situation. The Hungarian peasants, therefore, hate everybody and everything that caused their poverty, primarily the gentry and secondly the automobiles, which are the instruments of the ease and wealth of the gentry.....</p>
