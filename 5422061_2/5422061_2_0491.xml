   <p>My table is all covered with newspapers. Some of them are newspapers from the old country which arrived this week; some again are the American Hungarian newspapers. Involuntarily,I reach first for the American Hungarian papers, and as I look them over, I am surprised to see how clever their editors are in their work of advertising. Almost all the newspapers are full of good wishes for this Christmas and New Years occasions, and if these good wishes all could be realized, the Hungarians would be the happiest folk in this country of ours.</p>
   <p>So reading these advertisements, I remember way back in old Hungary those newspapers of the Yule-tide. I recall the arrival of those newspapers in my town, the fifth biggest town in old Hungary, on the fast train, arriving at about 2 P.M. The local newspaper agency was at such times besieged by <pb facs="5422061_2_0492.jpg" n="2"/>the would-be readers, who were almost fighting with each other for those papers. It was worthwhile, because there were many good and interesting things in those papers to read, not only advertisements. As I now turn over the leaves of the American Hungarian papers, to my sorrow, I am unable to find something worthwhile in them besides the advertisements of the distilleries , breweries, the undertakers, and the New Years Greetings of those politicians, who are preparing for the elections.</p>
