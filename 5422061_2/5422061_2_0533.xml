   <p>Two outstanding pieces of news concerning Magyars in America claimed our attention last week. Both events concerned the two largest Hungarian daily newspapers in America.</p>
   <p>The first news was about the Szabadsag (Liberty), a daily with national circulation, published in Cleveland, Ohio. The owners of Szabadsag have bought the Waechter Und Anzeiger, a German newspaper, and are moving the former into the plant of the German paper. This new investment gave a clear picture of the Szabadsag's financial condition, and shows that the owners are progressive and have business acumen.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0534.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The other news came to us from New York. The Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja (American Hungarian Peoples Voice), also a daily with nation-wide circulation, had been having financial difficulties recently. After trying all means of saving the paper, nothing remained but to sell it to M. F. Wegrzynek, owner of Novi Swiat, a Polish daily. For fifty thousand dollars the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja has come under the unrestricted control of a Pole, Mr. Wegrzynek.</p>
   <p>From the Hungarian point of view, we cannot be indifferent to this change, but let us look at it from the point of view of business. Strength overcomes weakness. "The fittest will survive," says Darwin, the scientist. Foreign newspapers have been condemned to a slow death and stagnation since the World War and since the restriction of immigration. The owners of the Szabadsag and the Novi Swiat are fighting extinction by fusion. By cutting down publishing expenses, the business will be put on a firmer foundation. This fusion will probably save the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja, too, from extinction.....</p>
   <p>The Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja in its thirty years of existence was always <pb facs="5422061_2_0535.jpg" n="3"/>motivated by considerations of profit. The result was that it could get no one to provide the necessary fifty thousand dollars--not even the Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>Many people are surprised that the Hungarian government allowed this paper, their official mouthpiece in the United States, to become the property of Poles. We were not surprised at the action of the Hungarian government..... The Hungarian government will not pay fifty thousand dollars even for propaganda.</p>
   <p>From time to time the majority of American-Hungarians were irritated by the stupid tendency of the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja to become subservient to the Bethlen-Horthy reactionary regime. Its editorials were full of praise for the policies of the Hungarian government. It was disgraceful to do such a thing in this liberal, democratic country.....</p>
   <p>The Hungarian government would have made a serious mistake if it had purchased <pb facs="5422061_2_0536.jpg" n="4"/>the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja..... It is not necessary in a case like this for a government to buy a newspaper; it is only necessary to give the paper financial aid until that government's aims are realized.....</p>
   <p>These financial difficulties of our Hungarian newspapers should serve as a lesson for the future. Those that follow the example of the Szabadsag are progressive, and those that stubbornly swim against the current will eventually meet the sorry fate of the Amerikai Magyar Nepszaja.</p>
