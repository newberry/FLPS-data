   <p>The Hungarian Theatrical Association presented three 3-act plays on three different occasions in Chicago recently. The first play was presented on April 30, entitled "The Typhoon," which was written by Menyhert Lengel. This play has never been presented by anyone in Chicago. It has a very interesting plot, and has to do with the life of Japanese youth.</p>
   <p>On May 1, this theatrical association presented a gay Hungarian play, "The Gypsy Primate". This play does not need any explanation, as it is one of the foremost Hungarian plays. It is full of gay gypsy music, and Hungarian dancing.</p>
   <p>On May 2, the organization again presented a play, "The King of Affection." This was a real surprise to Chicago Hungarians, not only because the performance <pb facs="5422061_2_0225.jpg" n="2"/>of this play was so superb, but because it shows that Hungarians have given considerable thought to the more modern type of theatrical plays. This play was written very recently by George Martorfalvy, who is choirmaster of this organization.</p>
