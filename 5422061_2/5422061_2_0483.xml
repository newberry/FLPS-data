   <p>In Chicago there are many Hungarian parents whose children are growing up without learning to read and write Hungarian, and without being taught about the history of Hungary.</p>
   <p>There are many smaller Hungarian communities in the United States where practically all children of school age can read, write and speak fluently in Hungarian.</p>
   <p>Not only those parents who expect to go back to Hungary after the war, but also those who are to stay in this country feel it their duty to provide their children with the Hungarian education which the Hungarian Summer School offers.</p>
   <p>Among the Chicago Hungarians the development of Hungarian schools has been very slow. There is a very small percentage of children who can boast of any Hungarian education. The slow development of the Hungarian schools was caused by certain occurences which we will not enumerate here, but we do know that the parents want to eliminate these causes, in order that their children may enjoy the same privileges of Hungarian education as the children of other communities enjoy.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0484.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We,therefore,want to call the attention of those Hungarian parents who are interested in the education of their children to the fact that the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Church is to organize a Hungarian Summer School. Although this church had a small Hungarian class last summer,the idea was not fully developed and the school was conducted on a small scale only. Classes were held daily in the school of the West Side Hungarian Church from the first of July till the month of September. The attendance was about fifty pupils, consisting mostly of children from the immediate vicinity of the church. Many of these children could hardly speak Hungarian, but when examinations were held, which were open to the public, these children read and wrote fluently.</p>
   <p>On July the first the Hungarian school will reopen on the West Side and we feel sure that the attendance will be much larger than it was last year. The West Side congregation does not feel satisfied that this opportunity is available to the children on the West Side alone, but they are going to see to it that the children living on the North Side of Chicago are given the same opportunities; therefore,the church will sponsor a daily Hungarian school on the North Side also. Due to the fact that we would like to locate this school centrally,we would like to have the list of names and addresses of those children who wish to attend.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0485.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Therefore, we ask the Hungarian parents living on the North Side, who wish to have their children attend this Hungarian school to get in touch with Rev. Endre Sebestyen so that arrangements can be completed.</p>
   <p>In this Hungarian school there will be no creed distinction. We welcome every Hungarian child to attend the Hungarian school.</p>
   <p>Signed, Rev. Endre Sebestyen,</p>
