   <p>A most impressive page was written in the history of the Chicago Hungarians last Sunday afternoon. For the past few weeks men have been working hard, and to the amazement of many they made it possible for the cornerstone of the rapidly growing, palatial Hungarian Home to be laid. This beautiful building will be a magnet to the South Side Hungarians where this Home will open a new cultural era to them.</p>
   <p>Representative Hungarians were present from all parts of the city. There were leading political figures of the city of Chicago present also. These American politicians admitted that this building was truly a great example of the cooperation that exists among the Hungarian people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The editorial staff of this newspaper has often said that if the Hungarian people of Chicago can show that they can do something notable they will be recognized <pb facs="5422061_2_0962.jpg" n="2"/>in political circles, and now our prediction has come true. At the celebration last Sunday these outstanding American people recognized the creative abilities of the Hungarian people.</p>
   <p>Mayor Dever and Senator Deneen both made speeches. President John Kovacs of the Virgin Mary Society read a short history of the Society which was placed in the cornerstone.</p>
   <p>There were many other interesting speeches made. Charles Hatvary, the great Hungarian tenor of Chicago, sang several Hungarian songs as part of the program.</p>
