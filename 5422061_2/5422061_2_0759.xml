   <p>Herzl Hall--again Herzl Hall, May 17! The jubilee festival of the Tarsalgo on the occasion of the forty-fifth anniversary of its foundation! My, how many were there! The whole building was full of gay, excited Hungarians. Frank Kalman announced the numbers of the program with great skill and humor, which helped a great deal to make the program of the festival a success.</p>
   <p>The overture was played by the gypsies; after that Miss Jolanka Horkay, the singer beloved by the public of Chicago, sang the American national anthem, and then together with the audience she sang the Hungarian Hymn; and John Balazs, the president of the Tarsalgo, greeted us in a few words. He was followed by Paul Timko, who has often been president in the past, and who now delivered a very effective festal speech. After these serious-minded speeches it was refreshing to hear the songs rendered by Miss Adrienne Szegedy, who, it seems, has already conquered the hearts of the Hungarians of Chicago, for the mere mention of her name brought forth tumultuous applause.</p>

   <p>After this followed the solemn ceremony of the dedication of the new Hungarian flag received from Hungary. There were speeches galore; it would be hard to judge which was the best. In what awed silence did we look and listen to the beautiful ceremony! After it was over, Royal Hungarian Consul Ladislas Medgyessy delivered a speech containing a greeting from the old country, which was followed by Miss Jolan Horkay on the stage, where she again demonstrated that she deserves all the applause that she receives. Between the speeches of John Kovacs and John Wolf a little golden doll, the six-year-old daughter Betty Lou of Mrs. Louis Nemeth, entertained the public with her graceful dance and sweet songs. Miss Irene Sinko recited some poems with great success. But there was also the Dancing Group of the Chicago Junior and Amateur Club! It was an agreeable, unforgettable evening for us all.....Michael Gutyan Junior, the vice-president, delivered the final address after which the dancing began, continuing into the small hours.</p>
