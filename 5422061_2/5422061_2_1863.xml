   <p>Quite a few of our readers want to know where we get the idea that American public opinion ridicules the King's restoration plans of Hungary, asking whether there is any truth in the reports that Hungary is planning to restore the monarchy.</p>
   <p>We have received the information from reliable sources, and it is not our invention. That the present Hungarian leaders want to restore the kingdom was Count Szechenyi's assertion when he was interviewed by the New York World. He is quoted as saying that the plan will be suspended for a while, until peace will be restored and Hungary becomes prosperous.</p>
   <p>Besides, to prove that we are right, let us quote a cable from Hungary, published in the Chicago Tribune. It says: "Admiral Horthy, the governor, adjourned the National Assembly for an indefinite time on account of the continual quarrels over the question of restoration of the Hapsburg Dynasty. All political factions agree that the question of the throne <pb facs="5422061_2_1864.jpg" n="2"/>of Hungary is entirely a home affair. Naturally if it is impossible to come to a decision on this question, Governor Horthy will have to turn to the people of the country, dissolving the National Assembly and ordering new elections."</p>
   <p>This is the interesting and important cable over which the Chicago Tribune put the following heading: "Hungarians Worried Over a King to Rule Them."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune thinks it is funny that the Hungarian National Assembly have to argue and fight over the king who should rule over them.</p>
   <p>As we said before, the National Assembly has become the laughing-stock of the world because, instead of trying to remedy the pitiful situation of the country, the legislators and representatives of the Hungarian people are wasting their time on the question of putting Charles Hapsburg back on the throne. It seems this is their only task; or perhaps they don't know anything else, for when the National Assembly make a law, <pb facs="5422061_2_1865.jpg" n="3"/>it is useless or at best an echo of the rack and stick punishment of the Middle Ages. Hence, it is much better that instead of making laws, the legislators play, debate and make long orations over insignificant matters.</p>
   <p>Looking back at the old pre-war days we can see that the members of the Hungarian Parliament are very fond of arguing and fighting over nothing, it was just their "hobby."</p>
   <p>Everybody remembers the big commotion in the political circles of Hungary when Franz Ferdinand was proclaimed Crown Prince. For months after the event, the subject of the disputes was who would be the crown prince of Hungary after Franz Ferdinand's death. When he married the Bohemian Countess, they wasted still more time in debates as to whether or not the children from this morganatic marriage would have a right to the Hungarian throne, according to the law, of the Hapsburg House.</p>
   <p>Our best lawyers, such as Desider Szilagyi, Geza Polonyi, Soma Visontay, <pb facs="5422061_2_1866.jpg" n="4"/>and a few others wrote whole essays on the matter and made long orations in Parliament to discuss the right of succession. What did the Magyar people gain by that? Nothing! A fanatic Serbian student solved the problem of succession with a bullet. Or when the members of Parliament wasted their time with the so-called Austro-Hungarian common law disputes, the Army's commanding language and the bill of the sword knot. Bills about flags and many other trifles of the common army caused long disputes. It can be said that the ten years prior to the War the Hungarian Parliament wasted most of their time in useless and worthless disputes. It is now that we know that the victories on the Russian and Italian battlefields were not brought about by the sword knot or by the flag. It would have been better if the legislators had occupied their minds with the problems of provisions, clothing, and sanitation of the army.</p>
   <p>The National Assembly worries about a matter which is the least harmful, but it cannot see the long oppressive fog which weighs heavily on the poor Hungarian people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1867.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Hungarian king question will be solved soon, not only by the Hungarians, but by the Allies and other small hostile countries encircling Hungary, which also claim the right of decision.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian National Assembly should direct their attention to more useful and serious things, such as winning sympathy for the Hungarian cause in foreign countries so that the poor Hungarian people may get rid of their worries and headaches. Because of all this waste of time by the National Assembly, the poor Hungarian people have to pay and suffer at the end.</p>
