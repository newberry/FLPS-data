   <p>Jeno Endrey, director of the Chicago People's Theatre, became an editor and publisher in August of last year. He published the Magyar Elet (Hungarian Life), a social, theatrical, and literary monthly magazine.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune printed this publication. It was an original, tasteful periodical.</p>
   <p>The last number was issued on January 15. After ten issues, the editor, Jeno Endrey, returned to directing and managing the Hungarian Theatrical Company.....</p>
   <p>We are not glad, rather we are sorry, that this publication is dead. This periodical was not our competitor. Those who are acquainted with the hardships of publishing Hungarian newspapers know that it is risky <pb facs="5422061_2_0566.jpg" n="2"/>business to start a new publication, because there can be but one outcome--failure.</p>
   <p>The general depression--the unemployment situation, which has cast a shadow over America--has made the solicitation of subscriptions and advertising difficult even for well-known, long-established Hungarian publications.</p>
   <p>The Americanization of our Hungarians and the restricted immigration quota are killing the future of Hungarian publications. The high cost of publishing, too, is a discouraging factor.</p>
   <p>Last but not least, there are so many Hungarian publications in Chicago, Cleveland, New York, and smaller cities that we can safely say that there is overproduction in this field.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0567.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the last twenty years a great many Hungarian publications became extinct, although talented writers and able businessmen exerted every effort to save them.</p>
   <p>For example, there was the Napsugar (Sunshine), with its editor, Julius Rudnyanszky, the poet and brilliant author. But this was only one of the many. One had a longer, the other a shorter span of life. They all bled to death, notwithstanding the fact that conditions were more favorable at that time.....</p>
   <p>If Endrey couldn't draw his conclusions from the unfortunate ventures of his predecessors, he learned a bitter lesson from his own career as an editor.</p>
   <p>We hasten to assure our readers that the retreat of Endrey from the field of journalism does not affect this newspaper in any way. The Magyar Tribune, <pb facs="5422061_2_0568.jpg" n="4"/>without boasting, has never had as many subscribers as in the last six months. This is the reward of our honest, struggling, and persevering efforts of fourteen years.</p>
   <p>We are grateful to our readers, our host of friends, the church and society leaders, and all the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>We solemnly promise that we will try to deserve their patronage in the future.</p>
