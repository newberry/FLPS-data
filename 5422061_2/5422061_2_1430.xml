   <p>Our West Side Church had a fraternal banquet at which the Burnside church members were present in a body. This fraternal gathering sent a cablegram of protest to the proper authorities relative to distressed conditions of our brethren in Jugo-Slavia. The cablegram was sent in the name of both churches.</p>
   <p>Christmas eve services were greatly enhanced by the violin solo of Bela Martay, virtuoso artist.</p>
