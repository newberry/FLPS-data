   <p>There was great rejoicing at the home of Charles Tittinger, February 7th, because newshad reached there that their son had been promoted to captain in the army. To make his promotion more colorful, he also married an American girl, which doubled the weight of the celebration.</p>
   <p>Young Tittinger was born in Hungary in 1892, and came to this country, settling in Chicago. He is twenty-five years old, and has been in the United States army for the past eight years. He received his commission on his twenty-fifth birthday. The Chicago Hungarians should feel proud of him.</p>
