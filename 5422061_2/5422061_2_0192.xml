  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian People's Theater has reached the end of its second season. This [organization]is something the Chicago Hungarian people can really be proud of. The culture of any group, land, or nation is judged by the number of schools, churches, hospitals, and theaters it possesses. The theater is a symbol of culture, and if there is a permanent theater in any locality, its presence shows that the people in that locality are anxious to acquire culture and that they are willing to learn.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian people have proven that they can successfully support a theatrical organization. This is demonstrated by the fact that Eugene Endrey has announced that he will again be director of this organization for the third year.</p>
   <p>We don't have to tell our readers what Endrey has done in the past two <pb facs="5422061_2_0193.jpg" n="2"/>years. Eugene Endrey has worked untiringly to make this favorite organization of the Chicago Hungarian public a successful enterprise. It is this Eugene Endrey who is celebrating his fifteenth anniversary as a stage director. Up to this time, he has worked to erect a strong edifice. He is now temporarily resting from his labors, now he has stopped but he will start again, and he will follow the path that fate has appointed for him.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian people have always been generous in honoring deserving people. And Endrey was honored by his co-workers and by practically every Hungarian-speaking person in Chicago on May 13, at a gigantic banquet given in his honor on the occasion of his fifteenth anniversary [as director].</p>
   <p>Ignatz Izsak was the honorary speaker of the evening, and he expressed the thanks of the Chicago Hungarian people to Endrey for his great devotion to the Hungarian people of this city.</p>
