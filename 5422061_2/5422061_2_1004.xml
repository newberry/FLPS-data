   <p>At the yearly Ides of March festival this year the Federation of the Chicago South Side Hungarian churches and societies contrary to its custom, did charge entrance fee for the benefit of those who suffered from the winter floods. The proceeds were intended to be handed over to the American Red Cross, but then appeared in our paper the descriptions of the sufferings of the Hungarian families in Harrisburg, Illinois, who also fell victims to that disaster. The Federation - very sensibly - sent the money, $115. directly to the afflicted Hungarian families. Just now came their receipt. It is only a short letter, but in it they express their deeply felt gratitude. They have had no time to seek for long sentences to express their gratitude. They have no rest; with the money they received, they build. They have to build anew almost everything. Here is their letter:</p>
   <p>Interest, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>From the South Side Federation of Chicago Hungarian-American churches and societies <pb facs="5422061_2_1005.jpg" n="2"/>in Chicago we received the amount of $115. which kindly publish in your paper, so all the Hungarians may see it. We are deeply grateful to you and the Chicago Hungarians</p>
   <p>With real Hungarian Friendly love,</p>
   <p>Address:</p>
   <p>406 W. People St. Harrisburg, Ill.</p>
   <p>Alexander Kiss.</p>
   <p>We received the money for the Hungarian flood victims. Please forgive me for this hasty writing, but am very much occupied just now.</p>
