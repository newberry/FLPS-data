<title level="a">THE ARRIVAL OF COUNTESS KAROLYI</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Countess Karolyi arrived in the United States last Sunday on the steamship George Washington. The boat arrived late in the evening, and the Countess was held aboard with the other passengers. There were other reasons besides the late arrival of the steamer which kept the Countess aboard. S. Stanwood Menken, president of the National Security League, has started deportation activities against Countess Karolyi, whom they have named "Red Katherine." Their grounds for deportation is a claim that she is a Bolshevik, and she will be a detriment to the principles of American government. Menken filed a complaint with H. Curran, Immigration Officer, stating that her presence was no more desirable than the presence of Emma Goldman, and her followers, who had recently been deported, therefore, her entrance to the United States must be stopped.</p>
   <p>The immigration authorities allowed Countess Karolyi to enter the United States <pb facs="5422061_2_1230.jpg" n="2"/>on Monday morning. The Menken activities were not stopped. Before the Countess arrived, Menken had asked the members of the reception committee if they knew their names were on the list by their own consent. Mrs. James W. Gerard, the wife of a prominent international figure, and a sister of the wife of Count Szigray, immediately telegraphed an answer to Menken's question, informing him that the committee had asked her two weeks previously to be one of the reception committee, and she told this committee that she wanted to withdraw when she found out who Countess Karolyi was. The same procedure was forwarded to Mrs. Elon Huntinton Hooker, and the committee received the same answer made by Mrs. Gerard.</p>
   <p>According to Dr. Stephen P. Duggan, president of the Institution of International Education, it was Hooker who questioned whether Countess Karolyi was a desirable visitor or not, and at first he said that his wife withdrew from the committee, and later denied that his wife was ever a member of this reception committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1231.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We must also mention the fact that through the efforts of Robert J. Caldwell, a member of the reception committee, the State Department had the New York City police department detail a special police escort for Countess Karolyi, after it was learned that she had received several threatening letters. We can expect many demonstrations from those who sent these threatening letters, and the Countess will be under guard during her entire stay in the United States.</p>
   <p>In the New York Times the following question was asked Countess Karolyi, by Menken: "Is it true that you are a communist, and that you are known as 'Katherine the Red' in Europe?"</p>
   <p>Laughing, the Countess replied: "My husband and I are Social Democrats, and this does not mean that we are Communists."</p>
   <p>This work of deportation, all the work of Horthy and Menken, is done to prove <pb facs="5422061_2_1232.jpg" n="4"/>Countess Karolyi's Communistic activities through articles which were written in a book by Cecil Tormay. This book was written for the sole purpose of glorifying the domination of the white terror, and is filled with falsehoods about communistic activities, and its aims are to prove the ties between Lenin, Bela Kun, and Countess Karolyi.</p>
   <p>Naturally, these facts which were written in this book concerning Countess Karolyi were not accepted as evidence enough to cause the authorities in Washington to take deportation steps.</p>
   <p>Some of the most important women of American society were among the members of the committee delegated to welcome the Countess on her arrival.</p>
   <p>In New York City, the Metropolitan gave a dinner in her honor, and on the same night at the Ambassador Hotel, a banquet was given in her honor also.</p>
   <p>She will appear in "White Plains, New York to lecture on "Why I am in Exile."</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1233.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Her tour is limited to three months, being directed by the Institute of International Education, of the Carnegie Foundation. It is the same organization which sponsored Count Apponyi's tour last year. She is also being aided by the League for Political Education.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi will come to Chicago, without a doubt, and we good Hungarians who have read this article must realize what an important mission brings her to this country, and what obstacles she has had to overcome. We hope that we will soon find out how the Chicago Hungarians will celebrate her visit to Chicago.</p>
   <p>The New York World, one of the most powerful publications in the United States, wrote a very interesting editorial with reference to the obstacles put before Countess Karolyi by Horthy, Menken, and others. This editorial appears in this newspaper verbatim, with our own compliments. The idea of this article is to show the Chicago Hungarians the great interest that is being shown by the American <pb facs="5422061_2_1234.jpg" n="6"/>people with reference to the policies and conditions existing in Hungary at the present time.</p>
   <p>In order that the American people be considered friends of Hungarian policies,the form of government in Hungary should be changed from the present reign of Horthyism and terrorism. This change must take place from one end of Hungary to the other. We hope that the Chicago Hungarians realize the fact that the American people are interested in our affairs in Hungary, and will cooperate to make Countess Karolyi's trip one that will make Hungary a truly democratic government.</p>
