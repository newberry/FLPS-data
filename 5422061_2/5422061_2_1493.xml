   <p>We are interested in many activities, so naturally we Hungarians of Chicago are taking definite steps forward. Probably our steps forward are following different paths, but these paths all lead to the same destination, and that is toward the development of the social and cultural life of our fellow Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Among our Hungarian people there are some very active churches that play a very important part in Hungarian society. For this reason we think that the Magyar Tribune should say something about the installation of the minister in the Hungarian Reformed Church of the West Side.</p>
   <p>There has always been a reformed church on the West Side and they have <pb facs="5422061_2_1494.jpg" n="2"/>had a minister to serve them. The minister was Reverend Eugene Boros of the Burnside Hungarian Reformed Church. This West Side Hungarian Reformed Congregation now feels that they can support their own minister. They have selected a man who is not only interested in spreading Calvinistic faith among the Hungarian people of Chicago, but he is also interested in the social life of the Chicago Hungarian people as a whole.</p>
   <p>We do not know Reverend Julius M. Hanko, the new minister, very well, but everything we have heard about him is very favorable. Without praising this man any further, the writer has some personal information in regard to the Hungarian reformed system of education. Reverend Hanko was educated in a Hungarian high school and college, and he realizes what a real education he received not only religiously, for he was also taught to be interested in all Hungarian activities regardless of religion, as long as these activities were for the common interest of the Hungarian people.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1495.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>So we naturally feel that the Chicago Hungarian population has gained a very worthy member in the person of Reverend Julius M. Hanko.</p>
   <p>While we heartily welcome this new minister and we congratulate the West Side congregation for their move in selecting this man, we want to call your attention to a very interesting and serious subject.</p>
   <p>We want to announce now, before we go any further, that we are writing this in a very serious manner, and we are not trying to pick out any one individual to praise or to criticize.</p>
   <p>In our great city of Chicago there are three active Hungarian Reformed Churches, one in Burnside where Reverend Eugene Boros is the pastor, one in South Chicago where Reverend Gero Garav presides, and one on the West Side where we have the new minister, Reverend Julius M. Hanko. It is a <pb facs="5422061_2_1496.jpg" n="4"/>very notable achievement to have three Hungarian Reformed Churches in three different parts of the city spreading the strength of the Hungarian cultural life for the benefit of all Hungarians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A church can not be established unless it has a membership, capable leaders, and a minister. In the United States it is very important that the Hungarian people have good ministers, because here they are the ones who hold the congregation together by their own efforts, and it is through the efforts of these ministers that churches are established.</p>
   <p>The members of the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Church were in very bad shape when Reverend Eugene Boros came here from Gary, Indiana. As we look back into the history of the Hungarian Reformed people of Chicago, we will note that they have advanced steadily since Reverend Eugene Boros <pb facs="5422061_2_1497.jpg" n="5"/>became the pastor of the churches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The development of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Chicago is outstanding because, if we consider the number of Hungarian Roman Catholic people in Chicago, they will outnumber the Reformed people two to one, and yet they can only show us one Hungarian Catholic Church, while the Hungarian Reformed people are proud to say that they have three well-established and well-organized churches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>There is only one activity which shows us that the Hungarian Roman Catholic people are still active, and that is the fact that it was their idea to build that great social center, the Hungarian Home.</p>
   <p>Our aims are not to serve the development of the different Churches, but <pb facs="5422061_2_1498.jpg" n="6"/>we are interested in all activities concerning the Hungarian people. We are fully satisfied that the Hungarian Reformed Churches have served the Hungarian people of Chicago impartially and in true Hungarian spirit. Therefore, we take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Eugene Boros for his great work among the Hungarian people in Chicago.</p>
