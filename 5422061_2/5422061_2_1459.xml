Bankers, physicians, industrialists, and workers alike recognized the practical value of the offer [made in the announcement] and not only subscribed to but also began paying for cemetery lots. One of our leading Hungarian-American citizens has ordered in his will, recently made, that under all circumstances he wishes to be buried in a Hungarian cemetery. Furthermore, he requested the directors [of the cemetery] that they should import some Hungarian soil and have it scattered all over the Hungarian cemetery to make it really Magyar ground.</p>
   <p>The documents pertaining to the Association, as well as the record of deeds, were examined by four attorneys and found to be in good order. Of these four lawyers, one is a Hungarian attorney and the other the American attorney of a Hungarian bank. The latter is one of the signers of the contract.....</p>

   <p>The work of landscaping and surveying has been started, and in a few weeks, as soon as the weather will permit, the cemetery will be finished and ready for inspection. We believe that our cemetery will be the most beautiful one in Chicago.....</p>
