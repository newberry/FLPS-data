  <body>
   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Virgin Mary Society was held last Sunday; This meeting proved to be one of great importance.</p>
   <p>John Kovacs, president of the Society opened the meeting by announcing that a committee was there representing the Hungarian Sick Benefit Societies Federation. He told the members of the Virgin Mary Society that this committee was there on a very important mission and that the chairman of the committee would explain what it was all about.</p>
   <p>Joseph Fekete, the chairman of the committee, told the members of the Virgin Mary Society that it was the wish of the members of the Federation to incorporate with the Virgin Mary Society. It was their wish that the Federation [should] turn their entire finances over to the Virgin Mary Society, and at the same time the members of the Federation are to become members of the Virgin Mary Society.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1264.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After a short discussion it was decided that the Federation should be accepted and incorporated into the Virgin Mary Society.</p>
   <p>The Virgin Mary [Society] gained ten thousand dollars financially and its membership was boosted by one hundred and ninety four.</p>
