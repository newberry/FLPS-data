   <p>Every movement which helps in the effort to shake the shackles placed on Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon, is praiseworthy and to be respected.</p>
   <p>The Midwestern Revision League was formed for this purpose and took upon itself the task of informing the American public from time to time of the tragedy of Hungary. It is too bad that the League is content to confine itself to waving its flag monotonously. It is <pb facs="5422061_2_1686.jpg" n="2"/>true that a few members of the League obtained 10,000 American signatures in behalf of Hungary's rights. It is not our aim to belittle this praiseworthy work, but we do have to point to the lamentable fact that the most important work that the League undertook, i. e., propaganda among the Americans, has been entirely neglected. The League has not informed the Press of its activities.</p>
   <p>At Hungarian gatherings to which the League sends delegates, we hear of the Revision, but it is unnecessary to acquaint the Hungarians with this question because they know all about it, and it is only repetition. We have to find friends for this cause among the Americans. If the present leaders of the League can't do propaganda work, they should let those do it who could benefit the movement of the Revision of the Treaty of Trianon.</p>
