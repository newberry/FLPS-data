   <p>We note with pleasure that the number of Hungarian cultural institutions has again been increased. The directors of the Magyar Home informed us that they have secured the consent of Karoly Kovach, popular music teacher and composer, to come to the South Side one day of each week to instruct the Hungarian children in this neighborhood in violin, piano, and voice. Instruction will be given at the Magyar Home every Saturday afternoon from four until six.</p>
   <p>It was a clever thought of the directors of the Magyar Home to engage this Hungarian master, whose thorough knowledge of music will aid the students to attain the best results. He plans eventually to organize an orchestra of young Hungarian musicians who would be able to supply dance music at all social affairs.</p>
   <p>In order that this music school shall be successful, the co-operation of the mothers is needed. Give your children the opportunity to develop their musical talents. Take them to the music school where Professor Kovach will try them <pb facs="5422061_2_0632.jpg" n="2"/>out and determine whether they have musical ability.....</p>
