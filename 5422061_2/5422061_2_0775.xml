   <p>p.13.................It happened twenty years ago. A number of far-seeing and sound thinking women and men came together to lay the foundation for an institute intended to help the brother Hungarians when they need to be helped. So they founded the Chicago Rakoczi Sick &amp; Benevolence Society. Alexander Racz, Michael Bedocs, Charles Csaszar, Alexander Szondy, Steve Subert, John Gulyas, George Pravda and others started the movement. They worked for the name, for the idea, and their work was crowned with success. When their Charter arrived on March 4, the new society could boast of seventy-nine members already. The first president of the new society was Steve Subert. Other officers were: Secretary, John Gulyas; treasurer, Michael Bedocs; recorder, Charles Csaszar; comptrollers, Joseph Kardosy and Wolf Vajka.</p>
   <p>The first few years of the existence of Rakoczi can not be called rosy, notwithstanding the fact, that the number of its members grew. Even in the first year there were deaths among the members; but in the second year some of them tried to exploit the society for their own benefit. This brought in its wake some <pb facs="5422061_2_0776.jpg" n="2"/>disturbances in the inner life of the society. The leaders did not hesitate, however, to take steps for order, and the year of 1916 sees again a strong and growing Rakoczi Society.</p>
   <p>The Rakoczi Society has only eighteen deaths during its twenty years existence (there were no deaths between 1927 and 1932). As burial-contribution the society paid a total of $5,745.00, and as sick benefits it paid $20,922.00 during the twenty years. The society also donated several hundred dollars for other human Hungarian purposes.</p>
   <p>During its twenty years existence the members numbered close to five-hundred, of these, as mentioned above, eighteen died; many of them moved to other parts of the U.S.; some of them returned to Hungary; but even today, when we are celebrating our jubilee, we have about 150 paying members, including fifteen of the founders, and assets close to $11,000.</p>
   <p>The officers in our jubilee year are: President, John Wolf ; vice-president, Mrs. Francis Gulya; secretary, Paul Toth; treasurer, Joseph Tury; secretary to the <pb facs="5422061_2_0777.jpg" n="3"/>treasurer, Francis Gulya; recorder, Steve Tinko; controller, Mathew Huber; inventory clerk, John Korbula, auditors, John Danko, Eugen Komuves, Anthony Lachman and George Kallay; flag-bearer, Joseph Papp.</p>
   <p>During its twenty years of existence the Rakoczi remained true to those traditions, which it started out to follow, and to those principles for which the famous Hungarian prince, Rakoczi, fought. God shall bless it so long, as it remains loyal to the faith uttered by the great Rakoczi, and so long it follows its traditions.</p>
