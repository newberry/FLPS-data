<title level="a">ABOUT THE HUNGARIAN LOAN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Hungarian loan, which has been talked and written about, has at last taken shape. On Wednesday, July 2nd, this loan first saw the light of day both in Europe and in America. America's share of this loan consists of seven and a half million dollars. In London, they have released close to thirty-three million dollars. The additional ten million dollars will be floated in Holland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.</p>
   <p>The biggest share of this loan was taken up by the Baring Brothers, the world's largest bankers of the house of Rothchild, and Schroder and company. This factor assures the Hungarian government that the loan will be placed. The American portion of the loan was taken up by one of the leading banks of <pb facs="5422061_2_1836.jpg" n="2"/>the country, Speyer and Co., who with the co-operation of several other banks floated the issue on the American money markets.</p>
   <p>The loan that is being floated in this country will yield approximately nine per cent. The Hungarian government will start buying these bonds back on the market after February 2, 1925. The price of these bonds is eighty-seven dollars and will be bought back for not more than one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>With reference to the security of this loan, Jeremiah Smith, of the League of Nations, and Baron Frigyes Koranyi, Minister of Finance in Hungary have made the following decision: Through this loan the value of the Hungarian money will be stabilized and the Hungarian money will be stabilized and the Hungarian budget will be regulated accordingly through taxation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1837.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Jeremiah Smith has been designated by the League of Nations to see that this idea is carried out, thereby insuring the loan. He will regulate the disbursement of this loan, which will be used for reconstruction purposes and other necessary governmental expenses.</p>
   <p>The loan will be insured through the taxation of sugar, tobacco and salt. The revenue derived from this taxation was 6 million 200 thousand dollars for the first four months of 1924, which is two and one-half times as much as is required to pay off part of the principal and the interest on the loan.</p>
   <p>To insure the collection of these taxes, there will be a separate department set up to handle the funds. At the end of each month, this department will give one-twelfth of the monthly receipts to a specially appointed committee from the League of Nations to do with this money as they see fit.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1838.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The League of Nations reserves the right to keep in close touch with the financial conditions of Hungary until such a time when this loan is paid back and the financial set-up in Hungary is sound.</p>
   <p>On March the 14th, 1924, England, France, Italy, Rumania, Jugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, declared to accept Hungary's political and economic set-up, thereby assuring those who had bought Hungarian bonds that it was a safe investment.</p>
   <p>During the last few weeks we have received many inquiries in regard to this loan, asking us for our opinions. Many cane to us and asked whether or not we recommend the purchase of these bonds.</p>
   <p>When we render opinions we do not dodge any of the issues in regard to the question. We are sure that our readers who have been following us for many <pb facs="5422061_2_1839.jpg" n="5"/>years will vouch for this statement.</p>
   <p>In regard to this loan, we stand this way.</p>
   <p>It is true that Hungary is in great need of this loan. The poor and the beggar need help. We are not confronted with theories, but with cold facts, and the well-settled position that Hungary is in.</p>
   <p>If the settlement of this question depended on us, we would have agreed that this loan was necessary, because we would have been satisfied with the facts.</p>
   <p>Now then, here is where our opinions differ. We would never give the Horthy and Bethlen government a cent, and we would demand that this entirely crooked government be stopped. Anyone connected with Horthy and Bethlen should <pb facs="5422061_2_1840.jpg" n="6"/>be removed from all county and city offices, so that the government can be handed back directly to the people, so that through the voting powers of the people a suitable government can be elected.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt that even if there was a democratic form of government in Hungary that this loan would have been made. We believe that if they had taxed the large land-owners, bankers, and financiers, it would have been able to float this loan right in the country itself, but it seems that this was not necessary, because the world bankers took care of this situation. Now we must discuss this new fact also.</p>
   <p>This loan does not mean anything, as far as patriotism is concerned, among the Hungarian people of America. Therefore, it is not necessary to make a patriotic appeal. This loan means only a good or bad business proposition as far as the <pb facs="5422061_2_1841.jpg" n="7"/>public itself is concerned. The public either forms its own opinion, or goes to his or her banker for advice to see whether a bond issue such as this is a good business risk or not.</p>
   <p>Nine per cent interest on an investment is very inviting for those who leap at a chance to reap large profits from their investments will buy some of these bonds; but those who are satisfied with a smaller profit, with not as great a risk, will stay away from this loan.</p>
   <p>Without any question, Hungary will be able to pay the interest on this loan and eventually repay the loan itself, providing the situation in Hungary and in Central Europe remains peaceful and quiet. But who will guarantee that for the next twenty years, peace will reign in Central Europe and in the <pb facs="5422061_2_1842.jpg" n="8"/>Balkans? The least bit of unrest will render great damage to these documents of value.</p>
   <p>Military activities would crumble all expectations, and the most binding contracts. Therefore the repayment of this loan does not depend on the taxation of sugar, tobacco and salt, but it does depend on peace in Central Europe. From this point of view, we think that all those people who are thinking of investing hard earned money in foreign bonds would examine the question.</p>
   <p>Horthy and Bethlen may be rooted firmly, but the unrest of the Italians, and Rumanians might crumble their entire power, putting entire Europe in military furor.</p>
   <p>This is only one example of many, because most anything might happen among the restless nations and politicians of Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1843.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>This fifty million-dollar loan will be received by Hungary whether the Hungarian people subscribe to it or not.</p>
   <p>When the world-famous bankers signed their names to this loan it became a reality, because when they endorse a bond issue, even if it were for five hundred million dollars, it would be good. So no one need get a head-ache wondering whether the Hungarian government will get this loan or not. We will come right out and declare ourselves, that according to our opinion, this form of government, whose present and past is bloody and sinful, has no future, and is not deserving of this loan to insure its continuation.</p>
   <p>To those people who pay little or no attention to the above notations, and at the same time do not recall the sad fate of the Hungarian Government's <pb facs="5422061_2_1844.jpg" n="10"/>war loan, we wish a lot of luck in this business venture when he or she gives their hard earned dollar to the banker who has promised such great profits in return. We are of the opinion that our good wishes will be appreciated sooner or later.</p>
