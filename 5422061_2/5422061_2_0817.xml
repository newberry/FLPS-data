   <p>Last year the Verhovay Aid Society purchased eighty-seven thousand dollars' worth of bonds from the Westminster Bond &amp; Mortgage Company. The Westminster Bond Company has closed its doors, and the United Lloyd and the Preferred Underwriters, who guaranteed the securities, have also gone out of business.</p>
   <p>This matter was discussed at the directors' meeting of the Verhovay, and at another meeting proceedings were instituted against Andrew Fejes, president, and Stephen Gaspar, treasurer. Fejes was responsible for purchasing the securities.</p>
   <p>The directors appointed Nicholas Nemenyi, also a member of the board, to investigate further. A few weeks ago, at a special meeting, the board of directors, acting on the suggestion of Nemenyi, decided to drop proceedings <pb facs="5422061_2_0818.jpg" n="2"/>against Gaspar, the treasurer. Although all indications point to the fact that the president, Fejes, acted in good faith, the case against him has been turned over to the disciplinary committee of the Society.</p>
   <p>We Chicagoans who have never considered the Westminster Bond and Mortgage Company a reliable concern are surprised at Andrew Fejes. He has always been very careful in advising the Society to invest their capital, and yet he has fallen into a trap which involves the loss of considerable of the Society's funds. In time, it is possible that the investment will prove to be profitable, but at present it seems unlikely that the Society will ever get its money back. Andrew Fejes should have known that there are unsound securities as well as sound ones; he should have sought expert advice before investing the money.</p>
   <p>The Verhovay Aid Society should have profited by the sad example of others, and should have investigated the reliability of the Company before making such an investment.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0819.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Verhovay is not the only organization whose money is in danger, for the Virgin Mary Home's investment with this same company is endangered. The Westminster Bond and Mortgage Company was owned and operated by Emil Pressburger, a Hungarian.</p>
