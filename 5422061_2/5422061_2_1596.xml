   <p>p.1.... The so-called foreigners are being looked upon with unfriendly eyes and new restrictive laws are being discussed daily, which would make their position more difficult. Murders, robberies, liquor wars are all blamed on the foreigners,even though it is a fact that most convicts are American born.</p>
   <p>It is true that many aliens entered the United States illegally. They were smuggled in, because they couldn't come in the regular way. These are the undesirable aliens who will be deported first,and then those who committed major crimes. According to the laws of today, if a person has resided in this country for five or more years, he can't be asked to prove the legality of his entry. If the authorities could check back and prove his illegal entry, they could deport him, but it is very hard to prove.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1597.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is advised that all foreigners carry some items of identification upon their person, so as to be able to prove legal entry. The argument is brought up that this is the custom in European countries and foreigners shouldn't complain if the same custom is to prevail here. We hope that the resentful feeling against the foreigners won't last long, and that the native Americans will realize that their fathers or grandfathers were also immigrants.</p>
