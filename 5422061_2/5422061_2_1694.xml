   <p>Hungarian Brethren!</p>
   <p>On the tenth anniversary of Trianon [the peace treaty], each and every Hungarian church organization, and individual must act as an envoy of the beloved country of our birth. We must protest in unison against the suppression of the Magyar nation.</p>
   <p>Although it will be ten years on June 4 since our mother country was mutilated, the great powers have done nothing yet to remedy this heinous injustice, with the result that the greater part of Hungary, including its population, is still under foreign rule.</p>
   <p>The victims of this injustice have appealed to heaven, and God has heard them, giving them the inspiration to submit their grievances to public opinion. Let us make use of this inspiration.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1695.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The A.M.O.S.Z. [Amerikai Magyarok Orszagos Szovetsege--American Hungarian National Federation], in this country, which can do more for our unfortunate people than anyone else, offers us an opportunity to forge ahead.</p>
   <p>We have a historical duty--let us fulfill it honestly. On the fourth of June, let us appeal to public opinion as one man. Our words--oral or written--as well as our actions, must be given world-wide publicity. We must permeate the world with our sorrow and our protests. We must do this in the following way:</p>
   <p>1. Our churches should hold special services on this day, inviting pastors of different nationalities but belonging to the same denomination.</p>
   <p>2. Hungarian colonies should also hold memorial affairs, inviting as many American guests as possible. These affairs should be arranged by the A.M.O.S.Z., and in places where the A.M.O.S.Z. has no branch, one should be formed immediately.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1696.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>3. Our churches and organizations should send cablegrams every week to the League of Nations; also telegrams to the United States Senate. Forms suitable for this purpose are given at the end of this article. We must protest against the unjust treatment of our mother country.</p>
   <p>4. Each Hungarian individual is duty bound to explain to at least one American the injustice of the treaty of Trianon.</p>
   <p>5. Let each of us give one day for the expansion of the work of the A.M.O.S.Z., the aim of which is to lead us Hungarians against Trianon.</p>
   <p>On June 4, 1930, the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty of Trianon, the following form of cablegram is to be sent to the League of Nations:</p>
   <p>"Secretary of the League of Nations, Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1697.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"June 4, 1930, is the tenth anniversary of the treaty of Trianon, which dismembered Hungary, the thousand-year-old state of Central Europe.</p>
   <p>"Peace treaties were never intended to be sacrosanct. The experience of the last decade has proved that the revision of the treaty of Trianon is imperative if peace is to be preserved and economic progress assured.</p>
   <p>"No lapse of time, no defeat of hopes will be sufficient to reconcile Hungarians to the desperate position to which the Trianon treaty doomed them, and we will strive continually for the revision of a treaty which took no account of Wilson's principle of self-determination of peoples, and which is contrary to all ideas of peace and liberty and, above all, democracy."</p>
   <p>On this same date the following telegram should be sent to the United States Senate: <pb facs="5422061_2_1698.jpg" n="5"/>"The Senate of the United States of America, Washington, D. C. "June 4, 1930, is the tenth anniversary of the treaty of Trianon, which dismembered Hungary, the thousand-year-old state of Central Europe.</p>
   <p>"The treaty of Trianon was not ratified by the United States Senate. The Senate felt the moral obligation to withhold ratification, since the treaty repudiated the very same principles of humanity and ideas of democracy for which this nation fought.</p>
   <p>"Peace treaties....."[Translator's note: From here on the text of the telegram to the Senate is the same as that of the cablegram to the League of Nations.]</p>
