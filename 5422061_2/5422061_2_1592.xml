   <p>The editors of the national and reputable weekly magazine, Liberty, called our attention to their recent article recommending a more liberal immigration law, and asked us to discuss this in our publication. The free translation of Liberty's article may be found on page four of this issue.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary for us to say that we are gratified that such a widely circulated national magazine should take a friendly interest in this acute problem. We are not even offended when the Magyars are called "Hunkies" in the article, because it is due to ignorance and not malice. Perhaps they believe that this is a nickname for Hungarians.</p>
   <p>An interesting and typical American oddity about the whole thing is that Liberty, owned by the Chicago Tribune, should take such a liberal view in <pb facs="5422061_2_1593.jpg" n="2"/>this matter. The Chicago Tribune is the most stubborn advocator of restricted immigration.....</p>
   <p>We, too, want to see immigration [laws]become more humane and impartial, because now they are unkind and unfair. But so much has been written about this, that it is futile to repeat ourselves. We have come to the conclusion that it is useless to appeal to the fairness, humanity and better judgment of Congress, because the majority of the members love their own kind too much. We are, therefore, pointing to an important economic angle. We do this as good American citizens, who place the good of this country above every other consideration.</p>
   <p>We will discuss the Hungarians, because we know them better than any other race. Doubtless, also the editors of German, Italian, Czech, Rumanian, and Bulgarian newspapers would discuss the qualifications of their people, if Congress were to ask them.</p>
   <p>Three types of Hungarian immigrants are an absolute necessity to the <pb facs="5422061_2_1594.jpg" n="3"/>economy of the United States, and these should be allowed entry outside the quota.</p>
   <p>Among the men, the farmer should be favored. We do not wish to say that Hungarian farmers are the best, but they are hard working and conscientious. We suggest that this class should be allowed to come here in numbers sufficient to fill the demand for skilled farm hands.</p>
   <p>Let us take the servant problem. The wages are very high, because the demand is larger than the supply.....Would it not be beneficial to millions of American families, if several thousand trained, thrifty, efficient housemaids were permitted to enter?</p>
   <p>Cooks, the queens of the kitchens, are getting much higher wages than before the war,.....and that is the reason a simple dinner or a sandwich is so expensive.....Hungarian cooks are acknowledged to be first class. What improvement a few hundred of them would bring to American cooking!....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1595.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The present quota is prepared to favor the Anglo-Saxon race. We have to submit to this favoritism, but we suggest that those workers for whom there is a demand and whose presence would not cause unemployment to others should be allowed to come to these United States outside the quota of the nation [from which they come].....</p>
