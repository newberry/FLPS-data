   <p>A large crowd filled the Wage Earners Home last Sunday to see the beautiful May festival program given by the Hungarian members of the I. W. W., the Modern Theatrical Circle, and the Workers Universal Singing Club.</p>
   <p>The master of ceremonies was Mr. Szabadi, who introduced Arnold Wiener as festival speaker. Wiener spoke of the origin of the May festival and of its importance. In his speech, short but full of meaning, he spoke of the May First of times gone by, and gave expression to the hope that the time will come when May First will be a real holiday throughout the world.</p>
   <p>His speech over, the Choir of the Workers Universal Club, led by Joseph B. Mayer, took the stage and sang a few selections, which were much applauded.</p>
   <p>An unexpected treat was the recitation by six-year-old Juliska Wiener. She recited a poem with such perfection that her listeners applauded until <pb facs="5422061_2_0395.jpg" n="2"/>their hands turned red.</p>
   <p>Ladislas Kerekes, accompanied by the gypsy band, sang a few Hungarian songs. His pleasing voice, his mastery of singing and his winning personality--all contributed to his success.</p>
   <p>Paul Pika's one-act play, "Today, Tomorrow," had a warm reception. Pika, an old veteran of the Hungarian labor movement, is well acquainted with social problems, a reason why he was able to write this play in such a magnificent manner. In this play he deals with great skill on the questions of today. We think our friend Pika would be a successful playwright if he would take the time and pain to write a three-act drama. No doubt he would render great service to the labor movement.</p>
   <p>As stage director Andor Wiener did a masterful piece of work. His arrangement of the stage and direction of the play would do credit to even the biggest show. The play was so well rehearsed and arranged that it brought out all the <pb facs="5422061_2_0396.jpg" n="3"/>expected effects.</p>
   <p>By all means the actors themselves contributed a great deal to the success of the play. They did their best to entertain the public.</p>
   <p>The following actors gave good account of themselves: [Translator's note: Names of ten amateur players:]....and so contributed to the brilliant success of the May festival.</p>
   <p>The program was followed by a dance, which kept the public together well into the late nours of the night.</p>
