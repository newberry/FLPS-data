   <p>Sometime last year, the City Council decreed that no more permits for new or additional cemeteries would be granted. This means that when the present cemeteries in Chicago become filled, the new cemeteries will have to be built many miles away from the city.</p>
   <p>The new city ordinance or law has caused great consternation among churches and societies that take care of the burial of their deceased members.</p>
   <p>This ordinance gave food for thought to these organizations, which quickly looked around for and made inquiries about available space in cemeteries.</p>
   <p>Their diligent search was rewarded, with the result that the Elmwood Park <pb facs="5422061_2_1474.jpg" n="2"/>Cemetery was found to be willing to concede parcels of land to churches and societies.</p>
   <p>The Elmwood Park Cemetery sent a circular letter to churches, societies, and national groups notifying them about the time limit within which the cemetery lots were to be taken over....</p>
   <p>In compliance with this circular letter, the churches, societies, and national groups lost no time in taking advantage of the proferred opportunity.....</p>
   <p>The West Side Hungarian Reformed Church could not take any steps in this direction before because there was a change in pastors, but now the new pastor, the Reverend John Muranyi, has brought this matter to the attention of the elders.</p>
   <p>The elders have decided that insofar as the offer (of the Elmwood Park <pb facs="5422061_2_1475.jpg" n="3"/>Cemetery) is advantageous to the members of the church, the matter would be discussed further.</p>
   <p>Upon the advice of the pastor, a committee of eight was delegated to inspect the cemetery and report on the advantages offered.</p>
   <p>The committee went to the cemetery and studied the blocks of lots offered and tendered a written report of the price asked and the stipulations.</p>
   <p>According to this written report, the offer of the Elmwood Park Cemetery is acceptable and the committee recommends the purchase of the block of lots.</p>
   <p>One block has one thousand individual lots, which are too many for a small church like the West Side Hungarian Reformed Church.</p>
   <p>For this reason it was decided that this should not be a Reformed but a <pb facs="5422061_2_1476.jpg" n="4"/>Hungarian cemetery. Thus, cemetery lots could be obtained in this block by other denominations, societies, or Hungarians who have no religious affiliations.</p>
   <p>Apparently the plan will be successful, because there is a lively interest among the Hungarians regarding this project.....</p>
