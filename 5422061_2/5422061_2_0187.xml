  <body>
   <p>We have known the versatile Jeno Endrey from many angles. We have expressed our admiration for him as an actor and producer, but have never had occasion to see one of his own plays. Apparently he has written quite a number of one-act plays that have been shown in Budapest cabarets with great success, so we are eagerly awaiting to see Endrey in this new character.</p>
   <p>The playwright declared that he wrote the play for the American stage, but, in deference to the Chicago Hungarians, he will first produce it in Hungarian. The play is a burlesque comedy, which is designed to amuse.</p>
