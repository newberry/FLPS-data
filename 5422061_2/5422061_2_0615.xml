   <p>Those people who listened to radio station WLS the last three Wednesdays were rather pleasantly surprised. Some very well-known Hungarian melodies were sent out over the air lanes to every corner of the earth. This outstanding radio program was directed by Charles Kovacs, a celebrated Hungarian composer and teacher of music.</p>
   <p>The main part of the program featured songs written by Kovacs and Hubay Lehar. These songs were superbly rendered by Mrs. Kovacs, who was accompanied at the piano by Mr. Kovacs. The rest of the program consisted of renditions by the pupils of Mrs. and Mrs. Kovacs. These children sang and played Hungarian music in a manner which made one feel as though it were really coming from the Hungarian prairies.</p>

   <p>This Hungarian radio program was a great success. Mr. and Mrs. Kovacs received a very nice letter from the directors of radio station WLS, complimenting them on the beautiful program.</p>
