   <p>The troubles of the Verhovay Aid Society have always interested and vexed us. The moment we heard that the Verhovay had purchased large blocks of Westminster Bond Company securities, we knew that there would be trouble. But it was not only we who were worried--others who were familiar with the business methods and manipulations of this company were also suspicious. The Bristol Company, too, was not a reputable concern in our estimation. [Translator's note: The Bristol Company was the underwriter of the Westminster Company.] The fact that the securities had to be insured raised suspicion in the mind of the public. We suspected that this was a good business deal for someone, and that somewhere someone divided the agency commission. These suspicions, however, were instinctive or quiet tip-offs, so that we did not want to shoulder the responsibility by publishing that something about the bond purchase was odorous. We also knew that to prove <pb facs="5422061_2_0800.jpg" n="2"/>the charges would involve time and money, and that we would have to contend with hard-boiled opponents.....And, as proved by further developments in the case, even after conclusive proof of mismanagement, the members, as well as the directors, only half-heartedly started to clean house. The guilty ones withdrew from their respective offices only after loud protestations. We silenced our consciences with an article or two, but the majority of the members paid no attention to even the strong accusations in other newspapers. The events were left to develop in their own way.</p>
   <p>Foxiness, secretiveness, lawyers' tactics--all were in vain. The delegates' eyes were opened. They saw that corruption was real. The discredited president, Andrew Fejes, Jr., after accepting two hundred and sixteen dollars for expenses, resigned himself to his ignominious dismissal.....Dr. Ferenc Marthy, secretary, and Istvan Gaspar, treasurer, <pb facs="5422061_2_0801.jpg" n="3"/>were branded as unfaithful officers and dismissed. The directors who accepted money in this transaction were voted no confidence. Taking into consideration the charges, they were accorded very light punishment.</p>
   <p>We are sorry that Chicago played such a prominent and unfavorable role in this scandal. The ex-president used to make his residence here. The business deal was made here. The bankrupt companies are here. These three circumstances caused the series of violations resulting in the horrible losses to the Verhovay, due to the worthlessness of the securities and the expenses of a special convention to investigate matters.</p>
   <p>Every intelligent person knows that firms like the Westminster and Bristol companies are rare exceptions in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Naturally, a reputable firm cannot pay four or five per cent sales commission.....This is the reason the bond purchasers of the Verhovay did not look for trustworthy Chicago Hungarian or American companies, but took <pb facs="5422061_2_0802.jpg" n="4"/>the money of the widows and orphans where there was a likelihood of fat commissions.</p>
   <p>The total ignoring of Hungarian bankers, business men, and lawyers of Chicago in investing this money of the public, was sadly avenged. Let this be a lesson in future business transactions. We are firmly convinced that if the bond purchasers would have consulted any Chicago Hungarian lawyer, business man, or banker before investing hundreds of thousands of dollars with the Westminster or Bristol companies, this national scandal, this serious loss of money to the Verhovay members could have been avoided. Any one of these people would have given information as to where and how the money could have been invested safely.....</p>
   <p>One thing is certain, and that is that in the future it will be the duty of organized Hungarian newspapers to follow the activities of American-Hungarian societies with watchful eyes. They must ruthlessly expose any underhanded methods and save the wealth, earthly and spiritual, of the <pb facs="5422061_2_0803.jpg" n="5"/>Hungarians. Furthermore, the Hungarian public should be freed of parasites, leeches, and degenerates. By these means only will the life and future of American-Hungarians, already contaminated, become healthy again. We express the hope that the Verhovay Aid Society will recover soon without a relapse from these losses. Let them be more circumspect and thrifty in the future. Let God lead them on the path of peace, honesty, and increased strength.</p>
