   <p>The Chicago Thalia Literary and Song Society held an interesting meeting on November 12. This meeting was their quarterly open meeting. At this time, some very interesting and worthy resolutions were read by the secretary, Mr. Andrew Vancso. A president pro-tem was selected, and Mr. Joseph Mayer was honored with this position. The different committees made their reports and were found satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Following these reports, the welfare of the lodge was brought up. It was decided that a literary class should be opened by this society. Mrs. Pilath made a suggestion that this society develope and find <pb facs="5422061_2_0473.jpg" n="2"/>more literary and art talent among its members. This suggestion after proper procedure was unanimously accepted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Mayer addressed the meeting, and stressed the principles of the organization, explaining the purposes for which it was organized. As a result of his address a resolution to the effect that regular classes would be held every Friday night, when classes in drama and music would be taught.</p>
   <p>There will also be some very interesting discussions on other subjects pertaining to cultural development. A resolution passed which provided for lectures one evening each month, where prominent Hungarians in Chicago would speak on educational and literary subjects that would help the growth of this newly organized society.</p>
