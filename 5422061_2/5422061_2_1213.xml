<title level="a">HUNGARIAN-AMERICANS SUPPORT RUTH HANNA McCORMICK FOR SENATOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>.....Mrs. Ruth Hanna McCormick, during her campaign for nomination to the Senate, will talk over the radio and arrange mass meetings. She will contact the voters in all wards of the city personally, conducting the most energetic campaign that the state of Illinois has ever witnessed.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of letters are received daily at the McCormick headquarters from Hungarian-Americans who have pledged themselves to support Mrs. McCormick in her campaign. They are convinced that she is experienced, qualified, and worthy of this position, and that she sympathizes with the working class and knows its problems.</p>
   <p>During her term as congresswoman she did a lot of favors for the Hungarian-Americans, favors which have been acknowledged by grateful letters.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1214.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Hungarian-Americans' Announcement</p>
   <p>A committee of one hundred Hungarian-Americans published an announcement in which it pledges itself to support the nomination of Mrs. McCormick for senator. Among other assertions, the Hungarian-Americans state:</p>
   <p>"We are for Mrs. McCormick because she is the only woman in America who had the ability and courage to oppose the World Court, which is a part of the League of Nations, and which would probably have entangled us in undesirable controversies.</p>
   <p>Humane and Just Immigration Laws</p>
   <p>"She advocates a more humane and just immigration law, a law which will permit a more liberal quota, thus avoiding the breaking up of families, which causes so much trouble to our people. As an employer, she also knows the requirements of the workers. She is a member of the Women's Trade Union League.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1215.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A Qualified Representative</p>
   <p>"We believe that the best interests of Illinois require that it should be represented in the Senate by Ruth Hanna McCormick, and therefore we ask our countrymen to vote for her as the best qualified person for this position."</p>
   <p>Not a Dictator</p>
   <p>Among the many resolutions adopted, the one from the 37th Ward is the most interesting. It states:</p>
   <p>"Ruth Hanna McCormick took a brave stand against the World Court, thus rescuing us from foreign entanglements.</p>
   <p>"As Congresswoman, she did her official duty, did not interfere in local politics, and did not aspire to be a dictator."</p>
