   <p>The Chicago People's Theater under the direction of Jeno Endrey has had four successful years of activity in Chicago. Unlike other Hungarian theatrical companies, this company was stationary and the patronage of the theater-going public enabled the members of the company to make a decent livelihood. The most interesting feature of the business methods of the Chicago People's Theater is that last season eight hundred season tickets were sold. This insured a full house at each performance.</p>
   <p>The management now announces that the Chicago People's Theater is being incorporated with a capital of ten thousand dollars. Hereafter the company will have a touring troupe of twenty members, their own orchestra and theatrical props. They will tour the country in their own bus. The record of the company is sufficient guaranty of their future success.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune records its pleasure at this new cultural effort, which is <pb facs="5422061_2_0184.jpg" n="2"/>destined to keep the Magyar spirit alive in a strange land.</p>
