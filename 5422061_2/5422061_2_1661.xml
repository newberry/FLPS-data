   <p>The arrangments committee of the University Singers' Choir, which in the spring gave a concert in Chicago, has sent its accounts to the Hungarian press in America to be printed in the papers. They are made up with the most painstaking adherence to detail and are a thoroughly conscientious piece of work. To our regret we are unable to reprint all the accounts, since the space in our paper is limited. Even so, we can see that there was a total income of $20,781.43, out of which was spent a total of $16,534.51 for all expenses, and the remaining $4,246.92 was devoted to charitable purposes. Some of the cities have not yet sent in their final accountings, but when they do, the outstanding amounts can only be added to the sum given to charity, since all the expenses are already covered.</p>
   <p>In the list of accounts by cities, Chicago shows an income of $1,387,28, of which the amount for charity is $539. The highest amount of income is that of Pittsburgh, $1,613.69; $409.12 goes to charity. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and <pb facs="5422061_2_1662.jpg" n="2"/>Detroit each had $1,000; New York brought in $1,126.67; the smallest amount was received at South Bend, Indiana, $300.</p>
   <p>The concerts were given originally for the benefit of the Hungarian-American Hospital Fund, for which the sponsor of the concert tours, Dr. Cholnoky, succeeded in collecting $1,760.04, which was deposited with the Bankers Trust Company in New York.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian University Singers' Choir and the arrangements committee of the tour repeatedly express their hearty thanks for the kindly support of all those who helped them to attain this great moral and material success.</p>
