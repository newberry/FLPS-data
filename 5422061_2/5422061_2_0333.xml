   <p>It was not in vain all the work and preparation which the Arranging Committee for the forty-five years jubilee and dedication of the flag of the I. Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Association of Chicago and Suburb did for weeks and even months. On Whit-Sunday there was not room enough to harbor all the crowd of the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity, who came together on this occasion. Even from other states the Hungarians gathered together to participate in this festival. As we know it, there were guests even from California, LosAngeles, whom the noted Hungarian painter,Emil Fellegi, sent to Chicago to witness this Hungarian gathering, so as to be able to tell the Hungarians of California, how it was done.</p>
   <p>At about 3:00 P.M. began the gathering of the different associations. First to arrive was the German-Hungarian Ladies Sick-Benefit Association whose members appeared clad in their white uniforms, bearing their color, under the leadership of Mrs. Mary Acker, president. There were also other uniformed groups, as that of the Woodmen of the World, Branch No. 317; many brought their flags along, like the Chicago Youth and Amateur Club, the 164th Branch of the Verhovay Aid Association, the Rakoczi Sick Benefit Association, <pb facs="5422061_2_0334.jpg" n="2"/>Independent Hungarians Association, Chicago Literary and Singing Association. There were further delegations of the branches 221st and 57th of the Bridgeport Aid Association, the Chicago Ladies Benevolent Association, the South Side Hungarian Reform Church, the Hungarian Society, the Federation of Hungarian Churches and Societies of Chicago South Side, etc.</p>
   <p>With the branch 221st of Bridgeport Aid Association came also the district director, John Kovacs, who delivered during the festival a very nice greeting speech in the name of the greater associations.</p>
   <p>The program proper began with singing by Miss Jolan Horkay, who was accompanied on the piano by Miss Elvira Rakos. John Balazs, President,greeted the public,then giving the stage to Paul Timko, who in the past was often president of the Jubilant Association and in his speech related the events during the forty-five years of existence of the association.</p>
   <p>Next on the program came the songs of Miss Adrienne Szegedy,accompanied by her sister, Alice Szegedy. Then came the dedication of the flag, the present flag of Hungary. The <pb facs="5422061_2_0335.jpg" n="3"/>church ceremonies were performed by Rev. George Thegze, Hungarian Greek-Catholic Priest, followed by a speech by the Rev. Gero Garay of the Hungarian Reform Church in South Chicago about the significance of the flag in general and of this flag in particular. The flag was dedicated by the honorable Ladistaus Medgyessy, the Royal Hungarian Consul, who then presented it to its god-parents, Mr. and Mr. J.Szidak. They, together with the honorary President, Coloman Molnar, became the guardians of the flag, and solemnly they vowed to take good care of it always.</p>
   <p>After the act of dedication those present were photographed, and then the program was continued. According to the program, the next number should be the singing and the dance of the "Prima-Donna" of Burnside," who was nobody else than the seven year old daughter, Betty Lou, of the Louis Nimeths'. The girl earned a tremdous ovation through her performance. She was accompanied on the piano by Miss Irenke Marossy, recorder of the Tarsalgo. In the name of the South Side Federation of Hungarian Churches and Associations, Joseph Barceli, the President, presented good wishes to the Hungarians from Chicago's South Side. Irenke Sinko recited with great success an English poem, written for this occasion by the lyrist of Bihar.</p>

   <p>As the stage was to small, the dance numbers of the Dancing Group of Chicago Hungarian Youth and Amateur Club was shown in the second, the dance part of the festivals. Of the two dances, the Palotas received great applause from the public, and was performed by the dancing group with real grace. This success is also due in part, to their dance instructor, John Petri.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the drinks were served lavishly, and the supper was in full swing in the dining-room. But since the Arrangement Committee planned for only about eight-hundred dinners, that number only could be served. However, there were no complaints about anybody being left hungry, because there was an abundance of sausage and all kinds of eatables.</p>
   <p>In the ballroom the dancers were happily dancing till sunrise. Everybody who was there had a good time celebrating this memorable festival of the Tarsalgo.</p>
