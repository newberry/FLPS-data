   <p>Chicago-Hungarians are affected greatly by the unemployment situation. Hundreds of people come to Chicago to seek work, in connection with the World's Fair, but there were many who were unable to find employment, and consequently, were stranded, forcing them to accept any kind of work for small wages. This cheap labor threw many people out of work. Over a half million Chicagoans. are without work.</p>
   <p>The majority of the Hungarians in Chicago were employed by the Illinois Central and the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad companies, but seventy-five percent of them were laid off indefinitely.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1019.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many Hungarians owned their own homes, but lost them through foreclosures.</p>
   <p>At present, there seems to be no possibility of better conditions. Therefore, the Hungarians have decided to aid their poor and unemployed in facing the problems of the coming winter.</p>
   <p>A meeting was held at the offices of the Magyar Tribune to discuss these matters. They formed the "Hungarian Relief Center." The following officers were elected: Dr. Erno Lowinger, president; Jeno Petrovits, treasurer; Louis Barna, secretary.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Relief Center set as their aim to render assistance where is most needed.</p>
