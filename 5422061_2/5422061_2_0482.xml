   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Reformed church has conducted a Hungarian summer school during the summer vacation of the Chicago public schools. The children who attended this Hungarian summer school gave proof of the education they gained by holding their examination open to the public. At this examination there were forty pupils present. The parents of these children were more than satisfied that the children had been capably handled and educated in the Hungarian language. All the children answered the questions put to them very satisfactorily. The examination was held in the church room. After the examination was over the church choir sponsored an evening of entertainment in honor of the children who attended the summer school It was a very pleasant evening of entertainment. The choir sang some Hungarian folk songs, Bill Manta entertained on the violin, accompanied by Bertha Manta on the piano. Elizabeth Gazso played a piano solo. The guests were well pleased with this entertaining evening which they thought was a very fitting way to end the summer school examinations.</p>
