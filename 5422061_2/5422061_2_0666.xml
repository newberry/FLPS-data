<title level="a">DEBATE AT THE OLIVET INSTITUTE ABOUT RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN RUSSIA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday evening, February 23, the topic of the open forum at the Olivet Institute, which was "Religious Persecution in Russia," elicited much interest.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stephen Csaktornyai, pastor, introduced the topic. He considered the question from three angles: the causes of persecution, its consequences, and viewpoints in relation to it.</p>
   <p>On the motion of Arnold Matray, it was agreed that the participants in the debate should argue only the causes of persecution that evening. A lively discussion followed which was distinguished by courageous thinking and impartiality.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0667.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The causes for religious persecution in Russia were found to be the clergy's antirevolutionary activities, the unity of the Church and the ruling class, the errors of the Church in the task of uplifting the people, and the atheistic tendencies of the Communist system.</p>
   <p>....The debate will be continued next Sunday, when the topic will be "The Expected Consequences of Religious Persecution in Russia on the Present and Future Generations".</p>
   <p>The open forum is public.</p>
