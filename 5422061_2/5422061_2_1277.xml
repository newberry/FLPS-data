   <p>The Chicago Magyar Club is the only Hungarian social club in Chicago of the intelligentsia. The club was formed in October of last year, and is making rapid progress, which shows that there is great need for such an organization.</p>
   <p>They had their regular monthly meeting at the La Salle Hotel, and had as their guest of honor, Louis Pichler, Assistant Secretary of the Interior (Hungary). Mr. Pichler is the founder of he Hungarian Immigrants' defense Bureau. Thousands of people have made use of this Defense Bureau. This club is planning to build a two hundred room hotel, with spacious waiting rooms, medical advisers, and reading rooms, for emigrants in Budapest. These accommodations will be of assistance to emigrants in all matters concerning immigration, which will prevent the wholesale fleecing of our countrymen by professional agents. Mr. <pb facs="5422061_2_1278.jpg" n="2"/>Pichler recommended establishing information bureaus in each large city for Hungarians wishing to visit or re-establish themselves in Hungary.</p>
   <p>This idea because of its magnitude, will be difficult to carry through, but it is a good one and is needed at this time.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to discuss ways and means to put the idea on a workable basis. It will make its report in April.</p>
