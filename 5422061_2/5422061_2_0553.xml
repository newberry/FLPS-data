   <p>At this time we want to tell the people how and where the press stands or should stand with the people.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune and the American Magyar are the two Hungarian newspapers with large circulations in the city of Chicago. Since the Magyar Tribune is a local newspaper, we think that we can keep the interest of the Hungarian people more at heart than the other newspapers, including the Szabadsag and the Nepszava. We have a larger circulation than the two newspapers combined, although they have a large enough circulation to warrant a business manager for this city. These facts are indications that the Chicago Hungarians do not ignore the press.</p>
   <p>The press has played an important part in the life of the older Hungarian societies and churches. We have no reason to feel badly towards the sick benefit societies, the cultural societies or the athletic organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0554.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These organizations have always acted with greatest courtesy towards the press.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there is a combating force in the life of the Hungarian press. This group is usually taking action without the knowledge of the press. Through these actions they hope to become leaders. They move secretly because they know that they will never become leaders among the Hungarians with the aid of the press.</p>
   <p>These so called, self-appointed leaders are people who are supposed to be from the upper class of people, socially speaking, They are all university graduates and consequently use gloves when they shake the hand of the common workingman.</p>
   <p>Just how detrimental, this ignoring of the press is to the Chicago Hungarians we will not attempt to say but we do want to stress the fact that the Chicago Hungarian Press has had enough of their foolish tactics, and in the future will use every method to put an end to their activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0555.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are not trying to plant any ideas. This is not a personal or a patriotic battle, nor should it be a battle to gain individual recognition. This is a battle for bread and butter.</p>
   <p>Those who ignore us, the representative of the press, make it hard for the press to exist. Without making things harder, we find that it is hard enough to exist, and for this reason we battle these people who so completely ignore the press. This battle is not being fought secretly, but in the open.</p>
   <p>We of the Chicago Hungarian press are not in this business for graft nor can we be bribed, but we are trying to make reflections so that we can be recognized by everyone, as a mouthpiece for the Chicago Hungarians in all their activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0556.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If we had caused any trouble or if we were standing in the way of Chicago Hungarians, or if the Chicago Hungarians favored two or three other newspapers in Chicago, then we could say that there would be individual partiality shown. But this is not so.</p>
   <p>Certain people have tried to organize Loyalty Leagues, Freedom societies and now they are trying to organize people to aid those people of Hungary who are suffering.</p>
   <p>All of this they have tried to do without the aid of the press. The careers of the first two societies mentioned show that these organizations did not live very long. In other cities no one who would try organization work without the aid of the press.</p>
   <p>Many unusual things have happened in Chicago in regards to important Hungarian activities. Individuals have forgotten about the press and have thrown it off into a corner somewhere. But at this time, we openly and bravely say that <pb facs="5422061_2_0557.jpg" n="5"/>this will not happen again. We are not writing this threateningly, but in a manly way, just as a man seeking employment speaks up and demands a hearing even if deaf ears are turned to him. We are not fighting this battle for our individual good alone but also for recognition of the other publications appearing in Chicago. We can add that we of the Magyar Tribune are the only Hungarian news editors of Chicago who are suffering financially, striving continually for the betterment of our publication in order that this newspaper gain recognition everywhere.</p>
   <p>We believe that people who do not recognize our newspaper, do not recognize the thousands upon thousands of Chicago Hungarians, so therefore we are not only seeking recognition for our publication, but we also want our readers recognized.</p>
   <p>We can conscientiously state that we not only continually seek recognition, but we will surely gain it.</p>
