   <p>On November 29, Countess Karolyi will arrive at the La Salle Street depot. Upon her arrival, she will be the guest of the Council on Foreign Relations at a luncheon to be given in her honor at the La Salle Hotel. At this time, she will give a lecture in English, explaining why she is an exile from Hungary.</p>
   <p>During her visit, Countess Karolyi will not give any lectures in Hungarian due to the fact that she is scheduled to appear in Columbus immediately after her lectures in English in Chicago. After making her complete tour of English lectures, which will be completed in January, she will start on her tour of lectures in Hungarian.</p>
   <p>Therefore, November 29 will be the day on which the Chicago Hungarians can show their loyalty and their sincere appreciation for her visit here. We feel sure that the welcoming committee will make arrangements for the <pb facs="5422061_2_0686.jpg" n="2"/>advancing liberal Hungarians to express their heartfelt welcome to this noble lady.</p>
   <p>At this time, we cannot give details of the plans of the committee, but we understand that elaborate preparations are being made by the prominent Hungarians of Chicago. We will have more information in regard to the reception in the very near future. We think that it would be very pleasing to her if a large number of Hungarians were at the La Salle Street station to welcome her.</p>
   <p>The Americans on the committee are only too glad to have suggestions from all Hungarians who are interested in this affair, and they cordially invite all to be present at this lecture. There will not be an admission charge, the only charge being made is for the luncheon, which follows the lecture.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0687.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians must wake up from their dreams which has led their interest away from their relations with the homeland, and when Countess Karolyi arrives, we should have that day declared a holiday.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi deserves such respect a hundred fold, and at the same time the Chicago Hungarians must show to the American public and the American press their strength, intelligence, and appreciation, towards a woman so noble and so interested in Hungarian affairs. We urge every Hungarian to be present next Saturday.</p>
