   <p>The festival and jubilee, last Sunday, at the Hungarian House, when one hundred child members marched under the American and Hungarian flags, celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Verhovay Aid Association of the Thirty-seventh District.</p>
   <p>The bad weather kept many away, but those, who were present, enjoyed the nice program. Reverend Stephen E. Balough, of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Burnside, was the festival speaker and as a member of the Association, he spoke with all the warmth of his soul of its accomplishments during thirty years existence. At the table, during the supper, which was excellent, and which reflected the culinary skill of the cooks, representatives of the other Hungarian Associations made speeches, in which they wished the jubilarian good luck and future prosperity. Later there was dancing to the music of Szepessy's orchestra.</p>
