   <p>The House of Representatives voted unanimously for the Bill prepared by the Law-preparing Commission, by which from the beginning of the next year no non-citizens could be employed in any position paid out of public funds. Exempted from this rule are only the active or retired members of the armed forces of the U.S. and those teachers who are teaching foreign languages in schools. This bill will affect quite a few foreigners very severely, not only on the payrolls of the different departments, but also on the payrolls of the W.P.A. From now on a foreigner can be employed only on an affidavit of the President himself, stating that the service of the foreigner is exceptionally necessary, or on the affidavit,under oath,of the official who has the power to appoint,that there was no American citizen available to fill that position.</p>
