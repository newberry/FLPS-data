   <p>The Poor Orphan Association of Chicago gave again proof of its greatheartedness on Thanksgiving Day, when it presented ten poor families with food baskets worth five dollars apiece.</p>
   <p>The secretary of this benevolent institution is our compatriot Ferdinand Boldorjan, well known in Chicago as a benevolent and kindhearted person, who has already helped a great number of poor families with coal and warm clothing. If anybody, it is the Poor Orphan Association that deserves the esteem of the Hungarians. Its members are doing a most philanthropic work, by taking care of the needs of the orphans and the poor, who suffer very much in these hard times, and to whom it means much to see they are remembered by goodhearted people.</p>
   <p>We wish this Association good progress and prosperity, and entreat those aided by it to ask the blessing of the Lord on its unselfish work.</p>
