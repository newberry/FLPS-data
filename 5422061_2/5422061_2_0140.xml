   <p>Attention Hungarians! The Chicago Hungarian Independent Literary Society has gained the membership of two prominent theatrical artists. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kenessey formerly members of the New York Hungarian Theatrical Association have moved to Chicago and have joined the most prominent Hungarian Literary Society in the City of Chicago. These two artists have already put their shoulders to the wheel and are working on a musical comedy under the direction of Mr. Paul Bevak well-known Chicago Hungarian.</p>
   <p>This musical comedy, the name of which is "Trial Marriage", is in three acts, is filled with mirth, music and dancing. This musical comedy will be presented on November the third.</p>
   <p>This play will be a hundred per cent better than any play that has been <pb facs="5422061_2_0141.jpg" n="2"/>presented by this organization thus far.</p>
   <p>It is the sincere hope of this organization that all Chicago, Hungarians will be present to enjoy the comical antics of the players.</p>
   <p>Tickets to this play may be bought from any Hungarian business man.</p>
