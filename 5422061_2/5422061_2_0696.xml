   <p>The rainy weather had its ill-effects on two inter-city football matches. The two teams of the Milwaukee Tigers played against the two teams of the Hungarian Culture Club and were the guests of the latter.</p>
   <p>The game of the junior teams started at 1:15 P.M. at the Kuppenheimer field. The final score was 2-0 in favor of the Chicago club.</p>
   <p>At 3 o'clock, the Senior teams started their games. As the rain was pouring, the disposition of the teams was not improved. The final <pb facs="5422061_2_0697.jpg" n="2"/>score was a tie.</p>
   <p>After the games, there was a banquet at the Culture Home and the Chicago Junior Magyar Athletic Club team was presented with the beautiful Jackson cup. The players received gold minature footballs.</p>
   <p>We wish to congratulate the Culture Club for sponsoring two football teams and hope that success will crown them for their efforts.</p>
