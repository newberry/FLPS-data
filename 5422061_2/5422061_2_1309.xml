   <p>p.2..................The Chicago Tarsalgo Sick Benefit Society held a memorial celebration of our National holiday commemorating October 6, 1849. (on this day thirteen Hungarian generals were executed by the Austrians.)</p>
   <p>The regular monthly meeting took place earlier in the afternoon, Kalman Molnar presiding. After concluding the business of the Society, ex-president,Joseph Rakos, talked about the efforts of Lord Rothermere, chief editor of the London Daily Mail toward the ratification of the treaty of Trianon. "The members of the Tarsalgo, though many of them are citizens of the United States wish to identify themselves with the cause," said Mr. Rakos.</p>
   <p>Dr. Elemer Horvath was the guest speaker on this occasion. He compared October 1849 with October 1918 when,at the end of the World War, Hungary was a victim of grafting politicians. (Hungary became a republic for a short time in 1918. Later the Communists took over the government.)</p>

   <p>The text of the cablegram to Lord Rothermere from the Tarsalgo follows: "The Tarsalgo, one of the largest Hungarian organizations in and aroung Chicago with a membership of five-hundred, many of whom are American citizens,follows your activities in behalf of the Hungarians by demanding the revision of the treaty of Trianon. We plead with your Lordship to keep up this movement. We will do everything in our power to inform the American public of the injustice of this treaty to the Hungarians. Please accept our heartfelt gratitude for your blessed work."</p>
   <p>Kalman Molnar, president.</p>
   <p>Steven Tenkarcs, secretary.</p>
   <p>Joseph Rakos, Louis Szappanos,</p>
   <p>committee members.</p>
