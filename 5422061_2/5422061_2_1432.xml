   <p>About fifteen years ago, the Hungarians had a Reformed Church in the City, but is ceased to exist because it was over-burdened with debts that could not be liquidated. Since that time, the thousands of Hungarian Protestants on the North Side have had no church of their own. Due to the fact that other Protestant churches are too far from their homes, most of these Calvinists and Evangelical Hungarians do not belong to any church. It is improbable that many of them do not wish to lead a church life.</p>
   <p>Their need for a church is to be met on the initiative taken by a few people, who have invited all Hungarian Protestants to meet and discuss the situation at the St. Paul's Church, Orchard Street and Fullerton Parkway, Sunday November 18, at 11 A. M.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1433.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are very glad to be of assistance in this connection and publish the following notice:</p>
   <p>Dear Brethren:</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned, have discussed ways and means to re-organize the Chicago North Side Hungarian Reformed Church.</p>
   <p>To the best of our knowledge, there are hundreds of Hungarian Protestant families who felt the necessity of church life and, therefore, joined different churches, although these churches could not make them feel at home as would their own Hungarian church. Even though they extend a welcome, we feel lost among strangers. To be able to keep our Magyar language and our own Reformed faith, we must have our own church.</p>
   <p>We wish to restore this brotherly union. We have the moral and financial <pb facs="5422061_2_1434.jpg" n="3"/>support of friends, but the possibility of such a project is what we want to discuss at the St. Paul's Church, Sunday.</p>
   <p>We extend a brotherly invitation to you and your families to attend this church service and meeting.</p>
   <p>Hoping that this invitation will be accepted with confidence, we are:</p>
   <p>Fraternally,</p>
   <p>Sandor Buzy, 5229 Harper Avenue</p>
   <p>Joseph Csajaghy, 5345 Eddy Street</p>
   <p>Frank Kalman, 4233 North Francisco Ave.</p>
   <p>Louis Missty, 3945 N. Tripp Avenue</p>
   <p>Stephen Mathe, 1941 North Dayton Street</p>
   <p>Michael Vass, 1631 South 16th Street, Maywood.</p>
