   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Reformed Men's and Women's Sick Benefit Society issued a semiannual statement of their financial status and progress. The report shows that the total present membership is 341 and that cash assets are $4,778.89.</p>
   <p>These figures prove that the Society is solvent and able to fulfill its obligations to the members at all times. The junior branch has seventy-eight members. Any Protestant child of Protestant parents, who has passed his third, but has not reached his sixteenth birthday, can be a member of the junior branch. The new member, upon joining, pays twenty-five cents as an entry fee, for which he receives a booklet of bylaws and a badge. Monthly dues are fifteen cents, for which sum each member is entitled to receive twenty dollars upon death within six months after joining, forty dollars within a year, <pb facs="5422061_2_0832.jpg" n="2"/>seventy-five dollars within two to four years, and one hundred dollars after four years.</p>
   <p>Children over sixteen automatically become adult members of the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Men's and Women's Sick Benefit Society without any entry fee.....</p>
   <p>Applicants may present themselves at any of the regular meetings that are held once a month on the fourth Sunday of each month in the Reformed schoolroom, 652 East 92nd Street.....</p>
