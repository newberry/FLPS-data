   <p>In the United States there are many Hungarian societies, clubs, and other organizations, in which the elder generation takes the most prominent part. These organizations are very helpful. They serve such purposes as insurance and sick benefits, provide funds for benevolent institutions such as orphanages and old people's homes, etc. All these benefits are derived from the united efforts of members of each organization.</p>
   <p>Let us stop briefly to consider the aspirations of Hungarian youth. There are problems which confront our brethren and our efforts to solve them through organized groups. Our inherited culture must be protected. Our Magyar literature, the rich product of centuries of effort, is vital to our Hungarian history. Our forefathers have struggled undauntedly for the preservation and <pb facs="5422061_2_1133.jpg" n="2"/>future of our beloved Magyar race. Why should not we in America, among our youth, perpetuate the noble work of our ancestors? Knowledge alone does not bring about desired results. National spirit, unity, traditions, and Magyar inheritance must be injected into the organized Hungarian youth. There is a call for the union of the hundreds of Magyar youth for a common cause, a call for mutual responsibility and protection of our culture and to advocate our inherited aims. For what shall it profit if leaders have planned and patriots have sacrificed, unless we accept the challenge to unite for the promotion of our Magyar culture? The works of John Hunyady, King Mathias, Rakoczy, Szechenyi, Kossuth and of Count Stephen Tisza, stand as mighty memorials to our vision. But unless we do more than admire those achievements, unless we build upon them, these sacrifices become only a monument to our lack of vision. It is when we turn our eyes to the future that we feel a sense of responsibility <pb facs="5422061_2_1134.jpg" n="3"/>for such work.</p>
   <p>The Chi Sigma Gamma Sorority of Gary, Indiana, is an example of an organization, which is doing valuable work under the able leadership of its organizer, Miss Charlotte Miko.</p>
   <p>There is a need for similar organized Hungarian youth groups in the city of Chicago as well as in other large centers.</p>
   <p>Efforts are being made to unite the Hungarian youth. The editors of this paper are anxious to promote this cause, and will do everything in their power to cooperate.</p>
