   <p>The editors of this paper are whole heartedly with the Hungarian League of Chicago, but,due to unforeseen circumstances, could not be represented at the last meeting of the league. We will, however, keep our readers informed through Stephen Hattala who writes to us about a certain resolution passed at the last meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hattala writes to us as follows:</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the league referred to, the following resolution was passed: "The Chicago Hungarian League, consisting of chartered Hungarian Lodges and associations has found it necessary to step forward in defense of Hungarian American Citizens, both as individuals and as a group. It is our aim to prove that the Hungarian American citizen can perform all the duties of a good American citizen. The League, for this <pb facs="5422061_2_1348.jpg" n="2"/>reason, plans a giant celebration for the Fourth of July or American Independence Day. The League plans to have all Hungarian church congregations invited as well as all members of Hungarian Lodges, to celebrate this great day together, In this way we Hungarians, as a body,can show that we are good citizens and that we intend to fulfill all requirements of good citizenship." Stephen Hattala was the author of this resolution. The various organizational representatives present accepted the resolution unanimously. They also decided to appoint a nine man committee,which will visit all Hungarian lodges, whether members of the league or not, and extend to them a cordial invitation to attend this celebration.</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was also decided that all Hungarian newspapers will be asked to give this celebration as much publicity as possible. The next meeting of the league will be held on Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock, May 13, 1917 at Schlitz Hall. The secretary of the league will send out invitations to the Hungarian organizations in Chicago and urge that the representatives of each and every organization make it their business to be present, in order that a very fine program may be worked out. The league wants every living Hungarian <pb facs="5422061_2_1349.jpg" n="3"/>in Chicago and near vicinity to attend this giant demonstration of good American citizenship among the Hungarians. (Hattala)</p>
