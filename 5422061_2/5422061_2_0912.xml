   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Benefit Societies Association held their grand annual meeting at Kossuth Hall. The officers of the association and the delegates took part in the meeting.</p>
   <p>Due to important personal business Stephen Soltezs, the president, could not be present; his chair was occupied by Samuel Beluscsak vice-president, who opened the meeting with a welcoming speech, after which he asked that a committee be appointed to examine the letters of authorization of the representatives of associated societies. The examination finished, Joseph Fekete was elected business representative of the benefit societies represented at the meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and accepted and later the delegates examined the books of the Association, and found them to be in excellent shape.</p>

   <p>Alex Kirner, the secretary, reported that the total income of the association for the past year was $5,428.75; expenditures, $4,172.18; clear profit, $1,256.57.</p>
   <p>After this a recess was called for a period of one hour, during which time a real Hungarian dinner was served and heartily enjoyed by all. Immediately after dinner the meeting was reopened and all unfinished business was discussed.</p>
   <p>The secretary then read two letters with reference to group life insurance policies. These letters were from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and The Ancient Order of United Workers. The propositions offered by these companies were very inviting but the delegates rejected the offers.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0914.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The constitutional committee made some recommendations for revision of the constitution. These revisions were accepted.</p>
   <p>After this, new officers were elected for the coming year. They were as follows: George Mehok - president; Samuel Beluscsak, vice president; Frank Boszak, treasurer; John Rakaczky, secretary; and Alex Kirner, secretary-treasurer.</p>
   <p>Each organization had already selected their own delegates.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned in the early hours of the morning. Everyone seemed satisfied with the work accomplished at the meeting.</p>
