   <p>We were cheated in our expectations when we waited for Countess Karolyi to arrive in Chicago on Saturday morning because she had arrived the previous evening. This misunderstanding was caused by her manager, who had notified the committee two weeks previously that she would arrive in Chicago on Saturday. This committee in turn notified us to this effect.</p>
   <p>Among the people who were also disappointed, there was one group of Hungarian women, consisting of members and officers of the Chicago Hungarian Independent and Benevolent Ladies Society. Had we not known that they were Hungarian women, we would have believed they were members of the American committee, so elegant and impressive was their appearance.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0679.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After a rather lengthy discussion, it was decided that a committee of four present a bouquet of flowers to Countess Karolyi at the lecture she was to hold Saturday noon at the La Salle Hotel.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Frank Glancz president of the Ladies Society, Mrs. Henry Vogel, Mrs. Leo Laszlo, and Mrs. Klein arrived at the Hotel La Salle at one P. M., and presented Countess Karolyi with a bouquet, consisting of roses and chrysanthemums. The presentation was made in the presence of some of the leading citizens of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In making the presentation, Mrs. Glancz made a very impressive and heartfelt speech. Countess Karolyi thanked each one individually, expressing her appreciation and hope of being with these noble ladies in the near future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ignac Izsak welcomed the Countess, and congratulated her upon the grand <pb facs="5422061_2_0680.jpg" n="3"/>work done in the interest of the people of Hungary. These interesting speeches were heard at a luncheon which was sponsored by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. There were five hundred people present, among whom were some of the most prominent people of Chicago. There were approximately twenty-five of the more prominent Hungarians present also.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the luncheon, Mr. Victor Elting, one of Chicago's prominent citizens, and also chairman of the reception committee, in eloquent remarks, introduced Countess Karolyi.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi appeared on the stage dressed in black, and was a beautiful picture to behold. At first, she spoke the English language fluently, but later, while referring to notes, she spoke with a very pleasing Hungarian accent.</p>
   <p>She spoke for one hour, and the people listened very attentively, being <pb facs="5422061_2_0681.jpg" n="4"/>interrupted only on occasions of applause. It was not only heard by those present, but also by the outside world by means of a national radio hookup.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi's speech had two principal parts: One was the explanation of the Hungarian aristocracy, the other part was devoted to the political situations in Hungary as it has been since the World War, and the part Mihaly Karolyi played in this political setup.</p>
   <p>We, who are acquainted with the Hungarian upper class, were surprised at the frankness and accuracy with which she dealt with the Hungarian barons, counts, and dukes, who are to blame for the unfortunate situation of Hungary. She painted a word picture of the most intimate life of these noble gentlemen, and with a few humorous sayings, she immediately connected her story with the political life of Hungary.</p>
   <p>She then spoke of the arrogant, bloated society which looks down on the <pb facs="5422061_2_0682.jpg" n="5"/>common people with contempt, and represents the governing body of Hungary. With historical accuracy, she related the political history of Hungary from Kossuth to the present Horthy regime.</p>
   <p>The part played by Mihaly Karolyi in the last ten years was emphasized as she saw it when she was Countess Katinka Andrassy, and her viewpoint after she became the wife of Mihaly Karolyi.</p>
   <p>The political part of her speech was so correctly built up, and was given so accurately that the part of the audience who knew the political history of Hungary from close range, was completely surprised. She not only tried to be sincerely loyal, but she was also brave in presenting her facts.</p>
   <p>Without any fear, she pointed out the betrayals and sorrowful incidents which were caused by the League of Nations, America, and the Entente, in the unfair division of Hungary, and while this was being done, the Karolyi <pb facs="5422061_2_0683.jpg" n="6"/>government's stronghold was being torn apart. They wanted to force Karolyi to agree to the crippling of Hungary. She discussed these facts so bravely that even those who are not her followers are fully satisfied that she does not represent the upper class, nor the Horthy government, but that she is here for the sole purpose of bettering the condition of the Hungarians and the entire Hungarian nation. It is for their interest and future that she is making these sacrifices. At this point, Countess Karolyi answered a few questions, and this notable lecture and luncheon came to an end.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi personally introduced herself to the Hungarian people who were present, and expressed her wish to come back to Chicago shortly to see the large number of working Hungarians who reside in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians not only owe Countess Karolyi a vote of thanks and gratitude for delivering such an educational lecture to the prominent people of Chicago, but we must also thank the Chicago Council of Foreign <pb facs="5422061_2_0684.jpg" n="7"/>Relations Committee for giving Countess Karolyi the opportunity to present her viewpoints, and relate the manner in which the people of Hungary have awakened. Now we can see our position and understand our own history and future development.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi held a lecture daily at different places, presenting her problem before distinguished personalities. She was honored at teas and banquets at many exclusive and prominent places. Her five day stay in Chicago was a real success in connection with her appearances and lectures, which prove the high esteem in which Countess Karolyi is held, and on the other hand, it was an honor to the people of Hungary to have their problems of democracy and the future of the Hungarian people presented by such an apostolic figure as the Countess, who preaches and lives for the interest of her people.</p>
