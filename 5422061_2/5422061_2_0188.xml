   <p>Since Eugene Endrey announced that he would continue the activities of the Chicago Hungarian Peoples Theatre for the third consecutive year, there has been a great deal of interest shown by the Hungarian people in this great cultural activity.</p>
   <p>With this announcement Endrey has started to write a new page in the history of the Chicago Hungarians. This is a move of which the Chicago Hungarian people can be mighty proud.</p>
   <p>When Eugene Endrey created the Peoples Theatre he gave something to the Hungarian people of which they had dreamed but had never dared to create. The Hungarian people owe him a vote of thanks for organizing a permanent Hungarian Theatre where the cultural jewels of Hungary will be preserved and passed on to our children.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0189.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We realize that the idea of the permanent Hungarian theatre was not conceived by Endrey, but he was the only one who dared to risk his time, money and energy in a project of this kind.</p>
   <p>The reason that Endrey was successful in his theatrical activities in Chicago was because he presented productions which were the best in every respect, and he thereby won the Hungarian theatre-going public to his side.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians have taken Endrey into their hearts, and now the Hungarian theatre is more than a financial success--it is a moral success to both the public and Endrey.</p>
   <p>When the Hungarian Peoples Theatre closed its second season, Endrey found that it was an immense success financially and he decided that the third year should be made a banner [year].</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0190.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Aiding him in all this work Endry had his wife, Margaret Padly, whom the people have come to know only as "our Margaret."</p>
   <p>Eugene Endrey has done his part.</p>
   <p>Now it is up to the Chicago Hungarians to continue to support this great cultural activity.</p>
   <p>In order that he shall be able to make his plans for the future, Endrey has decided at this time to sell season passes. By doing this he can devote more time to the production of his plays because his time is not lost in promoting ticket sales and worrying about finances for the future.</p>
   <p>Eugene Endrey is not asking for a favor when he asks us to buy those season passes. But he knows that it is the duty of every good Hungarian to help promote Hungarian cultural activities in Chicago and throughout the United <pb facs="5422061_2_0191.jpg" n="4"/>States.</p>
   <p>Endrey would like to sell 300 season passes, but we think that he shouldn't have any trouble in getting of 500. We Hungarians love the theatre, so we must show Endrey that we really appreciate his honest theatrical activities by subscribing for these season passes.</p>
