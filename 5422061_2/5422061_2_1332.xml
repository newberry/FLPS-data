   <p>The first Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society celebrated March 15 as a national holiday last Saturday night. A large crowd was in attendance.</p>
   <p>About 9 P.M. Mr. Joseph Rakos, the old Chicago-Hungarian warrior, who had charge of the affair, made a very short speech, but it carried a lot of weight. The National Anthem of the United States and Hungary was then sung. The president of this organization formally opened the celebration. The Thalia Literary and Song Society also contributed selections to the program by having its chorus appear. The chorus sang several Hungarian songs, and also presented a short, patriotic play. Then, there were <pb facs="5422061_2_1333.jpg" n="2"/>several short speeches, including a speech by the editor of this paper, Mr. Martin Benedek.</p>
   <p>A moving picture was then shown entitled "The Hozsanna of the New Hungary." This was followed by a vocal solo by Miss Julia Nagy, accompanied at the piano by Josehp B. Mayer.</p>
   <p>The celebration was not only a financial success, but also had educational and cultural value.</p>
