   <p>p. 2...Many prominent people were invited to the North Side Turner Hall at the suggestion of Congressman Britten to hear Brentano, American ambassador to Hungary, talk of the Davies plan. During the speech he favorably commented on the conditions in Hungary. They are making progress in National recovery. Many rumors widespread in this country, to the contrary are not based upon facts. Brentano said that Hungary suffered greatly under KAROLY and BELA KUN, but now has nearly recovered.</p>
   <p>Brentano's address was greeted enthusiastically by an audience of approximately one thousand. There were few Hungarians due to the fact that they weren't notified by the management. A few were invited in the last minute.</p>
