   <p>The Senate is again discussing further restrictive measures regarding immigration--it wants to rescind the quota based on nationality that President Hoover proposed last year.</p>
   <p>Of the many amendments presented before the House Immigration Committee, several had to be discarded. Among the proposed amendments, the one offered by Senator Black of Alabama (Democrat) is the most vindictive in its attitude toward foreigners. Black's amendment advocates the complete suspension of all immigration for three years to improve working conditions in the country.</p>
   <p>The proposal was voted down by a very small margin. A few more votes would have sufficed to carry it to the House.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1564.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many Senators voted in favor of repealing the quota based on national or racial origin. It is not improbable that debate will be centered upon an amendment to limit only the quotas of certain countries, thus further increasing the quotas of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.</p>
