   <p>The Italian Opera Company gave a brilliant performance last Sunday at the Ashland Auditorium, where the gay opera of Rossini, "The Barber of Seville," was brought to the stage with phenomenal success.</p>
   <p>About twenty-five hundred people enjoyed the opera, the music for which was played by the orchestra directed by the celebrated Dino Bigalli.</p>
   <p>In the role of "Count Almavivo," Luigi Ruffino earned a unique success with his sweet ringing tenor. As "Figaro," the young baritone Mario Fiorella easily enthralled the audience, which rewarded him with long applause. Charles Hatvari gave an excellent rendition of "Fiorello". Even in this smaller role, Hatvari proved his talent as an opera singer and artist. His next greater role will be in "La Traviata", Verdi's famous opera.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0093.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of the Hungarian public to these popular artistc performances, to which the highest admission fee is only a dollar, and where, for as low a price as fifty cents, one can enjoy performances which rival those given by the Civic Opera itself.</p>
   <p>The other members of the Italian Opera Company, most of whom are ex-members of the late Civic Opera, did their supporting roles excellently.</p>
   <p>[Translator's Note: Charles Hatvari is a Hungarian immigrant.]</p>
