   <p>We are standing before a new era in the social life of the Chicago Hungarians. It looks as though the Hungarian societies are beginning to understand modern conditions, and have found the correct method by which the smaller ones can consolidate-- this will surely mean success.</p>
   <p>A meeting was called last Sunday at the Prudential Hall. The enthusiasm with which the delegates took part in this meeting seems to indicate that consolidation will come very quickly.</p>
   <p>When the consolidation takes place it will mean added strength for the organizations involved.</p>
   <p>There has been talk of political activities in the consolidation process. We believe that creed and politics should be left out; these new activities are in the interest of all Chicago Hungarians, and the future of their social life <pb facs="5422061_2_1169.jpg" n="2"/>depends on the success of this consolidation.</p>
   <p>After the amalgamation we think that these organizations should become more interested in the activities of the Hungarian youth since they will or will not be the future members depending on what is done for them now.</p>
   <p>Naturally many of our ideas must be changed to conform with more modern and American ones. These changes will benefit both young and old in their future social life.</p>
