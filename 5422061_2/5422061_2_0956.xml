   <p>The ways of justice are deeply furrowed and full of thorns, but if those who believe in justice are undaunted, if they believe in eventual victory, then that victor will be realized, and will bear the fruit of understanding and love.</p>
   <p>Perhaps we have summarized in the above sentence the successful opening of the Magyar Home.</p>
   <p>If we consider the widespread agitation and conscious malice of some factions against the builders of the Home and all their sympathizers, we have to pay tribute to our simple, hardworking compatriots, who <pb facs="5422061_2_0957.jpg" n="2"/>resolutely followed the dictates of their hearts and came to celebrate the opening.....</p>
   <p>And the Magyars came from the North Side, Burnside, West Pullman, South Chicago, South Deering, East Chicago, and other neighboring small towns. They came to prove with their presence that they approved the purpose of the Magyar Home.</p>
   <p>They listened entrances to Paul Berak's play, the Birds of Passage," every word of which reached their hearts. In this play Berak made deathless the pattern of the American-Hungarian soul, and even though he is not rewarded as well as his fashionable contemporaries, his memory will live in the hearts of our people long after the other authors are forgotten.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0958.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Not only the people, but the consul, Istvan Scheffbeck, came to the celebration.....</p>
   <p>And the Magyars came and their hopes were not disappointed.</p>
