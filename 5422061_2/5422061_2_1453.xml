   <p>We are rushing ahead on the wings of time. Each year robs us of a part of our life. Time's swiftly moving chariot carries us away from our course against our will.</p>
   <p>We immigrants from Hungary have had this experience. Almost all of us came to this country with the intention of staying here for only a few years and returning to the land of our birth, to die and rest where the remains of our forefathers lie.</p>
   <p>However, as years went by we were diverted from our original purpose, and today when we sing the Hungarian hymn, "Here you must live and die"--in spite of our undying love for our mother country--we mean America.</p>
   <p>From Hungarian wanderers we became home-building Americans. And, lest the <pb facs="5422061_2_1454.jpg" n="2"/>onrush of time sweep us away, we must keep together, rally around the altars of our faith, so that we may be strong in unity. Today there is hardly one among us who can say that he will not join a society or church in America, because he is going back to Hungary. As the years have gone by, our course has been changed. Therefore, let us heed the warning of the New Year: "Hungarian-Americans, patronize your institutions; join the church and society groups, so that the onrush of time will not carry you with it and leave not a trace behind!"</p>
   <p>In Chicago and vicinity the immigrant Hungarians have built and are supporting a number of Reformed churches. These churches welcome all members of the Reformed and Evangelical faiths.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Zion Classis has formulated the following rules for us to abide by:</p>
   <p>"The presbytery of each church is to appoint a committee who, together with <pb facs="5422061_2_1455.jpg" n="3"/>the pastor, will visit members or prospective members and have them pledge their support. Those who have become members must promise to contribute to the church fund and to missionary purposes. Only those who make a written pledge will be considered members in good standing. Only members in good standing will be entitled to the services of the pastor and can par-take of the Sacraments.</p>
   <p>"Eugene Boros, Dean,</p>
   <p>"Burnside Hungarian Reformed Church".....</p>
