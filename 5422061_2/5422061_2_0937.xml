   <p>The meeting of the Hungarian-American Old People's Home took place on March 22, 1936 in the Herzl-Hall. It was called by its treasurer, Mr. Alexander Buzy, and secretary-treasurer, Rev. Gregor Garay.</p>
   <p>At this meeting the Tarsalga Association was represented by its president, Joseph Rakos; the 317th branch of the Woodmen of the World, by Nandor Legrady, president, and Steve Ihasz, secretary; the Woodmen Circle 137, by Mrs. Nandor Legrady, secretary; the 164th branch of the Verhovay Aid Association, by Joseph Iroczky, treasurer, and Ernest Kunstadt, secretary. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Nandor Legrady, and the recorder was Ernest Kunstadt.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Buzy asked those present to look through the books of the Old People's Home and to give their opinions openly to the public.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0938.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chairman Legrady and Mr. Ihasz, a member, noticed, with surprise, that the roll of the members and their donations were kept in the official book of the No. Sixty-six branch of the Woodmen of the World, from which book forty-one pages were previously removed. The number of members was only 594 and not many thousands as advertised. Reverend Garay read every item of income from his book which was checked in the treasurer's book by Mr. Ihasz and Mrs. Legrady. The receipts were summarized as follows:</p>

   <p>Mr. Buzy reported that the amount of $302.04, which was shown above under June 1, 1935 was the profit of the concert in the Congress Hotel in Chicago, which Secretary David Kovach entered in the books, but which money was still in custody of Louis Szappanos and the Board of Control.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0939.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Reverend Garay read all the outgoing items since may 28, 1935. The books of the treasurer were checked again by Mr. Ihasz and Mrs. Legrady.</p>
   <p>The payments were summarized by months as follows:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>1935 June</cell>
     <cell>$349.79</cell>

   </table>
   <p>Mr. Ihasz protested against some items to which Mr. Buzy replied that the debts were contracted by Secretary Kovach and he could do nothing but pay the presented bills.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Legrady remarked that on August 20, 1935, there was an item of $6 approved by the president for the Hungarian Daily Szabadsag, which was <pb facs="5422061_2_0940.jpg" n="4"/>paid out, but there was no receipt for it. There was no receipt for an item on Sept. 6 as payment for the laborers on the farm of the Home. The treasurer explained that money was paid out personally by the Vice-President, George Soltesz, and Reverend Garay direct to the workers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ihasz protested the payment of $25 to the treasurer, which boosts the above shown expenditures to $923.53.</p>
   <p>The last amount was paid out by the treasurer for the 100 raffle-tickets, which were missing at the ticket counting meeting of the auto raffle held in 1935 in Burnside. Mrs. Stromp, the secretary-treasurer of the Tarsalga, by a mistake, did not return the 100 tickets and so, to be able to make the accounting, Mr. Buzy, the present treasurer, who in that time was only an enthusiastic supporter of the idea of the Old People's Home, covered the amount out of his own pocket.</p>
   <p>On March 27, 1936, Mrs. Stromp, 3647 Bosworth Ave., sent to Mr. Kunstadt, the recorder, the following statement under oath and signed before a public notary:</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0941.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"I, the undersigned, do hereby state, that I returned to Alexander Buzy unsold raffle tickets of the Hungarian Old People's Home to the amount of $25 on August 11, 1935.</p>
   <p>Signed: Mrs. Albert Stromp."</p>
   <p>The following amounts for which payments were made in checks to the banks, are still open, as the checks are not yet cashed:</p>

   </table>
   <p>The assets in cash of the Hungarian-American Old People's Home on March 22, 1936 were $.30, besides the $26.60 in checks, which are still uncashed, and are deposited in the I. C. Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0942.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The meeting ordered the books of the Old People's Home to be handed over by the treasurer and secretary-treasurer to the newly-elected officers, who are in the State of Indiana, but only under the condition, that the new officers are willing that a certified copy of these books be made at the expense of the Old People's Home, so that by these copies the old officers and the certifiers of this protocol will be covered.</p>
   <p>The meeting ordered the recorder to send a copy of this protocol to the president for 1936, Mr. George Soltesz, and to the newspapers in Chicago for publication, but the original protocol will remain in the care of the chairman, Nandor Legrady.</p>
