   <p>p.1....John Hertz, president of the Yellow Cab Co. told reporters that he will retire from business.</p>
   <p>Hertz was born in Hungary. In the years before the World War he began a taxi business with a few old automobiles. The business grew and became the Yellow Cab Co. The growth of this venture stands without a parallel in the business world. Immense profits and large dividends followed so that Hertz became a millionaire in a few years. In 1920 the Yellow Cab Co. bought out their only rival, the Shaw Taxi Co., and in this way became the leading taxicab company in America.</p>
   <p>Hertz organized the Chicago Bus Company and later the Saint Louis and New York Bus systems. A few years ago he founded the Hertz "Drive-it-yourself system.</p>

   <p>The General Motors Co. bought the Yellow Cab Co. and this transaction netted Hertz and his friends a handsome profit.</p>
   <p>John Hertz today is a multi-millionaire and he is only fifty years old. When he retires he will pursue his hobby and find pleasure in his racing stables.</p>
