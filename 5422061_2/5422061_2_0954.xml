   <p>For the reassurance of our readers, we are publishing herewith the contents of a registered letter we sent to Vince Kohl, secretary of the Virgin Mary Society, two weeks ago, and to which we have not received an answer to date. With this we have done our duty.</p>
   <p>"July 13, 1928.</p>
   <p>"To the Secretary of the Virgin Mary Society:</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Secretary: We have received several inquiries lately about the financial status of the Magyar Home of the Virgin Mary Society. Various reports are circulated among the Hungarians, but we want to know the truth from the proper source, from the directors of the Magyar Home.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we ask you to show us the financial statement of the Magyar <pb facs="5422061_2_0955.jpg" n="2"/>Home. What are the liabilities and what is the capital? What was the net income in the first six months of 1928?</p>
   <p>"Is it true that the interest coupons due on the first of January could not be cashed because of lack of funds?</p>
   <p>"Is it true that interest coupons due on July first could not be paid to the mortgage bondholders?</p>
   <p>"We are asking for an answer to these questions because we wish to inform our readers and others. We believe that inasmuch as the Magyar Home is a public institution, built by public support, there is no necessity for secrecy.</p>
   <p>"Your detailed and accurate reply is requested within a week.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Samuel Sandor, editor."</p>
