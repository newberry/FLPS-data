   <p>The Reformed of the West Side were eye and ear witnesses recently of the progress our children made in acquiring the knowledge of our beautiful sounding native language. This Sunday in connection with the closing of the summer school there was a graduating festival, at which forty-two pupils, all future good Hungarian-Americans, played a nationalistic play, The Presage"; a remarkable good performance, and a great success.</p>

   <p>Burnside Reformed Summer School held its season-closing examination this Sunday. The parents and the rest of the public heard with delight the progress the newest generation had made in the language of our native country. The children's show, the group-dances and the recitals are deserving of every praise, which is due not only the performers, but also their teachers. The yearly bazaar, which was held in conjunction with this examination was, as always, a great success. At the "reformed's " on the Southside, it is quite a tradition, that when they gather for amusement, everybody must become happy and those who come to them, cannot help but have a good time.</p>
