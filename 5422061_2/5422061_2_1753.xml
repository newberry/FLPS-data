   <p>The Cleveland Szabadsag (Liberty) is the initiator of a national pilgrimage to Hungary. The pilgrims will sail on the Berengaria on August 8.....According to plans, the cost of the tour will be much less than it would be if a person were to undertake to make the trip alone.... The other remarkable feature of this voyage is that it will be free from Hungarian and American politics. It has been decided that inasmuch as a trip like this is an unforgettable event in the lives of most of the pilgrims, it would be sinful to dim their pleasure with political differences.</p>
   <p>The majority of American Hungarians earn their livelihood by physical labor. In their lives it is an outstanding goal to be able to visit the country of their birth, their relatives and friends. In addition to these joys, the sea voyage is a restful vacation.....</p>
   <p>Travel is the best education. To see the world and to mingle with strange people provide an opportunity for learning. For those who are going to Europe <pb facs="5422061_2_1754.jpg" n="2"/>for the first time, a new world will open. For those who have been in America for many years, Europe will look different from what it looked like when they left. We think that it is a wise thing for old settlers to take their American-born children with them on this pilgrimage. It will give them an opportunity to know the land of their forefathers.</p>
   <p>The leaders of this tour are all well qualified to take charge of this pilgrimage. We recommend wholeheartedly to all our readers the advantages of this pilgrimage.</p>
