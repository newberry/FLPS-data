   <p>Under ordinary circumstances, we would blush to write about the lethargic state, the indifference, the deep rut into which the Amosz has sunk. [Translator's note. Amosz stands for Amerikai Magyar Orszagos Szovetseg--American Hungarian National Federation.]</p>
   <p>However, during the past five months we have witnessed such unforeseen failures--old and powerful institutions have collapsed and become bankrupt--that the agonized struggle of the infant American Hungarian National Federation is not surprising.</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that we are examining these pathological symptoms from a scientific angle, we will disregard our scientific verdict, and--as is customary at the bedside of a gravely ill person--we will discuss a cure and <pb facs="5422061_2_1255.jpg" n="2"/>convalescence.</p>
   <p>The sick, that is, the laymen, are interested only in success and successful methods and anything else is immaterial to them. Let us, therefore, get on with our objective.</p>
   <p>Organization in the Amosz ceased in the middle of operations. Financial, personal, external, and internal circumstances disturbed the work.</p>
   <p>Martin Himler writes courageously in a crude but well-meaning manner, that the cause of stagnation can primarily be attributed to personal disputes. He places the blame squarely upon the president and the organizing secretary of the Amosz.....</p>
   <p>We confess that we think that all churches and their members should be a part of this National Federation, because without them unity cannot become a <pb facs="5422061_2_1256.jpg" n="3"/>reality.....</p>
   <p>There was quite a bit of pressure from the clergy at the convention in Buffalo, but we never claimed that they are at fault. They are performing their duty only when they co-operate with each other and use their influence when and where they can.</p>
   <p>We blame those liberal thinkers who criticize from the outside instead of co-operating with the liberal element within (the Amosz) so that the clergy's conservative leadership could be counteracted.</p>
   <p>Martin Himler started a rescue movement. He advises a change of president. With this change, he hopes to give the vehicle of the Amosz, which is in a rut, a push.</p>
   <p>Quick and thoughtful action is necessary. One more misstep and the Buffalo infant will die as did all of its little brethren.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1257.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The responsibility for a successful rescue rests with the foster parents of the Amosz--the newspapers and the clergy. The responsibility for the possible failure of the rescue also rests with them. They must weigh the consequences of the death of the Amosz.</p>
   <p>We cannot resurrect the dead, but we could try to save the ailing, if there is any possibility to do so.</p>
   <p>If no member of the clergy would have had a seat on the wagon of the Amosz, we would suggest a pastor to pull us out of the rut, a feat which we laymen could not accomplish.</p>
   <p>However, as the situation stands now, we already have many pastors among the leaders, and the only remedy offered is a change in title and location. To this proposition we have nothing to say.....</p>
   <p>We are not afraid of the devil....not even of the Reverend Elmer Eordogh (the <pb facs="5422061_2_1258.jpg" n="5"/>devil).</p>
   <p>We have been criticized enough by our communist, socialist, radical, and liberal friends for having remained loyal to the Amosz.</p>
   <p>We can find our place in the framework of the Amosz without giving up our beliefs, but we would like to see whether it is worth while to suffer the criticisms of our friends or not. We would like to see and support the work of at least two hundred and sixty-four thousand members in behalf of the Hungarians in America, and in their name ask for consideration for the millions of our brethren in Europe. At the present time, the Amosz has sixty-four thousand members, who only dream and do nothing.</p>
