   <p>Those of our readers who follow attentively what goes on in the Hungarian colony of Chicago have undoubtedly read in the last week's issue of our paper about the small group of Hungarians who undertook the noble task of founding the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association. For quite a long time the need for such an association had been felt, and not to have thought of it before is a shameful blot on the Chicago Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Every national group in America, even the smallest, has its own national cemetery; only we Hungarians, who number approximately fifty thousand in this great metropolis, had no cemetery of our own. It seems that in this respect, too, the curse of the poet who said, "There is a curse upon the Hungarians, because they do not stick together," is upon us.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1470.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This curse has been ruling us until now not only in life but also after death.</p>
   <p>However, a small but enthusiastic group of Hungarians have at last come forward. Their brave determination to try the hitherto impossible has gained them many adherents among such of their countrymen as have become acquainted with their project. In one week's time those in sympathy with the cemetery idea have contracted and paid for enough land to enable the sponsors of the idea to take an option on eight thousand and four hundred lots in one of Chicago's oldest and most beautiful cemeteries. It is now up to the Chicago Hungarians to continue successfully the work that has been begun.</p>
   <p>The founders are worthy of having their names recorded in our newspaper, which we will do in a future issue.</p>
   <p>We wish to quote the words said in this respect during the March 15 celebration by Hungary's official representative, Laszlo Medgyessy, Hungarian Consul in Chicago. "It makes me happy that the Chicago Hungarians are successfully <pb facs="5422061_2_1471.jpg" n="3"/>planning a project so necessary to the Hungarians here. This celebration of March will have a twofold meaning in the history of the Chicago Hungarians, inasmuch as it not only commemorates the date of our declaration of independence (March 15, 1848) but also marks the date of the founding of the Hungarian Cemetery.</p>
   <p>"No nation can be great unless it records the accomplishments of its people for future generations; nor can a nation be great unless its future generations can point with pride to the accomplishments of their ancestors. With this Hungarian Cemetery, the Chicago Hungarians have inscribed their names forever in the history of America."</p>
