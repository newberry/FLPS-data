   <p>A large crowd filled the Hall of the Wage Earners Home Sunday evening to hear a lecture by Hugo Laenne, former organizing director of the Independence party of Hungary and Undersecretary of the Interior in the cabinet of Karolyi. He gave an extremely instructive lecture on "Hungary's Position in the New Europe".</p>
   <p>Hugo Laehne is probably the only politician from Hungary who can speak competently on this topic. He has a record of thirty years of clean politics. During all that time he fought constantly for the rights of the poor.</p>
   <p>In his lecture, Hugo Laehne touched all the political and economical questions of Europe, and concluded with the assertion that Hungary can hope for the possibility of a happier future only in the frame of a Danubian Confederation, the organization of which was Louis Kossuth's own idea.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0648.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The question of Revision [of the Trianon Treaty], which at present is discussed at every step, was also included in his lecture. He said that it was impossible to think of a peaceful revision, inasmuch as neither Rumania, nor Czechoslovakia, nor Jugoslavia are willing to give up any of the territories given them by the treaty [of Trianon], adding that any attempt at revision is threatened with war, since the Little Entente will oppose with arms any such move.</p>
   <p>On the voice of Hugo Laehne one could feel not the experienced politician (which he undoubtedly is), but the Hungarian heart aching for the fate of Hungary--a heart speaking to other Hungarian hearts. This is what made this lecture so interesting.</p>
   <p>Laehne's lecture was followed by a discussion which lasted one and a half hour.</p>
   <p>By arranging this lecture, the Cultural Federation has proved again that it is ready to serve all parties alike.</p>
