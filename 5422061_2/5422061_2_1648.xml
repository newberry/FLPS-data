   <p>The immigrant today is a man we must take care of. He needs and deserves attention and thoughtful consideration; its our duty to help him.</p>
   <p>Economically he is a potential asset which we should appreciate. Help him understand the American point of value, and he will become a cheerful and hardworking American just as the rest of us who have preceded him. It is to our benefit, that this man should be able to take care of himself, learn our language and keep his mind hopeful.</p>
   <p>If we want to be loyal to ourselves, we should consider basic principles and find good reasons for doing all in our power to reveal America to this man. We can help him get a truer and more invigorating understanding of freedom, and show him the advantages of our democracy; we can help him get adjusted to <pb facs="5422061_2_1649.jpg" n="2"/>the American way of living. We should teach him to fight for higher ideals and show him how to realize them. We must get inside this man and see this country as he sees it, but also look back to the land from which he came; and then we must make him realize that this land has accepted him and becomes his foster mother.</p>
