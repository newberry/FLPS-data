   <p>March 15 is a red-letter day on every Hungarian calendar. The thought of the glorious, victorious, and sad years of 1848 and 1849 was not taught to this Hungarian generation in schools, but was instilled in them with their mothers' milk.....</p>
   <p>Two dates are conspicuous in those years: March 15, the day of the outbreak; and October 5, the day of the execution of the martyrs. The overthrow of the Hapsburg dynasty, the declaration of independence and of the republic was related in history books, but no celebration of these days was allowed on Hungarian soil.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1760.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even today it is not permitted; to be more precise, the prohibition is stricter today than fifteen years ago! In Hungary today the celebration of the eventful days of 1848 will be as strictly censored as in the time of Bach.....</p>
   <p>There still is no freedom of press and speech. The oppressors, with the aid of the police and the army, are watchful. There is no liberty, equality nor brotherly love. Government by the people is still a dream, a hope.</p>
   <p>In place of these, there is a dictatorship, Numerus Clausas, a kingless kingdom, political emigration, a reactionary government, class and religious persecution, and the pitiless oppression of political freedom.</p>
   <p>From March 15, 1848 until October 6, 1849 the Magyars dared to demand their human rights. They were ready to die for their cause. Some of them did die....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1761.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us not grieve. The Magyars will dare to demand their rights again. We send this message to our brethren across the ocean: "Think of something great and daring and stake your life on it. Whatever the ultimate destiny, everything is not lost for those who do not weary."</p>
