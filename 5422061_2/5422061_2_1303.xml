   <p>The whole American nation will celebrate the two hundredth birthday of George Washington on February 22. It is proper for us Hungarians to remember this great American and his deeds.</p>
   <p>Washington insured liberty for us to such a great extent that nowhere else on this earth is it equalled. The freedom enjoyed by the people of this country is envied by all other nations. If we consider how this country grew from the original thirteen colonies to the present forty-eight states which are bound together by love of freedom and liberty, we must know that we have George Washington to thank for this. He is deservedly called the Father of his Country. We need not fear that the unity of these forty-eight states and the American people can ever be broken.</p>
   <p>It would be most desirable to have commemoration service in all our Hungarian churches on the Sunday preceding February 22.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1304.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Societies and other organizations should also commemorate this two hundredth birthday of Washington. The committee of Hungarians appointed for this purpose will gladly send speakers who will acquaint the audience in detail about the greatness of George Washington to any gathering.</p>
   <p>We must mention here that Gen. Frank Perker has advised us that on July 4, at Soldiers' Field, there will be a military and naval field day celebration. The procession preceding the celebration will include floats. We have been asked to take part and wear our national costumes. Those wishing to participate will please inquire for further details from the secretary of the Hungarian sub-committee.</p>
