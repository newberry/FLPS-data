   <p>For more than fifteen years we have served the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity with unfailing regularity.....</p>
   <p>Our record of the past fifteen years proves that our only aim is to give our readers the best by making this newspaper so interesting as to keep our large number of readers eagerly waiting for each successive issue.</p>
   <p>To accomplish this, we have never spared any expense. On the contrary, we have grasped every opportunity in an endeavor to make our paper more interesting and satisfactory.....</p>
   <p>Our readers show their appreciation for our work with their subscriptions and, in return, we wish to give them a bigger, more compact newspaper.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune, beginning with today's issue, will be published in seven <pb facs="5422061_2_0528.jpg" n="2"/>(instead of six) columns, which means an added page of reading matter to our readers.</p>
   <p>We wish to announce at this time that although this paper appears in a new format, our policy remains the same.</p>
   <p>We will fight for the rights of the Hungarian working class in the future, too. We will use the whip against the oppressors of our people and those who attempt to disrupt American-Hungarian unity.....</p>
