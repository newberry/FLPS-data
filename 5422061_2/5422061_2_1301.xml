   <p>The congregation of the Virgin Mary Hungarian Roman Catholic Church held a very successful evening last Sunday, at which a beautiful play and an artistic program were presented. Those true Hungarians who are always struggling in behalf of all Hungarian institutions and tirelessly guard their future, so close to their hearts, were again present in great numbers.</p>
   <p>The play, "The Mute Man", was skillfully directed by Reverend Steve Nagy, who acted as master of ceremonies. The public was very much pleased with both the play and the program. [Translator's note: Here the article gives the names of the twenty-four amateur players, musicians, etc., who contributed to the success of the evening.] The public, which stayed long after the performance dancing and enjoying itself, left enriched with the memory of an evening well spent.</p>
