   <p>We are in the midst of a great religious holiday. There are approximately five million people in this city who are observing this religious holiday.</p>
   <p>Cardinal Bonzano is here representing the Pope. Besides him, there are approximately a million and a half other people here for the Catholic Eucharistic Congress.</p>
   <p>The activities of the Eucharistic Congress interest the entire world regardless of religion.</p>
   <p>People from every part of the world are attracted here by the Eucharistic Congress not only because of religious attitudes, but because of the education derived from this religious function, and this is an affair which cannot be seen every day.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1392.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From a religious standpoint the Catholic people are represented officially, and the Hungarian people also are represented by Monsignor John Csernoch.</p>
   <p>Monsignor Csernoch is here from Hungary with a staff of forty people consisting of priests, brothers, and sisters.</p>
   <p>The forty people who are here representing Hungary have come here for the sake of religion, for they come from a country which is very poor, and they have come under great difficulties due to finances.</p>
   <p>There was a great Hungarian Catholic meeting held at the St. Lawrence Church Hall where Consignor Csernoch gave a very interesting lecture on religion and conditions existing in Europe at the present time.</p>
   <p>Last Wednesday a banquet was given in honor of Monsignor Csernoch and his staff. The turnout at this banquet proved to be most impressive to him, and he saw that the true Hungarian spirit still existed in the hearts of Chicago Hungarians.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1393.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He saw at this time that he was honored by Catholics as well as people of other denominations, and he said that be wished he could take back this spirit to the people of Hungary where so much religious hatred prevails.</p>
