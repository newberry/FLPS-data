<title level="a">ARREST HUNGARIAN DOCTOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians had an unpleasant sensation last week when, through the American newspapers, the news spread like wild fire that a Hungarian doctor had been arrested and criminal investigation was in progress against him.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate hero of the case is Dr. A. C. Halmos, 646 W. Fullerton Ave., who is very well known to the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>His arrest is connected with the inquiry into the blackmailing attempt of Dr. Gabler by Cletus Monahan, ex-employee of the State Department, and his associates. Dr. Gabler accuses Monahan of trying to extort hush money on a fraudulent charge of illegal surgery. This blackmailing gang tried to get money from other doctors, too, it is rumored.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1101.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Monahan admitted under questioning that he succeded in getting $500 from Dr. Holmos. Charles G. Daugherty, district attorney, summoned Dr. Holmos into his office on the strength of Monahan's confession. To the amazement of the district attorney, Dr. Holmos denied giving money to Monahan. The district attorney's amazement is understandable, because it is inconceivable that Monahan would confess to something he did not do. The warrant for Dr. Holmos's arrest was issued for "bribery."</p>
