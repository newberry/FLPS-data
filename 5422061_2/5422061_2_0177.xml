   <p>Four one-act plays were produced last week at the McCormick Memorial Hall under the direction of a Hungarian artist.</p>
   <p>One of these plays, "The Just Claim," with a Hungarian theme and background, was written by Mrs. Ernest Szekely, nee Sari Dobo, a theatrical director.</p>
   <p>The performance was given before a distinguished audience last Friday by the Emerson Players. The play "The Just Claim" is thoroughly Hungarian and patriotic. It shows that Mrs. Szekely not only can write, but knows how to show the more advantageous side of Hungarian life. She won the Illinois State award for 1929 with this play.....</p>
   <p>Sari Szekely herself played one of the character roles in the play. She left a theatrical career behind her when she left Budapest to come to the United States. Her father was Sandor Dobo, one of the best Hungarian <pb facs="5422061_2_0178.jpg" n="2"/>comedians, and also a theatrical director. It is understandable that she, too, should be talented--blood does not turn to water.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Szekely is entitled to a brilliant career in America because of her versatility.</p>
