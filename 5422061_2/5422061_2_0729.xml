   <p>The past year has been one of the most trying, and also one of the most successful in the history of the"Chicago Hungarian Athletic Club."</p>
   <p>This organization can look at their work of the past with pride. This success has been accomplished through the tireless efforts of its members. The Hungarian people of Chicago, and throughout the country should be proud of this organization.</p>
   <p>The accomplishments of this organization has brought about the recognition of the Hungarians in the athletic world.</p>
   <p>In the past year this organization has sponsored two football teams in the American Football League. The first team, despite injuries and bad breaks, won their first three games. They tied the strong Ranger team and were beaten by the English all-stars. Two of the members of the first team were picked to play with the Chicago All Stars.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0730.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We must recognize their ability and give them all the credit that is due them for their outstanding work; the first team finished first in their league, and the second team finished fourth. The first team consisted of the following members: Nickdeon J. Mager, F. Albrecht, J. Jager, S. Gyura, J. Smithos, J. Vanchura, I. Friedman, I. Strassen, Gy. Spieler, I. Kvauld, and last but not least Frank Foldi ,who was the captain of both the first and second team, he also coached both teams and worked tirelessly for the success of the organization.</p>
   <p>The organization did not only achieve fame on the football field ,but also in other events. Frank Foldi won the broad jump and high jump among the Hungarians of the United States and John Vanchura won third place in the discus throwing contest.</p>
   <p>This cultural work conducted by this young and striving organization deserves the praise and help from the Hungarian people of Chicago. The Hungarians of Chicago must wake up and join hands in aiding this organization in the development of the cultural aspects of the Hungarian people in Chicago. Sport is a word that is understood by every nationality, and through this medium we can gain recognition for the Hungarian name.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0731.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This organization has mapped out a program for the coming year ,whereby it will take part in all the major sports in America. They have also organized a women's division,and mapped a program for them,which will provide both exercise and social functions.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Athletic Club asks the Hungarian people of Chicago to do their part in the development of this function.</p>
   <p>More information can be obtained from Frank Foldi,the secretary of the organization, located at 1731 Wells St., Chicago.</p>
