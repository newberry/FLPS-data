<title level="a">SPECIAL MEETING OF THE CHICAGO PEOPLE'S THEATER, INC.</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The stockholders of the Chicago People's Theater, Inc. held a special annual meeting last Tuesday at the Ravenna Hotel to discuss last year's activities of the corporation.</p>
   <p>Jeno Endrey, director of the corporation, announced that the income of the Chicago People's Theater, Inc. shows a steady increase. He stated that the gross income from September to March was $43,000. Inasmuch as Endrey couldn't give a clear account of the expenses of the corporation, a committee of three was appointed to inspect the accounts and give a report of its findings within three weeks. Endrey was instructed by the meeting to turn his books over to this committee. The committee must call in a certified accountant to check the books. Endrey also announced that the stockholders will receive this month, through the mails, checks covering not only the seven per cent interest on their investment but also ten per cent in dividends. The stockholders received this announcement with approval.</p>

   <p>Endrey outlined the plans of the two troupes of the Chicago People's Theater, whose season begins next September. The companies need trucks, and to be able to purchase them, Endrey proposed that the capital stock be raised to $50,000. The meeting approved his proposal and instructed the corporation's attorney to take the necessary steps in Springfield, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The following were elected new officers: Louis Terebessy, president; Isidore Feuerzeig, and Mrs. Martin Chanyi, vice-presidents; Julius Mihalyi, secretary; Jeno Endrey, treasurer and director; Louis Terebessy, Ede Gruber, Mrs. Dennis Gyorke, and Mano Kaufman, members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The meeting instructed Endrey to make a monthly report of the financial progress of the two troupes to the board of directors.</p>
