   <p>We are very sorry to hear that the Federation of Greater Chicago's Hungarian societies will dissolve. The failure of the Federation is due to those individuals, who in public life, seek only personal gain and recognition.</p>
   <p>The Federation, which started out so hopefully, and is credited with the success of last year's Hungarian Day at the World's Fair, among other things, <pb facs="5422061_2_1243.jpg" n="2"/>began to lose its influence many months ago, due to the bad influence contributed by bolshevik activities. The celebration of March 15, 1848, the Hungarian Independence Day, arranged by the Federation was an absolute failure and was the first contributing factor toward their downfall. The accounting of the financial committee was not accepted by the other members of the Federation. Among other items on the expense list there was one for thirty dollars "for entertaining the politicians." This is an unusual procedure because every one knows that politicians are the spenders before election. Mr. Iroczky, treasurer of the Federation, announced the withdrawal of his membership from the Verbovay 164. He could not induce the committee to turn over to him $142 deficit.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1244.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We do not know all those who wilfully disrupted the Federation, but we know that the death blow was dealt by the group which was planning to have a Hungarian Field Day at Soldiers' Field. The cost $3000, rental for a day of the Field, was utterly impossible, and those societies, made up of the more sane and sober thinking members, withdrew their membership.</p>
   <p>We have just been informed that there are only three societies which are still members of the Federation. One of these is the Sport Club, only recently formed, and is originator of the Hungarian Field Day idea.</p>
