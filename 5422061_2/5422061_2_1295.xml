   <p>The Federation of Hungarian Associations on the South Side, embracing sixteen organizations, decided at its last meeting to take part in the preparation of Hungarian Day and has asked our compatriot, Gustave Wojtas, to teach the "Kormagyar" [Hungarian national ring dance] to about three hundred young men and women, in order to add a new attraction to the festivity.</p>
   <p>Gustave Wojtas, who gladly complied with this request, has already started to teach the "Kormagyar" at the Hungarian Home in Burnside, where classes are held every Tuesday and Friday.</p>
   <p>In order to aid the committee, we are asking all young men and women willing to participate in this national dance to apply in person during dance rehearsals on the above-mentioned days.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1296.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Likewise, we are glad to mention that the Federation will hold on Sunday, August 27, the day after Hungarian Day, a joint entertainment at the Hungarian Home. The proceeds will be used to cover the expenses of Hungarian Day; the surplus, if any, will be given to the unemployed Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Federation of Hungarian Associations on the South Side is to maintain brotherly co-operation between the Hungarians in this section of the city and to prevent the holding of separate entertainments, festivals, and theatrical performances on the same day by two or more associations.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as we haven't received an invitation to this important meeting, though Emery Frank [Chicago representative of Szabadsag] reported that he had invited us (if that would be the first lie uttered by Frank he would surely drown in it), we have to be content to report the outcome of the meeting as we heard it.</p>
