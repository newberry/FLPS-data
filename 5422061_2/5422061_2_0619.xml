   <p>The new school of designing and painting, which was founded on the principles of the Bauhaus of Dessau, and which is known as the New Bauhaus, is under the leadership of the famous Hungarian professor Louis Moholy-Nagy. It will begin a new evening semester on February 7, for those who work or are otherwise occupied during the day. This excellent school instructs its students in the creative arts, letting them work at their crafts either by hand or by machine. Heretofore, the school in Dessau had been the only institute which taught designing, painting, architecture, etc. Last fall Professor Moholy-Nagy, who formerly was associated with the mother institute in Dessau, established this new institute in the former residence of Marshall Field, 1905 Prairie Avenue, which was placed at the disposal of the new school by the Art Society of Chicago.</p>
