<title level="a">THE FIRST HARVEST FESTIVAL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The first harvest festival of the season was held at the Wicker Park Hall last Sunday by the Workers' Sick Benefit Society Branch 13.</p>
   <p>The festival was a huge success materially [i. e. from the standpoint of attendance] but we are sorry to say that morally [i. e. with respect to the crowd's behavior] it was not so successful.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee did everything in its power to produce an amusing program. It was useless for the performers to try to entertain, because the large crowd was unruly and noisy. The audience made a poor showing in discipline and spoiled the day for those who were orderly.</p>
   <p>A picturesque group consisting of many girls and boys in national costume performed a dance. Simon Varga recited, or tried to recite the poem "Petofii", but could not make himself understood above the noise. The next number on the <pb facs="5422061_2_0434.jpg" n="2"/>program was a song rendered by the thirty members of the Workers' Chorus, but it, too, suffered the fate of the other numbers.</p>
   <p>It was decided not to have programs at these affairs in the future.....</p>
