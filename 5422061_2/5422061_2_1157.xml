   <p>At the Buffalo National Conference of the Hungarians, it was conceded that besides the Hungarian press, Hungarian schools are necessary to preserve the language in a strange land.</p>
   <p>So that the Magyars who emigrate from the mother-land shall not be lost to Hungary, the most important factor is that they don't forget their language or fail to teach it to their children and grand-children.</p>
   <p>Numerous Hungarian churches of various denominations are doing apostolic work in order to keep the national feeling, customs, and language alive.</p>
   <p>The Magyar thought, the Magyar soul, and the Magyar heart, live in the Magyar language. A thousand year old culture was built with the Magyar language, regarded by the whole world as unique.</p>
   <p>The Hungarians living abroad readily assimilate the culture of their adopted country. The natural outcome of progress is assimilation, unless the ties are kept up.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1158.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is desirable to have a cultural center which will keep in close contact with Hungary. The Hungarian settlements should have schools, and, if they can't support them, they should receive aid from the cultural center or from Hungary. In these schools, the teachers should speak English also, and be familiar with the history and language of this country.</p>
   <p>In this way we could keep the younger generation for Hungarians, and at the same time benefit them by teaching them the culture of Hungary.</p>
