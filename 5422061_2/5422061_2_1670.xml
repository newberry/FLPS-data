   <p>The solemn presentation of the Grand Cross and Honorary Diploma of the Federation of Social Associations of Hungary to Reverend Norman B. Barr, Superintendent of the Olivet Institute in Chicago, took place last Saturday at the Italian Hall of the Allerton Hotel. This honor was bestowed on Reverend Barr as a token of recognition for his efforts in the interest of the Hungarian revisionist movement.</p>
   <p>The festival was connected with a formal banquet, arranged jointly by the Chicago Magyar (Hungarian) Club, the Middle West Hungarian Revisionist League, and the Olivet Hungarian Church.</p>
   <p>Dr. Elmer Horvath, president of the Chicago Magyar Club, as host, greeted the numerous American and Hungarian guests. Reverend Steven Csaktornyay was master of ceremonies. The illustrious guests stood up and greeted with great applause the silver-voiced friend of the Hungarians, Reverend Barr, when Dr. Horvath, in a well-prepared speech, presented him with the decoration. The honored old gentleman answered with a speech in which he condemned with a vehemence seldom heard from the <pb facs="5422061_2_1671.jpg" n="2"/>lips of an American, the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon. [Translator's note: The article here gives a list of the speakers, among then the Royal Hungarian Consul, Mr. Ladislas Modgyessy and Reverend Antonio Martignetti, who spoke in the name of the Italian people.] The closing act of the evening was the artistic piano solo by Mrs. Ernest Lidge. At the end of the program, the guests betook themselves to the rooms of the Chicago Magyar Club in the same building, where they passed away the time in a very gay mood long into the early hours of the morning.</p>
