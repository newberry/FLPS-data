  <body>
   <p>There is another institution which deserves mention and it is the Committee of Foreign Born Citizens under the chairmanship of Mr. Felix Streycksman. This committee probably exists only in the city of Chicago. We are proud that the committee is with us, but at the same time it should be nation-wide.</p>
   <p>The existence of this committee in this large city of ours assures us that controversies which were planted in the hearts of the people of Europe previous to their emigration to this country have been practically eliminated.</p>
   <p>This committee consists of representatives of thirty nationalities, and it gives us great pleasure to be informed that the Hungarian population of Chicago is well represented. Up to the present time the Hungarians have been rather inactive; this was probably due to the fact that we have been working against each other, but in the end we all agreed with each other, therefore, we have eliminated every obstacle, in our desire to do our best in the benefit <pb facs="5422061_2_1191.jpg" n="2"/>of every movement originated by the committee of Foreign Born Citizens. We believe that the Hungarians of Chicago will not be the last in the future in cooperating with such worthy movements. We also believe that it is not too late to amend what we have neglected.</p>
