   <p>There is only one Hungarian University Club in the United States, it being in the city of Chicago. Although there could be one in any other large city, because the number of Hungarians with academic and university education, such as physicians, attorneys, professors, artists, clergymen, and intellectuals who, if consolidated in an organization, could make the way easier for the recognition for talented Magyars. They could be sounding heralds of the Magyar knowledge, and by the weight of their authority could swing the scale of the American public opinion to the advantage of Hungary.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Magyar University Club is the name of that interesting and worthy organization, which was founded in 1912, an idea and through the influence of John Pelenyi, former Austro-Hungarian consul, later councillor of the Hungarian embassy. The founders were: <pb facs="5422061_2_0454.jpg" n="2"/>Berthold Singer, honorary Spanish consul; Dr. Arpad Barothy, Dr. Steven Barat, Rev. Valentine Balogh, Emil Fellegi, Mladen Gawansky, Emery D. Groak, Arthur Hertz, Ignatz Izsak, Rev. Ladis Farkash, Dr. Ignatz Reiss, and Julian Kune.</p>
   <p>The club, even by its denomination, secured for itself a certain authority, and privileged position in the American-Magyar circles, and of which it is well deserving of this authority by the virtue of its office, although before the outbreak of the World War, and immediately after the peace treaty, occupied itself exclusively much with the politics of Hungary. On such like acts, the club was guided by the faith, convictions, and full bona fide, but it departed from the purpose set up at its organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0455.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Well, what was the purpose of the University Club? According to the definition of a meritorious founder, and member, Ignatz Izsak, it is the following:</p>
   <p>"The Chicago-Magyar University Club, its members are chiefly individuals with academic and university education, has for its purpose to maintain friendship, and public spirit, to cherish the Hungarian culture and Hungarian Art. The University Club, knowing its moral weight should endeavor to be of service to the general public and, if possible, to take part in the movements, aiming to promote the improvement of the fate of the mother country, just as well as to the improvement of the conditions of the American-Magyars. It should never lose sight that in such cases their performed activities have to be characterized by real devotedness and unselfishness.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0456.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian University Club should be an association of true friends, a determined brave guard, if necessary, ready for the combat, and protector of every Hungarian and American's good cause."</p>
   <p>Two years after the formation of the University Club in the spring of 1914, Count Michael Karolyi came to America. The University Club became interested in his political program at that time, and supported with all its power the Karolyi movement.</p>
