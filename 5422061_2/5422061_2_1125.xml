   <p>Among the rank and file of Chicago Hungarians William Fejfar is known as an undaunted champion of the Hungarian ideas. From this good Hungarian we received a long letter, every line of which reflects the nobility of his character. It is unfortunate that our lack of space makes it impossible to publish his letter in full, for every line of it deserves attention. We will summarize what he says:</p>
   <p>He went to a Bohemian opera performance given by a workers' association. The hall, which accommodated twenty-five hundred persons, was filled to its utmost capacity, despite the fact that the seats were numbered and cost a dollar and seventy-five cents per person. The performance, which was supposed to begin at 8 P.M., began promptly at that time. The twenty-eight musicians, all simple workmen, played the overture with remarkable harmony. Fejfar observed that the stage was so large that it could have easily accommodated the whole audience of some of the Hungarian amateur performances. He spoke highly of the sixty or seventy <pb facs="5422061_2_1126.jpg" n="2"/>actors who gave skilled performances, and he commented favorably on the audience which sat in silence during the whole performance.</p>
   <p>Fejfar describes his emotions as follows:</p>
   <p>"And I was stung by jealousy, to realize that the nation which did so much wrong to the Hungarians is capable of such accomplishments, and that compared to them, we, who are regarded as a brave and daring nation, seem to be so insignificant in this regard.</p>
   <p>"We are given to sitting with a glass of good wine, beating our chests, and telling the world what good Hungarians we are, but when it comes to accomplishing something in the interest of our race, our nation, or our language, to preserve our standards, we drink one more glass of the good wine, and go towards our goal--to nothing.</p>
   <p>"But not so the Czechs. The Czechs do not [give up so easily]; they do not say-- <pb facs="5422061_2_1127.jpg" n="3"/>like many Hungarians--that in ten or fifteen years there will be no Czech association, Czech language, Czech newspaper, but what they do say is that even if there were to be no more immigrants there would be Czechs here, even after one hundred years.</p>
   <p>"The Czechs do not reply, when asked to cultivate their native language, 'Why, our youth does not like that!' as our Hungarians are apt to answer; they want to keep up their national individuality, and what they want, they are going to get.</p>
   <p>"When a Hungarian association arranges some amateur show, it has to be planned on a small scale; little money can be spent on preparation. It seldom happens, however, that the arrangements committee does not incur a deficit. On the other hand, a Czech workingmens' association does not hesitate to launch a five-thousand-dollar proposition. The Poles, the Italians, and the Czechs have their own movies, homes, churches, and various places of amusement, and almost every Sunday they stage amateur shows. They know that in this way they may prolong the <pb facs="5422061_2_1128.jpg" n="4"/>life of their group. They can hear their national songs on their own radio hours; and announcers who speak the respective languages perfectly enable each group to retain its native language and perfect its style.</p>
   <p>"And what do we do? We do have a couple of struggling weekly Hungarian radio hours, and some altruistic Hungarians are trying to maintain the showing of Hungarian movies, but to our sorrow, they have to bolt. When members of Hungarian associations try to arrange an amateur show, the others ridicule the idea and destroy it before it materializes. Even if they do succeed, the audiences are always very small; in some cases the performers have had to play to almost empty houses, and in almost every case there is no profit, and soon the amateurs lose interest. They fear a repetition of the fiasco.</p>
   <p>"My dear Hungarians! I ask you, what are we waiting for? The burial of the Hungarian consciousness, of the Hungarian culture, of the Hungarian language?" Thus we have presented the sentiments of William Fejfar, the unselfish Hungarian, who fears the passing of the Hungarians.</p>
