   <p>The Chicago Branch of The Rokoczi Society has sponsored many social affairs for the benefit of Chicago-Hungarians, but the picnic which was held on June 22 surpassed all their previous activities.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Hungarians really enjoyed themselves. A Hungarian orchestra furnished the music, and the performance of several Hungarian folk dances and songs claimed the attention of all present.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Athletic Club was the guest of the Society, and they conducted a very interesting athletic tournament. This particular feature of the picnic will long be remembered by those who attended this picnic. There was a race of 100 yards, a hammer throwing contest, high jumping contest, football kicking contest, and a bowling tournament. All these events had very thrilling finishes.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0446.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Nandor Robatkay, president of the Chicago branch of the Rokoczi Society, wishes to express his sincere appreciation for the splendid work done by the members of this organization, and extends his heartfelt thanks to the Hungarian Athletic Club for the part they played in this celebration, thereby helping the people enjoy this picnic, which will be long remembered by the Hungarians.</p>
