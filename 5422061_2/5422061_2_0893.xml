   <p>A beautiful holiday celebration was enjoyed by the Chicago-Hungarians in Burnside's K.P. Hall on August 22. It was here that the United Virgin Mary and St. Inre Herczig Roman and Greek Catholic Sick Benefit Society celebrated its fifteenth anniversary.</p>
   <p>The celebration started at 2 P.M., and the following organizations took an active part in the celebration: St. Stephen's Society; The Burnside First Hungarian Workers' Benefit Society; The Chicago and vicinity Ladies Sick Benefit Society; and the Verhovay Aid Societies, branches 96 and 37. The following organizations were represented by committees only: The Chicago and Vicinity Sick Benefit Society, and the Chicago-Hungarian Reformed Sick Benefit Societies.</p>
   <p>The president of the celebrating societies thanked the Hungarian organizations <pb facs="5422061_2_0894.jpg" n="2"/>for their cooperation in conjunction with this celebration. He also thanked all individuals for their presence. John Kovacs then formally opened the anniversary proceedings with a very interesting speech. This speech was followed by the initiation of one hundred thirty new members.</p>
   <p>The following program was conducted by Mr. Louis Szauther: The Hungarian national anthem was sung by the audience; Mr. John Kovacs addressed the new members of the organization; Mr. Elek Kirner gave a religious and patriotic speech on "Our Lady of Hungary"; Mr. George Meszaros explained the ideas of this great celebration in English; the honorary speaker of the occasion was Joseph Kocsio; Father Soltesz then spoke on the realities of life and brotherly love.</p>
   <p>The officers of the society then gave an account of their activities during the past fifteen years. Andrew Pasztor read the book of minutes; the <pb facs="5422061_2_0895.jpg" n="3"/>comptroller, Thomas Lamberger, gave his report; then Stephen Kovacs gave a financial report in which he disclosed that at the present time the society has a membership of six hundred fifty, and has $10,000 in its treasury.</p>
   <p>After the program in the K.P. hall, the different societies grouped together and marched to the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church. The march was accompanied by the music of two brass bands. In church, Father Soltesz delivered a very beautiful sermon, and blessed the lodge. At this time, a flag of mourning was also dedicated, and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bukovics were given the honor of being god father and mother to this new flag. After the church ceremonies, the march continued to Pilat's picnic grove. The presidents of the different organizations made many inspiring speeches to the Hungarians. The representatives of the celebrating society then cordially thanked the different organizations who took part in this anniversary festivity. They also thanked their own members for their aid in making the occasion such a success.</p>
