   <p>On the evening of May 17, an important concert--from a Hungarian point of view--took place at Kimball Hall. Bela Urban, a seventeen-year-old high school graduate, made his debut as a violinist.</p>
   <p>Bela Urban was born in Budapest. He was an honor student in high school despite the fact that much of his time was spent in study of the violin since early childhood.</p>
   <p>A large audience gathered to hear Urban, who in spite of his youth is a master of the violin.....</p>
   <p>He will leave this month on a study tour to Europe. His teacher here was Edward Dorazil.</p>
   <p>We are positive that this concert was the initial link in a chain of successful <pb facs="5422061_2_0107.jpg" n="2"/>future concerts and are eagerly awaiting the time when he will return from Europe a great master.</p>
