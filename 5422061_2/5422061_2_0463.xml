<title level="a">THE FIRST SELF-EDUCATIONAL CIRCLES OR CLUBS</title>

   <p>Following the first wave of Hungarian immigration, self-educational clubs were organized in the larger cities, such as New York, Chicago, and Cleveland, where the Hungarians had settled in large numbers. The pioneers responsible for this cultural movement patterned themselves after the Magyar patriots, who, during the Bach period, fought to keep alive the flame of Magyar nationalism.</p>
   <p>Those early American-Magyar leaders and zealous workers, who toiled with passionate registration for their ideal, stimulated the desire for education and inoculated the mind of the Hungarian worker and tradesman with ambitions such as he had never known.</p>
   <p>The means for reaching that goal were at first very simple and primitive; at the regular and social gatherings, the members recited patriotic verses <pb facs="5422061_2_0464.jpg" n="2"/>and sang ballads, the works of Magyar poets. Later, they gave humorous monologs, plays, song recitals and performances of national dances. Lectures on Magyar literature and occasional debates were also in order. In the celebration of historic Magyar dates, the leaders of these self-educational clubs had to concern themselves with forming a suitable program for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The Magyars in the large cities set the example for the small town groups. It is certain these self-educational clubs would never have been organized in the smaller towns were it not for the eagerness of small town leaders whose enthusiasm was stimulated by articles appearing in the American-Magyar newspapers about the success of the Chicago, New York and Cleveland self-educational circles.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Magyars, a small group of dreamers and idealists, organized the first Clubs in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_0465.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>That which Joseph Cukor and few friends realized in 1888 in New York was also made possible years later in Chicago, through the efforts of Lajos Jilly when he organized the Chicago Singing Club which later became the Self-educational Club.</p>
