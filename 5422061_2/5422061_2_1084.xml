   <p>A few weeks ago an article appeared in this newspaper in which aid was asked for a very poor Hungarian family. The plea was recognized as worthy of attention almost immediately by the Chicago Hungarian Ladies' Charitable Society, which without calling a meeting, donated three dollars in cash to this unfortunate family. Mrs. Frank Pollack a member of the society also took up a collection among her friends and received eight dollars and twenty five cents which she turned over to this family in need; to the cash donations were added many articles of clothing and an ample supply of food.</p>
   <p>This is a good example of how light-hearted the Hungarians are; this half starved family was rescued almost as soon as the condition was made known among its countrymen in Chicago.</p>
