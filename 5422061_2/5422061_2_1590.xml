   <p>Early this week, the Chicago Daily Tribune had an editorial explaining why Congress should not modify the present stringent immigration laws.</p>
   <p>Knowing that this point of view is part of the policy of this great newspaper, we were not surprised. Only one additional point is added that is very interesting. The editorial says that immigrants from countries like Italy, Russia, Poland, and Hungary--in addition to the fact that they have other undesirable qualities--are not wanted here because for years they have tolerated dictatorship and for this reason they are unfit, politically unripe, to become residents and eventually citizens of a democratic country like the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1591.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dictatorship is forced on people by a minority through terrorism, fear of prison, force of arms, executions, suppression of all individual opinion, and similar brutal methods of oppression.</p>
   <p>By forbidding these people under dictatorial rule to come here, we insult all American traditions, according to which this country was to be a haven for politically and religiously oppressed people. We should not forget that the first settlers were also fugitives from political and religious oppression.</p>
   <p>The fact that a person is willing to sacrifice money and often imperils his life in order to leave the country of his birth and all the memories of childhood proves that this immigrant is spiritually ripe enough to become a free resident and citizen of this free country.</p>
   <p>We believe that these people, having paid the price of suffering and deprivation, will make ideal Americans.....</p>
