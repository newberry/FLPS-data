   </div>

   <p>The Hungarian Americans have spoken. Representatives from every Hungarian American community assembled in Cleveland during the past week.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this assemblage and convention was to assure the government of the United States and the president, that the Hungarian people fully appreciate the protection and hospitality provided for them by this country and the President.</p>
   <p>At this convention the following resolutions were passed:</p>
   <p>(1). Resolved: That we express our sincere and deepest gratitude to the President for his recognition of the most honorable purposes of Hungarian residents in the United States by not regarding them as alien enemies. We assure the President that this convention was not misplanned, and that the Hungarians in America will continue to be attached and devoted to this country.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_2_1396.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(2) That we re-affirm our unflinching loyalty to our country, the United States of America, and are proud of the fact, that the Hungarian Americans have at all times fulfilled their duties as citizens of this country. We appreciate the freedom and equality that the consitution of this country accords us, and are ready to uphold the ideals of our president, aiming to make the world safe for democracy,</p>
   <p>(3) That we recognize the importance of Americanizing the people coming to the shores of the United State. This has been pursued by all organizations and institutions of Hungarians at all times, and we pledge to continue these efforts.</p>
   <p>(4) That we have always stood for a free independent and democratic Hungary on the principles proclaimed by Louis Kossuth. We rejoice at the fact that the President makes the realization of this principal an absolute certainty.</p>
   <p>(5) That we are pleased to be apprised of the formation of The American Hungarian Loyalty League for the duration of the war, we endorse its aims and purposes. <pb facs="5422061_2_1397.jpg" n="3"/>and we not only pledge our own cooperation, but also urge upon all Hungarians, citizens and non-citizens to join it.</p>
   <p>(6). That we further resolve that copies of this resolution be properly presented to the President and members of his cabinet, and to both houses of Congress.</p>
