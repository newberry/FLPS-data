  <body>
   <p>Mr. Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, is already in court on one complaint alleging misconduct in his private affairs, and the time may come when he will be in court on another allegation of the same sort. As the principal stockholders in the Hi-Bred Seed company, he and his wife have been placed in a position to profit in the Government's acreage reduction program which he sponsored. The Government, thanks to Secretary Wallace, paid the farmers' bounty for planting fewer acres to corn; thereupon Mr. Wallace, the seed merchant, offered them an article (at a fancy price) which would enable them to grow almost as much corn as they ever did, despite the reduced acreage. His company even published advertisements in Wallace's Farmer to that effect. This may not be unethical, and it may not be go-getting in Mr. Wallace's eyes, but to others the words seem to fit.</p>
