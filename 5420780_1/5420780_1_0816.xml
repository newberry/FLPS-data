   <p>"Hjemdal" the much read Danish newspaper says in today's edition: The enemies of the opposition party seem to believe that the best weapon against A. C. Hesing is the unveiling of his past. Fortunately for Mr. Hesing, it is just his past which entitles him to an office. If his opponents say that Hesing intends to rob the county treasury to pay his debts, they contradict themselves. It is stupidity to distruct a man on one hand as able to commit a crime and on the other hand to ascribe to him such noble feelings that for the love of his creditors and to satisfy his obligations towards them, he would be willing to jeopordize his good name and his position of leader of the opposition party in Cook County. There are few, who are able as well as A. C. Hesing to resist the enticements of a public office.</p>
   <p>As long as Mr. Hesing fought in the ranks of the Republican Party, he did not lack recognition; unless the honors bestowed upon him by the Republicans <pb facs="5420780_1_0817.jpg" n="2"/>were merely granted by them to keep him in the Republican fold. Should Mr. Hesing have asked them to pay his debts, as condition of his further co-operation, they would have paid them at once. No one doubts, that, should Mr. Hesing return to the Republican fold as a contrite son, he would be next year a rich man, due to Republican benevolence.</p>
   <p>The prospect for Mr. Hesing's election is very good and we shall gladly give him our votes.</p>
