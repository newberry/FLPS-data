   <p>p.2.col.3......The Scandinavian Socialists picnic on Sunday was, despite its competition with half dozen other picnics, a real success. Early in the day, however, the weather was quite threatening so the beginning of festivities was somewhat delayed. But, by late afternoon, there were 1200 people in the park. An extensive program of sports for old and young began at 4:30 and competition for many really worth-while prizes was very keen in all events presented.</p>
   <p>Speakers for the day were N. F. Holm, committee chairman; A. G. Erlando; and the old veteran Thomas Morgan. Singing by the Socialist Chorus was followed by dancing. The Red Cavalcade's Orchestre played for the latter event. In the opinion of the old timers this Picnic was evidence that solidarity still reigns among Scandinavian Socialists.</p>
