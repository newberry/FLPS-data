   <p>A. Wm. Hansen, also called Sorte Hansen, died in his home on Aug. 12, only 55 years old. He was born in Copenhagen in 1854, and worked at Bing &amp; Grondahl's porcelain factory. About 1875 he became unofficial secretary to Louis Pio, one of the first Danish Socialist leaders. When the Socialists tried to hold a meeting without the consent of the police, Pio had to flee. Pio was paid 5,000 Kroner by police inspector Hertz when he left for New York; when he arrived at New York he was paid another 5,000 Kroner.</p>
   <p>Povl Geleff, another Socialist agitator was paid only 1,500 Kroner in Copenhagen, and he was very much dissatisfied. Both Hansen and Geleff felt that they had been cheated by Pio. In fact, they claimed that he had sold himself to the capitalists. But when Pio went to Kansas to start a socialist colony, Hansen went with him as his secretary. The project had to be given up within a few months. Hansen came to Chicago where he got a job with <pb facs="5420780_1_0448.jpg" n="2"/>Falker &amp; Stern's porcelain's factory. In 1904 he had been with the firm for twenty-five years. He was married twice.</p>
   <p>He had a keen mind and a warm heart and he always was true to the love of his youth, Socialism.</p>
