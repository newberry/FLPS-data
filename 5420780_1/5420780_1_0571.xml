   <p>For Mayor vote for George Koop; for City Clerk, A. W. Mauce; for City Treasurer, J. A. Ambroz.</p>
   <p>The local election campaign between the two capitalistic factions is gradually approaching a degree of tension and high pressure that will influence decent people, who otherwise are at their right senses, to submit and vote Democratic or Republican once more. The situation on the political front is rather dull since the Democrats re-nominated Mayor Dunne who was elected two years ago on his platform of "municipal ownership" of the traction facilities and then hired one of the streetcar company's most noted servants, Walter Fischer at a $10,000 a year salary to ruin the program completely. Had the Republicans been more cautious in their efforts to serve the streetcar capitalists and selected a respectable candidate they would have had a sure chance to win; but they acted so clumsily that the result of the election next Tuesday is doubtful.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0572.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But we fear that if either the Republican or Democratic candidate is elected, together with the traditional guard of corrupt aldermen the infamous traction deal will be consummated just the same.</p>
   <p>Even if the "ordinance" is voted down as it ought to be, it will mean nothing unless a socialistic mayor and a good many socialistic aldermen are elected at the same time.</p>
   <p>That would be perhaps too much for us to expect although it seems high time for the majority of voters to react against the corruption prevailing in the capitalistic parties, and then vote in favor of their own individual interests.</p>
   <p>But Rome was not built in a day, and the socialists will be satisfied to add still a few more thousands or tens of thousands of voters to their ranks as an effective protest against the capitalist system and its political hirelings. It is not beyond possibility that one or more socialists are voted into the city council provided we put our shoulders together.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0573.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Therefore vote straight socialistic next Tuesday and put an X to the "No" on the "little ballot" on the ordinance question!</p>
