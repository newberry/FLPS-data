   <p>The director of the American Civil Liberties Union solemnly professes that his organization "has nothing to do with Socialism or any other ism," but operates solely for the purpose of "defending the civil rights of individuals and groups wherever they are infringed upon," and again, to "defend the right to express all views."</p>
   <p>However, so far, the A.C.L.U. has been singularly silent, not only about Soviet Russia's ruthless suppression of free political views, but also in regard to clearly perceivable bureaucratic inclinations for curbing the American press. And what about other important civil rights--for instance, the right to produce and own property which just now is being assailed, undermined, and restricted from above in a manner contrary to all American <pb facs="5420780_1_0286.jpg" n="2"/>traditions and precepts. Has the A.C.L.U. uttered one word of protest against these ominous onslaughts against civil rights and liberty? Of course not, because to do so would conflict with the views of Socialists, Communists, and their associated modern day liberal addenda.</p>
   <p>The director names a number of "distinguished members" of his organization, but carefully omits to mention numerous prominent Socialists and Communists and their confreres, including practically every brain truster and New Dealer of note, hardly any of whom would be found on the roster of the A.C.L.U. if that organization really had "nothing to do with Socialism."</p>
