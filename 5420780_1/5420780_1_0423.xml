   <p>p.2.col.1........Thomas J. Morgan whose "Provoker" has carried a number of scurrilous editorials slandering the Socialist party and its leaders has been thorougly investigated by a special committee appointed by the national committee of the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>We quote from their report: - "We find that the "Provoker" is a publication largely for the dissimination of malice, slander, falsification and misinformation. It appears from the documentary evidence placed before your committee that the editor, Thomas J. Morgan, is engaged, either in a wilful distortion of facts, or is temperamentally unable to appreciate them."</p>
   <p>After such a killing disavowal of himself and his paper we trust "Tommy" will still have enough shame and sense of decency to tender his immediate resignation as a member of the Socialist party. Anything he may, in the past, have done for the party <pb facs="5420780_1_0424.jpg" n="2"/>he valiantly endeavored to tear down so his passing will be regretted only by a few dumb-heads, separastistic and anarchistic elements who have sneaked in to try to undermine the party by spreading false reports creating misunderstanding and hatred in the ranks. All this dirty activity of course would, if successful, immensely please the Capitalistic press and in probability bring them a few crumbs in reward for purfidy.</p>
