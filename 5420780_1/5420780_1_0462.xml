   <p>We can now clearly see the well laid plan on the part of Theodore Roosevelt to draw public attention away from the pitiful failure his administration turned out to be. He was no sooner out of office than his well known antisocialist views began poisonously although ineffectively spraying every possible channel. His attack is laughable when one realizes that the Socialist party has prospered and increased its membership more during his administration than at any other time in history. This scurilous Rooseveltian attack would not even have been given space in the national press were it not for the prominent position he had so recently held.</p>
   <p>In his present criticism he follows his old tactics.- He does not attempt to disprove the principles and doctrines of the Socialist party. He merely reverts <pb facs="5420780_1_0463.jpg" n="2"/>to the old practice of false accusation. He accused the party of advocating free love, communising anarchy and other un-American ideas, in fact a veritable combination of untrue statements all of which he professes to believe constitute the Socialistic Creed.</p>
   <p>He falsely states that Socialism will place "Special Privilege" in power, allowing each one to contribute what he can to a common fund and to draw out of this same fund whatever he thinks he needs. This theory is communism, if it is any theory, for it is absolutely not socialism. On the other hand "Teddy" does countenance the special privilege of generations of Vanderbilts, Thaws, Astors, Rockfellers, etc., who produce exactly nothing, though they acquire millions while the producers get practically nothing.</p>
