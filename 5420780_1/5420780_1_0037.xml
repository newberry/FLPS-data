   <p>Professor Chr. Anderson, son of the Rev. A.W.Andersen, Danish Trinity Lutheran Church of Chicago gave an excellent lecture last Friday night in his father's church. The young professor who holds a high position at Wayne University in Detroit spoke on the subject: "A Modernization of our Educational System. "The lecture was accompanied by moving pictures.</p>
   <p>Professor Andersen began his lecture with paying a tribute to the Trinity congregation, expressing his thanks and appreciation for the years he has lived among this little group of people, and for the ideals with which they had imbued him while growing up. He admitted that he, like most other young people did not at that time understand or appreciate the idealism which causes Danish emigrants to hold on to their spiritual values. He had learned that later and felt now clearly that this alone was an invaluable inheritance and an asset in his work as an educator.</p>
   <p>He informed us that about one third of the teachers at Wayne University were of Scandinavian descent.</p>

   <p>The lecture was clear and intelligible to all. The speaker had a pleasing way of expressing himself and met criticism with understanding.</p>
   <p>Maybe the Detroit School system is good for Detroit because Detroit is a marked industrial center; yet it must be said that this system is based on the fact that the parents in general do not possess a strong feeling of responsibility and are either too poor or too lazy to concern themselves about the education of their children. The speaker was of the opinion that sooner or later it would prove a necessity to keep the children in school to the age of twenty-one, all on account of the scarcity of jobs. The many years of schooling would not include academic education or any other thorough training, but the time would be spent in a pleasant way, as far as possible, to the individual satisfaction of the students. It seems to me that this system of education puts too much of a burden on parents who are poor. Possibly also that state and county would have to support the young folks while growing up which would be a total surrender of responsibility on the part of the parents, and which in this country would mean surrender of responsibility to the politicians. The Spartans in old Greece had a similar idea 2,600 years ago. It did not work so well. Now the same thing is tried in Italy, Germany, Russia and other places. The result is doubtful.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0039.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I believe the best we could do is to take a look at Nature and notice what is going on. Living beings in general have a decided feeling of responsibility towards their offspring and will see to it the young ones are being properly educated so they can stand on their own feet in the world; but of course in the world of nature we do not find any half-baked psychologists.</p>
