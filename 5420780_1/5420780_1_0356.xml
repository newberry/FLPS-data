   <p>John C. Kennedy, Seymour Stedman, Mary O'Reilly, Wm. E. Rodriguez, and James Dobson, former members of the board of directors of the Chicago World, are publishing their reasons, in the Workers World, as to why their paper failed. According to their statements, there were no great expenditures, as exorbitant salaries or mismanagement. Neither was there any waste involved in the various expenses incurred when the paper had to be enlarged and broadened in scope.</p>
   <p>The final offer made available to them was financial aid of $120,000 which would make secure the operation of the paper, as well as complete control, by the party. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. O. Beutall, who managed to line up a scant majority of votes against the proposal made to the County Committee, the offer was refused. Thus the fate of the paper was sealed. Quoting the report in part: "We still believe that the Socialist Party and its friends would have been successful in this <pb facs="5420780_1_0357.jpg" n="2"/>undertaking, that we would have paid off all our debts and that the Daily World would be alive today had it not been for the demagogical efforts of Mr. O. Beutall and a few of his associates."</p>
   <p>Beutall belongs to the revolutionary group whose main organ is the International Socialist Review, in which paper he has misrepresented the causes of the discontinuation of the Chicago World. He even succeeded in becoming editor of the Workers World, a weekly, started by the party immediately after the Chicago World was no longer published. As editor, he promptly attempted to make the paper an organ for the syndicalistic organization International Workers of the World. However, that scheme did not work. On account of pressure from the majority of socialists, Beutall had to retire as editor and business manager in favor of John C. Kennedy and Arne Brooks Baker.</p>
