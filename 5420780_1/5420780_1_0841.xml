   <p>Within a comparatively short time, French war heroes have crossed the Great Divide, and the hero worshippers throughout the world have shed tears and lamented over this great loss. Meanwhile, the real heroes, the shock troops who during the actual conflict were blown to atoms and scattered all over the battlefields of France, have almost been forgotten. As for the heroes who miraculously escaped the blood-drenched scene of strife, their heroism has been repaid with only shattered nerves. One look at our returned heroes and their plight should cover with shame the countenance of every so-called patriot. War, it seems, is safe only for generals.</p>
   <p>Many an honest man has been left at the crossroad by the unthinking mob, which, because of lack of understanding and appreciation of real worth, sees in the truth-seeker only the shadow of its own shortcomings.</p>

   <p>One of the current books well worth reading is called The Conquest of Happiness. To the average person, this name might seem rather paradoxical, for at best man can conceive only of the pursuit, and not the actual conquest of that elusive something which beckons to us, but is always just around the corner. Conquest on the battlefield leaves destruction in its wake. Likewise, in the conquest of happiness it also becomes necessary to destroy our old habits of wrong thinking. If we conquer, from this chaos will eventually emerge peace. After all, is this not the first step toward happiness?</p>
   <p>Our inferiority complex shows itself in many different ways. One of the most commonly suffered is our fear of being misjudged and underestimated by our friends and associates. Doubtless that is the only reason why so many of us live beyond our means. "What fools these mortals be."</p>
   <p>Of all the philosophers since time immemorial, no one is less understood than Nietzsche and the world has never quite been able to accept his views. The main reason for this, no doubt, is that he was so far ahead of his time <pb facs="5420780_1_0843.jpg" n="3"/>that only a Morris Cohen, better known to the Danes as George Brandes, could really understand and appreciate this so-called madman. On the other hand, those mediocre scribes who are always ready to poke fun at what they cannot fathom, and who delight in throwing inflammatory criticism at this unfortunate but great philosopher, fail to realize that by their ridicule they are only proving to the world that Nietzsche was right.</p>
