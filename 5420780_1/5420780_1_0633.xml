   <p>The Socialists had a great meeting at Central Music Hall on September 29. The hall was full, and many were unable to get in. Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist candidate for president, spoke. The next speaker was Herman C. Perry, the Socialist candidate for governor of Illinois. The third speaker was the first Socialist mayor in the United States, John C. Chase of Haverville, Massachusetts. The last and best speaker was Professor George D. Herron. His excellent speech was later translated into Danish and printed in Revyen. Many Danish Socialists were present at the meeting, which did not end until after midnight.</p>
