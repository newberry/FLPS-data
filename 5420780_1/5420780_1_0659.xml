   <p>Nominations for Alderman, County Commissioners, Coroner, and Sheriffs are now settled to every one's satisfaction. It may be necessary to check up on the candidates for Alderman as some of them are not fit. We Danes so far have been ignored in former political campaigns, but times have changed. In former campaigns other nationalities were running for the different positions, and we were found to remain content with promises which were never kept; hence this movement that Danes should work and vote for candidates of our own nationality only. We do not know for sure which side we are going to take, but it looks like we are going to go the Republican way because of promises they have made, etc. But you can never tell.</p>
