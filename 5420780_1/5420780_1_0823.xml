   <p>The following article was returned with thanks to the writer after having been submitted to the Chicago Daily News, the paper probably not desiring to hurt somebody's feelings by its publication:</p>
   <p>Being a reader of the Daily News for over forty years, I have reached the conclusion that the Daily News is the fairest and most impartial of our daily papers. I, therefore, avail myself of the opportunity to ask a few questions which someone perhaps will answer, and thereby enlighten me and others on the subject. In reading your paper the other day, I find that the four men held to the grand Jury for murdering a labor leader had procured the services of four of our most able and brilliant lawyers. May I ask: what does this mean? Our State's Attorney claims to have sufficient evidence on hand to convict the men. But suppose the four lawyers by their <pb facs="5420780_1_0824.jpg" n="2"/>shrewdness and talent succeed in juggling to such an extent that the jury will render a verdict of not guilty. Does that mean that a man at any time can commit murder and go free providing he has the price to buy the talent, or does it mean that justice has been reduced to a piece of merchandise sold to anybody who wants to buy? Does it not tend to encourage lawlessness? If these lawyers succeed in freeing the accused men, our daily press will offer columns of praise and eulogy to the already well-known and honored barristers. The public in general will admire their wonderful achievements, while they themselves way down in their hearts (perhaps) feel that they have helped to defeat justice, but probably the profession makes allowance for all that.</p>
   <p>Dear readers, if such things can happen in our courts, what can possibly happen in our legislative bodies where I understand about three hundred lawyers are representing the majority of the American people? Is there <pb facs="5420780_1_0825.jpg" n="3"/>not cause for us to stop and think, cause to fill the mind and heart of every justice and liberty-loving true American with fear for the future? Would it not be high time for every loyal American to replace these gentlemen of lesiure with real men; men who would contribute to the maintainance of society, men engaged in constructive work, both mental and material. It would not be necessary for them to know their Wester, or to use more than ordinary words which the common people would understand, as long as they are true representatives of the welfare of the country and the people, men who would interpret the true spirit of our laws and constitution, and not try to buy it in honey combed amendments, but hold the grand old document aloft and let its shining ideal be burned into the heart of every man, woman, and child. Perhaps it would help to settle the unrest and discontent in our land. Perhaps it would drive away the red spectre that is raising its head everywhere, if the causes are removed. Then we could proudly tell the world: "This is God's country, and fit for industrious, law-abiding, justice and liberty-living people to live in.</p>
