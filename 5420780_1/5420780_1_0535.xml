  <body>
   <p>The fact that the big telegraph strike is going on in a peaceful manner is due to many reasons. For one thing, the strikers are refraining from demonstrations and violence, and for another, the capitalistic press keeps as quiet as possible concerning the fact that the strike is causing plenty of trouble for business in general. The telegraph companies have even the nerve to insist that the strike is over, despite the fact that 20,000 to 25,000 men, or about 95% of the telegraphists of Western Union, Postal Co., and Associated Press, are out on strike; and there is no immediate danger that amateur scabs are going to take their jobs, because it takes years to acquire the training.</p>
   <p>Would the companies come out in the daylight and admit that their businesses are at a standstill; and would the press present the truth concerning the effect on business when an institution such as the telegraph ceases to function, then public opinion would swing to the support of a plan for a publicly owned telegraph system.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0536.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>People in general would find it outrageous to have a few individuals play havoc with the whole country for the only reason that they cannot make up their minds to pay their laborers a decent wage.</p>
   <p>Here is a case in which the government would be fully justified in telling the owners of the monoply to either get the system working or rain the chance of having it expropriated. Apparently there is no danger of such a proposal being made as long as Roosevelt is the captain of the ship of state. Nevertheless, a strong public opinion in favor of a publicly owned telegraph system, with higher salaries for the employees and lower rates, has bean created; and that alone would throw a scare into the monopolists' camp.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the strikers seem to posses a high degree of solidarity, and the situation, therefore, is so much in their favor that the monopolists will have to give in sooner or later.</p>
