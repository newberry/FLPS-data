   <p>Colliers informs us that daily papers around the country are furnished with tainted news by various so-called press bureaus financed by great capitalists and corporations, who thus manage to influence public opinion in their favor, whether this be for of against the issues presented by the press. Three of these bureaus, with headquarters in Boston, New York, and Washington, D. C., attempted to oppose the law regulating railroad rates, and have now started on a campaign to defeat the municipal ownership idea, all for the benefit of their capitalistic bosses and owners.</p>
   <p>That the activity of these bureaus is a paying proposition, may be concluded from the fact that huge sums of money were spent in Chicago to prevent municipal ownership of street-cars. The spenders achieved their purpose, and the stock of the street car companies increased several million dollars in value immediately after the defeat of the ordinance.</p>
