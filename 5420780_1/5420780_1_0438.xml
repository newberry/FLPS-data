   <p>p.2.col.1...........The well known English Author, A. Conon Doyle has recently published a book wherein he makes a naive appeal to the Capitalists and Government of the U.S.A. for intervention in behalf of the people of the Belgian Congo. He dwells at length on the disastrous taxes imposed by King Leopold of Belgium to obtain funds for his continuous rotten carousals with French hussys and prostitutes.</p>
   <p>The naivity of this appeal is as refreshing as it is laughable when one considers the fact that our Capitalists including J. P. Morgan, Tom E. Ryan et al are business bed-fellows with his infamous Belgian Highness Leopold through their mutual interest in the rubber industry of the Belgian Congo. It is even arrongantly asserted that this disgusting monster in his cloak of majesty has shown his smartness in granting to Morgan, Ryan, etc., valuable concessions in the Congo as well as extensive interests in various parasite organizations that are bleeding the <pb facs="5420780_1_0439.jpg" n="2"/>people of their earnings. With these favors the old reprobate thinks to lull the American sense of decency and fair play and secure for himself, through Morgan and Ryan and the Capitalistic parties and government of this country, the moral support necessary to permit the continuance of his rottenness.</p>
