   <p>Theodore Roosevelt, acclaimed by many people, is now violently attacking the Republican party and the "bosses", from whom, only a few weeks ago, he would gladly have accepted the Presidential nomination. If it had been offered him there would have been nothing wrong with the party and its corrupt leaders, just as there was nothing wrong with Taft as long as he presented no obstacle for Roosevelt's plans, and just as there is nothing wrong with the trusts and capitalists, who are for him, and who are contributing to his campaign fund.</p>
   <p>He is an unadulterated demagogue, for whom any means are justified as long as it serves his purpose of obtaining power for himself and his clique. Thus he is now blowing the radical trumpet, in order to exploit <pb facs="5420780_1_0784.jpg" n="2"/>the peoples' dissatisfaction with prevailing conditions in our public life, but at the same time, just as he did when he was President, he is very careful not to do or say anything which may endanger the capitalistic interests, at present or in the future. He is what he always was, the crack, thundering lion in Morgan and Company's political circus.</p>
   <p>The irony of it all is that in this campaign, not the lion, but the peaceful, ruminant cow is symbolizing the latter and his party.</p>
   <p>The danger about Roosevelt is that ass a paranoiac, and suffering from delusions of grandeur as he does, he plays his role, as a thundering lion, with such violent intensity that he is liable to impress and dupe the unthinking elements in the nation. His chances in this campaign depend entirely on the extent of the voters' political naivety, and their ability to resist demagogic platitudes and oratory.</p>
