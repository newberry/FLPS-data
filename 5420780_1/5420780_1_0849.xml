   <p>It looks like we will not avoid having a "Day of Defense" as a permanent institution. On that day we are going to pay homage to our military power, and everybody, who has a chance is going to wear a uniform. Bayonets shall glitter in the sun, and the roar of big guns will be heard everywhere. The common people are going to be effectively reminded that their welfare depends on whether we have a strong army or not. We are going to be intoxicated with enthusiasm over such a display of military might. Certain it costs money to maintain a capable army; but we are to be convinced that we are getting our money's worth.</p>
   <p>And foreign governments shall be awe struck - friend and foe - where the American Eagle shakes its wings. -</p>
   <p>We used to look at European governments with contempt because they used more than hall of their revenues to prepare themselves for war. They surely succeeded in getting the war - for which coming generations will have to pay and suffer.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0850.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now the United States is going to join in the armament race. Certain elements have tasted blood and are now sponsoring a drive to make America military minded. These elements were not here before the war. Our modest army did not put on military displays; but now military preparation has to be pushed in the foreground on every occasion.</p>
   <p>By means of special favors our colleges and universities attempt to induce our young men to join some military organization. In every boy's life there is a period during which he likes to play with weapons and wishes to become a soldier, and his attention is easily attracted when called upon in due time. It is more difficult to awake the interest of university students. Therefore the special favors.</p>
   <p>The military minded press writes enthusiastically about how successful the event was. "Twenty million people participated in the demonstrations," said Tribune. To be sure, it is important to have people believe that the entire nation was behind the show so that Mr. Citizen would make a fool of himself if he too were not there. - A lot of people don't dare oppose what they are led to believe is an expression of public opinion.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0851.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A couple of days later,however, the minister of war expressed his dissatisfaction concerning the scant participation and public approval in general. We hoped to be able to work up some enthusiasm through legislation.</p>
   <p>Patriotic speakers emphasized the fact that military expedition only were responsible for the making of this great country. "We have won every foot of soil in our fight with the Indians," says Tribune."It is the sacred duty of every citizen to bear arms in defence of his country as is it his duty to defend his wife and children," said an admiral somewhere.</p>
   <p>We are discussing the "Theory of Evolution" these days;it is queer that nobody discovered an aspect of that theory called: "The History of Moral Evolution."</p>
   <p>Quite sure, we killed the Indians and took possession of their country but who is will to acknowledge this method of procedure as morally justified now-a-days? At any rat our government would not pursue a different course of action. It would negotiate a purchase of the land, pay for it and accept that method as satisfactory. There was a time when a person had to defend his home and family arms in hand; but that is not <pb facs="5420780_1_0852.jpg" n="4"/>even permissible now. There was a time also when it was consistant with good morals to kill one's mother-in-law if she had grown too old to be useful around the house. But all of this belong to the past.</p>
   <p>Thus, since individual morals have improved considerably we should expect that national morals had also improved correspondingly. Can it be possible that development in this respect can be shown only through the display of bigger and better tool of murder? We don't think so.</p>
   <p>Recently there were troubles over in China. Foreign nationalities have seized territories, even whole sections of Chinese cities where they demand rights and protection. The foreigners refuse to make themselves subjects to the laws of the country and demand ample protection in case of trouble. There are conditions to which Americans would never agree. Neither will the Chinese for very long.</p>
   <p>What does the American government do in a case of that sort? It sends an invitation to the Chinese government to send a delegation to a conference in Washington where <pb facs="5420780_1_0853.jpg" n="5"/>these troubles will be made subject for discussion in order to come to an understanding as to the justification of the privileges claimed or already acquired by the White man in China.</p>
   <p>According to the Tribune this invitation had a very calming effect in China.</p>
   <p>Of course it had. But why did not the U.S.Government threaten China with military invasion? When peace is supposed to depend on arms, why then hold conferences? Isn't it because we, despite military propaganda, are slowly working ourselves towards the conviction that nothing can be actually accomplished by the use of arms?</p>
   <p>Instead of listening to the military propaganda, it would be well for us to listen to and think about what President Coolidge said in Washington the other day.</p>
   <p>The President reminded his listeners that it was important not only to bring about a cessation of hostilities, but also to bring permanent peace to the world. "Nation of the world have tried to settle their differences by means of arms, but it was a <pb facs="5420780_1_0854.jpg" n="6"/>total failure. The welfare of humanity is based on a state of permanent peace and justice to all. If that which we accumulate, build up or create in times of peace shall repeatedly be destroyed in times of war, humanity will be doomed to eternal slavery."</p>
   <p>These are statements worth considering. Perhaps it would not be out of the way in this connection to call attention to a statement from the Bible: "He who lives by his sword shall perish by the sword."</p>
   <p>Christ thus expressed figuratively a fact which has been affirmed repeatedly throughout the history of mankind, but which this generation apparently attempts to ignore.</p>
   <p>The fewer"Days of Defenses" we get in this country the better.</p>
   <p>Fortunately,most people preferred to celebrate the event by going on a picnic instead of staying home and looking at the military parades.</p>
   <p>Signed,</p>
   <p>A. Th. Dorf.</p>
