   <p>Members of the Illinois Legislature have recently visited the University of Illinois, in Champaign and Urbana, with the object of inspecting this gigantic institution.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers, who addressed an audience numbering 3,000 students and teachers, was Representative Christian M. Madsen, who emphasized the importance of public control over educational institutions and closed with the following words which hit the point in a striking manner:</p>
   <p>"We believe that whoever furnished the financial backing for any institution will, at least to some extent, control the policy of that institution and for that reason we believe that our state universities should be free from any particular interest or creed, making it their <pb facs="5420780_1_0054.jpg" n="2"/>object only to discover and impart the fundamental truths and great achievements in science and philosophy.</p>
   <p>"I wonder if you boys and girls, in this great audience, realize the opportunities which are given you here, as keenly as one who has never had a chance. I am perhaps an idealist, as your president said. I am looking forward to the day when every boy and girl in the State of Illinois shall have an opportunity such as this great institution holds out to you, and I want to assure you that the University of Illinois has no more ardent supporters than the four Socialist members of the State Legislature."</p>
