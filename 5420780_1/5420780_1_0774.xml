   <p>We are almost forced to admire President Wilson for the consistency and undiminished fervor with which he continues to advocate tariff reduction. Thus in a recent article:</p>
   <p>"The steel schedule, I dare say, is rather satisfactory to those who manufacture steel, but is it satisfactory to those who make the steel with their own tired hands? Don't you know that there are mills in which men are made to work seven days in the week for twelve hours a day, and in the 365 weary days of the year can't make enough to pay their bills? And this in one of the giants among our industries, one of the undertakings which have thriven to gigantic size upon this very system."</p>
   <p>This is powerful talking and sounds good, but unfortunately our academic <pb facs="5420780_1_0775.jpg" n="2"/>President does not tell us how and why a reduction of the tariff on steel products not only is going to cause a reduction in the price of these products but also shorter working hours and higher wages for the workers, and, on top of that, make room for the small manufacturers which the "giants" have put out of business.</p>
   <p>Theories and beautiful ideals make good conversation, but actual facts and practical reality are more important, and there will be no effective cure of our economic ills until all unjust taxes are abolished, and the state derives its income solely from taxes on estates and income.</p>
