   <p>Lloyd George, Britian's Minister of Finance recently made public his view on England's problem of unemployment and poverty, the cause and the remedy.</p>
   <p>His speech was a shining example of the thought and attitude of the up-to-date, thinking politicians of the old political parties. It is undeniable evidence of a gradual awakening to the faults of the present social structure and to the practicality of the Socialistic ideals.</p>
   <p>Lloyd George is a statesman of a far different type than our Roosevelt whose every effort was directed toward protection of the Capitalistic tyrants though his own personal interests were always given the preference in every way.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0431.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lloyd George - in his plea for the ending of unemployment and for the continuation of Britian's excessive armament program has, however, linked these two thoughts into a masterful absurdity. Militarism never has and never will be a permanent cure for unemployment. The fact that he knows and admits that the present social order leaves much to be desired is evidence of a deep study of conditions. Such conscientious study by men of Lloyd George's ability and character will finally bring to the notice of the world at large that the only unfailing cure for present social ills is Socialism, pure and simple.</p>
