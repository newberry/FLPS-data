   <p>Many of those who read the Chicago Daily Socialist, also read one or more of the capitalistic papers, and, of course, that is the right thing to do. On the other hand, opponents of socialism should read the Daily Socialist; thus all would keep themselves posted on the matter viewed from different angles. As things stand at present, however, many readers of the Daily Socialist are at a loss to understand the attitude capitalistic papers now take towards the Idaho murder case. Whatever course of action these papers have taken before and immediately after commencement of the Court procedure, what they thought of the three suspects being guilty or not guilty, you will hardly be able to find a single editor in the whole country by now who is too blind to realize that the prosecutors have not produced a speck of evidence provind the defendants' guilt. Had this been an ordinary murder case with traditional sensational aspects, comments in favor of the suspects would have been published far and wide; stern demands for freeing the three men, and prosecution of their jailers for conspiracy would have been current subjects throughout the country.</p>
   <p>But this is not an ordinary murder case. Its origin and course is a typical by- <pb facs="5420780_1_0549.jpg" n="2"/>product of class hatred and class struggle. It was started by a shameless capitalistic organization with the object of putting a strong and courageous labor organization out of existence, and the object has been pursued mercilessly. That is why the capitalistic papers decidedly took sides with the prosecutors and approved their unconstitutional way of arresting the suspects by actually kidnapping them and hauling them across a state line to Idaho. That is why the same papers maintain a strict silence now when it is proper to publish the fact that the case is decidedly in favor of the defense. They can't deny the failure of the prosecutors to prove the men guilty, and they don't want to admit their own folly before they know the decision arrived at by a servile capitalistic judge and a jury, picked as much in favor of the prosecutors as possible. Even a decision contradicting law and justice will be approved by the defenders of capitalism and so their press must refrain from thwarting the case with comments unfavorable to the higher-ups.</p>
   <p>The papers are silent--editorially; as far as their less responsible correspondents are concerned, the field is open and extensively used now, as heretofore, <pb facs="5420780_1_0550.jpg" n="3"/>to present the case in favor of the prosecutors and to defame the characters of the accused men worse than ever.</p>
   <p>Of course this attitude on the part of the capitalistic press reflects itself in various Scandinavian echo-papers, as is always the case on such occasions; and oftentimes the echoes are rather malicious, because the articles written by the irresponsible correspondents of the capitalistic papers are resurrected in the Scandinavian papers as editorials. Thus a Danish paper published in New York brands Mayer and Haywood as "a pair of criminals," which judgment, we maintain, is a limit of frankness yet to be exceeded by any other paper in this country. Here is an example from one of Rasmussen's papers published last week: "Among other witnesses ex-Governor Peabody of Colorado and his daughter have testified from the stand; but their statements only confirm what Orchard (who turned state evidence) has said, that Haywood, Mayer and Pettibone were responsible for the assassination of Governor Stennenberg."</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0551.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Well what about these "confirming" statements? Oh yes! Orchard had "confessed" that ex-Governor Peabody was one of the men he was supposed to kill at the order of Mayer, Haywood and Pettibone. As witness appeared the ex-Governor himself to testify to the effect that he had seen Orchard in Canon City at the very time Orchard himself insisted he had been there for the purpose of "letting him have it." A still more marvelous "evidence" was furnished by the ex-Governor's daughter, who said that she had seen two suspicious persons in the proximity of her carriage once while her father was Governor!</p>
   <p>That was all! but it is an excellent example of the shaky foundation on which the case has been built. Orchard might easily have been in Canon City a hundred times, ignorant of the fact that he was believed to have come there with an intention to kill Governor Peabody. Still less founded is the suggestion, that the labor leaders had hired Orchard to do so. For that matter he could just as well have told he was hired by President Roosevelt to do the job, or by Chr. Rasmussen of Minneapolis, or the editor of this paper. Ex-Governor Peabody's and his daughter's testimonies would <pb facs="5420780_1_0552.jpg" n="5"/>have served the purpose just the same. We believe that people who possess the ability to reason and are not willing to lie on their stomachs for the captains of capitalism will protest when such nonsense is admitted as evidence. Such unfair procedure instead of convincing them, will strengthen their belief in the innocence of the three men, an innocence which has been more and more apparent in the course of the court proceedings.</p>
