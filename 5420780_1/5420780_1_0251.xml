   <p>The well-known Danish labor leader, Nils Kjaer was arrested on June 13, and he was ordered deported last week. Nils Kjaer has lived here in Chicago for about eighteen years. Kjaer was one of the most active leaders in the radical labor activities here. Max Naiman, International Labor Defense, was assigned counsel for the defense, but Max says he is quite sure that Judge Woodward's decision will be upheld.</p>
   <p>Woodward refused bail for Nils, even though both the Danes and Norwegians had put up thousands of dollars' worth of real estate for bail.</p>
   <p>The Karl Marx Scandinavian Workers' Club held a mass meeting last week to raise additional funds and to agitate Kjaer's release.</p>
   <p>We ask the co-operation of the Scandinavian societies. They should elect committees not only to see the judge but also the Governor. They should demand Kjaer's release.</p>
