   <p>It has occurred to me that there reigns some confusion among us as to the idea and use of the hyphen.</p>
   <p>The word,"Hyphenated Americans" was coined to express at certain contempt. And we all know the meaning of the term "Hundred Per cent Americans."</p>
   <p>The use of the hyphen does not mean division. It means connection. The term, "Danish-American," does not denote a divided nationality. It means Danish born. The Danish-American does not subtract from America. On the contrary, he connects it with Denmark. He adds to America the live assets of ideas which he received in his old country, and in bringing them together with the new ideas which he receives here, thereby he brings about a fermentation which can only produce a better portion.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0160.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What is true of the Dane is true of many other nationalities. And what is surprising is not that America has thereby become great, but that there are Americans who do not see it.</p>
