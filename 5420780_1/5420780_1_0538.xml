   <p>That John D. Rockefeller and other leaders of the Standard Oil trust are violators of the laws may well be learned from the fact that a jury has returned a verdict of guilty and that the judge sentenced the defendants to pay a fine of $29,240,000. The fine has not been paid, and John D. Rockefeller says that the judge will be dead for long before it is paid. If the worst comes to the worst, the almighty trust will just raise the price on its products correspondingly. That is why Rockefeller and his mang of convicted violators of the law can laugh at the whole thing, because they will not be bothered further, at least not for a long time to come.</p>
   <p>But while it does not matter what the big violators of the law do or think, even after being convicted, it happens that innocent men are being kidnapped on a false charge, hauled away from their homes and families, held prisoners for a year and a half or more, and scarcely avoid the gallows. This is what the defenders of capitalism call equality and justice.</p>
