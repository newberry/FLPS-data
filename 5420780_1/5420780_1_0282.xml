   <p>in common. They are both labor governments.</p>
   <p>The Social-Democrats and the Communists both have the same respect for Karl Marx, the great social thinker and prophet. They both build on his ideas and his gospel to the working class: "Unite and throw off your chains." They both believe that the workers, who are the majority in every nation, should rule. They both think that the state should take over the factories and the means of production. They both believe that the present distribution of wealth is too unequal. They both feel that the working class and the middle class should have better living conditions and more comfort in their homes.</p>
   <p>Social-Democrats agree on the goal, but they disagree radically as to the interpretation of Karl Marx and the means for the realization of his program.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0283.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The socialists believe in evolution, in democracy and parliamentarism. The Communists believe in revolution and democratic centralism. They believe in education through schools and propaganda. They believe in co-operation in full control of the people.</p>
   <p>The communists build a new culture through the press, literature, theatre, and the movies.</p>
   <p>The coming struggle against reaction can only succeed through unity of the people.</p>
