   <p>p.2.col.3........Repeated assertions are being made that capitalistic interests in Europe (and U.S.A.) are considering war as the cure for the social interest due to unemployment throughout the world. Capitalists would probably breathe more easily, for a while at least, if a number of thousands of hungry laborers could be turned into cannon fodder and valuable property destroyed.</p>
   <p>There was a time, not so long ago, that such a catastrophy could be brought about at will. Now, however, the masses have learned better that to allow their hunger and suffering to be converted into a hysteria for war and destruction. They can no longer be stampeded into taking up arms against their fellow men in a strange land, who are, in all probability,suffering unemployment and hunger also.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0450.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The American worker has been gradually brought to realize that his release from the slavery of a capitalistic system can only be attained by the elimination of moneyed parasites and the rotten system that fosters them. This clean-up will have to be accomplished by ballots, not by bullets.</p>
