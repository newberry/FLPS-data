   <p>At a recent meeting of the directors of the steel trust, president Gary stated that twenty-five per cent of the "men" are now working twelve hours a day and "the majority of them would not be satisfied to work less." Of course not! If they did, they and their families would starve to death. However, if they were paid for an 8-hour day the same wages that they are getting now, there would hardly be any objections to shorter working hours, but in that case Gary and his fellow-millionaires would make a few millions less, and would not that be a calamity!</p>
   <p>One of the other trusts has just decided to establish a minimum wage of $9 a week for women workers, explaining this humane gesture with the admission that this is the smallest amount on which a woman can decently exist.</p>

   <p>Why just exist? She is allowed a bare existence in order that there may be plenty for those that live in luxury and leisure on the fruits of her labor.</p>
