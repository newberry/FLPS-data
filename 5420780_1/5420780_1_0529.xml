   <p>John D. Rockefeller reveals a rather pleasant disposition on the occasion of his company's being fined $29,240,000; and why not? The fine, if ever paid, will be paid only by raising the price on Standard Oil products. On the other hand, the legal prosecution means little to Standard Oil. The trust and all the rest of Rockefeller's business enterprises will suffer a loss only in public prestige on account of the adverse publicity. Nevertheless, this annoys the old capitalistic giant. We refer to an article in the Record Herald, with such headlines as the following: "Hit Me, Hurt All." says Rockefeller. "Attacks on Corporate Wealth Injure Poor More Than Rich, He Argues." "Thinks he is Benefactor." "Makes Works for Thousands and Opens Opportunities for Thousands More."</p>
   <p>Such headlines indicate clearly Rockefeller's attitude and are absolutely correct. As long as the capitalistic system is to be maintained at all and <pb facs="5420780_1_0530.jpg" n="2"/>we are to have economic guardianship, Rockefeller is as good and able as anybody. To kick him out and divide his monopolies among a dozen or more capitalists of smaller calibre wouldn't improve the situation one particle. It would not in any way abolish the system of starvation wages, nor do away with the rich loafers living in luxury. A more determined prosecution of Rockefeller and Company would hardly be advisable either, because the only result would be a disturbance in the business world, and scramble for chances on the part of other capitalists. Determined action on the part of the Government would be the only solution. We need a Government that would have the courage to tell the capitalists: "Get out of here, we are going to run the country for the benefit of the people." Under such a Government, Rockefeller and his henchmen would be helpless and unable to cause a panic, even if they wanted to. Half-baked reforms, as advocated by Roosevelt, would be worse than none at all.</p>
