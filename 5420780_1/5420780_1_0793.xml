   <p>November 8 will be an important election day. The Danish Socialists have nominated two Danes for office, Lauritz Olesen for Treasurer of Cook County, and C. M. Madsen as Representative for the Twenty-third District.</p>
   <p>Lauritz Olesen was born in Samso, Denmark, in 1855. He joined the Socialist party in Aarhus in 1881. In 1887 he came to Chicago, where he started a wagon and truck factory in 1897. He is a fine man to work for.</p>
   <p>C. M. Madsen was born in Thy in 1869 and came to Chicago when he was very young. He has taken an active part in the Danish young people's work. He is a painter by trade and belongs to the Painters' Union No. 194. He is a member of the Socialist county committee and of the executive committee, and is a leader in the Thirty-fifth Ward. He is likewise the co-editor of the local paper, The Next Step. He has good support in his wife, Dorothea Marie Madsen, who is the Socialist candidate for County Superintendent of Schools.</p>
