   <p>As reported last week, our countryman, Mr. Christian M. Madsen, won the Chicago Chess and Checker Club tournament and is, therefore, now the champion chess player of Chicago. The new champion was born 1869 in Gammelby, in Thy, Denmark. His parents, now dead had a small farm and were very poor. Mr. Madsen entered the painting trade, and after three years of work and study in Copenhagen emigrated to Chicago in 1902, where he took up residence at the Danish Young People's Home. There he learned to play chess, and before long created a stir by his ability.</p>
   <p>Later he became a member of the Chicago Chess and Checker Club. On several occasions he has represented his club in tournaments and telegraphic matches with clubs in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. About his recent achievement the Chicago Daily News says in part:</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0179.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Madsen is entitled to his victory. He has played careful, steady, consistent chess all through the tournament."</p>
   <p>Madsen never forsakes his Danish traditions. He is a member of Danish Young Peoples Society, and has also performed as an amateur playwright. He is an admirer of George Brandes, J. P. Jacobsen, Horeys, and other Danish philosophers.</p>
   <p>In the last chess tournament he lost 12 lbs.</p>
   <p>In the latest tournament there were 16 members of the club's star players participating. Thus each person played fifteen games. Madsen lost but one. His closest follower was M. Lee, an American, who also lost one <pb facs="5420780_1_0180.jpg" n="3"/>game but had one remiss in addition which counts for one half lost game.</p>
   <p>The result of the tournament has encouraged Danish chess players to make arrangements for several local tournaments.</p>
   <p>The establishment of a Danish chess club is also contemplated. Danes in Chicago are said to be better represented among chess players than any other foreign group except Germans.</p>
