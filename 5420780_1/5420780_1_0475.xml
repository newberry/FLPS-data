   <p>A question often asked in, "What is Socialism?" Gustav Bang in Arbeidernes Almanak makes this tatement. "Socialism is a study of an inevitable new social order that will replace the present capitalistic order."</p>
   <p>History reveals that, throughout the world, new social orders are continuously supplanting the old to meet the demands of the everchanging social and economic conditions. In olden times all manual labor was performed by slaves either owned as chattels or bound by claims created by the exhisting conditions. Following slavery came the era of serfdom whereby the worker was enslaved as completely as before. In fact it was probably worse on the laborer because his titled master organized more of the proprietary responsibility of the slave owner.</p>
   <p>The tenant class too suffered by the unjust tribute and taxes levied by the titled land owners. In fact they were no better off than if they had been owned and bartered like so much live-stock.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0476.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The present order is different - no one is now denied personal freedom, within the law. The working man is free to sell his services to the best advantage; employer and employee enjoy the privilege of equality in bargaining for service. This is true to outward appearance only. In reality the laborer is still at a disadvantage. The worker of today is as much a distinct class as ever. A few individuals or small groups own all the land, buildings, factories, machinery and raw materials and have a monoply on every item needed on an entire nation, while the working man with empty hands has to beg for an opportunity to earn bare necessities of life.</p>
   <p>Having accepted the terms laid down by the employer he is able by strict economy to eke out a meager existence. At the and of the day or week the raw material fashioned by his hands into a finished article becomes one of thousands that brings fortunes to the employer.</p>
   <p>Socialism demands a more equitable division of profits derived through the skill of the worker.</p>
