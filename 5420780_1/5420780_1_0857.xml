   <p>In returning to Denmark of her own free will after about sixty years of subjection to Germany, Scleswig furnishes another illustration of the truth that a people of any spirit can never be permanently enslaved, never completely assimilated by the conqueror. It is also an illustration of the truth that the Germans, though conquerors, are not colonizers. Their failure with Alsace-Lorraine was no more pronounced than their failure with Schleswig or Poland, and it is, therefore, much cause for rejoicing that the allied victory has spared Europe a still larger share of Germany's domination.</p>
   <p>The return of Schleswig to Denmark is another installment of their self-determination for which America went to War, and for which we could do even more if we were a member of the League of Nations, and that not by warfare so much as by its prevention.</p>
