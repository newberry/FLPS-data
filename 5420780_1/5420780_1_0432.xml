   <p>November 8 will be an important election day. The Danish socialists have nominated the following two Danes for office: Lauritz Olesen for Treasurer of Cook County, and C. M. Madsen as Representative for the 23rd district.</p>
   <p>Lauritz Olesen was born in Samso, Denmark, in 1855; he joined the Socialist party in Aarhus in 1881. In 1887 he came to Chicago where he started a wagon and truck factory in 1897. He is a fine man to work for.</p>
   <p>C.M. Madsen was born in Thy in 1869 and came to Chicago when he was very young, and he has taken eager part in the Danish young peoples' work. He is a painter by trade and belongs to the Painters' Union No. 194. He is a member of the Socialist County Committee and of the executive committee and a leader in the 35th ward; he is likewise the co-editor of the local paper: The Next Step. He has good support in his wife, Dorothea Marie <pb facs="5420780_1_0433.jpg" n="2"/>Madsen, who is the Socialist candidate for County Superintendent of Schools.</p>
   <p>(Good pictures of both candidates are found on the same page.)</p>
