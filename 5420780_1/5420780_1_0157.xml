   <p>This slogan will be our goal. The Danish language is the living expression of Danish culture. It is an advantage to be able to speak more than one language. Americanization is a patriotic movement that has nothing whatsoever to do with our children learning foreign languages. If this is true, why do we not teach more foreign languages in our schools? Our colleges and universities do not teach the Danish language. It therefore, becomes our duty to teach it in our homes. Our Danish schools are few and far between, and the roads are long, so there are only a few children who reach them. We are the only nation in America which permits our children to have their own free will when it comes to learning their mother tongue. If we do not teach our children the Danish language, we will lose them for the nation and for Danish culture.</p>
   <p>It is not the children who should lead their parents away from that culture <pb facs="5420780_1_0158.jpg" n="2"/>which their motherland gave them, but the parents should rear their children so that they will defend and extend this culture. This can only be done through the Danish language. Therefore, this should become an issue in every Danish home. Keep the Danish language alive.</p>
