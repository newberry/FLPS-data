   <p>p.2.........There is a violent upheaval of militaristic hysteria sweeping the entire civilized world at the present time. The European powers, Japan and the U.S.A. are making preparations and arming for war as never before. The worldwide race for supremacy in fortifications, navies, cannons and other instruments of mass killings is draining the treasuries of the nations of the world. National debts are increasing at a rate that will, if not soon halted by a return to common sense, embroil the nations of the earth in war of the "free for all dogfight" variety.</p>
   <p>The present day authors and playrights are so steeped with this so-called "preparedness fever" that practically all their productions deal with war hysteria and the delirium of national glory, in fact, the only books or plays featuring past struggles or fantastic tactics by future enemies are acceptable by the present-day public.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0470.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>War, intrigue and mass destruction are so constantly being dinned into the ears and flashed before the eyes of adults and children alike that one wonders if godliness or even a trace of humanity will long exist.</p>
   <p>Strange to say, this feverish stuggle for future power goes on at a time when the prospects for peace are more evident than at any time in the history of Europe. History's greatest factor in promoting peace, based upon understanding, is Social Democracy. The principles of this movement are day by day creating an ever increasing feeling of understanding and co-operative unity between the different European people and the world at large. The idea of Social Democrats of one country at war with those of a neighboring country is abhorent. The sooner entire nations are imbued with the principles of Social Democracy, the sooner will war be a thing unknown.</p>
   <p>The present hysterical delirium of war propaganda is simply the last violent convulsion of the capitalistic system endeavoring to retain its power. Then <pb facs="5420780_1_0471.jpg" n="3"/>again, the more is spent for armaments, the less there will be for promoting a constructive trend of thought and effort toward freeing the working man from the slavery of the capitalistic system.</p>
   <p>However, it is not inconceivable that a reaction in both Europe and America may bring on a war of many nations,welcoming such a war as a remedy for the widespread unemployment throughout the world. The exporting of thousands of workers as cannon fodder and the wholesale destruction of properties will provide capitalists with a wonderful opportunity for double profit. The destruction and following reconstruction periods would be welcome indeed; and workers remaining at home will enjoy the blessings of high wages to be followed by poverty and suffering when the bubble bursts.</p>
   <p>This program of destruction would undoubtedly have advanced rapidly had it not been for those high-thinking men with the high ideals of Social Democracy.</p>
