   <p>Denmark is being much discussed in the current periodicals. Besides Maurice Francis Egan's comprehensive article, "Denmark and the Danes" with its thirty-nine illustrations of rare excellence, in the August number of the National Geographic Magazine, Francis Hackett has crystallized his impression of "Denmark: A modern Monarchy" in Harper's Magazine for October. As an instance of his keen analysis and understanding admiration of the Dane, his life, institutions, and intelligence about common needs, one may quote from the account of his visit to "the Old People's Home, as pleasant a projection of social service as I have ever seen. Each old person was known to our guide by his or her first name, and they, in turn, were "Christian" and "Ingeborg" to the old people. There was no class distinction." He accounts for the well being of rural Denmark in this way: "Denmark has standardized agricultural production and socialized agricultural existence; it has given the farmer <pb facs="5420780_1_0152.jpg" n="2"/>his place in the great society. This is what makes Denmark sane and steady in a convulsive, unhappy world."</p>
