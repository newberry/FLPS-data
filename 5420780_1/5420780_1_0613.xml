   <p>p.2........American sympathizers, are supporting the German social democracy with cash contributions, for the approaching great Reichtag - election campaign.</p>
   <p>This is a song that Kaiser Wilhelm and our own capitalistic-patriotic trouble makers, such as the Hearst papers, do not like to hear.</p>
   <p>Even though there are still people who are susceptible to war enthusiasm, even though there still are people who will permit themselves to be hired or forced to go to war, and to murder their fellow men, the patriotic glory that once enveloped the profession of war, is gone, never to return to any civilized country, where the ideas of socialism have gained a foothold.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0614.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The socialists have no more desire to be slaughtered,than they have to slaughter their fellow men and nothing in the world, not even their own just and holy cause, can make them lose their head and common sense and their human sympathies. The rulers know this, and realize that no longer do they possess the automatically obedient tools for their international robberies. The social democracy is therefore by far the most important factor for the maintainance of peace. The stronger it gets the more difficult will it be to prepare for war and to declare war.</p>
