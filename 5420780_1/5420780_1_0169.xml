   <p>The Norwegian Theatre's spirit and driving power have been incarnated in Mrs. Borgny Hammer, who last Sunday gave here her farewell performance.</p>
   <p>The program opened with the presentation of Offenbach's "Fritz and Lise", the public never seem to get too much of the old sentimental and pretty melodies of this light comedy.</p>
   <p>Next came "Comardes," and the acting of Mr. and Mrs. Hammer in this play did full justice to Peter Nansen's clean, harmless humor.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. Hammer sang "We Greet You, Ladies," "The Last Journey," and several other numbers, and Mrs. Hammer recited Norwegian poetry, as usual holding the audience spellbound with her beautiful voice and the intensity and personal feeling which she puts into all her work on the stage. Both she and her husband were rewarded with hearty applause, and during an interval Mrs. Ellen Frandsen <pb facs="5420780_1_0170.jpg" n="2"/>entered the stage and read a poem, written by Anton Kvist in tribute to Mrs. Hammer, entitled "Greeting from Danish Friends and Admirers."</p>
   <p>When the popular actress now leaves us and goes on toward bigger opportunities, we sincerely wish that her love for her art and her great talent will bring her success.</p>
