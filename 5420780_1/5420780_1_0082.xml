   <p>Every democracy is as good as the people in it, and no better. The Kingdom of Heaven itself would soon go to pieces, if left in the hands of ignorant, selfish, and wicked beings. Immigrants often complain that although the United States is a democracy, a land of the free, and a refuge for oppressed and ill treated, they, nevertheless, have suffered at the hands of some people here, just as they suffered in the old country. There is a good deal of wrong done, and altogether too much law violation, resulting in unnecessary suffering. Why? Because the citizens of this country are not doing their duty towards democracy. There is too much ignorance, too much indifference, and too much pure laziness. Things will not, and can not be made better, until there is an improvement in the citizenship, here and elsewhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0083.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the first place, there are too many people here from other countries who do not know the English language. They can not function as citizens, because they do not know how. Too many do not care to take the trouble to learn how, or to make use of their opportunities to influence things for the better. It must be your wish, and the wish of every man and woman who believes in common good, to assist those who do not know the language of the land, or how to perform their duties as citizens. You naturally ask, "What can I do?" The answer is simple: "Learn those duties yourself, and see to it that your nearest neighbor learns them. Unless you do this, you have no right to complain about the government."</p>
   <p>In the second place, there are people who know the language, and know how to do their duty as citizens, but dislike the work involved in doing their duty.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0084.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Others do only that which will bring them some immediate advantage. They are too blind to see that failing to do their duty well is bound to cause them a great deal of trouble eventually, and that to seek only small favors, instead of honesty and efficiency in public service, is to deprive the people of much good and many greater advantages, which come from efficient and honest administration. Again, you ask, perhaps, "What shall I do?" And again the answer is: "First, do what is right yourself, and then influence others to do the same."</p>
   <p>Lastly, there are people who use their influence as citizens for their own personal advantage at the expense of all the people. They not only vote, but do everything in their power to make others vote for them and their <pb facs="5420780_1_0085.jpg" n="4"/>friends, because they profit by it. These people often do a great harm. They are responsible in a large measure that public welfare is neglected and politics used to help the individuals or cliques who try to grab the power. If the citizens were to do their duty, it would be impossible for these people to get into power. Individuals would be elected who would do right, and whose goal is the public good, your good. Are you asking again, "what can I do?" You can use your vote against dishonesty, and vote for the honest, public-spirited man. You can influence others around you to do the same. You can be on guard always. One alert man, who does his duty like this, is worth a hundred of the indifferent. You can realize of what great value you can be to the cause of democracy by acting upon these simple suggestions.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_1_0086.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Is it worth the effort? When you consider that your happiness, that of your family and your friends, and what is still more important, the safety and preservation of democracy, depend on your doing this, it is worth your while. Do you realize how much depends on you? Begin Today to Learn to Be An Intelligent Citizen; To Be An Active Citizen, and last, but not least, To Be A Courageous Citizen.</p>
