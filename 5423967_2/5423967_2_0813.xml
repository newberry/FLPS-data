   <p>This week the United States Congress will begin its deliberations on the social-insurance bill: unemployment insurance, old-age insurance, insurance in case of sickness, maternity insurance, insurance for homeless children, etc. The passage of this bill is very important to the people who have to work for a living; three-quarters of the population ought to be vitally interested in its adoption. This bill, if it becomes a law, will not be a temporary or so-called emergency measure designed to heal some temporary economic disarrangement, but will be a basic law, having as its main objective the removal of fear for tomorrow from the minds of seventy-five percent of the American people.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that this law will be a basic one, its enforcement will affect the interests of many people, particularly the possessing class, because <pb facs="5423967_2_0814.jpg" n="2"/>the wealthy people will have to pay higher taxes to cover the expenses of the government for social-insurance purposes. For this reason, the struggle for and against the enactment of this bill into a law will be a stubborn one. Even now, some of the leaders in Congress raise their voices in apprehension and contend that postponement of the enactment of this bill until the next session of Congress is advisable from the standpoint of political expediency.</p>
   <p>Even such a conservative paper as The New York Times gave space last Monday to an editorial on this subject, and cautioned the legislators that care must be taken in the consideration of this bill. The newspaper particularly objects to that feature of the bill which would lay the whole burden of social insurance on the employers of labor and would not tax workers and employees; this is not the way it works in other countries, particularly in England. The editor considers that equal participation of employers and employees in carrying the burden of social insurance would be a very sound basis for the whole scheme. Thus, this newspaper supports the view of those who would postpone the enactment of the bill under the pretext that such a law is a serious <pb facs="5423967_2_0815.jpg" n="3"/>departure from the old system, and that the bill as offered to Congress does not provide for employees' and workers' participation in sharing the tax burden. Prior to the death of its publisher, this newspaper even expressed its opposition to the whole scheme, and strongly advised postponement of such legislation. Any man of common sense must admit that the adoption of this bill is the first step on the road toward ending the economic crisis which has held its grip upon this country for over five years. The crisis in capitalist America cannot be overcome until and unless every worker and employee is assured of employment, or, if he does not have a job, is secured by insurance from hunger, and assured of a piece of bread, as of some help in case of sickness.</p>
   <p>We are firmly convinced that until and unless every citizen is made to feel secure in his life, the crisis which began over five years ago will continue to devastate the country, and to play havoc with the physical and moral fiber of the human beings residing in it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0816.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A population dependent on a miserable wage or salary cannot spend freely for fear of tomorrow. The purchasing power of the people cannot be freely employed and their money will not circulate freely because the people are afraid of tomorrow. They fear that tomorrow may bring hunger and other privations. Fear of tomorrow compels human beings to reduce their purchases, even of essential articles, and to save their miserable pennies for tomorrow. How can industry develop if the people are forced to economize?</p>
   <p>As long as this basic condition for increasing consumption is not understood by the propertied class, the present crisis cannot be overcome. Nothing can come from nothing. Life and prosperity cannot develop in a vacuum.</p>
   <p>The social-insurance bill is the touchstone by which the crisis can be overcome. If its present modest form is rejected, it will mean the shattering of every hope of improving the economic life of our country. If the lobbyists in Congress, representing the property groups, do everything in their power to prevent the passage of the bill the workers and employees should do everything <pb facs="5423967_2_0817.jpg" n="5"/>in their power to push through the Federal legislative chambers the Wagner-Lewis bill on social insurance. Even though it is moderate in every respect as to its objectives, it may serve in the future as the foundation for broader social legislation.</p>
