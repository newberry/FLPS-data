   <p>Many of you have been very close to the revolutionary movement in Russia. All of you were compelled to leave your Fatherland and search for fortune in America.</p>
   <p>And what have you found? Here, as well as in Russia, during strikes they shoot workers and dump them into prisons. Politicians in various courts are setting up the laws, which entangle the workers as spiders entangle flies. The judges issue prohibitions, which deprive the workers of all rights guaranteed them by the Constitution. All of you understand this.</p>
   <p>But what are you doing for the struggle with your enemies, with the enemies of the entire working class? Are you an active member of a local labor movement, or are you saying that you need not be agitated, that you are a <pb facs="5423967_2_0452.jpg" n="2"/>socialist anyhow? Do you realize what value a soldier has outside of the army? You, too, have the same value, if you are not a member of a workers' organization.</p>
   <p>The fact that you consider yourself a socialist does not help the labor movement. The movement is in need of active workers, in need of people. Strengthen the revolutionary army of the working class.</p>
