<title level="a">THE KUBAN COSSACKS IN CHICAGO</title>

   <p>The last months of the public life of the Russian colony of Chicago will be remembered by our colony for a long time.</p>
   <p>The old members of the colony declare that they do not remember any other period of time when life in our colony would have been manifesting with such intensity as during the first months of the year 1926.</p>
   <p>Almost every Sunday there are given in Chicago several Russian entertainments, lectures, etc., Prominent Russians residing in America have also taken notice of Chicago. Our colony has been visited in 1926 by Shalyapin, Isa Kremer and Ivan Vasilievich Lazarev, an artist of the Art's Theater, who a short time ago has enabled us to pass so many delightful moments. Serghey Ivanovich Gusev-Orenburgsky is still with us in Chicago, <pb facs="5423967_2_1459.jpg" n="2"/>and his literary evenings have helped much to increase the interest in Russian literature.</p>
   <p>The starring of the artists of the Musical Studio of the Moscow Art's Theater is achieving much in the realm of theatricals. Mr. Mark Slonim is doing good work in the realm of public life. And lastly, the chorus of Kuban Cossacks which has come to Chicago will by its impending concert achieve much in the musical realm.</p>
   <p>Judging by the newspaper clippings which we have before our eyes - clippings of critical notices that have appeared on the pages of Russian and American newspapers - we can expect from the performance of secular music by the Kuban Cossacks a great treat. The concert of the chorus of the Kuban Cossacks will take place on April 25, at the Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
