   <p>Every newspaper must render service to its readers by doing the following things:</p>
   <p>1. Informing the readers about what is going on in the world; 2. Giving them information about the local life, and 3. Enlightening as far as possible those of the readers who need enlightenment.</p>
   <p>The Russian Herald has been doing its best trying to fulfill conscientiously all these duties, observing in relation to them the following chief rule: To be truthful and impartial and to serve the toiling masses of our Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Let our readers themselves tell to what extent we have succeeded in doing this. As to the editorial staff, it is doing its best so that the readers would say, "Yes, the Russian Herald gives us all we need."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1715.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lately there has arisen the idea of creating in connection with our newspaper courses for the workmen.</p>
   <p>Many of our readers are not acquainted with the history and geography of Russia and America. They should be taught these things.</p>
   <p>Still more persons are to be found who do not know a single thing about the rules which should be observed in order to preserve one's health and to prevent disease.</p>
   <p>Help should be given in this respect.</p>
   <p>Some of our correspondents, - good and sincere men, - who want to be useful to the colony write to us about the events happening in the colony. But they write so that often we are forced either to change the form of their reports entirely, or, sometimes, even to throw these into the waste paper basket.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1716.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All this happens because the correspondents do not know how to write and how to express their thoughts so that the information they are giving would be complete, yet concise; interesting, but not sensational, reminding one of the character of the reports published by the yellow press.</p>
   <p>In order to be able to give such information one has to learn how to write reports for the newspapers.</p>
   <p>The editorial staff of the Russian Herald has resolved to be helpful to such correspondents.</p>
   <p>In the very near future we are planning to start in connection with the Russian Herald a cycle of lectures for workmen. The lecturers will be selected from among experienced, competent persons who are trusted by the colony. All lectures will be given free of charge.</p>
   <p>In the beginning these lectures will have to do with the following <pb facs="5423967_2_1717.jpg" n="4"/>subjects: History and geography of Russia and America; medical science and hygiene; agriculture; Russian literature, and how to write reports for the newspapers.</p>
   <p>More particulars will be communicated in due time. Meanwhile we invite our readers to be our guests. Learn, study that which surrounds you. Unite all together, those who have knowledge and those who have none, and let those who possess some learning teach those who are less fortunate.</p>
