<title level="a">THE GRECHANINOV CHORUS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Sunday, December 22, about one o'clock in the afternoon in the large hall of "Znanie" Society; the entire chorus with its conductor, V. V. Shumkov, the representatives of the "Znanie" Society, the public, the unfailing companions of our colony - the children, tearing the ornaments off the walls of the hall, etc... V. V. Shumkov, having already sung his numbers, is nerveusly pacing in the hall. All wait for "him," the honored guest, the famous composer, Alexander Tikhonovich Grechaninov. At last, the familiar figure of Alexander Tikhonovich appears at the door.</p>
   <p>The president of the Society, I. F. Erin, in a short and hearty speech, greets the venerable composer and introduces V. V. Shumkov to him. The honored guest seats himself and the chorus, somewhat nervously, begins its program. A. T. listens, very attentively and occasionally exchanges remarks with his companion, the music director of the radio station...</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1297.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After the short program Mr. Grechaninov in a brief speech, expresses his delight in such harmonious and well conducted singing, and thanks V. V. Shumkov, the organizer of the chorus. Mr. Shumkov, cordially thanks the venerable guest for the honor bestowed on the chorus and asks Mr. Grechaninov's permission to name the chorus "The A. T. Grechaninov Chorus of the Znanie Society" in his honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grechaninov kindly give his consent and states that he will relate this experience with pride in his adopted country, France, and that he will spiritually remain with the choir always. The conductor communicates the news to the chorus, and thunderous applause follows.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grechaninov promises to visit "Znanie" again on his next trip to Chicago in the early spring.</p>
