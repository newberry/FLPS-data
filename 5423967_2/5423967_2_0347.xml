   <p>Why do the non-socialist ministers suffer in prisons? Did they cause the terrible fight in the streets of Petrograd and Moscow, and have they turned the country into civil war? Did they ban all the socialist and non-socialist newspapers? Did they constitute the self-judging courts? Did they rob the banks? Did they change the law of the freedom of speech, of meetings, and of the person?</p>
   <p>An old and experienced revolutionist, Mr. Burtzeff, and the non-socialist ministers fell into strong hands and been thrown into dungeons. Why did they go there? Because Lenin, Zinovieff, and Trotzky, are afraid of Burtzeff as a revealer, and the ministers are to be held in Petropavlosk, just because they are not socialists. The socialist ministers, they have liberated. Why did they liberate ministers of socialist ideas? Just because they cannot find them guilty in any way; as the case is with the government members. If there was even a little bit of suspicion they would proclaim them as traitors to socialism and would punish them more severely than any others. And as these are being released of all guilt, it is clear that with the oppressors, there is no basic grounds for the arrest of the entire personnel of the present government.</p>
   <p>They let out the socialists in order to avoid questions from the Socialist parties, but they hold the non-socialists in order to inflame the garrison and the workers <pb facs="5423967_2_0348.jpg" n="2"/>against the bourgeoisie.</p>
   <p>It is necessary for all the socialist parties to set-up a protest against these disgusting hottentot morals. The friends of Tseretely, Skobeleff, and Czernoff, being long-time socialists in the present government and bearing all the responsibility for the more daring steps, necessarily will raise their voice in behalf of the imprisoned ones. They are the leaders of the parties and therefore they should not be kept away from unrighteous deeds.</p>
   <p>And the comrades, Prokopovich, Malantovich, Masloff, Hvozdeff, Nickityn, and others that have been released, leaving their friends of the cabinet in prisons, will likewise do the same.</p>
   <p>What a shame it is, when the democracy in cowardly fashion makes a peace with great disgrace, done in its name, when it tolerates the persecution of the people for this, only that they are not socialists.</p>
   <p>It is necessary for our Russian-American adherents of the bolshevik regime to know this.</p>
