   <p>Upon the initiative of the members of the societies "Women's Circle" and "Znanie" (Knowledge) there is going to be arranged on June 8, for the first time in the city of Chicago, a solemn celebration of a "Day of Russian Culture".</p>
   <p>The committee which is organizing this festival requests all the Russian cultural and educational organizations and societies, as well as separate individuals who sympathize with this undertaking, to unite for the celebration of this great event. For the elaboration of the program of this celebration and for the elucidation of various questions connected therewith, the committee begs all who are willing to participate in this work to attend a meeting of the committee, which will take place at the headquarters of the societies "Znanie" and "Women's Circle" at 1902 W. Division Street, on Friday, May 17, at 8:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>(Note: This notice is important for the history of the life of the Russian Colony of Chicago, as since that time, the Russian Colony has started to celebrate periodically such "Days of Russian Culture", and such celebrations have been carried on to the present time. N. K.)</p>
