   <p>The Russian Medical Society numbers at present already 40 members.</p>
   <p>This Society was organized in August, and during two months has been able to hold several business meetings.</p>
   <p>The society has already worked out a constitution which has been approved by the membership.</p>
   <p>The chief purposes of the Society are as follows: Uniting the Russian physicians of the city of Chicago and of its suburbs in order: (a) to contribute to the exchange of thought about social-economical questions which concern the medical profession; (b) to organize an employment agency, a section of juridical information and mutual aid for needy members; (c) to protect the interests of Russian physicians in the United States; to improve the giving of medical aid to the Russian colony of Chicago and suburbs, which includes the popularizing of scientific knowledge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1514.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The last items merit especial attention as they concern the whole colony.</p>
   <p>The Russian immigrants are being exploited pitifully by charlatans of the medical profession and self-styled doctors.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the Society will pay special attention to this fact and will take measures in order to diminish the number of victims of these sharks.</p>
