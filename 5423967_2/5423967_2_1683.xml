   <p>The editorial office of the Rassviet receives daily, a great number of letters from its readers. The majority of them approve its trend and consider it to be the only Russian newspaper in the U. S. A. which firmly stands by the side of liberty and justice and which impartially elucidates the world events. For this reason it is favoured by the people, and is popular because, its columns are widely open to every reader and because the editing office goes carefully over every letter and correspondence, and takes pains to correct and publish same even if it does involve a great deal of effort and time.</p>
   <p>There is, of course, a small number of readers, who oppose the paper. The reason of their animosity is simply the fact that the paper stands for free-thought. These people dislike free-thinking. There are those, who plunged in the spirit of religious fanaticism, resent the fact that, in the columns of the newspaper there appear articles criticizing the activity of the clergy, and other anti-religious matter. This religious fanaticism has taken such a firm possession of their souls and hearts that they consider all free-thinking <pb facs="5423967_2_1684.jpg" n="2"/>to be criminal and heretical.</p>
   <p>There are, undoubtedly, all types of fanatics. Some are extreme nationalists and others are Bolshevik-fanatics. The former accuse the newspaper Rassviet of defending the Bolsheviks and cooperating with them in devastating Russia. The latter consider Rassviet as 'nationalist' and accuse it as a counter-revolutionary organ. Some of the readers are "one hundred per cent" anarchists, who call Rassviet a counter-revolutionary newspaper, whereas the real counter-revolutionists consider it to be the most revolutionary-anarchist paper.</p>
   <p>What is the explanation of all this? Fanaticism, is the only answer! These readers are not apt to exercise critical, independent thought; they have not learned to treat with respect and tolerance differences of thought. For some the religious dogma is sacred, and for the rest--their political doctrines (monarchist, Bolshevik, etc.)</p>
   <p>In their opinion, therefore a newspaper is good, only as long as it expresses their views and creeds. There is nothing extraordinary in the fact that the newspaper Rassviet is disliked by such fanatics, irrespective of what kind of fanaticism they represent (religious, monarchist or Bolshevik).</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1685.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But such fanatics, fortunately, are few. In its majority the Russian immigrants in America, are free from all kinds of fanaticism. The Russian immigrants are beginning to be independent and critical in their thoughts, and have ceased to swallow the medicine served to them by these ever-ready "leaders" and "teachers."</p>
   <p>The Russian immigrants now understand, that without freedom of thought, mutual respect and tolerance, nothing can be accomplished. The newspaper Rassviet wishes the immigrants to uphold these principles. This is why its popularity grows day by day, and this is why it is a favorite paper with the Russian worker.</p>
