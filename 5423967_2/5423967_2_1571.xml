   <p>My cordial greetings to Rassviet and through Rassviet to those Russian organizations which, through their support have aided this useful and greatly needed newspaper to continue publication.</p>
   <p>In this period of social and economic confusion, with a hard road to travel and under the most difficult conditions, Rassviet has nevertheless managed to continue its valiant fight against ignorance and its splendid work of educating the Russian masses in the spirit of world brotherhood and co-operation. Rassviet, by its skillfully prepared contents and wisely directed policies, is preparing its readers in America and in Europe for the new world brotherhood, based on equality, freedom of thought, and the free creative work of all the people, thus proclaiming and putting into realization the testament of the great Russian thinkers, L. Tolstoy, P. Kropotkin, and others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1572.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>May Rassviet bring light to those who are still in darkness, making them see the now life dawning for them! May Rassviet grow and flourish in the second decade of its existence, increasing and expanding its spiritual and material wealth!</p>
  </body>
