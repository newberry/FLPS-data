  <body>
   <p>On October 8, 1929, at the Western Electric Co. a concert was given by Mr. L. Brunwald, baritone of the Russian opera. The program of the concert was very interesting. Among other things Mr. Brunwald sang the popular Russian "Volga Boatman's Song" and the "The Two Giants". These songs earned very much applause. In the history of the W. E. Co. it was the first day devoted to Russian songs. Mr. Brunwald was the first Russian singer who sang under the roof of this gigantic plant. The highly talented pianist, Miss Rita Rotermel, undoubtedly contributed much to the success of the singer.</p>
   <p>The audience, which numbered some 4,000 people, rewarded every number performed by our talented artist with such hearty applause that the Board of Directors of the W. E. Co. decided to include a few more classical concerts in the program of this year, seeing that an audience composed chiefly of workingmen, can appreciate really good music.For this also the credit must be given to Mr. Brunwald. The American newspapers praised our compatriot most enthusiastically. Mr. L. Brunwald was born in Riga. He has received his musical education in Russia, Germany, France and Italy.</p>

   <p>In Russia he studied under the guidance of the celebrated Russian opera singer, Mr. Tartakov. Abroad on of his teachers was Reschke.</p>
