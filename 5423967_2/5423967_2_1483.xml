   <p>Small Russian libraries have been opened in connection with the clubs, "Zvooki Rodiny" ("Echoes of the Homeland") and "Rodnai Ochag" ("Our Own Hearth"). We heartily welcome the opening of these libraries. But it is a pity that they are so extremely small.</p>
   <p>Our colony needs a good, large library. We are ashamed to acknowledge that we have no such library.</p>
   <p>The library of the Society for Technical Aid to the U.S.S.R. is a very poor one. It consists of only a few hundred books. The just recently opened libraries are also very poor. Our only rescue from this sad plight lies in the Public Libraries where Russian books are to be had; the Central Public Library (corner Michigan Avenue and Washington Street); the library on North Avenue, corner Rockwell Street; the library near Douglas Park, and some other branches. There is a fairly good Russian library even at the Hebrew Institute, (corner of Taylor Street and Racine Ave.). There is also a small Russian library at the Hull House, corner <pb facs="5423967_2_1484.jpg" n="2"/>of Halsted and Polk Street.</p>
   <p>Only we ourselves, the Chicago Russians, have not cared to arrange a good Russian library of our own. And yet the need of Russian books is felt very strongly. It is time to think about founding a library of our own.</p>
