   <p>This is a frantic appeal to join the Workmen and Peasants Free Russia Cooperative as a means of supporting the newspaper of that name, Svobodnaya Rossiya. This daily, it is pointed out, is of utmost importance as a support to the revolution in Russia. Soviet Russia is living through great, trying days. We should be happy to have such daily paper as Svobodnaya Rossiya. Its future depends on you, readers! Capitalists and Kolchakists wish to drown in a spoon of water any medium of the people, which stands up for the Soviets........Without this paper who will interpret correctly the people's cause for liberty? Who will raise his voice in protest against all sorts of vile insults to the poor Russian workmen and peasants? Remember that each one, by doing his bit, has his say in all the affairs of the cooperative. The word cooperative means just this: the people's enterprise, and the <pb facs="5423967_2_0315.jpg" n="2"/>people shall conduct it as they like... He who is against the Soviets and is for capital, landowners, bishops, generals and tsarist officials should stay out, his money is not desired here; let him take it to the slave drivers of yore. We need the support of those toiling poor who wish to preserve the conquest of the rights of the people.</p>
