   <p>Events in Russia have changed in many ways, both the work of Russian- American organizations and their direction.</p>
   <p>Many Russian organizations, thanks to changing events, have ended their existence; many organizations, under the influence of these same events, were founded on the day of the Russian revolution.</p>
   <p>Almost all Russian revolutionary and progressive organizations in America have experienced ups and downs, and have suffered disorganization. This is due in part to the departure for Russia of large numbers of the so-called 'intelligents,' the most conscious elements in various organizations. But at no time is there such a demand for hard work on the part of revolutionary organizations as at the present.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0423.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The problems of the Society for Aid to Political Exiles and Prisoners in Russia were liquidated by the revolution. The masses remaining in America are not well informed about events in Russia. This brings up the problem of raising the level of consciousness in the Russian masses in America and the training of conscious workers, who might take the place of those who have returned to Russia.</p>
   <p>This means work through lectures and pamphlets explaining events both in America and Russia. This means that more members must be secured for the Society for Aid to the Russian Revolution, and the organization itself must undertake more extensive work.</p>
   <p>Each conscious worker or intellectual must not at the present time stand apart from revolutionary organizations, but aid them as much as possible in their work.</p>
