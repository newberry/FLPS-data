   <p>Considering the short existence of the society Znaniye, it has made great progress. This small group of people during the year of their existence was able to gain the confidence and sympathy of all circles of the Russian colony. The society arranged several beautiful concerts and plays. The staging of the play "Dni Nashey Zhigny" (The Days of Our Life), by L. Andreyev, once more proved the splendid work of this young organization. Thanks to the energetic effort of the society, which got in contact with the best artists, the play was a colossal success, both from the financial and artistic standpoints. The play was performed on December 1, and the hall was overcrowded. The performance of the artists was excellent; especially good were the artists A. Tamirov, K. Sheyn, E. Nelidov, Mrs. Mirayeva, and Mrs. Mikhailovskaya. The audience was very enthusiastic about the performance of the play. There were no amateurs among the artists, but real talented actors. There have been no artists like them since the existence of the Russian colony.</p>
