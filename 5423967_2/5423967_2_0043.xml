   <p>Dictatorship in America: An American Mussolini, Hitler or Stalin? Of course this is nonsense, an impossible thing. Thus will delcare any supporter of the American democracy.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless one reads quite frequently in the American press articles and new items about our future dictators. Their names, of course, are well known to the American public. They figure in numerous scandalous incidents. They are the heroes of the day. They are spoken about, criticized, denounced, praised and cursed.</p>
   <p>Who are these future dictators of ours?</p>
   <p>Everybody in America knows Hugh Johnson, a retired general and former head of <pb facs="5423967_2_0044.jpg" n="2"/>the N. R. A., Senator Huey Long, from Louisiana, and the Catholic priest, Charles Coughlin. This is the triumvirate of pretenders to the dictatorship chair. At present they are engaged in inoffensive polemics over the radio and in intrigues against one another, just as the rule is with all triumvirs of all peoples.</p>
   <p>The democratic bleachers looking at the scuffle of our future dictators only giggle and amuse themselves. The outcome of the contest is still in doubt, for the gladiators for dictatorship are still in the arena and fighting. A too sensitive public opinion took our triumvirs under a hurricane fire of criticism. In the role of the judge this time appears the Methodist Federation of Social Service, which, we assume, impartially and minutely analyses our candidates for dictatorship.</p>
   <p>What, then, do our venerable Methodists say?</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0045.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"All three contestants for the leadership of the lulled masses," says the declaration of this Methodist federation, "attempt to reform and preserve a system which, as was stated by our general convention, is unethical, anti-christian and anti-social.</p>
   <p>"In January we showed the inability of the administration (a thrust at Johnson) to fulfill the promises made to the people. We have shown that the attempts to sustain the present economic system by state aid increases the expenses and relief expenditures faster than they find work for the unemployed or raise the standard of living.</p>
   <p>"The system of private gain does not permit self-regulation, as Roosevelt and Coughlin think. With a still greater determination the capitalists will resist every attempt to realize the fantastical promises of Huey Long."</p>
   <p>But all these are only the buds. The berries are: it's known that Coughlin and <pb facs="5423967_2_0046.jpg" n="4"/>Long (not saying anything about General Johnson who would not make any concessions even to his own office employees.) advocating, first, "social justice," and, then, "sharing the wealth," do not live up to their own preachments. Methodists, for instance, have shown that the radio broadcasting priest, Coughlin, pays his office workers "less than is required for decent living", and the International Typographical Union and the Cleveland Federation of Labor openly denounced the priest for his anti-union activity."</p>
   <p>Senator Long has gone even further than his opponent in the sphere of "social justice." In the state of Louisiana in the public works in which the Senator takes so much pride, the wages in many instances do not exceed 10 cents per hour.</p>
   <p>Demagogic shoutings,--Methodists say,--about sharing the wealth are in open conflict with his doings.</p>
   <p>In Louisiana,--claim Methodists,--wretched poverty exists alongside of concentrated wealth at the time when rich plantation owners, sugar refiners, oil <pb facs="5423967_2_0047.jpg" n="5"/>men and fur merchants support Long's dictatorship. Among his supporters we find Harvey Couch, a rich railroad magnate, and Randolph Hecht, a New Orleans banker and head of the American Bankers Association".</p>
   <p>Besides all this Methodists point out that dictator Long claiming particularly friendly feelings toward the laboring man, has not passed laws concerning old age insurance in his own state, has passed no legislation with a view of helping the unemployed, has placed no restrictions on child labor and has made no provisions for payment of same wages both at public and private work for the same labor.</p>
   <p>Senator Long speaks a great deal about helping the poor by means of taxing the rich. He demands that Congress pass a law placing a tax of twenty-five per cent on all incomes above $50,000, but in his own state this tax amounts only to six per cent.</p>
   <p>Coughlin's fascism, representing a variety of Mussolini's system, based on the <pb facs="5423967_2_0048.jpg" n="6"/>Papal bulls, leads directly to the guardianship of the Catholic church and sacred inquisition.</p>
   <p>If the priest, Coughlin, is only a tool of the Catholic church which still dreams of conquering all countries and spreading its sway over all peoples, the other pretenders to dictatorship, General Johnson and Senator Long, have no less powerful and influential backers and benefactors from Wall Street.</p>
   <p>All these heroes and saviors, however, have been properly routed out and exposed. Maybe only Foster, a dictator of the Stalin stamp, will contend for the laurels of priority with Coughlin and Long. No good would come of that. This fellow, Foster, would divide everything in such way that even the workers would be left without their shirts.</p>
   <p>Let us live better without dictators and seek new and other ways toward a better and more equitable life.</p>
