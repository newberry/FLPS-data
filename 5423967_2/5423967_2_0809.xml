   <p>The other day, the Department of Justice published statistical data on the growth of criminal activity in the United States. If such figures were published by an institution other than the Department of Justice, the data would seem fantastic and extremely exaggerated. Many an American would say in such a case that the data had been released by some source inimical to the American people, in order to present the United States to the rest of the world as a country of criminals. But since the statistical data was released for publication by a government body that is engaged in eradicating crime, one cannot doubt the validity of the figures.</p>
   <p>From the data published, one realizes that the army of American criminals is larger than the armed forces of all the European countries combined. Toward the end of last year, the Department of Justice had on its roster 5,824,448 persons with criminal records; out of this number, 4,696,576 persons had been <pb facs="5423967_2_0810.jpg" n="2"/>fingerprinted. However, these figures, as the Department of Justice points out, do not fully reveal the crime situation because there are many cities that do not supply this department with data concerning the number of arrests made, and other information about criminals. What is more, there are many criminals in the country who have never been arrested, and, therefore, are not classed as such. The picture of criminal activity would have been much more horrifying if the Department of Justice could have identified all the criminals and registered them as such.</p>
   <p>During the year 1934, the Department received 343,582 communications concerning criminal arrests. After these reports were analyzed, it was established that out of the total number, 120,883 persons had previous criminal records and had been fingerprinted before. Criminals arrested in 1934 are divided as follows: whites, 247,753; Negroes 80,618; Mexicans, 10,418; women, 23,645. For major crimes, 229,470 persons have been arrested; for minor offenses, 114,112.</p>
   <p>Out of the total number arrested, 6,636 persons were charged with murder or <pb facs="5423967_2_0811.jpg" n="3"/>homicide; 14,377 persons with robbery; 70,894 persons with stealing automobiles and other property; 9,576 persons with embezzlement and fraud; and 6,191 persons with carrying concealed weapons. A large majority of the male criminals were about nineteen years old, and the women, around twenty-three. According to the data, the Department lists about 5,000 bank robbers. The country as a whole, as a result of the crime activity, suffers an annual loss of over twelve billion dollars.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, during the six-month period from October, 1934 to March, 1935, 1,193 criminals were brought before the courts. Of these, fifty-two per cent had previous criminal records. We should also take note of the causes leading to crime, since very often crime is attributed to and explained by economic conditions.</p>
   <p>Last year the warden of Sing Sing asked 1,371 inmates under his jurisdiction to give the reason for their entrance into crime. The answers were as follows: 700 prisoners recognized their cause to be bad environment; 135, unemployment; <pb facs="5423967_2_0812.jpg" n="4"/>81, easy gain; 14, women's influence; 13, greed; 1, his own foolishness. Thus, only ten per cent of the prisoners claimed that economic circumstances (unemployment) caused their entrance into crime; more than half of them blamed their bad environments, and attached no significance to economic conditions at all.</p>
   <p>On the basis of this analysis, we must conclude that the youth, who make up such a high percentage of the criminal population, should beware of bad environment more than of anything else. This, though incomplete, is the picture of crime in America.</p>
