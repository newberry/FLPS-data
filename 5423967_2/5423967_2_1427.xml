   <p>In a debate on November 23rd, between Mr. Moravsky and Mr. Seoev, the works of our local poets, Bondarenko, Stotsky and Kornosevich, were harshly condemned. Whether the merits of these poets as contributors to the field of culture, be great or small, I wish, nevertheless, to say a few words in their defense, and to point out the unjust criticism of Moravsky and Seoev.</p>
   <p>If Bondarenko, Stotsky and Kornosevich are not poets (as Moravsky and Seoevstate), even though they be not Pushkins, Bloks or Nadsons, they are still entitled to a more just appraisement than that meted out to them by our critics. They are entitled to a kinder treatment, even for the simple reason, that though they are weak as poets, yet they are, after all, toilers of the spiritual world. If this world of theirs be small, just the same, it is a spiritual one for them. If people dedicate themselves to this cause, we must but say: "You are welcome to the temple of culture;" and not aim to fell their heads for the sole reason of their love of poetry.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1428.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Let us admit that we do not derive any great delight in reading these poems; that their perusal causes our heads to ache (as remarked by Mr. Seoev) yet we should realize that the poets indulging in their own creations find great spiritual satisfaction and an outlet for the energy of their restless souls.</p>
   <p>If people could do the work that most interests them, this world would be a happier place.</p>
   <p>Who are these poets, and what is their background? They are the sons of peasants, brought up on those places, where the light of culture did not penetrate.In villages, where there were seldom any peasants who were not illiterate. They had come to a foreign country not for amusement but for hard labor in stuffy factories, plants and mines. After finishing this unbearably hard work, they would come home exhausted and instead of seeking rest they would go for a book and pen, and labor mentally. Our critics, Moravsky and Seoev, reproach our poets for not trying to correct their illiteracy. I partly agree with these remarks of the critics, with this exception, that the poets do their utmost to improve themselves. Certainly, they are not Pushkins or Byrons, but they possess a Muse of their own, which endows their lives with <pb facs="5423967_2_1429.jpg" n="3"/>meaning. Mr. Gribov, in his speech, spoken in defence of the poets, said, that these men pass many sleepless nights, in their efforts to create this work. I regard, therefore this ruthless criticism, on the part of Moravsky and Seoev unfair and consider it dangerous. Seoev points to Pushkin, Nadson and Blok in comparison, and suggests for our local poets to hush up, on the strength, that their work is uninspirational, and harmful rather than beneficial. Our critic is a writer of fables himself, but he forgets that he is not another Krylov, and that his writings may give us headaches too. His criticism, therefore is quite unjust.</p>
   <p>Not everyone can be a Pushkin, a Dostoevsky, a Tolstoy or a Krylov. But just the same our local poets should be given encouragement instead of reproachment; all the more so, since these sons of peasants had no opportunity of enlightenment. Their ill-fate was their university. Dr. Pertzov expressed it well, when he said, that among the swamps of our colony these men loom as great pillars of hope.</p>
