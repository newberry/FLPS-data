   <p>Last Saturday, in the Russian-American Citizens' Club, 1902 West Division Street, a banquet was given in honor of Mr. Moravsky, editor of Rassviet, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the inception of his literary and public career. About a hundred guests were present. Among them were representatives of Russian public life in Chicago and friends and admirers of the editor. There were also guests from the suburbs. The Russian Orthodox clergy were represented by the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty of Chicago and by the Reverend P. Nirvanna of Minneapolis. Of the R. I. M. A. S. those present were President A. Pasiuk, A. Dedoshko, and [five] members of the central administration, N. Sabinsky, G. Volos, D. Michalchik, D. Vorobay, and V. Olesiuk. From St. Vladimir's parish on Leavitt Street Mr. Kopernik, Mr. Michailovsky, and others attended. The Russian-American Citizens' Organization was represented by its president, Mr. G. Orlovsky.</p>

   <p>The guests were addressed by the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty, the Reverend P. Nirvanna, Professor A. Nedzelnitsky, Dr. Pertsov, J. Voronko, and G. Vasiliev. They all pointed out the great public services rendered by Mr. E. Moravsky in his capacity of journalist, public man, and orator, a man strong and unwavering in his convictions and responsive to every good cause.</p>
   <p>S. Dubimka ("Miss Russia") and Mary Melnik ("Miss Rassviet") presented Mr. Moravsky with a lovely bouquet of flowers and a valuable wrist watch, to signify, we presume, that in the future the newspaper should come off the press in time. Mr. N. Novin acted as toastmaster. Mr. Cheslavsky, editor of the Russkoye Obozrenie, presented the guest of honor with a written address of gratitude covered with many signatures.</p>
   <p>Dancing and friendly conversation lasted till late at night.</p>
