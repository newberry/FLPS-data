<title level="a">RUSSIANS ARE LEAVING THE STOCKYARDS</title>
</bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Russians who are working in the stockyards report that during the last months many Russian workers have left their jobs there.</p>
   <p>The reason for doing so is their desire to find better work, with better remuneration and in more suitable conditions. It is also reported that recently many Russians have obtained positions of foremen and managers of minor departments. More "privileged" Russian workers are also to be found, such as specialists in cutting meat, sorters of meat products and eggs, etc. They are mostly men who have specialized in these kinds of work for many years. In general, in the opinion of old residents, Russians who are working now in the stockyards are progressing fast. They are no more the butt of ridicule, they choose, if possible, the better kinds of work, paying better remuneration. One thing, however, remains the same as it was before: many Russians who are working in the stockyards are still spending their evenings in a foolish way, frequenting pool rooms and saloons and playing cards. Although in this respect there is also noticeable some slight improvement, many are attending evening schools. More and more Russians who speak English are found at present among those who work in the stockyards.</p>
