   <p>The concert's program consisted chiefly of songs. The following singers participated: Mme. Mashir, Mme. Sokolov, Mme. Shukhvostov and Mr. Kosteluk. Their appearance on the stage was greeted with asstorm of applause........</p>
   <p>Other artists who participated in the musical program were: Mr. Dobrokhotov, Balalaika; Mr. Remeo--accordian, and the "Echo" string orchestra. Mr. Dobrokhotov, as usually, charmed the public with his playing and his technique. The "Echo" string-orchestra performed a few light pieces which earned an ovation. The accordian players proved good, considering their youthful age.</p>
   <p>Mr. Arrigoni's humor as usual kept the audience in merriment.</p>
   <p>The surprises in the concert program, were speeches, by J. Kobrinsky, W. Olesuk, W. Kishun, Mr. Zmagar and Mr. Grossman, of the City Council Board.</p>
   <p>There was a large attendance. All seats were filled including the balcony.... The concert was a great success both materially and morally. Profits will go to the unemployed.</p>
