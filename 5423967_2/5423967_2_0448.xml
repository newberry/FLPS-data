   <p>The Chicago Society for Aid to Political Exiles and Prisoners in Russia extends to you, comrades, brotherly congratulations on the great events in our native land.</p>
   <p>With a feeling of indescribable joy this society greets you in the days when the great aims of those whom the society considered it a duty to assist, is beginning to materialize.</p>
   <p>Overfilled with love and with loyalty to its best sons, the nation which is just barely beginning to lift its head, became imbued with the obligation of freeing from prisons and from exile the fighters. And in the jubilant shouts from the nation who has raised its head, also in the manifesto of the provisional government, before all else, <pb facs="5423967_2_0449.jpg" n="2"/>have been heard the stern words: Full amnesty for all political prisoners. These obligations of the nation for them were not incidental.</p>
   <p>Under heavy jail locks, in irons, and under terrific guard have been held those who, by endless sacrifices of freedom, life and health, have, over a stretch of years, been teaching the nation those concepts with which it has now ventured out.</p>
   <p>The workingmen and soldiers of Petersburg and of Moscow, they who overthrew the autocrat and the autocratic clique, have, in all their demands, repeated only the same slogans for which the fighters have paid so dearly.</p>
   <p>The Society for Aid to Political Exiles and Prisoners in Russia extends its greetings to you, comrades and citizens of our native land. It greets you and fraternally congratulates you on the eve of liberating <pb facs="5423967_2_0450.jpg" n="3"/>our fighters, on the eve of the great revolution with the approaching of a great bright future for our country, in whose history our glorious, brave fighters, through trials of imprisonment and exile, have long since written in shining pages of heroism.</p>
