  <body>
   <p>Because of the present election and the struggle for power between the two major political parties, it will be of interest at this time to enumerate some of the more important achievements of the Democratic Administration.</p>
   <p>I. Shorter working hours.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows that decreasing the number of hours in the work day, or the number of days in a work week, gives more leisure to the workers, creates a demand for more workers, and generally improves the condition of the working people.</p>
   <p>2. A minimum wage.</p>
   <p>This assures the worker, especially the unskilled worker, a certain fixed wage, and protects him from exploitation by the employer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0854.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. Restriction of child labor.</p>
   <p>Greater protection for minors will keep more children in schools, and will safeguard the health and insure the proper physical development of the young generation.</p>
   <p>4. The right to organize.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Administration has given the workers the right to form their own unions, and to strike in order to win higher wages.</p>
   <p>5. Relief for the unemployed.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Administration has demonstrated a sincere interest in the lot of the country's unemployed, whereas the Republicans, when in power, had shown no interest in the unemployment problem. Now the unemployed receive government relief and can live like human beings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0855.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>6. Aid for the farmers.</p>
   <p>Federal aid to farmers has saved hundredsof thousands of American farms from imminent ruin. The bankruptcy proceedings and the liquidation of farm properties were halted when Federal loans for the farmers were instituted by the Democratic Administration.</p>
   <p>7. Public Works.</p>
   <p>As a result of the Federal Public Works Administration's plan for a nation-wide construction program, millions of unemployed have received employment, thus unburdening the relief rolls.</p>
   <p>8. Homesteads.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Administration has undertaken the great task of settling the unemployed on the farms, on especially prepared homesteads. This new plan is undergoing far-reaching experimentation, and may prove to be a blessing to the poor man.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0856.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>9. Bank insurance.</p>
   <p>The bank catastrophe during the Hoover Administration had brought poverty and despair to millions of small depositors. The Roosevelt Administration took a decisive step to prevent a similar situation from arising in the future. The banking system of the country has been changed. Insurance of all deposits up to $5,000 has been introduced, thus guaranteeing the depositor against all possible bank defaults and bankruptcies in the future.</p>
   <p>10. Prohibition.</p>
   <p>The Prohibition amendment to the Constitution proved to be harmful to the nation. However, the Republican Administration was unable to decide whether or not to put an end to Prohibition. It took the Democrats to deliver the decisive blow to the Prohibition law by submitting the question to the vote of the states.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0857.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>11. Restriction of competition.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Administration is waging a stubborn fight against unwarranted and dishonest competition in commerce and in industry. Such competition throws the economic life of the nation out of balance.</p>
   <p>12. Higher prices for farm products.</p>
   <p>Because of widespread unemployment in the cities, farm products could not be sold in sufficient quantities, and, consequently, the prices fell far below normal. To remedy this condition, the Roosevelt Administration undertook measures to boost prices on all agricultural products, thereby improving the economic condition of the American farmer.</p>
   <p>This is only a brief review of the many constructive activities of the Democratic Administration intended to reform and improve the economic life of the people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0858.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>of this country. This summary is sufficient, however, to throw a strong light on the present Democratic Administration and on its plans for the future. The Democratic party is the party of progress and improvement. All Russians who are citizens of the United States should vote the Democratic ticket in the November 6 election.</p>
