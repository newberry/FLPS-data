   <p>p. 34--Mr. F. V. Sykora, cellist, is a comparatively young man. He was born and received his musical educations in the city of Kiev. The Kiev Conservatory of Music under the direction of the famous composer R. M. Glier, who is at present in Moscow, ranked among the best musical schools in Europe. In the conservatory, the talent of Mr. F. V. Sykora was developed, and now we have excellent reports of him from the sternest musical critics.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sykora for the last few years has traveled over more than half of the surface of the earth. His playing has been heard in Kiev, Vladivostok, Hongkong, Tokio, and many of the cities in the United States.</p>
   <p>After a short visit in Chicago, Mr. Sykora left for Houston, Texas, where he continued his musical career. In the English musical magazines there appeared several articles by Mr. F. V. Sykora on Russian Music, and the modern Russian compositions.</p>
