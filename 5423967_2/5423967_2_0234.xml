   <p>In Russia, as we know, there are 160 million inhabitants, and the Communist party boasted to have up to January 1st, of this year only 2,040,655 members. It is clear, therefore, that the Communists constitute an insignificant portion of the population. Notwithstanding the above, the Communists declare that they are the true representatives of the will and aspiration of the Russian people.</p>
   <p>If the Russian people supported the Bolsheviks and agreed with their political and economical program, then, undoubtedly, the Communist party would have in its rank and file not two, but possibly twenty or fifty million members. But since the Communist party has only 2,040,655 members, this testifies to the fact that 158 million people do not support the Communist party and that they are not in accord with its program. The Communists, therefore, express their own will, and not the will of the Russian people, and consequently when committing criminal acts, they do not have the moral right to assert that they are acting on behalf of the Russian people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0235.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Especially among the European and American Communists there are even rascals, who consider as genuine Russians those not of the 158 million Russian people, but only those of the Russians who belong to the Communist party. Among those rascals are to be included the followers of Novymir (New World); these Communist do not differ at all from the gendarmes and ultra-reactionaries of the tsarist regime, who considered themselves as the genuine representatives of the Russian people, and the rest of the population were mere "cattle."</p>
   <p>If the socialists and anarchists began to criticize the Tsar, then these gendarmes and the zealots of conservatism would shout that the socialists and and anarchists are the worse enemies of the Russian people. They strive to ruin Russia. In order to save Russia and the Russian people, it is necessary to hang these enemies.</p>
   <p>Many Communists maintain the same thing at the present time. For instance, when the newspaper Rassviet criticizes the Communist party which has replaced the Tsar they start to scream that Rassviet is the enemy of the Russian people.When the newspaper Rassviet subjects to criticism the <pb facs="5423967_2_0236.jpg" n="3"/>Communist despotism, then these rascals well like lunatics that Rassviet aims at the destruction of the "peasants and workers country." These rascals act exactly the same way as the gendarmes and the zealots of conservatism. They consider that their party represents the Russian people, and that any opposition against the Communist despotism is tantamount of fighting against the nation.</p>
   <p>Why do they act that way? Why do they substitute certain ideas for others? They do it solely with the purpose of leading astray the illiterate people, who cannot descriminate between the interests of the people and those of the ruling party. That is why these crooks swindle in their political game by transforming the black into red, and the red into black. When Rassviet exposes their criminal work, they falsely claim to be the mouth-piece of the Russian people and declare to the naive and illiterate people that the newspaper Rassviet is the enemy of the Russian people. But in reality the reason why the newspaper Rassviet criticizes the Communist party is because the welfare of the Russian people is very dear to it. The newspaper indicates that between the Communist party and the Russian people there is nothing in common, as this party did not liberate the <pb facs="5423967_2_0237.jpg" n="4"/>people but, on the contrary, enslaved it. The newspaper conducts a vigorous struggle not with Russia proper, but with the Communist despotism, which leads Russia toward a chronic famine. This newspaper carries on the fight against the crooks, using the name of the Russian people when committing various crimes.</p>
   <p>It is useless, therefore, for the followers of the Novymir (New World) to change the white to black and vice versa. No one will believe their lies. Not only Rassviet but every intelligent man knows that the Communists are the worse enemies of the Russian people and that they do not have the right to falsely assert that they speak on behalf of the people.</p>
