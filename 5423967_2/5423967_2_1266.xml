   <p>Last Saturday, in the new hall on Wood Street, there took place a concert ball arranged by three children's schools maintained by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (RNzOV). The entertainment was a very successful one, both culturally and financially.</p>
   <p>This time the school committees had arranged an excellent musical program, which attracted a great many people. The concert program was participated in by the following artists: Miss Georgieuskava, an opera singer; M. Kosteliuk, a well-known Russian-Ukrainian artist; and Miss S. Dubinka, violin seleist. Their appearances were greeted with great enthusiasm. Included in the program was a gypsy tabor, composed of the school children; and there were other attrastions.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, also, the Wood Street congregation witnessed a great event. The <pb facs="5423967_2_1267.jpg" n="2"/>services were conducted by the newly appointed priest, Reverend P. Nirvanna, who had just arrived from the East coast, assisted by Reverend V. Antsiferou. Reverend Nirvanna is a well-known man in the United States. He is an eloquent speaker and a very good lecturer and thinker.</p>
   <p>The Wood Street center has not for a long time seen so many people as appeared Sunday. The church was crowded. Many who were unable to get inside stood around the church and in the courtyard. The people came to see the Reverend Nirvanna and to hear him preach. Inside the church one could see a few Bolsheviks and even atheists. The sermon delivered by Reverend Nirvanna touched most of the people deeply, and one could see some men and women in tears. After the services, one could hear, both from the members of the congregation and from outsiders, most enthusiastic opinions concerning Reverened Nirvanna. Some people said: "Now we have a father who possesses knowledge and is able to express his thoughts. With the help of such a clergyman, our congregation can accomplish much good for the Russian colony."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1268.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On the same day, Reverend Nirvanna appeared at the meeting of the Saint George Brotherhood and conveyed to those present words of greeting. He was also present at the concert arranged by the Saint George Parish. At the concert, the auditorium was filled to overflowing, and the crowd was so orderly and quiet that it was a surprise to many who-had attended entertainments on Wood Street on several previous occasions.</p>
   <p>Reverend Nirvanna spoke a word of advice at the concert. He counseled the Russian people to live in peace and friendliness with their neighbors, to give more thought to what unites them, and to live not only for the pursuit of material things but for spiritual things as well. He said the new parish building should be not only a religious center but a place for the development of Russian culture and scientific thought. Reverend Nirvanna's words of advice met with an enthusiastic response and thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The concert was an outstanding success. Most of the concert program consisted <pb facs="5423967_2_1269.jpg" n="4"/>of numbers sung by the famous choir of Agrenev-Slavianskoy.</p>
   <p>The concert given by the Saint Vladimir Brotherhood was not so successful. The attendance was not large. Perhaps the failure was due to the fact that the arrangement committee had not given enough thought to advertising. As a matter of fact, even Rassviet did not carry any notice concerning this entertainment.</p>
