   <p>The Russian Workers Cooperative Grocery and Meat Market, - sister enterprise of the Russian Cooperative Restaurant, - was opened in 1929. It is under the guidance of the Russian Cooperative Society and abides by the same constitution as does the restaurant.</p>
   <p>A large part of the workers of this community and other communities are in sympathy with the work of the Russian Workers Cooperative Grocery and Meat Market and help maintain it. Because it is not a store only, but an institution friendly toward workers, it is patronized by workers of all nationalities. Its financial standing is quite sound. All profits of the store are turned over to the treasury of the Russian Cooperative Society and are used for cultural, educational and social activities of the Russian workers.</p>
   <p>The store is managed by a member of the Russian Cooperative Society. It has three employees - all are members of the cooperative. Mr. Michael Poziwilko is in charge of all affairs of the cooperative. Although <pb facs="5423967_2_1023.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Posiwilko prefers that his employees be members of the cooperative society, he also employs non-members who are skilled workers and are in need of employment.</p>
