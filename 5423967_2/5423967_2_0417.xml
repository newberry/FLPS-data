   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>Some time ago, soon after your society had been formed, and in connection with a certain gathering of your society, there appeared in a local paper, the Chicago Daily News, a very provoking article, in which all Russian Socialists combating war were called German agents. In this article it was stated - as per the wisdom of a certain Socialist - that Russian literature against war, Socialist publications in Russian. Russian massmeetings, etc., all this is backed by German funds. It was further stated in the article (as information from 'one who knows') that all the Russian Socialist-Internationalists, whether in Russia or America, are in the service of the Kaiser, and so on.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Accordingly, the conference of Russian Socialist organizations for aid to the Russian revolution replied to this provoking article, explaining the actual position taken by the Russian Socialist-Internationalists on the question of war.</p>
   <p>I learned recently that the article published in the Daily News was from the pen of a member of your society.</p>
   <p>When that gentleman openly admitted his authorship at one of your society's meetings, your society, I was told, did not take any steps in this matter.</p>
   <p>Is this true?</p>
   <p>Is it true that this gentleman is regarded by your society as a sincere friend of Russian democracy and is still in the ranks of your society's membership?</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0419.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Furthermore, at your conference for the organization of a reception for the special mission from Russia, headed by Professor Bakhmetev, you had - among other representatives at the conference - also delegates from three churches, and among these was one from the church on Leavitt Street, where at this time there goes a Blackhundred agitation to restore to power the tsar and the old regime. It is said that Priest Kukulev was there as a delegate from his church, and that you accepted him as a delegate, and you found it possible to discuss with him details of the reception for the mission sent by a revolutionary government.</p>
   <p>Is it true?</p>
   <p>Would you not take the trouble to give an open answer to these questions through Novyi Mir? This question is of interest not to me alone, but to the entire Russian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>M. A. Stolyar</p>
