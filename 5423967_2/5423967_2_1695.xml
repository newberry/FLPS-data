   <p>The concert and ball given for the benefit of the Daily Rassviet on January 29, 1928, proved to be a great success. In spite of the fact that on that day there were four similar festivities organized by various Russian organizations, the concert and ball of the Rassviet attracted a large crowd of Russians. It was in all respects the most successful festivity of that kind arranged by Rassviet.</p>
   <p>The public was attracted to this concert ball by the many interesting numbers on its program. The names of some of the most talented Russian and other artists appeared on this program. Among the names of the Russian artists that of Countess M. Kuchkovski aroused perhaps the greatest interest among the Russians, as this singer, if we are not mistaken, was to appear for the first time before an <pb facs="5423967_2_1696.jpg" n="2"/>audience of Chicago Russians. The countess is undoubtedly an eminent artist; she has a mellow voice and a remarkable technique. The public gave her a very warm reception and she had to sing a few encores.</p>
   <p>The center of attraction was the Mayak. The popularity of our Russian Gypsies increases with every new performance. When these jolly fellows and girls appear on the stage, the attention of the public is immediately riveted upon them. Among the best actors of the Mayak we have to mention Mr. Gribov, who played very well his role in the comedy "Medvyed" (The Bear). Mrs. Gribov was very good in her role of the Gypsy soloist at the 'Gypsy Camp.' Dr. Korablinov's acting in the last scene of the 'Gypsy Camp.' was grand. Dr. Kamm, from Gary, Ind., helped to stage the shows of the Mayak Company.</p>
   <p>The children of the Progressive School have shown a remarkable progress in the theatrical art under the coaching of Dr. Korablinov.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1697.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The well-known Polish singer Miss M. Groschinski had a well-earned success; she has a powerful voice and graceful manners and by her beautiful singing she held the whole audience spellbound.</p>
   <p>The opera singer Mr. G. Morozov, who had volunteered to participate in the concert, was also appreciated very much by the public.</p>
