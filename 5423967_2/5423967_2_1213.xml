   <p>Ivan Lazarev, Russian artist of the Moscow Art Theater, passed away in his fifty-second year.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarev, a native of Saratov, arrived in America in 1922, with the Moscow Art Theater Co. He remained in the United States exclusively for the purpose of fostering Russian art.Mr. Lazarev became famous when he produced and staged the "Miracle", and played the dual role of an insane emperor and a lame beggar.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarev, with the cooperation of Americans, founded in Chicago a model art theater, including a theatrical school. He was very influential among the American theatrical groups. In spite of his ill health, he would not forsake his work, which he loved.</p>
   <p>He died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Funeral services will be held today at the Church of St. Michael, 4400 S. Paulina St., at 2 P.M. Interment will take place at Mount Hope Cemetery. I. Lazarev is survived by his widow, the well known actress, Mary Astrov.</p>
