   <p>The Bolshevik newspapers seem to think that during the last few months, the Soviet government has begun to map out a new policy with regard to its domestic and foreign affairs. These declarations are made on the basis of those "democratic reforms" which have either been planned, or already effected, such as, entrance into the League of Nations, democratization of elections, abolition of bread cards, certain concessions to collective farmers, etc.</p>
   <p>From all these reforms, the Bolshevik papers conclude that if not in the immediate future, then a little later, the conditions under which the Russian people live will begin to improve. But the Soviet citizens attach no significance to these Bolshevik "reforms". The correspondent from Krestcross [Translator's note: Krestcross is a news bureau in Western Europe maintaining underground channels for receiving information from Russia] reports that <pb facs="5423967_2_0676.jpg" n="2"/>the population of the U.S.S.R. treats the new reforms ironically. Even among the party members and workers, such statements as these are heard: "We have fallen in love with the League of Nations, and we are fast becoming bourgeois." "Our socialism is full of holes and we are suffering from the draft." "We shall see how we shall live in the future: Perhaps instead of house committees, we shall have landlords." "We are racing full steam ahead--not toward Marx, but toward Nicholas I."</p>
   <p>Further on, the same correspondent writes that even under the new plan, everything will remain as it is: Communists will continue to feed the people in the capital city so that they will remain quiet and docile. As formerly, the workers in large key plants and factories, who, with tacit understanding of Bolshevik authorities, receive many favors, will continue to remain walled-in behind their "closed stores and supply depots," inaccessible to the masses. These stores and depots will, as before, continue to receive abundant supplies not only of bread, but of other products of which there is a definite shortage, and which are scarcely obtainable for the common people. And, as before, the rest of the working people will continue to remain <pb facs="5423967_2_0677.jpg" n="3"/>underfed, to go around ragged, to freeze from lack of clothing, and to curse Communists and hope for a better future.</p>
   <p>The correspondent pictures the present condition of the workers as follows:</p>
   <p>Due to extremely unfortunate circumstances, the "desertions from the labor front" are not diminishing. To stop this in the industrial establishments, severe measures are taken. To receive work, the following documents are required from the applicant: discharge papers from the last place of work, membership card, passport, which must be in good order, and in which notice is made by the last employer that the worker was discharged and did not desert from his place of work. Such an entry on the passport is indispensable for all those who seek employment.</p>
   <p>Workers are usually hired through the labor exchange, but that procedure can be circumvented by filing an application with the labor bureau which is to be found in every industrial establishment, if one possesses all the documents above mentioned. For applicants seeking work for the first time, a two-week <pb facs="5423967_2_0678.jpg" n="4"/>test period is necessary. In large cities, unemployment exists, but it is difficult to estimate it is extent, because officially there is no unemployment in the U.S.S.R.</p>
   <p>Workers' earnings are not sufficient to cover even the most modest needs, and for that reason the workers resort to various means of obtaining additional funds to cover their living expenses. For instance, they will sell the clothing they receive from the so-called closed stores. Most of the buyers of such articles come from those elements who have been entirely deprived of the right to purchase such articles. Such people buy both for their own use and for resale at a profit (for speculative purposes). Speculation is the only means by which they can make a living.</p>
   <p>All this indicates that Bolsheviks are not only on the way back to the times of Nicholas I, but have already reached that goal, with only one difference. During that Czar's time the serfs enjoyed better economic conditions than the so-called free Soviet citizens, not to mention several million Soviet slaves doing hard labor in exile.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0679.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As far as the political oppression is concerned, Nicholas I might have borrowed a few leaves from the political book of Bolshevism in practice.</p>
