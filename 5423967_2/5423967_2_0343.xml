   <p>The recent telegrams begin to bring us more consoling news from Russia. We are informed that the Bolsheviki see the uselessness of their foolish tactics. They have come to the conclusion that the only way of saving the revolution is to make an alliance with the other socialist parties, which would also save everything that depends on the salvation of the revolution.</p>
   <p>Until the socialist parties unite for common interests, the freedom won by the revolution is in danger.</p>
   <p>I am not a prophet. I do not believe in prophecy, but seeing everything that takes place, I referred myself to this question about two months ago in one of the articles entitled, "The Elementary Needs of Russia."</p>
   <p>As the article was written in the Russkaya Zhizn at the time when this <pb facs="5423967_2_0344.jpg" n="2"/>paper was published in Detroit, and the subscribers of this paper in Chicago, were not as many as there are now. I am inclined to think that it would not be out of order if I would state some of the principal points from that article.</p>
   <p>The people and the organized groups, being penetrated by the feeling of sympathy toward ruined Russia, come from here and from everywhere to help the victims of chaos and storm in Russia. Each of them, in his own way, is ready to render aid; someone would donate a pair of shoes, someone else some money; others would like to help with locomotives and freight cars; still others with protests or by enlisting in the armies of the Bolsheviki and anti-Bolsheviki. All are directed by the feeling of obligation toward the fatherland and the revolution, and all are impelled to help the great cause of liberation, and if we can judge this or that person, this or that political course, I would call it a mistake in tactics.</p>
   <p>The greatest need of Russia is the preservation of the freedom that <pb facs="5423967_2_0345.jpg" n="3"/>has been won. This is possible only when all the revolutionary people of all political factions achieve unity. In other words, the revolutionary socialist parties should inevitably unite. It is time to know that the difference between the Bolsheviki and the Mensheviki is only in tactics, that is, in the way of attaining righteousness on earth; the mighty ones of this world were not allowed any more to scoff at the right of the poor working people. The right of a just distribution of the land, and the right of claiming the fruits of one's labor were obtained by the toilers.</p>
   <p>Similar opinions exist in both the right and the left wings of the revolutionary socialist parties. Both are struggling for the happiness of the people and for righteousness. Both from their point of view are right. Both parties need dynamic power and common sense, for the simple reason that in this union is to be found only salvation of the revolution. The influential initiation of the Socialist leaders is <pb facs="5423967_2_0346.jpg" n="4"/>needed in this recovery. It is but time to put away the savage destruction of one revolutionist by another, of one socialist party by another.</p>
   <p>The thoughtful elements inevitably will come to such a conclusion. I shall not prophecy, but I will say that the sole deliverance from this terrible disagreement in party affairs is the powerful national revolutionary and socialist organization.</p>
   <p>The United Socialists.</p>
