<title level="a">THE RUSSIAN GROUP ENTERS THE ARENA OF PUBLIC LIFE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>In the past our group has shown very little interest in the life and affairs of the United States. This can be explained by the following two facts: our immigration to this country began much later than that of other national groups; and the Russian immigrants came to the United States with the fixed idea of staying here only a short time. Their purpose was to earn and save a little money, and then return to their homeland as soon as possible to start their family life on their native soil. But our destinies are in the hands of a blind and insidious fate, which shapes them in its own way. During our absence from our fatherland many changes took place there, which forced us to remain here for many years, perhaps forever. Thus we had to become citizens of this country. During this changing time a new Russian generation was born and raised in this country, a generation of young men and women who automatically became citizens of the United States. In this manner, in the land of Uncle Sam, there came into being a new racial group, a solid Russian generation, which leads a permanent way of life and has accepted all the duties and obligations of citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0593.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Since we are now a part of the native population of this country, we should receive and exercise full rights and privileges as regards participation in public life and in the government of the country in which we live. To this day we have had no such rights; our group has been treated like a stepchild, although the democratic form of government of the United States and our Constitution fully guarantee equality and equal opportunity to every citizen.</p>
   <p>It is our own fault that we have been left on the side line of the main current of life in this country. We have not been organized, and we have not known how to look after our own interests. Other national groups, even our Slavic brothers the Poles and the Czechs, a long time ago adapted themselves to the way of life in this country. They formed strong organizations, and through intensive organized effort succeeded in obtaining the recognition of municipal, state and federal governments, where they are now properly represented by their own people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0594.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us take, for example, our own city of Chicago with its three and a half million people, thirty-two per cent of which are of Slavic origin or descent--over one million people. Here our Slavic brothers, after a hard political struggle, are now occupying a prominent place in public life and in the government of this city. For instance, there are over two thousand Poles holding different positions in the city government, and as many Czechs. The Serbs, Croats and others are probably represented in the same proportion. But there are no Russians. Also in the executive, judicial and legislative branches of our city and state governments many Slavs occupy high positions. We need mention only our last mayor, [Anton J. Cermak.] who was of Czech origin. There are also scores of judges, aldermen and other officials occupying responsible positions in the affairs of our city, county and state who belong to the Slavic race. There are many Slavs holding responsible Federal positions. But there are no Russians.</p>
   <p>And where do we Russians stand? Only our group, due to its lack of interest and organization, even at this time, remains a stepchild of this great country, <pb facs="5423967_2_0595.jpg" n="4"/>and waits outside the pale of public life of our city, state and country. It is time that we opened our eyes. It is time for us to unite our forces and enter the arena of public life on the same level with any other group or party. There is a large number of us here. According to the last census there are 177,000 Russians in Chicago and Cook County; 75,000 of them are full-fledged citizens of this country, having full and absolute right not only to vote and elect candidates for various offices, but also to be elected to those offices. Up to this time we have always been represented in the local or Federal elections by some unknown strangers who received all the credit, fat political jobs or financial remuneration for our votes. Only recently the more prominent individuals among our people have begun to realize the importance of united action, and have started to build political organizations.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago there was organized in Chicago the Russian-American Democratic League, composed of the Russians, the Carpatho-Ruthenians and the Ukrainians. The organizers are persons with good political records and experience. The <pb facs="5423967_2_0596.jpg" n="5"/>appearance of this new organization aroused much interest in the Russian group. The League has begun its work with marked efficiency. In the short time of its existence it has succeeded in spreading its network of branches in many parts of the city and in neighboring towns. The League is a member of the Slavonic Alliance of America, which embraces all Slavic groups in this country.</p>
   <p>What are the aims of the Russian-American Democratic League and what can we expect from it? The League aims to extend legal aid to us when we need it in the courts or in matters relative to property taxes; aid in finding help and shelter for our orphans; help in times of sickness and accidents. The League will also help you to receive aid of a financial nature from Government agencies when you are in economic distress. It will assist you in obtaining a better education for yourselves or your children; will help you to receive city appropriations for the improvement of social and educational facilities in your wards; and will aid in many other circumstances of our individual and community life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0597.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>All the foregoing contingencies are being provided for by the proper city, county, state and Federal authorities and philanthropic institutions. We have our legal right to the use of these institutions. All other national groups in this city derive full benefits from these institutions, but not our group, because we are unorganized and defenseless. It is only our Russian group which at this time appears to be a stepchild of this great American community, because even now we are not organized politically and have no connections with the agencies of public life of this city. This is why the Russian-American Democratic League was organized.</p>
