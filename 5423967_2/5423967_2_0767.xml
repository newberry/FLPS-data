   <p>The Supreme Court of the United States has once more dealt a mortal blow to the New Deal of Roosevelt's Administration. The decision of the Supreme Court which found the AAA unconstitutional produced a greater confusion in Washington than the abolition of the NRA by the decision of the same court some time ago.</p>
   <p>This, of course, is quite natural, for the NRA and the AAA were the two "whales" on which the entire structure of the New Deal was supposed to rest. The NRA was created for improving conditions of the workers, and the AAA for ameliorating conditions on the farms. Whether these institutions have improved the conditions of farmers and workers to any degree it is difficult to say, for the American economists are both favorable and unfavorable to these institutions and, as a matter of fact, cannot agree among themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0768.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, one should not deny the fact that the administration and Congress, by adopting these laws, really intended to help farmers and workers. But the Supreme Court has decided that the laws providing for the NRA and the AAA are unconstitutional. By killing these two "whales" the Court actually reduced to ruins the entire legislative program covering the problems of farmers and workers.</p>
   <p>The AAA, as we all know, was created for the purpose of exercising a partial control over the prices of agricultural products. One of its main tasks was to raise the prices on farm produce. While pursuing this aim, the AAA took steps to reduce the area of land under cultivation and to reduce the number of cattle on the farms, paying to the complying farmers premiums, as some of the American newspapers put it for "wheat that was not planted and for cows and pigs that were not raised".</p>
   <p>During its existence the AAA paid to the farmers $1,200,000,000, and should have paid out $284,000,000 more to those farmers who fulfilled their contracts <pb facs="5423967_2_0769.jpg" n="3"/>on reduction of the cultivated land during the year 1935.</p>
   <p>Thus, for instance, for cotton the farmers received $110,318,820, and $12,681,180 was still due them.</p>
   <p>For wheat, over $60,000,000 was paid over etc.</p>
   <p>The AAA organization, at the peak of its activity, had 6,500 employees, and the U. S. Treasury paid them about $50,000,000 in salaries and wages. The AAA had both positive and negative sides. While reducing production of the farms it created a market for foreign produce. During the last year, for instance, there was imported into the United States a large quantity of foreign wheat and meats. The wheat was imported mainly from Canada and the meat products from Argentina, Poland, and other countries. During the fiscal year of 1933, the beef imported into the country amounted to 34 million pounds; in 1934, to 40 million pounds; and during the last year, to 75 million pounds. During the same years 32 million, 39 million, and 69 million pounds of canned <pb facs="5423967_2_0770.jpg" n="4"/>meat products were imported, respectively. At the end of December, during one week over 250,000 pounds of canned hams from Poland were landed in New York. All in all the imports of meat products during 1935 increased by 3,600 % over those of 1934.</p>
   <p>American farmers during the same period were reducing the cultivated area, and also the number of heads of cattle on their farms, for which reduction they received bonuses.</p>
   <p>Under AAA conditions, the prices on farm products have risen, of course, but the condition of the city populations has not been improved thereby, for the cost of living in cities has increased.</p>
   <p>The Roosevelt administration, however, does not intend to back down on its agricultural program. According to the information coming from Washington, Democratic leaders in Congress, in co-operation with the secretary of Agriculture, are already working on a new bill, which in its essential features <pb facs="5423967_2_0771.jpg" n="5"/>would take the place of the law just abolished by the decision of the Supreme Court, and at the same time would not go contrary to constitutional provisions.</p>
