   <p>Americans born in foreign countries or here! The President of the United States asks you to buy 4% Liberty Loan Bonds! The United States is now at war with an enemy who destroyed in Europe and wiped out from the surface of the earth the homes and peace of millions of people; with an enemy who attacked American honor, American rights and American ships; with an enemy of all those people who believe in democracy and freedom. This is the greatest war of all times, it demands big sums of money in order to bring it to a successful and speedy end. In order to get this money sooner, the Government of the United States issued Government 4% Liberty Bonds in amounts of $50, $100, $1,000, and higher. If you <pb facs="5423967_2_0721.jpg" n="2"/>buy 4% Liberty Bonds in the amount of $100, it means that you loan to the Government of the United States one hundred dollars, helping it to win the war and to win it speedily. This great nation of 110,000,-000 population will not only pay you back the hundred dollars in gold, but will also pay four per cent yearly profit. Buy 4% United States Government Liberty Bonds!</p>
   <p>Buy profits from your government in your new country, the greatest country in the world; in a country which made you what you are now; in a country which believes in you whether you were born here or in any other country; in a country which makes the world the safest place for you and your children. Buy Liberty Bonds because it is the safest, greatest and soundest investment in the world; buy because it is the same as cash money and four per cent interest with it. In buying them you are supporting your government; buy them because by doing so you support the army and navy and you give the enemy to <pb facs="5423967_2_0722.jpg" n="3"/>understand that nothing can satisfy us except full victory, which, once and for all, will stop this war and will make the world secure from such wars forever. Take this announcement to your banker, your employer, or to an official of your organization or society - tell them that you want to be one of the privileged Americans who wants to help his country to win and to end this war. You do not have to pay all the money at once; your bank will show you how you can buy the 4% Liberty Bonds in installments. But do it at once - today!</p>
