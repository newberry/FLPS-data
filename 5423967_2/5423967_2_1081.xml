   <p>In Chicago there are many tailor shops, of which Hart, Shaffner and Marx is the largest firm making men's clothing. Many Russians in Chicago are working in tailor shops. Our Russian tailors in Chicago live no better than the Russian workers who at the Crane Company's factories carry iron on their shoulders, or those who soil themselves at the jails of the stock yards. Two or three times yearly there is slack of work in the tailoring industry. Instead of the 44 hours a week, sometimes it is necessary to work only two or three days a week. That means that business is bad.</p>
   <p>There where it is necessary to put an experienced tailor on a sewing machine and to pay him the salary due according to the union rate, the bosses instead of men hire seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls or aged <pb facs="5423967_2_1082.jpg" n="2"/>women, pay them an insignificant salary and give out home work in big quantities, and thus are snatching work from the men union workers.</p>
   <p>It is bad if you are not a member of the union. If you are a member of the union then it is very hard for you when you are not working, as you have to pay dues. It is hard for the laborer to live in Chicago, but it is a little easier for the professional workers. Besides the above mentioned industry where thousands of our Russians are working in Chicago, there is another important industry in which you can see our Russians in different parts of the city (mostly laborers). There are more than two hundred railroad freight yards in Chicago in different parts of the city, the biggest of which is in Clearing, Illinois, which is not far from Argo. This clearing yard belongs to one of the Chicago companies, The Belt Railroad Company of Chicago. The width of this yard is about one mile. One has only to see the electrical signal system of the latest type and the maneuvers of the cars from one place to another to be extremely astonished at this yard. Every year many Russians work there.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1083.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Many Russians are working in all the other yards, starting with repairing of the railroad tracks and ending with loading and unloading cars. The salary everywhere is from eighteen cents to thirty-eight and one half cents an hour for loaders.</p>
   <p>An insignificant part of the Russian workers in Chicago do not want to bother with hard and dirty work, and prefer to work in the Loop. Some of them are working as servants in restaurants and lunch-rooms; others are trying to get a place in hotels for seventy to eighty dollars a month, and there you see a Russian washing the windows of the skyscrapers, or washing and cleaning automobiles at the garages for from thirty to thirty-five dollars a week. I do not know how many of our Russians are working at the McCormick International Harvester Company, but it is known that quite a number of them work there.</p>
   <p>Besides the common Russian laborers and an insignificant number of more <pb facs="5423967_2_1084.jpg" n="4"/>or less professional workers, we also have quite a few Russians businessmen of all kinds. They ceased to work for the capitalists a long time ago and are working for themselves and their families. One must pass through Maxwell Street, from 12th Street to 20th Street on Halsted, Morgan, and Throop Streets up to Ashland Avenue, and in this district, one without trouble can find Russian meat stores, Russian restaurants and many (useless) Russian pool rooms, Russian barbers, shoemakers and merchants of coal and wood, and all kinds of Russian fruit and vegetable stores.</p>
   <p>As you see, we have here in Chicago our own "businessmen," whom I will divide here in two groups. There are some of our Russian businessmen who with their honesty have gained the confidence not only of the Russian housekeepers but even from housekeepers of other nationalities. They are making a good living. But there are also among our Russian businessmen in Chicago those who, with the opening of some kind of a store, would like to get rich at once. They are not concerned about your pocketbook, but are quite concerned about their own.</p>
