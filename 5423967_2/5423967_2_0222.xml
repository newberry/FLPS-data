   <p>Last Sunday from behind a corner, the bolsheviks' bandits killed V. S. Levkovich, the financial secretary of the Rassviet organization, and active member of the Fifteenth Branch of the Rnzov, Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), because he was one of the best and most honest and active members of the Russian colony, because he, being an honest worker, unafraid of the truth, strove zealously for the unity and enlightenment of the Russian colony. V. Levkovich became the first victim of that political banditry which for several years has been preached and cultivated in the most backward and ignorant section of the Russian colony by Pogromnii Mir [The newspaper, Novyi Mir (The New World), called sarcastically "The Destruction of the World"], and has been converted by all the administrators of the bolshevik organizations, during recent years, into gangs of typical lawbreakers and cutthroats.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0223.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The villainous murder of V. Levkovich is the bolshevik bandit's provocation towards the Russian colony, and the Russian colony should take it as a challenge. If the colony does not stop this banditry, then it will grow to unheard of proportions. The life of every valuable welfare worker will, in such a case, be in danger.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday the bandits performed bloody justice on V. Levkovich, and tomorrow or the day after tomorrow they may, from behind a corner, plunge a knife into the back of some other social welfare worker.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday they killed a member of the Rassviet organization, one of the most active Independents; tomorrow they may organize a similar villainous attack upon the active members of the Roov, Russkoe Ob'edinennoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society), or any other Russian organization.</p>
   <p>Times at present are such that Russian workers and the mutual aid organizations <pb facs="5423967_2_0224.jpg" n="3"/>must take the proper steps to change their words into action, as the deceased Levkovich said a few days ago; they must unite their forces. Now is the time when they must stop all the villainous activities of the bolsheviks' bandits, when they must purge their ranks of those individuals who directly or indirectly condone these bandits and their ideological managers.</p>
   <p>It is time that we knew that the majority of the bolsheviki are not revolutionists and are not defenders of the workers, but are common pogromshchiki (plunderers). This evidence is shown by their making mischief at antibolshevik lectures, their beating up of the anti-bolshevik lecturers, and their many other "heroic" actions of pure hooliganism and banditry, not to speak of what is going on in Russia where such plunderers rule the whole country. It is necessary to teach these hooligans and bandits that they are in America, and not in the U. S. S. R. where such similar bloody justice has been committed against people of different opinions in proportions hitherto unknown to the civilized world.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0225.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Russian people, for many reasons, cannot stop the bolshevik banditry in their own country, but the Russian colony can do it here. This banditry has occurred for the first time, in Chicago, and it may later break forth in other cities if it is not stamped out at the roots. The Russian colony, particularly the organized part of it, shall and must act.</p>
