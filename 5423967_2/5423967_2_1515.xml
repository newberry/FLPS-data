   <p>At the last meeting of the recently organized Russkoye Meditsinskoye Obshchestvo (Russian Medical Society) in Chicago (originally named, Union of Russian Physicians) elections of the members of the board of directors have taken place. The following physicians have been elected: G. V. Khasin, president; M. Sahud, vice-president; H. R. Krasnow, secretary; B. A. Khilkevich, treasurer, and G. Fainstein, A. I. Nedzelnitsky, and N. V. Popov, members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>Dr. Khasin enjoys a great popularity in Chicago as well as in America in general. He was graduated from the Medical Faculty of the Kazan University in 1897 and since that time has devoted himself to scientific activity in the branch of Pathology of the nervous system. His name is known at present to all the scientific medical world. He is professor of Neurology of the Illinois University and consulting physician of State Psychiatric Hospital; he also has held the office of president of the Chicago Neurologic Society....</p>
   <p>The Russian Medical Society has at present more than forty members, and in the very near future will possess its own headquarters--a reading room and club house--for its scientific and business meetings.</p>
