   <p>All agree that the Russian group in America is slowly moving ahead toward a new life. This manifestation of new vigor among our people gladdens our hearts. From now on, let us keep, as our slogan, "All for one, one for all".</p>
   <p>We have our own newspaper, Rassviet, which aids our people in the United States and in Canada. It is up to us to show our appreciation of this service by maintaining the closest contact with this publication, by supplying it with material, and by supporting it morally and financially. If we work together with Rassviet, we will succeed in accomplishing much good for ourselves and for Rassviet.</p>
   <p>We should help by supplying the editors with interesting material regarding life and affairs within our group, so as to make it possible for them to have a larger selection of printable material with which to enliven the newspaper and make it more interesting to readers. We frequently hear the reproach that the <pb facs="5423967_2_1634.jpg" n="2"/>editors of Rassviet allow people to express their widely divergent views on the pages of this newspaper. But we should be proud of the fact that we have a free, workers' newspaper which not only allows, but actually invites and urges, the people to express publicly their thoughts, opinions and convictions on various subjects. Every man can contribute something out of his store of life's experiences and send it, in the form of a letter, to Rassviet! This will add interest and variety to the newspaper.</p>
   <p>Once a week Rassviet devotes special pages to the activities of two Russian mutual aid societies, the Russian United Mutual Aid Society and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. Two more special pages could be introduced with the aid of the readers: a Women's Page and a Farmer's Page. A Women's Page would be especially helpful in arousing the interest of Russian women in public life and in our local problems. But these innovations can be achieved only with the aid of Russian organizations and private individuals who want to help. After giving these questions serious thought, let each of us do his or her part toward our common welfare.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1635.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In what way can we help our newspaper, Rassviet? We can secure new subscribers; we can help spread its circulation and popularity among our people; we can solicit advertisements and bring printing orders to Rassviet. The success of Rassviet depends on our full co-operation. If we only go to work with a will and determination, we will succeed. We can make it possible for Rassviet to increase its size to six pages, from its present size of four pages.</p>
   <p>The Russian groups in the United States and in Canada are strong in numbers, sturdy in moral fibre, and rich intellectually. We can build on these characteristics of our people. Every human being needs food for his soul and his mind, just as he needs food for his body. The best food for the mind is the printed word. The Russian newspaper supplies mental and spiritual food for our group, and serves as the torch that brightens the road to progress and contentment for the Russian people living in America. Let us strive for knowledge and education, and thus assure a brighter future for our group in America.</p>
