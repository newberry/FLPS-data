   <p>A revolution took place in Russia, Tsar Nikolas, the Bloody, was thrown off the throne, and Russia breathed freely. But hardly had the old regime vanished, when a new one - the power of merchants and manufacturers - seated itself upon the necks of the people.</p>
   <p>The Duma, which has captured the power in Russia, does not express the will of the people - the Russian workers and peasants - but the will of the bourgeoisie (the capitalists).</p>
   <p>In its manifesto to the people, the provisional government promises mountains of 'freedom,' but not a word of the things which are most essential for the workers: the transfer of land into the hands of the peasants and of all shops and factories into the hands of the workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0504.jpg" n="2"/>
