   <p>At the present time large and small European countries are spending huge sums of money for armaments. They all care very little about improving economic conditions and throw all their resources into the bottomless pit of militarism. As a result, at present only the war industries are thriving, and all others are languishing in a pitiful state. The most astonishing thing is that in this latest competitive rearmament contest small countries together with the large ones are beginning to play a rather prominent role, although they fully realize that in case of the outbreak of a new war they will be quickly crushed by the large nations. Only recently, for instance, the Warsaw correspondent of the Chicago Tribune told us that Poland had decided during the present year to increase its military defenses in order not to be crushed in case of a war between Germany and Russia. For this purpose huge sums of money <pb facs="5423967_2_0634.jpg" n="2"/>will be required, and taxes, in consequence, will be raised still higher, despite the fact that the economic crisis continues to ravage the country with undiminished force. Only recently the Polish Economic Institute characterized the economic condition of the country in the following words:</p>
   <p>"One should keep in mind that the level of industrial production in Poland at the height of the crisis was extremely low. Consequently the rise in industrial activity as compared with the lowest point reached in the crisis is very small if expressed in absolute figures. Investments of capital which at the height of the crisis fell by two thirds at present have not reached forty-five per cent of investments in 1928. Industrial production, which in the last two years has increased twenty-five per cent, at present does not exceed two thirds of that attained before the crisis."</p>
   <p>The noted Polish economist, Professor Matushevsky, has made public some very interesting data which clearly demonstrate the unheard-of burden borne by the Polish state to keep its machinery functioning--a burden that <pb facs="5423967_2_0635.jpg" n="3"/>is becoming intolerable for the Polish national economy. According to his estimates government expenditures swallow more than a third of the national income at a time when the real value of that income has been reduced by one third. When the last pillow is being pulled out under the peasant's head, and the rural populace are driven to rioting all over the country, there is a basis for saying that taxes are becoming intolerably oppressive.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Professor Matushevsky subjects to very severe criticism the profligacy of the government bureaucracy, which saps the economic organism of the country and yet cannot balance the budget and avoid a deficit; as a result the national debt at this time has reached the huge total of a billion and a half zloty. Now in connection with the increased outlay for armaments the national economy of Poland will receive another severe blow, and the tax burden will become altogether intolerable for the population.</p>
   <p>Such a state of affairs exists, however, not in Poland alone. The same <pb facs="5423967_2_0636.jpg" n="4"/>condition is observed in many other European countries. It is no wonder, therefore, that Fascism, Bolshevism, and other socialistic movements are spreading like wildfire on the European continent.</p>
