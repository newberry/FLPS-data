   <p>P.44--In observing cultural centers, I visited The Chicago Art Theatre, directed by Mr. I. V. Lazarev, an artist of the Moscow Art Theatre.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to get hold of Mr. Lazarev at once...Everyone, as in an anthill, is busy.</p>
   <p>On the stage, new scenery is being prepared for a new theatrical production. Behind the side scenes, Miss Astroff (assistant of Mr. Lazarev) is rehearsing one of the forthcoming plays: "Cricket in the Hearth." In the hall, Miss George is correcting and explaining to actors their errors in diction and reading of their parts. In one of the rooms, Mr. I. V. Lazarev himself, through his assistant, is directing the rehearsal of the play, "Torch Bearers," (by the famous American dramatist A. Kelly) with which the Chicago Art Theatre will open its subscribers on January 6th. In the reception room, Mr. Mac Reneali, (president of the board of the Theatre) is explaining to some elderly gentleman, the idea and plans of the theatre. And interruptions come from everywhere.</p>
   <p>"What would you do, Mr. Lazarev, in this case?"</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1342.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And somehow, softly, calmly, and deeply engrossed, Mr. Lazarev successfully satisfied everyone who questioned him and in the mean time supervised all the work.</p>
   <p>After a long wait, we succeeded in drawing Mr. Lazarev away from everything, for a few minutes.</p>
   <p>"How do you do?"</p>
   <p>"Fine, very well!"</p>
   <p>"What kind of plans do you have?"</p>
   <p>"There is only one plan: to acquaint the Chicago people, and Americans in general, as much as possible with the method which has made the Moscow Art Theatre so famous."</p>
   <p>"How are you going to do this?"</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1343.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"First, we have already staged about a hundred plays at our and other theatres and in doing so we have organized a steady, complete company. Second, at the theatre we have daily courses (from 11 a. m. to 5 p. m.) for preparing future actors. Third, on account of the many letters and requests that we have received, we have been compelled to open an evening course (given twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9:30 in the evening) at a reasonable tuition fee. And now, from January the 2nd, because of matured necessity, we are opening a school and theatre for children, giving instruction once or twice a week from 10 a. m. to 12 noon, with plans to place the pupils in several children's plays, using our method, since it is very easily accepted by children. Registration has already begun. We came to the conclusion that, from time to time, we will offer lectures, conduct and manage forums with different groups interested in theatre, playwriting, and creative work in general. Next summer, as we did last year, we intend to organize a month's course (from the 11th of July to the 11th of August) for teachers and instructors of theatrical art. Already one of the universities in Chicago has invited me to introduce next summer the method of the Moscow Art Theatre to students, directing their studies in the theatrical art, in a six weeks' course."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1344.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Is there enough time for it?" I asked, being somewhat astonished.</p>
   <p>"It is a pity that we do not have forty-eight hours in one day; we could accomplish more."</p>
   <p>The bell sounded, Mr. Lazarev was being called for a rehearsal. He apologized. We bade farewell and departed.</p>
   <p>After leaving there, we still felt the impression of the intense work done in this institution. We were reminded of the words of a great judger of life: "What is the theatre really?...Work, work, and work!"</p>
   <p>Quite right, it is work, and not presumption of inspiration and talent as it is very often assumed by professional actors and particularly by amateurs.</p>
   <p>We do advise one to see how they work in this theatre. (410 South Michigan Avenue, Fine Arts Building.)</p>
   <p>It is useful and instructive.</p>
