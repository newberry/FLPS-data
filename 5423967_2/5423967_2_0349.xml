   <p>The more the bolsheviki in the name of the Soviet Commissars show their faces, the more it becomes evident and more clearly comes to light their complexion, a complexion of people without principles, lying people, people that change not only the revolution and the fatherland, but also their own words and their promises.</p>
   <p>The bolsheviki presented themselves as real defenders of political liberty. Sometime ago they blamed the Kerensky Government, because it did once stop the publishing of Pravda.</p>
   <p>Now, political liberty is void. There is no freedom of expression. The meetings and other gatherings are scattered, the press (printing) is suffocated. By whom? By the bolsheviki.</p>
   <p>The liars immersed themselves in falsehood, committed a disgrace with their weapons; they stand knee-deep in their brothers' blood that was shed by their own faults; they made an uproar in the cities; they desolated liberty, they gave away to Germany the fatherland; these owners of Smolny have made an alliance not with the cadets, but with the monarchists, with the two faced ones, and the convicted <pb facs="5423967_2_0350.jpg" n="2"/>provocateurs, people who almost all of them are convicted rascals and sharpers; these people naturally cannot refrain from making changes in everything, and in this way even their word. This is a substantial order, nothing alarming. But it is a terrifying and painful feeling for those, who up to this time have not been enlightened upon the matter and do not see what kind of characters these honorable, national commissars and their assistants possess. It is a horrible feeling for the betrayed native land and ruined freedom. It is a terrifying sensation at the end for the condition of the peasant of the Russian land; the land that needs the last anchor of safety for poor, betrayed and robbed Russia.</p>
