   <p>"This Association is a progressive, non-partisan organization and as such its major objective is to unite all Russians in the United States and <pb facs="5423967_2_1019.jpg" n="2"/>to serve their economic, cultural, educational and social needs without regard to their religious or political beliefs or affiliations. The motto of this association is "Unity, Fraternity, Economic Welfare, Enlightenment and Progress."</p>
   <p>"To accomplish its purpose, the association has prepared an elaborate program of activities. It plans to sponsor a Russian radio program which will be known as "Voice of the Native Land," introducing commercial advertisements , topics of the daily events and announcements of particular interest to the Russian colony.

It will engage in survey and research in various and diversified fields for the benefit of its members. It will maintain a free information bureau for its members, a social service to needy unemployed Russians and other similar humanitarian services which an organization of this kind may lawfully render to its members and to others of Russian descent for the purpose of their protection and welfare. The association aims to create for its members an environment for congenial social contact, for exchange of their <pb facs="5423967_2_1020.jpg" n="3"/>ideas and discussion of problems of mutual interest and, to attain this end, it will maintain a permanent headquarters with elaborately furnished club rooms, with various forms of cultural entertainment.</p>
   <p>"Never in the history of the Russian colony in America has there been greater need of such an organization than today. This association offers to its members the most advanced and beneficial services ever offered by any Russian organization in this country. The variety of services outlined in the plans now being prepared by this association is indispensable to every broad-minded and progressive Russian, and particularly those engaged in business or professions. Through plans for efficient services this association is fully prepared to assist in solving perplexing problems that may from time to time confront its members.</p>
   <p>"All those who desire to join the association are cordially invited to address all communications to the office of the secretary, Zachary E. Lossieff, 127 N. Dearborn St., Room 1622, Chicago, Ill. Tel. Dearborn 2856 (after business hours, Midway 4341).</p>
