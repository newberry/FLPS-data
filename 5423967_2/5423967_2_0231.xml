   <p>Of late, Bolshevik activities have reached a point of limit. 'Comrades' from the Bolshevik camps have lost their human aspect, their sense of shame, and have become as primitive savages. They spill their venom of hatred on all Russian organizations, in their pogrom-provoking machinations--on all those who are unwilling to swallow the bait put out by the Shkliars, the Deviatkins, the Mornels and their ilk. They have organized a band of real rowdies for breaking-up meetings, lectures and debates arranged by the Russian organizations. This band of hooligans consists of the lowest and the most ignorant type of people. They have committed many acts of trickery in the Russian colony, which were described by the newspaper Rassviet more than once.</p>
   <p>Against this activity of hooliganism a protest has already been made by the 23rd branch of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America, which called upon all Russian organizations to organize in self-defense against this clique of pogrom-makers.</p>
   <p>It seems, however, that no attention was given to this appeal.</p>
   <p>Perhaps, many are of the opinion, that there is no need to trouble with this <pb facs="5423967_2_0232.jpg" n="2"/>base and deplorable people. It is true that unpleasant scandal should be avoided, but it cannot be helped if getting into it is unavoidable. In my opinion, a stop must be put to this Bolshevik hooliganism, once and for all. It places a stain on the good name of the entire Russian colony. How is it at all possible for a cultured man to look with equanimity on acts of savagery which are perpetrated by these half-wits at our lectures and debates?</p>
   <p>Can a sensible man interrupt a lecturer or a speaker, by grabbing a chair and throwing it at the speaker? Whoever thinks of such acts as a disgrace to those who perform them is sadly in error. For such people as these, no shame can have any meaning, for they are not more than savages.</p>
   <p>Every Russian man has to bear the stigma for this, in the eyes of the civilized world.</p>
   <p>What would be the opinion of a visiting foreigner if he should be a witness to such scenes? Would he not think the Russian people as still uncivilized?</p>
   <p>Among people of other nationalities such scenes are not tolerated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0233.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Furthermore, can any Russian organization carry on its cultural and educational work, under such circumstances?</p>
   <p>If we do not put an end to this state of affairs, no speaker or lecturer will wish to lecture to Russian audiences. If we do not wish our cultural work to suffer and stagnate, we must take prompt measures to prevent this outrageous behavior on the part of the Bolsheviks. We must not act for the purpose of attacking them, but for the sake of self-preservation, for the defense of our own organizations and our great Russian culture, so that others may not have the impression that the Russians are still uncivilized.</p>
   <p>I propose that all organizations take up this question and adopt definite decisions, at their next meetings.</p>
