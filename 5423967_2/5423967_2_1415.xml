   <p>The Rassviet makes an emotional and single-minded appeal that all Russian factions unite and contribute to the utmost, in a united spirit, for an all eclipsing celebration of the centenary Jubilee of Aleksandr Sergyeevich Pushkin.</p>
   <p>A united Committee of organizations, brotherhoods, sisterhoods of Chicago and suburbs, such as East Chicago, Pullman, Melrose Park, Gary, etc., are feverishly working out literary and musical programs as an expression of pride and glory in their compatriot. "The grand celebration of the centenary of the day of the tragic death of our greatest poetical genius, the creator of the artistic Ianguage and parent of Russian literature, Aleksandr Sergyeevich Pushkin." The celebration will take place on February 14, 1937 at 1042 N. Damen Avenue, Liberty Sons Hall.</p>
   <p>As one of its chief objects this celebration, it is pointed out, will aim to familiarize the masses, who though Russian, yet are ignorant of the great works of their own literary Titan, A. S. Pushkin. For this purpose competent lecturers will read essays, and good music will in its own manner imbue the celebrators with the great spirit of the immortal poet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is further brought out how a certain type of the poet's compatriots will expostulate that ignorance of his undying works in justifiable since, "who is Pushkin anyhow? He was not a revolutionist! Not a Bolshevik! And what did he do for the Russian people?" Their arguments, and the interminable discussions in their train, it is pointed out in the Rassviet article, will be adequately brought to a focus for crystalization.</p>
   <p>All factions are urged to unite and collaborate on this solemn occasion--"not so much because he is ours, but because he is immortal. One hundred years has gone by since his demise and he is not forgotten, nor will he be in a thousand years, for Pushkin are born but seldom. At least none such come in this century."----"The theme is inexhaustible."</p>
   <p>The various Russian groups are admonished to secure tickets, buttons, postcard portraits of the Great Poet in good time, and are reminded that already even non-Russians are wearing these buttons in their button-holes, how much more so does it behoove Russians to whom "A. S. Pushkin is our national glory".</p>
