   <p>All spheres of Russian Society will celebrate the centenary of the birth of L. Tolstoy: atheists and religious people; people of all political movements, such as anarchists and bolsheviks, socialists and monarchists, white guards and red; aristocrats, peasants and workers; practically all the Russian people in Russia and outside her limits; the cultured people all over the world, who bow before the genius of L. Tolstoy and respect him, as a great artist of the word, thinker and teacher. Tolstoy never stopped in his thinking halfway, but always went on to the end. No matter how terrifying the truth was, which was whispered to him by his mind and conscience, he always had the courage to face the truth himself and to tell it to other people. Tolstoy, when studying the social problems, especially when investigating the causes of poverty and wealth, reaches to the very root of the evil. Immediately he makes a decision, which astounds and stirs up against him the people of his circle, calls out the discontent of his relatives and finally leads Tolstoy to the rejection of his previous way of living, to the breaking with his aristocratic past, to simplifying his life, and to the recognition of the truth in the simple laborious peasant life. Tolstoy threatened the landowners with a terrible judgment<pb facs="5423967_2_1445.jpg" n="2"/>, while they still lived on earth, a bloody judgment and revolution. Would it not be better to give the land to the peasants voluntarily and to share in a Christian and brotherly manner with the poor, as fortytwo years back Tolstoy had foreseen it, than to lose the whole wealth and to be subjected to the horrors of the revolution? And having lost their wealth and having become poor, the Russian landowners will understand the meaning of Tolstoy's advice to renounce their estates in favor of the peasants. Even that one fact, that the bolsheviks are honoring Tolstoy, the foe of their ideas, who denied power, and government, and violence, shows that the moral authority and influence of Tolstoy's ideas in Russia are so great among the people, that the Soviet government could not ignore them. Tolstoy foresaw that the revolution in Russia would get into a blind alley. In his remarkable pamphlet, "The Meaning of the Russian Revolution," Tolstoy grieved that the Russian revolution was following the wrong, the West-European path of political changes. He warned of the impending disaster, and the uselessness of revolutionary political changes.</p>
