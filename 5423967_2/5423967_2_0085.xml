   <p>A correspondent of Krestcross writes that the purging process in the Communist party, which began after Kirou's assassination, still continues, as it has been found that the party contains many members of the opposition group. Thus, in Leningrad, for instance, many former agents of the secret police were arrested. They are all charged with neglect of official duties. Besides, Yagoda [the chief of the Gay-Pay-Oo, or secret police] ordered the purging of the entire staff of secret agents of the Leningrad Bureau. As a result thirteen agents are under arrest.</p>
   <p>At present, in many local organizations, the purge is being carried out for the second time. This is confirmed by the fact that eighteen former chiefs of political bureaus of the motor-tractor stations have been purged, although during the first purge they were found to be reliable party members. Not only is the purge being made in the party branches, but it is also carried on in Soviet administrative and educational institutions. According to the report printed <pb facs="5423967_2_0086.jpg" n="2"/>in the Socialist Herald all persons are now being discharged who belonged to any opposition group, whatever, in the past.</p>
   <p>At the same time Stalin begins to make certain "concessions" to the Russian People. This first "concession" is the introduction of secret balloting; certain "concessions" were also allowed to the collective farmers. But all these "concessions" are made only for the purpose of enlisting the good will of workers and peasants, and of eliminating the danger of their opposition in case of war. The people, of course, know that these "concessions" do not change the situation in any essential way. In the industrial centers strikes frequently take place. The causes of the conflicts are always the same: interruptions and irregularities in food supply; nonpayment of wages or low wages, insufficient to buy commodities which are forever rising in prices.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pronin, a party member, who went to Stalingrad to appear at workers' meetings, tells just how the Soviet young people view conditions and how they react. He related that during such meetings the lights were frequently turned <pb facs="5423967_2_0087.jpg" n="3"/>off and the officials on the stage, sponsors of the meetings, were the targets for dirty rags and other objects. The speakers were frequently met by hisses and catcalls. Shouts and insulting remarks from the audience often offended both the party and its responsible officials. Often, when the lights are turned off or in some dark place, party organizers are assaulted and beaten. In some places anti-Bolshevik propaganda is spread among the audience by means of hand bills.</p>
   <p>Many party organizers sent to other towns request their return home. They point out that their activity does not meet the approval of the workers whom they approach. All through their sojourn they find that they are under a continual boycott, and that their lives are endangered daily by possible assaults, beatings and even murder.</p>
   <p>Stalin, of course, knows that the greater danger comes not from Communist members who are in opposition, but from the hungry population deprived of all rights. These facts explain in part why Stalin finds it necessary to make certain "concessions" to the people.</p>
