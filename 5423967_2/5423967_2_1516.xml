<title level="a">AT THE ORGANIZING MEETING OF THE SOCIETY OF RUSSIAN PHYSICIANS IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The first organizing meeting of Russian physicians took place on July 18, 1924, at Mr. Muraskev's laboratory, 32 North State Street. Towards 10 o'clock one could see that the meeting would be a lively one: twenty-six persons were present, and this should be called a large attendance, if you consider that at the meeting of the Chicago Medical Society, which has more than 4,000 members, usually there are no more than 150 or 200 persons present.</p>
   <p>The first item of the order of business was the report of the Organizing Committee, and the chairman, being one of the members of this committee, made an introductory speech. In the opinion of the chairman, Dr. M. Sahud, an organization of Russian physicians in our city is most necessary, both for those who would be its members, and for the whole Russian colony. There are many considerations of a scientific and an economic character that speak <pb facs="5423967_2_1517.jpg" n="2"/>in favor of such an organization... The chairman discussed the necessity of this organization also from the standpoint of mutual aid; it is necessary to unify the old Russian educated residents of Chicago with the newcomers in order to further the common good and prosperity of the Chicago Russian intellectuals. The chairman concluded his excellent speech with the following words: "We have proved to the Americans the greatness of Russian art by introducing to them the artists of the Moscow Art Theater; we shall prove to them also how high stands the grand banner of Russian scientific achievement"....</p>
   <p>In the same trend spoke also the other members of the Organizing Committee; according to Dr. N.V. Popov, this organization will have chiefly to consider carefully scientific problems and the status of medical science in America as well as abroad and in our own native country. Dr. A. I. Nedzelnitsky also came, to the conclusion, putting it briefly, that at the present moment the most important thing that has to be done is to get organized, <pb facs="5423967_2_1518.jpg" n="3"/>and that after that we should act according to the demands which life will put before us. Dr. Krasnow pointed out the fact that besides the American medical organizations there exist and thrive in Chicago also similar organizations created by other nationalities, such as the Polish Medical Society, also a German, an Italian, a Scandinavian, a Bohemian one, etc. In Dr. Krasnow's opinion there should be room especially for a Russian organization of a similar character. We are more segregated than other nationalities and are living under less favorable conditions... Charlatanism among the medical profession is firmly rooted owing to the extensive activities of persons who profess to know all about everything, but in reality are frauds, fake doctors. All this the new organization will have to fight..</p>
   <p>There followed a debate in which the doctors G.V. Hassin, Piet, Berkman, Broyde, Tsepenuke, Herzfeld, Khilkevich, and others participated. On the whole they all expressed the opinion that an organization among the Russian <pb facs="5423967_2_1519.jpg" n="4"/>physicians should be started and that it should undertake some activities right away. The question as to the name to be chosen for the new organization was raised; a more elaborate statement as to the purposes of the Society and the election of a board of directors had to be discussed. In connection with this Dr. A.Y. Feinstein made the following proposition: the organizing committee already in existence, consisting of the doctors, Nedzelnitsky, popov, Sahud, Spivak, Treigher and Krasnow (secretary pro-tem.) should work out a constitution defining the aims and objects of the society and present this project to the next session of the General Assembly, to be accepted or rejected by it. This proposition was accepted unanimously. It was also decided to publish the preliminary project of the Constitution and Laws of the society in the Russian Herald in order that those interested could become acquainted with it.</p>
   <p>Thus has been laid the foundation of a new organization, very important because of its purposes....</p>
