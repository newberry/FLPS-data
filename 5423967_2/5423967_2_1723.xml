   <p>He who works and earns his daily bread with his toil, such a one is with us, - and we are with him.</p>
   <p>He who seeks the truth and regards service to our native country and to its toiling masses as his supreme duty, such a one is with us, -and we are with him.</p>
   <p>The good and the welfare of the Russian colony; its unification, not its splitting up; peace and justice, not quarrels and enmity - these are the objectives of the newspaper Russkii Viestnik and our objectives, i. e., the purposes of the editorial staff which is directing the paper.</p>
   <p>Let everybody who calls himself or ever did call himself a Russian, <pb facs="5423967_2_1724.jpg" n="2"/>who is suffering from want and is heavy laden, - let him or her know that the Russkii Viestnik is a friend, a helper and an honest adviser.</p>
   <p>Russian organizations of any kind, provided they lead the Russian colony towards light, truth and unity and not towards enmity, will all get support from our paper and a place of honor on its pages.</p>
   <p>We do not ask anybody what his creed is, nor do we inquire about his political views.</p>
   <p>The truth is one, but there are many paths leading towards it. There are wrong paths and there are right paths. And if you believe that your path is the right one and leads towards the truth, point out that path without any anger, prejudice and abuse towards one who is following a wrong path. And if such a man will be convinced by your <pb facs="5423967_2_1725.jpg" n="3"/>words and will see that you are right, he will go with you. But if it would happen that not only will he not be convinced, but will, on the contrary, convince you that your path is wrong, - well, then follow him.</p>
   <p>By dissension and enmity you cannot achieve anything; by peace and solidarity everything can be achieved.</p>
   <p>Whatever our Russian schools may be, if they teach our colony what is good and if they enlighten it, we stand for them. It does not matter to us which party or organization supports a school; what matters is that the school should teach the people what is good and useful. There will be no room on the pages of Russkii Viestnik for spiteful and unfair criticism of anybody. If something is bad <pb facs="5423967_2_1726.jpg" n="4"/>we shall just say that it is bad; if something is good we shall say so.</p>
   <p>Russkii Viestnik is serving the truth, the light; it is serving the Russian colony, a colony of toilers. Therefore this paper is entirely non-partisan, for there is some truth in the teachings of every party except the party of parasites who aim to live on other people's work; and in the Russian colony there are representatives of almost all parties.</p>
   <p>All that which would be harmful to the Russian workmen's colony will be denounced by our paper, from whatever source the harm may come; all that is useful to the colony will have our paper's support and approval.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1727.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Russkii Viestnik shall be a faithful servant and guardian of the interests of the whole Russian colony. This paper, however, is not a servant of those who dream about living at the expense of other people, about the tsar (the "Little Father"), and about other nightmares of the past.</p>
   <p>Russkii Viestnik is the center of the colony; it reflects its life with all its sorrows and joys; it is the organ of our toilers' colony.</p>
   <p>But in order that our paper be such an organ not only in name but in reality, we the editorial staff beg the colony to help us.</p>
   <p>Be with us, unite around us; never forget that Russkii Viestnik first of all is your own paper. Write to us about everything concerning the colony, do not be shy because your epistle may not be written in a smooth style or may not "fit exactly our views." Just write; everything good will be accepted and will find a place in our paper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1728.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Be collaborators and friends of your paper; impart your thoughts to others through its medium and in turn get information from them. Everything will find a place in the Russian Herald (Russkii Viestnik), except enmity, dissension and the repudiation of one part of the colony by another. We are your friends, so be also our friends and friends of your newspaper.</p>
   <p>A. Skopin.</p>
