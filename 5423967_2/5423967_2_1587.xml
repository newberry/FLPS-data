   <p>There are three men on the editorial staff of Rassviet. You read their stories and political articles every day in Rassviet. One of them is a man of average height, and of rather delicate frame. He has a dark complexion and handsome, somewhat oriental features, with deep, penetrating eyes which reflect the intense spiritual nature of their owner. He seldom speaks, and is always busy writing. When he speaks he always says something interesting. (E. Moravsky-Dolinin, editor in chief [transcriber]).</p>
   <p>The second man is rather short and of husky build, with ruddy face and bright eyes. He, too, is eternally silent; he pounds away at his typewriter. He knows his business well. (M. Rubiezhanin-Kayduk, associate editor [transcriber]).</p>
   <p>The third man is tall, interesting, and a bachelor. He knows how to interest visitors, and how to manage them. One can talk with him and even exchange <pb facs="5423967_2_1588.jpg" n="2"/>compliments. He is not so taciturn as the two mentioned previously. (N. Novin, associate editor and secretary of the Rassviet Publishing Company [transcriber]).</p>
   <p>We shall now glance at the composing room where linotypers, composers, and printers toil, unknown to the outside world. Mr. Romanovitch and Mr. Komov, the linotypers, and Mr. M. Striapko, the printer and make-up man, are busy all day at their respective jobs, and have no time for conversation. They all merit the praise and respect of Rassviet's readers for their technical skill and their loyalty to the publication.</p>
   <p>There is one more man connected with Rassviet who must not be forgotten. He is Mr. Senkevitch, the deliveryman, on whom rests the responsibility of prompt distribution of each issue of Rassviet; for you must get your copy as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>To all these men who are responsible for the success and the smooth functioning of Raasviet, I convey my sincere greetings and congratulations on this day of the tenth anniversary of Rassviet.</p>
