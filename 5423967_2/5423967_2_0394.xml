   <p>The author says that as a storm at sea brings to light the mud, so the revolution in Russia brought up the slime and dirt. This was true in Chicago. The arrival of the Russian mission in that city brought all the hidden dirt to the surface.</p>
   <p>It began with the local "progressive" Russian newspaper. Upon the extraordinary occasion of the Mission's arrival an extra number (selling for three cents) was published, containing outrageous declarations.</p>
   <p>The contents? In addition to such criminal statements, portraits of <pb facs="5423967_2_0395.jpg" n="2"/>members of the mission, a portrait of Kerensky and under it, "Pray for Kerensky," and an explanation of why prayers were needed. On the first page there was a fictitious list of organizations joining in the greeting. In this list was the Lithuanian Section of the Socialist Party No. 138, and the City Central Committee of the Socialist Party. These bodies took no part in the greeting. The City Central Committee not only did not take part, but decided to ask all Socialists to refrain from participation in any committees organizing the welcome. Further in the paper there were printed a number of eulogies of the Mission and the Provisional government.</p>
   <p>The ignorance of the church paper of the Independents was characteristic. They inserted several welcoming paragraphs.</p>
   <p>Now about the Russian meeting. The initiators of the meeting did their best to attract the revolutionary organizations but failed. They lined up only the "bund" (Ed. Note: Jewish Social Democratic Organization in <pb facs="5423967_2_0396.jpg" n="3"/>Russia) and the groups of the Organizational Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party, whose sole activity had been agreeing to send delegates to various conferences. The Jewish section of the Socialist Party agreed to take part in the reception only if the other sections of the party took part. The organizers held a meeting "in the name of the revolutionary and progressive organizations," not mentioning the churches and reactionary organizations which also took part.</p>
   <p>The meeting took place on Saturday, August 4, 1917, in the Auditorium Theatre. The theatre was decorated with red cloth and revolutionary placards. There was a large American flag, the Russian national tricolor and red flags. There were many police present. The president was Comrade Berg.</p>
   <p>"In the name of the revolutionary and progressive organizations" he <pb facs="5423967_2_0397.jpg" n="4"/>greeted the Russian Mission and spoke about freedom, ideals and exile. Then he proposed a standing tribute to the fighters for liberty. All stood. The orchestra played the funeral march and the Bund's revolutionary song. The whole auditorium laughed boisterously. The president again spoke of the revolution, freedom, etc. He accidentally mentioned "peace" and the auditorium resounded with cries of "Hurrah for peace" and loud applause.</p>
   <p>In the name of the group of the Organizational Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party Comrade Khinoy greeted the Russian mission and asked them to convey comradely greetings to the Temporary Government and the Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies. He tried to assure the (Russian) bourgeoisie that they need not seek foreign markets, and then stated that Russia needed peace. For this reason the democracy supports the Temporary government in its efforts to secure peace. Again arose the cry, "Hurrah for peace."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0398.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Comrade Mills spoke for the Bund. He said that the Bund had always, even during the time of pogroms, believed in the victory of socialism. The Bund believed that "the liberation of the Russian people will be the liberation of the Jewish nation" and that democratic Russia would be "our Palestine." Again the orchestra played the Bund song when he had finished.</p>
   <p>"A slight misunderstanding" arose when the representative of the Lithuanian Workers' Soviet, Mr. Jurgelionis, spoke. All speeches had been censored. Mr. Jurgelionis had submitted his speech also. But he spoke about things not in his prepared manuscript. He greeted the Mission on behalf of the Lithuanian proletariat. When he said that the Lithuanian proletariat would continue to fight the Roman-Catholic priests and landowners, the president pointed out that there were several <pb facs="5423967_2_0399.jpg" n="6"/>priests present. A denunciation of the exploiters of the proletariat in other countries led to an attempt by the president to hush him, but without success. The speaker said that the key to peace was in the hands of Russia. (Great applause.) Then Erin and Orlovsky, representatives of the non-partisan organizations, spoke. There was some misunderstanding regarding Orlovsky's remarks.</p>
   <p>Bakhemetiev greeted the meeting in the name of Russia. He avoided mention of recent events in Russia. (Ed. note: Probably the July Days of 1917.) Professor Lomonosov, of the Mission, likewise avoided this subject.</p>
   <p>There were distributed at the meeting handbills, About War and Peace and Izvestiya of the Conference of Russian Socialist Organizations for Aid to the Russian Revolution.</p>
   <p>M. Skromnyi.</p>
