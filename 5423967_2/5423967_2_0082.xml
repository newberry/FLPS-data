   <p>In the Bible it is said: "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof." Whether God brought his creatures before Adam and whether Adam named each one of them we do not known, but we know that commissars are named after their kind and that only cruel men are elevated to this position.</p>
   <p>Into the "bedbug breeder" on Division Street [Translator's note: The reference is made to the Communist club) enters one of the very severe colonists. Because of his cruel character he has been nicknamed "commissar." This "commissar" inhumanly treats his own wife, who just recently arrived in this country. Prior to his wife's arrival the "commissar" had worked a little; <pb facs="5423967_2_0083.jpg" n="2"/>but since her coming he has stopped working altogether. He spends all of his time playing checkers at the "bedbug breeder." The "commissar's" wife could not endure the privations and hardships incident to the wars and revolution in Russia; but when she came to Chicago her husband, instead of letting her rest, handed her a mop and a brush and sent her out to scrub floors in rich people's homes. The neighbors say that not even among the African tribes can there be found anyone who exploits his wife quite as cruelly as this "commissar".</p>
   <p>On coming home after a hard day's work the woman cooks his meals, washes clothes, and makes beds (the "commissar" keeps lodgers). The "commissar" himself either lies in bed or plays checkers; he does not want to help his wife and considers that it is all a woman's work.</p>
   <p>In the morning the "commissar" gets out of bed, washes himself, orders his wife to give him a clean shirt, and then after circling the table twice and smelling the food says: "You, peasant woman, can not even prepare <pb facs="5423967_2_0084.jpg" n="3"/>breakfast properly." After gorging himself with food like a pig, he goes to the "bedbug breeder" to play checkers; his wife, meanwhile bathes herself copiously with bitter tears, picks up her tools and goes to scrub floors for rich people so that her husband-parasite, nicknamed "commissar," may eat tomorrow.</p>
