   <p>Rassviet has written many times about the hooligan exploits of the Bolsheviks in this country. Despite this, many Russians in America still believe them to be the real revolutionists, the defenders of the working people, and irreconcilable enemies of the capitalist class. But they are gravely mistaken. They think so, because they are unable properly to appraise political questions, and cannot distinguish between a true revolutionist and a common hooligan, or between a revolution and a pogrom.</p>
   <p>Every sensible and impartial man, after examining more closely the Bolshevik activities, will agree that the Bolsheviks, the Communists, are not revolutionists but political hooligans--and not friends but enemies of the working class.</p>
   <p>There has been no instance in the United States in which Communists have come <pb facs="5423967_2_0204.jpg" n="2"/>to grips with the capitalists or with other enemies of the working class. Quite the contrary. The Bolsheviks organize their attacks not on capitalists but upon workers. Their "revolutionary" activity consists of assaults upon workers who do not think as they do. And there is nothing strange about this. For the Bolsheviks are unable to prove anything by words, so they resort to physical force.</p>
   <p>Not a long time ago these "revolutionists" organized an attack on the Ukrainians in New York, and last Sunday they attacked the Ukrainians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Ukrainians organized a demonstration in protest against the dictatorship of hunger and terror in the Soviet Ukraine. More than three thousand people took part in the demonstration--not capitalists or rich land owners, but workers and their wives and children. The demonstration was not to the taste of the local Bolsheviks, and they decided to show the Ukrainians their "revolutionary spirit."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0205.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As was to be expected, the attack was made from "around the corner," on Madison Street. The Communists, numbering about two hundred men, had taken their position beforehand on the platform of the Madison Street elevated railroad station, and, when the columns of the demonstrators passed underneath, a sudden hail of rocks, bricks and pieces of iron began to fall upon their heads. At the same time, another onslaught was made upon the flank of the passing columns.</p>
   <p>But the parading Ukrainians did not lose their heads. They swiftly reorganized their ranks and launched a counter-attack. The attackers were repulsed and given a good whipping. It is plain that those who came out to attack and were beaten back were but common, ignorant, rank-and-file members of the Communist party, carrying out the orders of their leaders, who stayed at home.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainians have given a good lesson to the Bolshevik hooligans, who evidently imagine they are in the U. S. S. R., and not in the United States, where there is freedom of speech, of press, and of assembly. The Bolsheviks <pb facs="5423967_2_0206.jpg" n="4"/>received what they deserved. Perhaps now they will understand that an attack upon workers, their wives and their children is a disgraceful and criminal act.</p>
   <p>Not many Ukrainians suffered bruises in the melee. They repulsed the attack quite easily, thanks to their overwhelming number. But readers can imagine how many victims there would have been among innocent people if the Communist hooligans had been superior in number.</p>
