   <p>On Sunday, February 10, of the current year, in the elegant small hall of the Y. M. C. A. , was celebrated the centennary of the death of the great Russian writer Alexander Sergheyevich Griboyedov.</p>
   <p>A carefully written paper on Griboyedov and on his literary work was read by Mr. E. Z. Moravsky.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. I. Baycher read brilliantly Chatsky's monologue from "Gorye ot Ooma" (Sorrow From Much Cleverness).</p>
   <p>As an encore Mr. Baycher recited Merezhkovsky's charming poem "Sakya Muni".</p>
   <p>Miss S. P. Alexeyev recited very well, as usually, "Rossiya" (Russia) by Block, and "Dary Tereka" (The Gifts of the Terek) by Lermontov.</p>

   <p>Miss Nina Besedov, a violinist well known in the Russian colony, played with great spirit. One of the best Chicago pianists, Mr. Clifton Met, invited by the Russian Center, accompanied Miss Besedov on the piano.</p>
   <p>The program was closed by a solo on the piano played by young Miss Evghenia Murey (daughter of Mr. V. Murey, a well known member of the Russian colony,) In spite of her youthfulness Miss Murey played brilliantly several difficult pieces.</p>
   <p>The president of the Russian Center thanked the audience for the flattering attention it had paid to the cultural endeavors of the organization and to the memory of the best men of Russia.</p>
