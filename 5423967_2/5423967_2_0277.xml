   <p>In an article, bearing this title and devoted to a discussion of Mussolini's legislation regulating the organization and activities of Italian trade unions, the author (writing under the pseudonym of Yeghipetskiy) mentions the creation of a ministry of labor and the substitution of so called national associations for the former free labor unions. These associations will consist both of workers and employers. It is pointed out that such a reform practically deprives the workmen of the right to strike, and that thus they will be at the mercy of the employers and the Fascist government.</p>
   <p>This state of things, created in Italy by the ultra patriotic Facist government must teach, the author says, an important lesson to those patriotically minded workmen who put national interests above anything else. They are easily intimidated by the argument of the facists that the activities of free labor organizations may endanger the national interests and thus such ultra patriotic workmen can be persuaded to act in a way contrary to the interests of their own class. They should understand that by thus sacrificing these interests <pb facs="5423967_2_0278.jpg" n="2"/>to the demands of so called patriots they may be helping the enslavement of the working class by the capitalists.</p>
