   <p>It surprises you when you read the papers just received from Russia; more than that, it irritates you and you are angered to the depths of your soul.</p>
   <p>Autocracy used to punish (people) for becoming partisans of any political party tending to overthrow its form of government. People suspected of belonging to any Socialist party were thrown into dungeons by hundreds and thousands or "sent to places not very far off."</p>
   <p>Needless to say that democracy as well as all Socialist parties protested against such laws and methods of struggle.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0352.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lenin and his fellow soldiers inherited the mannerism of autocracy, and in this spirit they follow their predecessors. Without any reason, without justification arrests were introduced by them from the first day.</p>
   <p>In Izviestya there is a statement of a new decree of the Bolsheviki about the arrest and sending over to the revolutionary marshal court of members of the cadet party as enemies of the nation. This law was introduced in all Soviets of the Republic.</p>
   <p>Tens of thousands of citizens are to be arrested and handed over to the court. For what? For being adherents of the National Liberty Party. Will the commissars have enough room in their prisons?</p>
   <p>To tell the truth autocracy had never reached to such despotism, even in the worst years of reaction.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0353.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is not likely that autocracy ever permitted itself such arbitrariness. It is difficult to go any further along this road of violence. Lenin and company, would you have enough prisons? Would it not be better to erect gallows for dealing with your enemies? Think of it.</p>
   <p>One cannot go further; we have approached the last limit of mercilessness and violence. The struggle for liberty against the new autocracy is inevitable. We invite all to it.</p>
   <p>Our attitude towards the autocracy of the Bolsheviki applies also to the monarchists who think of establishing the tsarist autocracy.</p>
