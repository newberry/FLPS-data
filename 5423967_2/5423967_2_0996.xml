<title level="a">BANQUET IN HONOR OF DR. KRASNOV</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>On the initiative of the active members of the Oasis Club, on April 19 in the Rogers Park Hotel a banquet was given to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the beginning of Dr. [H. R.] Krasnov's active public work, and the date coincided with the fifth anniversary of the foundation of the Club, which was organized by the man whose public services are recognized and honored by the entire Russian colony in Chicago. Toward seven o'clock the spacious banquet hall on Sheridan Road was filled with professional men and women and Dr. Krasnov's friends.</p>
   <p>After the banquet Dr. Chulok, president of the Club, stated that the banquet had been arranged to mark the fifth anniversary of the foundation of the Club and to honor Dr. G. Krasnov, who with his wife more than anybody else has contributed to the success of the Club by his constant efforts and <pb facs="5423967_2_0997.jpg" n="2"/>untiring labor. After recounting all that Dr. Krasnov has done for the Russian colony during his residence in Chicago Dr. Chulok told the guests that besides being the founder of several Russian civic and scientific organizations Dr. Krasnov in the course of his active career has prepared and delivered hundreds of lectures on medical and scientific subjects before Russian and English-speaking people.</p>
   <p>The Oasis Club was founded at the time when social and political controversies were at their height, and when the cleavage between the opposing schools of political philosophy was widest. In its five years of existence the Club has attracted into its membership the most prominent artists, literary man, and lecturers, and by the constant care of Dr. Krasnov the organization has grown and prospered. At present the Club commands the attention not only of the Russian but also of the English-speaking intellectuals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0998.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the field of artistic talent the Club on a number of occasions has been the host of such luminaries as F. I. Chaliapin, Mme. Bourskaya, Nikita Baliev and his troupe, the members of the Monte Carlo opera company, Eugene Leontovich, Mme. Tamara, noted stage and radio actress, S. Sarmatov, and many others. Prominent professors and lecturers have on many occasions imparted their ideas to the members of the Club. The Club received many telegrams from people who regretted that they were unable to attend the banquet and sent cordial congratulations to the organization and to Dr. Krasnov.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Dr. Krasnov and his wife expressed in the most cordial terms their thanks to the initiators of the banquet for their efforts and particularly for the fine sentiments expressed in the speeches by the guests who had paid them such an unexpected honor. The occasion was crowned by an excellent musical and vocal program, in which noted singers <pb facs="5423967_2_0999.jpg" n="4"/>and [other] musicians took part; both operatic music and folk songs were included. Upon this writer the evening left an indelible impression.</p>
