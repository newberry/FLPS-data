   <p>At the meeting of the correspondents of the newspaper Rassviet (The Dawn), many questions were resolved. Among them arose a question regarding the newspaper. A report was submitted by one member which read as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The Rassviet is the workers' newspaper of progressive organizations and is not a private newspaper which exists for the profit of an individual.</p>
   <p>2. The newspaper Rassviet is the only Russian daily newspaper in the United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>3. Rassviet is the only Russian [news] organ in Chicago and the vicinity.</p>
   <p>4. Rassviet is the newspaper of the [Russian] colony.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1660.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>5. Rassviet is a non-partisan newspaper and publishes its paper for all people who desire liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>6. The newspaper Rassviet is recognized by Roov, Russkoe Ob'edinennoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society), which numbers 4,000 members, and has its own page every Friday.</p>
   <p>7. The newspaper Rassviet is also recognized by Rnzov, Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), which has 2,000 members, and has its own page every Saturday.</p>
   <p>Considering all of these facts, the correspondents decided to support the newspaper by all possible means and to write in it three or four times a week, and if possible even oftener in the future.</p>
   <p>The correspondents decided to write about the Russian colony in Chicago and the vicinity; current events in the Russian colony; rumors in the colony; news of Chicago, topics of the day; the factories and mills in Chicago and the vicinity; <pb facs="5423967_2_1661.jpg" n="3"/>Russian organizations in Chicago and the vicinity; Russian schools; the relations between the "whites" and "reds", communists and monarchists--the imposters who take advantage of the Russian colony. The correspondents decided to resist the red hooligans if they dare again to attack the newspaper Rassviet or The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
