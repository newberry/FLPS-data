  <body>
   <p>Last week, the Russian-American Democratic League of the Twenty-fifth Ward held a meeting, attended by approximately sixty people. Russian citizens of the Douglas Park area apparently pay considerable attention to the activity of the Russian-American Democratic League because its business meetings are well attended. The last meeting was held under the chairmanship of Mr. Chopko, permanent president of the organization. Complete harmony prevails among the members attending the meetings. At the last meeting, members were chosen to work at the affair scheduled by the League for February 2.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that our women have readily agreed to help, and to cook all the food necessary for the occasion. The women in our ward organization are diligent and reliable workers. They also express their opinions freely, and take an active part in all affairs. Perhaps the continued existence of the ward organization depends wholly on the active co-operation of the women in the ward.</p>

   <p>Mr. Novin spoke at the meeting and urged all Russians to study English, because knowledge of the language will make them real American citizens. Many Russians, as Mr. Novin pointed out, feel themselves strangers in this country just because they do not know the language.</p>
