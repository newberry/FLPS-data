   <p>Here and there, in the Russian colony of America, monarchistic organizations are appearing. In New York they are already active quite openly. They are even publishing their own paper, the Just Cause. True, it is so far only a weekly paper, and a very meager one at that.</p>
   <p>In Gary, Ind., a monarchistic cell is already in existence, with Par-fenoff at the head of it. Nor are they asleep in Chicago; also here they already have a delegation from that union and, this accomplished, they will undoubtedly proceed with their work in due order.</p>
   <p>What should one say to all this? Attack? Criticize? What for? So much has already been said and written about it that one is bored to tears to add anything. Nor is it worth one's while to prove its futility. One is fed up saying this.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0310.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Yet it is necessary to say the following: Would it not be better if we -all of us - come down to earth from the clouds and begin to walk over the earth?</p>
   <p>Is it not true that it takes money and people for the planning of monarchistic or other alliances here in America, and would it not be better to apply these means to something much more sensible and necessary?</p>
   <p>Would it not be better to start a Russian school in Gary, where our boys and girls would learn to read and write Russian, rather than to foster a monarchistic cell there?</p>
   <p>The expense would be the same, but the benefits incomparably greater. Furthermore, to start a non-partisan school, so that instead of stuffing their heads with all sorts of incomprehensible bunk, the people would be taught to read and write.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0311.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And would it not be better, as comrade Bakalets suggested, to start a cooperative restaurant where we would get wholesome food without ruining our stomachs, without poisoning ourselves with tainted foods in lunch rooms? This, instead of spending money for the feeding of monarchistic emissaries.</p>
   <p>Let us get closer to life, and further away from high-brow stuff.</p>
   <p>We have neither the means nor the time for sponsoring costly tempests in a cup of water, which are devoid of beauty or joy.</p>
