   <p>As it was to be expected, the United States drew no benefit from the recognition accorded to the Soviet government. Billion-dollar orders for American goods, of which Mr. Litvinoff spoke, while seeking recognition from the Roosevelt administration, proved to be a crane (bird) in the sky. After the recognition the trade with the Bolsheviks, instead of marking an increase, slumped considerably, which can be seen from the statement made by the Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mr. Rosengoltz, and published in Pravda January 31.</p>
   <p>Rosengoltz reported that during the year 1930, the Soviet Union imported from the United States, American goods to the value of 264,000,000 gold roubles, and in 1931, 226,000,000. The total number of the Soviet orders placed with American firms amounted to 820,000,000 roubles, out of which 733,000,000 fell <pb facs="5423967_2_0836.jpg" n="2"/>during the years of the first five-year period. In respect to the Soviet purchases during the last two years, Rosengoltz declared that they did not exceed sixteen to seventeen million roubles per annum. "Lately," declared Mr. Rosengoltz, "despite the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, we encounter a number of obstacles, and some of them are entirely unexpected ones in the development of our trade relations. Among them we must mention the unfounded application of Johnson's Act by the United States, which forbids extension of loans or government credits to countries not paying debts to the United States government." Because of this restriction the Export-Import Bank, organized particularly for the development of trade with Russia, remains inactive.</p>
   <p>The almost complete disappearance of exports to Russia is not entirely unexpected, for all the talk about billion-dollar orders were put out only for the purpose of gaining recognition. During the prolonged negotiations between the two governments, it became evident that the Bolsheviks would agree to pay even a part of the debts only on condition that they were accorded loans and <pb facs="5423967_2_0837.jpg" n="3"/>long-term credits. In other words, they agreed to pay part of the old debts with a part of the money advanced by the American government, and with the balance of the money to purchase American goods. As a result the American government decided to discontinue the negotiations with the Soviet government and close the Export-Import Bank.</p>
   <p>Despite this, there are people among the Americans who still try to catch the Soviet crane in the sky. Thus, the Washington Daily News does not accuse the Bolsheviks, but the American government, for failure to reach an agreement. "The Government," writes this paper, "should have done everything to reach an agreement, so that American industrialists, the unemployed, and the farmers of the cotton belt might derive benefits from the Soviet billion-dollar orders. Nothing can justify the interruption in these important negotiations only five minutes after Troyanovsky's [Translator's note: Soviet ambassador to Washington, D. C.] arrival, when it was even declared that the negotiators had reached an agreement. Such action has no precedent in the annals of the Department of <pb facs="5423967_2_0838.jpg" n="4"/>State".</p>
   <p>All this is easily explained, however. The Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate, to which the paper belongs, had carried a whole campaign in favor of Soviet recognition, and spread the Bolshevik fables regarding the billion-dollar orders. Now, this Syndicate finds it difficult to explain the failure in the development of the Soviet trade and to confess its error. The other newspaper trust (Hearst Syndicate) had acted better. It admitted its mistake, and now conducts a violent campaign against Communism.</p>
