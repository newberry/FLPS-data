<title level="a">BOLSHEVIKS' ATTACK ON THE INDEPENDENTS IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>In the past our Chicago Bolsheviks have done a good deal of destructive work in the social life of the Russian colony. They have brought under their control the Federation of Children's Schools and paralyzed all its activity, converting it into a political organization. They have destroyed the Russian People's University, which was attended by more than two hundred students, sons of peasants and workers. They have captured the Russian Workers' Cooperative Society, an organization with considerable capital and a number of well-run commercial undertakings. In a word, all that has appeared good in the Russian colony has been immediately devoured by this flock of red, bloodthirsty crows.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks have not been able to create anything themselves during all this time; they have not founded a single organization, not one undertaking. All their work consists only in going around among the Russian organizations, causing dissension and spreading slander among the members. They go there not <pb facs="5423967_2_0239.jpg" n="2"/>with empty hands, but loaded with large quantities of mischievous literature, with leaflets, handbills, pamphlets, etc. At their disposal is also their weekly Novyi Mir (New World), in which they have their own department. As a rule, they fill their columns with various slanderous articles against the most active and honest members of Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>In their destructive activities the Bolsheviks resort to different methods. In order to destroy the confidence of the rank and file toward the administration, they write in their articles that the officers of the organization in question are in collusion with White Russians and are working on their instructions. They claim, falsely, that some of the members are White Russian officers and generals. They bestow the rank of colonel, etc., on workers and peasants who have, perhaps, never seen any military service. In a word, the Bolsheviks are apt to use any foul method in order to destroy this or that organization.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Bolsheviks have seized into their own hands much that was already <pb facs="5423967_2_0240.jpg" n="3"/>in existence, created by efforts of honest workers. They are strangling everything.</p>
   <p>There are now no now victims in sight, and the Bolsheviks are on the road to bankruptcy. Realizing this, they have gathered their forces and, arming themselves to the teeth, have started attacks on the Independent Society (Rnzov), for they know that the Society has a fat bank roll and great deal of property. In a word, here is something to prey upon.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks act energetically and in accord. In large groups they go to the meetings of the Independents. They go to the church of St. George Parish, which is maintained by the Independent Society. They go to the Society's conventions, and carry on there their propaganda for unification with the Pittsburgh society Rnov (Russian Peoples Mutual Aid Society), which they captured several years ago. They write appeals to the Independents under their own names or pseudonyms, as if those appeals were made by groups of members of the Society. They accuse old and active members of the Independent Society of maintaining relations with White Russians, and ascribe to them all kinds of <pb facs="5423967_2_0241.jpg" n="4"/>titles. They go to the branches and carry on mischievous propaganda against the general administration of the Independent Society. These wreckers resort to all kinds of methods and do everything they can to capture the Society and run it.</p>
   <p>The general administration of the Independent Society, aware of its own power and confident of its membership, has not paid any attention to the Bolshevik activity, reasoning to itself, "Let them play around; they can do no harm."</p>
   <p>But Chicago Bolsheviks do not remain quiet; with ever-increasing insolence they try to push their way into the ranks of the Independent Society. They are beginning to exert their influence upon the most simple-minded members. These members, seeing that the officers of the administration do not retort to the slanders of Bolsheviks, think that these slanders may be the truth, that their administration is in reality in the hands of White Russian officers and generals, who are leading a movement against the working class. Such misgivings among the least intelligent members have been observed lately.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0242.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Now the general administration, or, rather, the more enlightened members of the Society, have begun to appear in print with explanations concerning Bolshevik activity and its destructive policies in relation to the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>It is desirable, however, to put one question to our Bolshevik comrades. Where were you at the time when the Society was being organized, when it was enrolling members, acquiring property, and accumulating its capital? This was not done easily and quickly. Scores of years were required. All this time the doors of our Society were wide open for you, and we called upon you to join its ranks. We called upon you not in the name of officers and generals, with whom you attempt to link us, but in the name of peasants: Domoshevets, Putilov, Pasiuk, Ustich, Olesiuk, Sabinsky, Mikhalchik, Goroshchenia, and others--in the name of real peasants and workers, whose interests seemingly should not run counter to yours in anything.</p>
   <p>But what was your answer to our call? You turned us down with scorn, ridiculed us, called us ignoramuses, backward people, etc. Why then do you need us now? <pb facs="5423967_2_0243.jpg" n="6"/>--now, when we have a large family, plenty of property and a considerable sum of money in the treasury.</p>
   <p>If we are able to acquire property and money, we can manage it also. We do not need any vikings to rule over us. Therefore, let us say to you, comrades, that since you did not want to work together with us before--keep your hands off the Independent Society now.</p>
