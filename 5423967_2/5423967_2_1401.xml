   <p>"The Chicago 1933 Century of Progress cannot take place without the White Russians." The last decade gave this, hitherto 'unknown', people the opportunity to inscribe its name in the largest world centers. Agricultural, ethnographical, esthetical, literary, and other exhibits in Moscow, Paris, Prague, Riga, Cologne, Leipsic, Konigsberg--contained among their exhibitors also the White Russians: Be that the handiwork of White Russian peasant-women, or the rich gifts of White Russian soil, or the creations of etchers and painters from among the White Russian masses, or a copy of the White Russian Testament, Old or New,--dating more than 400 years back,--to say nothing of the White Russian histrionic art, the White Russian theatre, the White Russian song. It is known, for instance, that recently, at the all-Russian competitive congress of numerous national choirs in Moscow, the White Russian Kapella received the first prize.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1402.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So it was in Europe. But now is the time for the White Russian people to register its existence among other regenerated peoples and in America. The approaching Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago shall serve as a start for this objective.</p>
   <p>All the nations of the world will face one another in this noisy, motley, boundless Fair. All nationalities will appear here, in the fairy-like capacious Grant Park, on the shores of azure-blue Michigan. And here shall also appear the White Russians in 1933.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the foundation for it is prepared in America; the White Russian national consciousness in the several localities, in the colony, is after all increasing in greater or lesser degrees. It remains only for the American White Russians to demonstrate their wish, to assist their old native home to be represented at this world-wide Fair. And it were best if our native homeland did not fall before Indian palaces, German castles, American skyscrapers, French towers...It were best that White Russia showed to the world something, even if ever so little, from some village near Minsk or Grodno: a modest frame hut, its roof of aged straw as green as a park, its chimney crooked; and inside the hut everything should be from there; tables, <pb facs="5423967_2_1403.jpg" n="3"/>benches, ovens, behind-ovens, wooden beds, a grindstone, enormous trunks, wooden dishes, earthenware receptacles, towels embroidered by skillful hands from Slutsk, girdles and belts, rugs and table cloths of one's own make, dough-mixers, spades, tripods, oven-rakes, cleavers, and a great many other home implements.</p>
   <p>Some of these house utensils could even be made here, yet the greater part of it would have to be imported from Minsk, Slutsk, Vilno, Grodno, and Pruzhani.</p>
   <p>In the hut should be a typical White Russian family who would explain to hundreds, thousands and millions of visitors, during the Fair, what the White Russians are, what they want, what they produce, and how their neighbors treat them.</p>
   <p>By the hut a thrashing-place and a granary may be put up, and even a small modern kiosk in White Russian style could be built to demonstrate White Russian farming (why does not the Chicago market show our lumber, flax, <pb facs="5423967_2_1404.jpg" n="4"/>stumps, our leather and wool?:) White Russian culture and handicraft, the richness of our soil, the wealth of the bowels of our earth, etc., but chiefly our achievements in the past twenty five years. This exposition is coincident with the twenty fifth anniversary of the latest White Russian movement.</p>
   <p>Of course, in order to realize even this modest plan, means are needed, and not small means, but...in the first place it is yet five years to the Century of Progress; secondly, if the White Russians of all categories and emigration points will start intensive work for this objective, and if all the best forces of the White Russian people will be drawn to this work, then White Russians will be represented by a White Russian Department at this Exposition.</p>
   <p>One need not expatiate on the usefulness and significance of such a White Russian demonstration. Not one argument against White Russia's participation in this World Exhibit can hold out.</p>
   <p>The Chicago White Russian National Union took upon itself the responsibility <pb facs="5423967_2_1405.jpg" n="5"/>of raising this important question. Accordingly an appeal is being issued to all White Russians on this question. Comprehensive information is also given to the Century of Progress Committee where good neighbors are already saying things in behalf of White Russians.</p>
   <p>Yet the White Russian National Union does not claim the part of sponsor in this matter. It is important that this idea should be realized, and that White Russians should already tackle the need for an organ, with whose help the White Russians will appear not at the tail of the dazzling array of Eastern European nations before the world of culture. White Russians must be independently represented at this universal exposition.</p>
