   <p>The concert and ball arranged by the Chicago branch of the Russian Emigrees' Children Aid Society on May 20 was a great success, both artistically and financially. The appeal of the committee found a worthy response in the hearts of our Chicago Russians, who are always alive to the needs of our orphans. Our especial gratitude is due to the Russian professional artists and entertainers, some of whom had to cancel or postpone their appearances in other places so that they might give of their time and their talents for the worthy cause of helping the Russian children.</p>
   <p>In spite of the oppressive heat, the hall of the Russian-American Democratic Club was filled to overflowing. Our artists were at their best, and the enchanted public applauded their efforts ardently. The tunes of Russian music and the motifs of our folk songs, rendered with simplicity and inspiration, created a quaint and charming atmosphere. Everybody forgot his daily worries and admired the performance on the stage--the performance that <pb facs="5423967_2_1118.jpg" n="2"/>represented the better side of life in the Russia of bygone days. Many spectators had tears in their eyes, tears of emotion awakened by the memories of the past. Nothing can so inspire and stir the human emotions so much as music, song and dance. All praise and honor to you servants of the Russian arts, for your loyalty and devotion to your higher callings, and for spreading appreciation of the Russian arts in America even when your economic condition is very difficult and your lives are filled with obstacles of all kinds.</p>
   <p>Below are the names of the Russian artists who participated in the concert given for the benefit of Russian orphans:</p>
   <p>A. Armati, pianist; E. Adison, violinist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; A. I. Grishaev, baritone, member of the Russian Cossack Choir; A. Dobrokhotov, balalaika virtuoso; A. Diskont, a young ballet dancer; L. P. Zemtzeo, tenor, member of the Cossack Choir; V. I. Kuznetzov, a musician, singer and dancer; <pb facs="5423967_2_1119.jpg" n="3"/>Anastasia Lalush, dancer of folk dances; P. I. Maksakova, lyric soprano; E. Petukh, accordionist; N. Z. Sokolova, mezzo-soprano; S. Sokolov, pianist, director of the Cossack Choir; Anna Tcherepova, dancer; E. Reveka, a five-year-old dancer. Mr. I. F. Erin directed the concert and also acted as master of ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The concert committee was composed of the following: I. F. Erin, chairman, A. Bernard, M. Brashevetz, N. Vishnevsky, A. Guber, A. Daniluk, A. D. Dobrokhotov, E. Kopernik, E. Shishova, T. A. Lobanova, A. V. Lobanov, P. Logunov, A. V. Maksimova, A. A. Mikhailowskaya, S. Yanchuk, A. Kivaka, and S. Bakal.</p>
   <p>During the intermissions the following cash contributions were made: E. I. Perminiua, one dollar; A. Timon, one dollar; M. Kersh, $1.75.</p>
   <p>The following persons contributed provisions and other supplies for the buffet counter in the concert hall: A. Bernard, A. Guber, A. Mikhailowskaya, <pb facs="5423967_2_1120.jpg" n="4"/>T. Lobanova, A. Maksakova, E. Shishova, E. F. Wagner, S. Shukhostov, V. M. Zhukowsky and A. Kersh.</p>
   <p>The concert committee expresses its warm gratitude to all the artists and to the public for their participation in the concert.</p>
   <p>In the near future we shall publish a complete financial report of this concert. Now, however, in view of the great needs and the hardships experienced by our Russian orphans in Poland, we have sent them twenty-five dollars through the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Besides this, the society has issued special subscription lists on its own printed stationery, appealing to good people everywhere for contributions. On every list there is a seal of the society and the signatures of the chairman and the secretary. On every list there is printed its consecutive number and the name of the person authorized to solicit contributions. The names of all contributors and the amount of their contributions will be published <pb facs="5423967_2_1121.jpg" n="5"/>regularly in Rassviet.</p>
