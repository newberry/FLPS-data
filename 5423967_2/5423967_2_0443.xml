  <body>
   <p>On April 13, 1917, at the Sherman Hotel, a gathering of the recently organized "Society for Aid to the Russian Revolution" took place. About sixty persons were present at the gathering. By their formation all the present were an example for Russian organizations: the majority of those people belonged to the so-called "privileged classes," physicians, merchants, etc.</p>
   <p>During the meeting there were debates which called forth a conflict in the society. Several persons who belonged to revolutionary organizations insisted on sending the collected money of the society to deputies of the Soviet of Workers, but the majority of the gathering decided to send it to the Provisional government.</p>
   <p>The minority of those people, as it was reported, seceded from the society.</p>
