   <p>The editor says that the American Government has just published a series of documents showing that the Bolshevik leaders were in secret agreement with the German General Staff to promote a peace with Germany. The Bolshevik leaders were reported to have received $55,000,000.</p>
   <p>The Bolshevik government is silent about this, but Bolsheviks in America rush to their defense, crying forgery. It is very queer that Lenin is silent, why is this so. It is too bad that the Russian people can't find out about this. Let those who cry forgery be careful. Let any honest Bolshevik, who considers it his duty to explain this affair to the world, send these documents to the freest of governments - the United States.</p>
