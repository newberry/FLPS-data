   <p>In the latest monthly issue of the National Industrial Committee Monthly, figures are published relative to price increases on the articles of first necessity. According to this data, the prices on these articles in February rose five and two-tenths per cent compared with those of February of last year; but in comparison with those in February of 1929 the prices were seventeen and five-tenths per cent higher.</p>
   <p>The purchasing power of the dollar was figured at 121.4 per cent in February of this year as compared with 122.5 per cent in January; it was 127.7 per cent in February of 1934; 100.1 per cent in February of 1929; and at face value in 1923. In other words, one may now purchase for 82.5 cents as much as he could buy for a dollar in 1929. On the other hand, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently announced that, for each dollar received during <pb facs="5423967_2_0830.jpg" n="2"/>1929, workers in various industries were getting only from sixty-seven to seventy-two cents during January of this year. Consequently, the wages of workers are lagging considerably behind the increasing prices.</p>
   <p>In this connection the Bureau also stated that for each hundred workers employed in 1929 not more than seventy-five are working now. Thus, the total payroll is reduced by twenty-five per cent, without even the exclusion of reductions suffered by those workers who are now employed. The purchasing power of the people at large, therefore, has fallen quite considerably.</p>
   <p>During last year the prices for agricultural products rose by twelve and seven-tenths per cent; rentals by seven and three-tenths per cent. The only exception is clothing, the prices of which, during last February, declined by one and five-tenths per cent as compared with February of last year. This is explained by two factors: First, the manufacturers were forced to liquidate stocks of old-fashioned clothing; second, the demand <pb facs="5423967_2_0831.jpg" n="3"/>was slow since people were compelled to spend more money for other articles of necessity.</p>
   <p>Drawing certain conclusions from all this, the financial writer of the Chicago Daily News, D. Mirt, states that it is impossible to expect any improvement in business under such conditions, as the purchasing power of the population is continually declining. The attempts of the government to increase prices leads the people to spend most of their money for the purchase of articles of first necessity, which reduces the demand for other goods. If the level of prices is rising, wages must rise also. Only then will the equilibrium be preserved which is the goal of the present administration. At present such equilibrium does not exist, because the wages were lagging behind the rising prices. If the purchasing power begins to rise, and not decline as it has heretofore, American industry, in the opinion of Mr. Mirt, will get on its feet and will not need government help, which up to now was rendered through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and other government agencies.</p>
