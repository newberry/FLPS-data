   <p>Dreadful unemployment prevailing everywhere forced me to turn for aid to the Public Relief Agency, which sent me to work on one of the Federal Public Works' projects. I have now been employed on one or the other of these projects for over five months. I have had the chance to mingle with over twenty thousand people employed on these various projects. I wish now to share with the readers of Rassviet the experiences, impressions and observations gained during these five months as a project worker and as one of this great crowd of workers.</p>
   <p>At the beginning our crowd, over twenty thousand people, worked on one shift. We were spread over an area about two miles long. Every foreman had seventy-five men under his supervision. The great majority were unskilled workmen, common laborers of many nationalities: Poles, Italians, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Czechs, Irishmen, Germans, Swedes, Russians, Frenchmen and Americans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0865.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the first month of our work I noticed much solidarity in the gang I was in; everybody worked honestly and with joy, after many months of idleness. I thought then that work of any kind produced the best and strongest ties among men. I also thought and believed that, with the aid of knowledge and human concepts of life, human society could wash out from the globe all the man-made grime of misery, and establish happiness for all mankind. I believed that other people, at least those who were in an economic position similar to mine, thought as I did. I did not know that some people are born strong, others weak; that some are born wise, others stupid.</p>
   <p>When I began to observe these workers I found that they held widely different views and ideas, had differing temperaments, and reacted differently in the presence of moral problems. After I had worked with my gang for over a month I began to notice things which I had not seen before. I saw the disappearance of all respect of one man for another. The men began to laugh at and scorn one another. In their talks and quarrels, instead of respectful <pb facs="5423967_2_0866.jpg" n="3"/>words they used the most indecent and filthy expressions of all languages.</p>
   <p>Later, when they learned that the foreman was not a slave driver, and did not force people to work, our gang, consisting of seventy-five men, split into three groups. One group comprised the good conscientious workers; another group included in-between, wavering types; and the third group was composed of loafers and sluggards, who from the beginning refused to work. When asked by the foreman why they didn't want to work, they answered in unison that they had no warm clothing and that it was cold outside. Soon the administration issued good sheepskin coats to its workmen, and, besides, from then on, every day, furnished a supply of wood and coke for fire to keep them warm during the cold weather. Then the loafers of our gang dug a deep hole in the ground and installed therein an improvised stove, made of an empty iron barrel. They spent most of their work time around it, six hours every day. Some of them did not even bother to bring their spades with them when they came to work in the morning. Their ranks were steadily increased by <pb facs="5423967_2_0867.jpg" n="4"/>members of the half-hearted vacillating portion of our group, who, one by one, joined the loafers by the fire. In this fashion they spent the entire winter. The administration pretended not to see it or know about it. Many of these fire-huggers even burned their Government sheepskins. All this time the small group of honest workers had to work much harder to make up for the shirking of the loafers. When spring came and it became warm, the loafers left their hole and their stove, and sprawled out in the sunshine, shooting dice or playing cards, or simply sleeping under the trees. Many times the foreman or the boss pleaded with these parasites to leave their games and loafing and go back to work. But to no avail.</p>
   <p>I noticed that among these workers there were some horribly pernicious elements, fraught with grave dangers to the peace and order of our civilized society. These communistic, parasitic elements might cause a revolution or dictatorship, where now we have freedom and free speech. They would be either ultranationalistic or internationalistic, if only they could <pb facs="5423967_2_0868.jpg" n="5"/>remain idle and live well.</p>
   <p>Every day I see much poverty and destitution. But I do not see the dull, ignorant, exploited, homogeneous masses of which our Russian critics so often speak in our Russian press. Instead, I see everywhere separate groups of people, engrossed in their own little private, personal affairs, not interested much in the destinies of the human race or even of their own country.</p>
