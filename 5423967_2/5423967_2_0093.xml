   <p>The problem of the Pacific draws the attention of all countries of the world. The former prime minister of the South African Union, Mr. Smuts, in a comprehensive report read in Capetown at the meeting of the South African Institute on Foreign Relations, approached the problem with a disinterestedness noticeable only to an outside observer. The South African is interested only slightly in the affairs of the Far East. South Africa is so distant from the Pacific Ocean that Japanese expansion in no measure can threaten the immediate interests of the Union. However, the possibility of Japan applying the "Monroe Doctrine"--Asia for Asiatics--in the event of a Japanese victory over the European countries and America in the Pacific Ocean, can indirectly threaten even the interests of South Africa.</p>
   <p>General Smuts has appeared for a long time in the role of a proponent of common-front actions of all countries having interests to preserve status <pb facs="5423967_2_0094.jpg" n="2"/>in quo in the Far East. In his reports, both in London and on the native soil, the former prime minister of the South African Union always advocated the necessity of setting limits to the persistent efforts of Japan to carry into effect the slogan "Asia For Asiatics," which in practical application would be tantamount to seizure by Japan of most of the Territories on the Asiatic continent, and most of the islands in the Pacific. The famous South African statesman sees clearly the danger of giving free reins to the Japanese in the Far East. In his latest report, with particular emphasis, he dwells on the details of Anglo-American relations in the Pacific and points out the fact that the English Dominions--Canada, Australia, and South Africa--all agree that the closest collaboration between England and America in the Pacific would be most desirable and beneficial for all interested parties, except, of course, Japan. Concerted actions of the two great powers would not only secure the safety of the nations, but also assure safety of the Dominions, particularly of Canada and Australia.</p>
   <p>The mere fact of an agreement between the two countries in regard to the <pb facs="5423967_2_0095.jpg" n="3"/>Pacific problems would alone force Japan to be extremely careful in her policy of conquests in the Far East. Such an agreement, besides,would facilitate the entrance of the United States into the League of Nations, which at the present moment constitutes the backbone of the peaceful nations' struggle against those nations which, after arming themselves to the teeth, are carrying on separately and entirely independently of the League of Nation's policy, leading to the possibility of armed conflicts.</p>
   <p>At present, according to General Smuts, the preservation of the pillars of European civilization which is confronted with mortal danger is the issue. The old structure seems to be cracking and falling apart; and the coming decade threatens the entire world with a total loss of all those good things which this civilization gave us. In the face of the danger looming in the Far East, the men holding the reins of government must prove that they are equal to the task. Perhaps this present hour is the time when Europe can re-establish her hegemony over the world, which, it would appear, has been lost, and become again the bulwark of civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0096.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is somewhat peculiar that while advocating closer co-operation between England and the United States in regard to the Pacific problems, General Smuts has not said a word about Soviet Russia. As we recall, the relations during the last few days between Russia and the United States have cooled off somewhat. America quite openly manifested her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government by reducing her diplomatic and consular staffs in Soviet Russia. We can easily assume that Soviet Russia is considered as an insignificant factor in the questions of Pacific relations. Seemingly, even if there is any intention of establishing much closer collaboration between England and the United States, the aim of which will be to set limits to the Japanese expansion on the Asiatic continent and in the Far East, such collaboration does not contemplate the participation of Soviet Russia in solving the problems of the Pacific. Attempts of the present administration in Washington to establish more or less normal and closer relations with the Soviet government, at least for the present, should be considered as failures. Russian interests in the Far East may, of course, suffer considerably because of the refusal of the great powers to deal with the Communistic government.</p>
