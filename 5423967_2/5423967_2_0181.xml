   <p>The R. I. M. A. S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) is today in a position similar to that of the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society in Pittsburgh in the days preceding the latter's absorption by the Communist organization. The men responsible for the Pittsburgh organization's decision to join the Communists were high in the Society's council and were supported by many rank-and-file members of Red persuasion.</p>
   <p>The R. I. M. A. S. has many members who are out-and-out Communists. They are boring from within to force the organization into the embrace of an international order composed of and controlled by the Communists. If the R. I. M. A. S. does not get rid of these Red vermin now, it may soon be too late. These Reds are trying to bring Deviatkin [local Communist leader] into the organization. And when Deviatkin becomes a member of the Society, its days will be numbered. It will soon share the fate of the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, which, as a result of the plots and intrigues of the Communists, because affiliated with the Communist organization. The <pb facs="5423967_2_0182.jpg" n="2"/>Communists heading the Russian People's Society violently opposed the union of that organization with the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society in New York (one of the strongest and most reliable Russian organizations in America) at the time the question of affiliation was discussed, because they wanted to sell out the Society to the Reds. And they had their way.</p>
   <p>A similar situation now exists in the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. There is a Red clique within the organization which works surreptitiously for union with the international Red gang, which already has devoured several smaller mutual aid societies of various national groups in this country. The decision of the twenty-third convention of the R. I. M. A. S., not to join the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society can be attributed to the intrigues of the Reds. By this negative decision of the convention, their hopes that they will soon be able to hoist the Red flag over the Society have risen high.</p>
   <p>These enemies of the Russian people work untiringly on all fronts. They know that the R. I. M. A. S. enjoys very friendly relations with Rassviet, which has always supported and defended the Society. They realize that if <pb facs="5423967_2_0183.jpg" n="3"/>it were not for Rassviet the organization would stand alone, more vulnerable to successful attack. For this reason, they are now directing all their efforts to destroy the friendship between Rassviet and the R. I. M. A. S., thus depriving the latter of its chief weapon of defense. To achieve their aim, they publicly sling mud at Rassviet, and they are using all of their sly, well-tried tactics in an attempt to undermine the reputation and popularity enjoyed by Rassviet among the masses of the Russian people. They say, for instance, that Rassviet is fighting Bolshevism; that therefore it has a strong political cast, and that since it is a political organ, the interests of the Society are harmed by friendly relations the newspaper maintains with the Society. They brazenly suggest that the Society's future would be much brighter if all relations with Rassviet were severed. Some grossly ignorant or childishly gullible persons may believe their assertions, but the majority of our people know that all their talk and arguments are lying Red propaganda.</p>
   <p>Now is the best time to purge the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society of this criminal element. If the Society does not destroy the roots of the <pb facs="5423967_2_0184.jpg" n="4"/>growing Red evil now, it will find that tomorrow is too late.</p>
   <p>All members of the R. I. M. A. S. who have the future welfare of their organization at heart should stop worrying about the fate of the communized Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, which has been lost forever to the Russian cause in America. They should rise as one man in defense of the threatened free existence of their own organization, lest it be too late.</p>
