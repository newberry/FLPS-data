   <p>The celebrated Russian painter, Nikolay Konstantinovich Roerich, has come to Chicago. His son has arrived with him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Roerich has come only recently to America from India and Tibet, where he has been working hard lately.</p>
   <p>A year ago he founded in New York an art museum bearing his name, where about 400 of his paintings can be seen.</p>
   <p>Some time ago he was working at the scenery for the Russian opera, "The Snow Maiden" (Snyegoorochka), for the Chicago Civic Opera Company.</p>
   <p>What Mr. Roerich has to say about the Americans and their culture is interesting.</p>
   <p>"The Americans proposed that I should become an American citizen," says <pb facs="5423967_2_1197.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Roerich, "but I gave them the following-explanation: 'Between us Russians, the most progressive and spiritual nation of Asia, and you, the nation of the future, the Americans, a creative relationship is being formed.</p>
   <p>" 'We are brothers, the closest friends. I would not wish to see you becoming transformed into Russians. Be yourselves and at the same time be our friends. Why should we be fused into one homogeneous whole?' And they understood me and liked what I told them."</p>
