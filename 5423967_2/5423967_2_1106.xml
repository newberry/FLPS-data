   <p>The conductor of the Kuban Cossack Chorus, Mr. S. Sokolov, who is well-known to the Chicago Russian colony, celebrates in this year the twenty-fifth anniversary of his activity as conductor.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. G. Sokolov is the son of Mr. G. A. Sokolov, who was a very popular conductor of church choirs in Moscow. Mr. S. Sokolov was born in 1887 and acquired his education in Moscow. He inherited his musical talent from his father. In 1904 he was already conducting a choir at the Borisc-Glyebsky church in Moscow. Soon Mr. Sokolov, who had won the sympathies of the members of the choir as well as those of the public, became, like his father, the conductor of several church choirs.</p>
   <p>In 1909 Mr. Sokolov accepted the position of teacher of music at the Poltava seachers' Seminary, on the Kuban,where he was taking care of the musical education of the future public school teachers. But this successful work as music teacher did not satisfy the young conductor, and in 1910 he joined the Moscow University and at the same time studied at the Moscow Imperial Conservatory in order to complete <pb facs="5423967_2_1107.jpg" n="2"/>his musical education.</p>
   <p>In February 1915 Mr. S. G. Sokolov was graduated from the University where he was studying law; and in September of the same year he was graduated from the Conservatory. Soon after that he was called to do military service. After graduating from a military school he went as an officer to the Western front. When the Civil war broke out in Russia, he went to Serbia, and there he organized a large chorus consisting of Cossack refugees. He made several very successful tours in Yugoslavia with this chorus.</p>
   <p>In 1922 there came to Yogoslavia a detachment of Cossack refugees. This detachment had with it a chorus consisting of Kuban Cossacks. The Ataman (chief commander) of the Cossacks proposed to Mr. Sokolov to take over this chorus. Mr. Sokolov accepted this proposal, reorganized the chorus and made a tour with it all over Europe. He gave concerts in Rome in the Milan Conservatory, in Madrid and other large cities of Europe, and these concerts helped him to acquire the reputation of a great musician. The best musical critics in Europe praised highly his musical talent which had enabled him to teach his Cossacks how to combine in their performances a strict exactitude with true artistic taste.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1108.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After making a tour with his Cossacks through Mexico and Central America, Mr. Sokolov accepted a series of proposals which enabled him to undertake tours in the United States. He established his headquarters in Chicago and for four years has been arranging tours and giving concerts in various cities of the U. S. and of Canada.</p>
   <p>The critics of various American papers also praise enthusiastically Mr. Sokolov's work as director, and the performances of his chorus. Mr. Sokolov deserves the highest praise for his efforts to acquaint the foreign countries with the Russian folk-songs. And his selflessness and true love of his art induced him to reorganize his Cossack chorus on such principles that at present this chorus is a corporation of artists in which no singer can be exploited in any possible way.</p>
   <p>On July 22 there have elapsed twenty-five years since Mr. S. G. Sokolov started on his career of ceaseless labor as a great musician and conductor of Russian choruses. He is now on a tour in states of the far West. Therefore the celebration of the 25th anniversary of his activity has been postponed until he returns to Chicago.</p>
