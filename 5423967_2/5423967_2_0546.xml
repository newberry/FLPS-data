<title level="a">MEETING OF THE RUSSIAN DEMOCRATS IN DOUGLAS PARK DISTRICT</title></bibl>

   <p>On April 12, the annual meeting of the Russian-American Democratic Club was held in the hall of the Twenty-fifth Ward branch of the Democratic party. The meeting was attended by representatives from other districts and suburban towns.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by P. Chopko, president of the Club. He read into the record a report concerning the activity of the [executive] committee and active members of the organization, particularly women, during the past year. From the report it was seen that the Club has three hundred members. Among them are many members who come from suburban areas. Most of the members pay their dues regularly.</p>
   <p>The Club has two subsidiary organizations: a youth group and a dramatic group. Recently, a string orchestra was organized. The Club intends to form a choir <pb facs="5423967_2_0547.jpg" n="2"/>and this will be easy because among the members there are several experienced singers, as well as men and women who have good voices. The only thing they have to do is to hire a conductor. They are also planning to open a school for both adults and children. Further on [in his report], Mr. Chopko reported to the meeting a resolution adopted at a meeting held on March 22. The chairman reported that the resolution had been presented personally by the delegates of the Ward to the [State] League's officials and to the newly elected president. A majority of the delegates who heard the resolution decided to reject the demand made by the Twenty-fifth Ward committee. Furthermore, the district delegates declared themselves in favor of leaving the League and of carrying on independent activity.</p>
   <p>Having expressed a wish for the success of the new [state] administration, the [district] delegates left the hall.</p>
   <p>The meeting, then, expressed its thanks to the committee and to all those who had taken active part in forming the Russian-American Democratic organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0548.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>N. Turin, temporary financial secretary, reported that during the second half of the year, the Club had received $75.80 as income from two entertainments.</p>
   <p>The chairman reported that during the year, the Club had helped thirty men to file applications for first citizenship papers, and ten men to file for their second papers.</p>
