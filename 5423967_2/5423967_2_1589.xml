  <body>
   <p>My dear editor, members of the editorial staff, and all co-workers of Rassviet: My hearty greetings to you on this day of the tenth anniversary of your publication. I join you, in an exalted spirit, in your historic celebration of this glorious occasion.</p>
   <p>Allow me to set forth, even though briefly, my views and opinions regarding some pertinent circumstances which, directly or indirectly, are responsible for the fact that our Rassviet is celebrating today its tenth anniversary.</p>
   <p>As an old resident of Chicago, I remember well the day when Rassviet first appeared in our colony. It had a very humble beginning as a small party organ. As time went by, its circulation increased steadily, and its columns <pb facs="5423967_2_1590.jpg" n="2"/>were opened ever wider for the entire colony to express their views and outlooks on various vital questions. Rassviet began early to look rather deep into the minds and hearts of the Russian masses in this country. It discovered soon the problems, the dilemmas, and the open sores that were thwarting the life of the Russian group in America. For these reasons, Rassviet was fast becoming a publication representing the views of the entire Russian group in the United States and in Canada, with the exception of the Russian-American Bolsheviks. Rassviet is also the connecting link between the Russian group in America and other Russian groups in different European countries and on other continents.</p>
   <p>Here are the points which I wish to bring out:</p>
   <p>1. Rassviet is the mirror of our life in America. This newspaper reflects both the positive and the negative sides of our life. Thereby it enables us to see our mistakes, and to mend our ways when necessary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1591.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>2. Rassviet is our guide. By giving examples from the lives of other peoples and other national groups, and by informing us about world events, it guides us and shows us the path to a better future.</p>
   <p>3. Rassviet leads us forward to progress. Rassviet urges the Russian people to constant improvements in their group and individual procedures having to do with the Russian schools, the cultivation of Russian arts, the benefit societies, and other economic and cultural activities.</p>
   <p>4. Rassviet disseminates knowledge. Rassviet educates the people by the wise selection of material, by popularizing knowledge, and by spreading interesting information.</p>
   <p>5. Rassviet is the embodiment of the higher aspirations of the colony. Every creative thought or idea, no matter whether it comes from a group or from an individual, always receives the full support of Rassviet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1592.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>6. Rassviet is the beacon of the colony. By its great educational work, Rassviet brightens the life of the Russian colony and shows the way to a better future.</p>
   <p>7. Rassviet the protector! Whenever misfortune visits any Russian organization, or a private family, Rassviet immediately issues a call for aid and rallies all possible means of assistance.</p>
   <p>8. Rassviet the bureau of information! Everything of importance which transpires today in the life of the local Russian colony, and everything which is scheduled to take place in the future, is carefully recorded in the pages of Rassviet. If you want to locate somebody, the personal column of Rassviet is at your service.</p>
   <p>9. Rassviet the uniting factor! Rassviet aids the Russian people in forming various groups and organizations, like benefit societies, clubs, <pb facs="5423967_2_1593.jpg" n="5"/>political organizations, culture and art centers. Rassviet strongly supports the activities of the local Russian-American youth. The two largest Russian organizations in America--The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society in New York and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society in Chicago--have been able to achieve a remarkable growth and success by using regularly their own special pages in Rassviet.</p>
   <p>10. Rassviet fights the Russian enemies. We have many enemies who are trying to destroy the Russian spirit and Russian national consciousness in our people in America. We witnessed, not so long ago, how these enemies, the red comrades, attempted to get hold of and put under their control the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, the two most outstanding Russian benefit societies in America. Thanks to Rassviet's unrelenting campaign against these enemies, and to the energy of the leaders of these organizations, these bloodthirsty hooligans were mercilessly defeated in their sinister efforts to ruin our organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1594.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Considering all the foregoing, all Russians in America should highly value and respect Rassviet and everything it has accomplished for the Russian group in America. For these reasons, every Russian in this country should Join me in congratulating Rassviet on its tenth anniversary and in wishing it the best of success in the future.</p>
   <p>Long live Rassviet and all its honest, devoted workers!</p>
   <p>I. F. Erin</p>
