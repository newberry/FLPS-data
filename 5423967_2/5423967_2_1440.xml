   <p>On February 10, 1929, the celebration of the centenary of the death of the great Russian author, Alexander Sergeyevich Griboyedov, took place. The celebration took place in the small exquisite hall of the Y. M. C. A. Mr. Moravsky read a detailed report of Griboyedov and his work. A brilliant reading by Mr. B. I. Baycher of Chatzky's monologue from "Gorye Ot Uma" (Sorrows of a Superior Mind). For an encore Mr. Baycher recited the beautiful poem "Sakia Muni" by Merezhkovsky. Good as usual was S. P. Alekseyev in the declamation "Rossiya" by Block and "Dary Tereka" by Lermoutov. Miss Nina Besedova played the violin with great spirit. Mr. Cliffton Mett, one of the best pianists of Chicago was invited to accompany her at the piano. In conclusion a solo on the piano was played by the youthful Evgenia Murey (daughter of Mr. Murey, well known in the colony. In spite of her youth, Miss Murey brilliantly played two very difficult numbers. The president of the Russian Center thanked the audience for the attention they paid to the cultural undertakings of the organization and to the memory of the best people of Russia.</p>
