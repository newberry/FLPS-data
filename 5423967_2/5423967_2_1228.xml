   <p>.... As was communicated in yesterday's issue of our newspaper Ivan Vasilievich Lazarev, an artist of the Moscow Art Theater, has come to Chicago.</p>
   <p>During six weeks he will appear on the stage of the Auditorium Theater in that grand play, "Miracle," which has made such a stir in America.</p>
   <p>Lately Mr. I. V. Lazarev has been touring with the troupe of artists of the Miracle Company, visiting various cities in the United States. The American newspapers give enthusiastic accounts of his acting.</p>
   <p>In some cities Ivan Vasilievich gave lectures about the Moscow Art Theater and staged some plays.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some groups of the Russian colony of Chicago are trying to persuade Mr. I. V. Lazarev to give one or two lectures here and to stage several plays. Ivan Vasilievich will probably agree to do so. In that case, besides getting the opportunity of seeing him in the "Miracle," we shall also enjoy his acting in some Russian plays.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. V. Lazarev has been acting on the stage of the Moscow Art Theater during seventeen years and is still a member of the troupe of artists of this theater.</p>
   <p>When the writer of this article asked him what had induced him to abandon temporarily the Moscow Art Theater, Ivan Vasilievich answered: "I desire to make, as far as it is possible, more lasting the trace which the Moscow Art Theater has left in America,"</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarev is full of energy and has a strong faith in the power and the influence of the theater. And he belongs to that famous company of <pb facs="5423967_2_1230.jpg" n="3"/>our most honored artists who consider the theater to be not just a place where the public can pass the time and have some fun; but - as Mr. Lazarev said when speaking about a certain theater - "a place for the propaganda of exalted ideas, a place for public thought." According to his idea the theater should be, in a way, a "teacher of life....."</p>
