   <p>The First of May has passed. The day went with much less animation or exaltation than heretofore. In the past the first of May used to be a veritable workers' holiday, a day of great manifestations. This time the first of May passed without exaltation; yet not without victims. There were some killed in France and in Italy.</p>
   <p>Apparently the bloodshed was due not to stormy events of the celebrations, but rather to the prevailing grewsome reaction in those countries, where the police are just itching to start trouble under any pretext.</p>
   <p>In the more industrial countries, such as Germany, England, and the United States the day went off very quietly.</p>
   <p>In London, if one is to believe the newspapers, only 4,000 participated in the celebrations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0290.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This seems altogether too strange inasmuch as the unemployed alone in England are about a million, and there are about eight million workingmen in England.</p>
   <p>One is glad, of course, that there were no clashes nor any victims in Germany, England, or the United States, but it is rather sad that the first of May should have been so dull.</p>
