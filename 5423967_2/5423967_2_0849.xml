   <p>The United States seems to be the first country to take the path of Social Reforms. The law to effect the economic regeneration of the country, known as the NRA, appears to be only the first step in the sphere of social reforms. This reform has not been particularly effective, and, consequently, the government has decided to move a step further--to introduce more radical reforms which may improve the conditions of the workers. This is indicated by the latest proclamation of President Roosevelt regarding the Social Security [Act]. The new social reform guarantees unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, and social care for mothers and children.</p>
   <p>As was to be expected, industrialists are very dissatisfied with the proposed reforms, but offer no alternative method to overcome the crisis. If they <pb facs="5423967_2_0850.jpg" n="2"/>guaranteed work to all the unemployed, and did not condemn future workers to a miserable existence, perhaps the proposed plan of social insurance would not be necessary. But they reject even this method of eliminating unemployment.</p>
   <p>All this indicates that they have not yet freed themselves from an extreme [type of] egotism, and refuse to think of the conditions of the workers. They think only of themselves, forgetting that such egotism quite frequently provokes powerful social explosions.</p>
   <p>The [example of the] United States has been followed by France and Canada. It is necessary, however, to point out that the reform measures which these countries are at present putting through, to overcome the crisis, were shown, in the United States, to be obsolete. A number of bills, very similar to the America NRA, have been introduced in the French Parliament by Premier Flandin, <pb facs="5423967_2_0851.jpg" n="3"/>who just recently declared that the present social order needs some reforms.</p>
   <p>"Present-day youth," he declared, "fights for life and happiness with a different spirit than we had." Flandin explained also that there was an overproduction of intellectuals to be seen not only in France, but in all other civilized countries. "The time has come," declared the Premier," to increase the ranks of our manual laborers, the bricklayers, carpenters, whose services France needs more keenly than she does the unemployed university graduates.</p>
   <p>"I propose, therefore, to limit the number of lawyers, physicians, engineers, admitted to practice each year. In order to limit the number of diplomas issued, we shall introduce the system of competitive examinations. This will put an end to the growth of the unemployed among the professional class, which threatens to become a social ulcer."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0852.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The reforms proposed in France have nothing in common with dictatorship, which many uneducated people think is the only salvation. "Frenchmen are too wise," said Flandin, "to accept [the system of] dictatorship, which crowds the jails paralizes tongues, and condemns the entire population to a life of fear and terror."</p>
   <p>Canadian Premier Bennet also declared, in the Parliment, his intentions of introducing a plan of social reforms. His plan resembles the NRA even more than France's does, since its basic principles are confined to the establishment of a minimum wage and maximum working hours, the elimination of unfair industrial competition, and the creation of an "industrial council," similar to our American Brain Trust.</p>
   <p>All this indicates that humanity is entering a new era of social reforms. Undoubtedly, other countries will follow the examples of the United States and Canada as soon as they understand that modern problems will not solve themselves, and that in order to improve the economic situation of the people it is necessary to carry out certain decisive reforms of broad scope and significance.</p>
