   <p>The Communist butchers in Soviet Russia have recently executed twenty-eight men. Prior to this, they had put to death thirty-seven men in Leningrad, twenty-nine in Moscow, nine in Minsk, and twenty-eight in Kiev. Everyone of these one hundred and three lives was taken to avenge the assassination of a Communist official, Kirov.</p>
   <p>Instinctively a thought comes to our mind: "How long will these Red bandits rule How long will these macabre orgies continue? How long will the blood of innocent people continue to flow? Will it ever be possible to curb and restrain these killers in their fiendish activities?"</p>
   <p>Soviet Russia was accepted not long ago as a member of the League of Nations, as a member of an association of civilized peoples. Let us hope that this high <pb facs="5423967_2_0178.jpg" n="2"/>institution, created for the defense of justice, will intercede in behalf of the maltreated, bleeding Russian people. Let us hope that the noted statesmen, writers, scientists, and other distinguished personalities in many lands will raise their voices in protest against the brutal outrages now taking place in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>So far, the outside world has been silent; it has been uninterested in the events now taking place in the Red paradise. But if this silence and this apathy toward the suffering of fellow human beings continue, the chances are that the Red evil, with all that it embodies, will spread to other parts of the world, and that those who today look with indifference upon the outrageous crimes committed by the Red monsters will themselves become the victims of the Communist terror.</p>
   <p>In order to stop these wholesale murders in Soviet Russia, it is necessary to organize world opinion against the Red masters of the Kremlin. When the Red dictators hear these indignant protests coming from many cultured nations of <pb facs="5423967_2_0179.jpg" n="3"/>the world, they will be forced to put an end to this ruthless slaughter of men and women.</p>
   <p>The Russian group in America should be the first to organize a common front against the depravities now being committed in Russia. All political, religious, and social differences should be forgotten. All Russians in America should rise as one man to defend their fatherland and to condemn the Kremlin killers. The foundation for this great work has already been laid by Russians in greater New York. As a result of their efforts, protests against the Bolshevik killings in Soviet Russia are beginning to flow into Washington.</p>
   <p>Protest meetings against the Bolshevik terror in Soviet Russia should be held in every American city and town where there are Russian people. Silence is a crime against our own honor and against our fatherland, Russia, when we consider the circumstances in which our brothers and our fathers are compelled to live and suffer in Russia under the Bolshevik scourge. Not a single Russian organization in America would be justified in maintaining silence, under the pretext that it <pb facs="5423967_2_0180.jpg" n="4"/>is nonpolitical in character, when the very lives of the kin of its members are constantly threatened by the Red oppressors. This is not a political campaign, it is not a fight for political power; it is a campaign to defend human beings, and to save them from a gang of barbarians and killers.</p>
