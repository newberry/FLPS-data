   <p>In almost every issue of Novyi Mir [the Russian Communist publication] Mr. Shklar [local Russian communist leader] devotes an article or an item to Rassviet. This, of course, does not grieve us, but rather makes us glad. It is evident that Rassviet causes Mr. Shklar much annoyance and unpleasantness, if he gives it so much attention. It is also evident that Rassviet is not a "worthless sheet," as it is branded by Novyi Mir writers, if the Shklars, Deviatkins and other literate Bolsheviks read it everyday from cover to cover, as they evidently do.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shklar's items in Novyi Mir are sad stuff. They appeal neither to the mind nor to the heart of the readers of that Communist newspaper. Shklar's tirades against Rassviet consist of empty phrases, hysterical wails and abuse. Had the writer of these articles been someone other than Shklar, <pb facs="5423967_2_1637.jpg" n="2"/>a more cultured or educated person, the contents of these articles would have been different. But Shklar is unable to write differently. He has no educational background and no knowledge of the literary use of the language. For this reason he is at his best when, like a parrot, he repeats over and over in all his scribblings the following words: "anarchists, White Guards, fascists, traitors of the working class, defenders of the capitalists, sons of the merchants, and former aristocrats."</p>
   <p>Nothing else can be found in his articles. But this is easily understood, for Shklar and his kind have their own language. For them there exists no logic, no grammar; they deny facts and disregard proofs. Whoever disagrees with them or tries to question them receives abuse and invectives as an answer.</p>
   <p>Not long ago Rassviet asked the Bolsheviks the following questions: What has remained of your old program? What are you fighting for, now that you have officially proclaimed that liberty, equality and brotherhood are bourgeois prejudices?</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1638.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As was to be expected, Shklar did not answer these questions but instead wrote an article about the "betrayal of the working classes by the White Guard paper Rassviet." It appears that Rassviet has been called "traitor" by the Bolsheviks because it printed an article in which it declared that General Johnson is opposing the exploitation of workers; because it stated that there has been an improvement in the economic conditions of this country; and because it said that the Socialist building program in the Soviet Union is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>Shklar knows well that our statement about better economic conditions in the country is based on official data; yet he considers it a betrayal of the working class. If this is treachery, then Mr. Shklar commits the same sin when he gives official Soviet data concerning the Soviet construction program. As to General Johnson's declaration, Mr. Shklar does not like it, evidently, because it contradicts the program of the Moscow Politbureau [Political Bureau] which is striving not to destroy exploitation and slavery, but to strengthen and expand it. Mr. Shklar also knows <pb facs="5423967_2_1639.jpg" n="4"/>that the communications in Chicago's larger newspapers of the impending Soviet economic bankruptcy--only briefly quoted in Rassviet--must have passed the Soviet censor before they could leave Russia, so he should accuse the Soviet censor of treachery and not Rassviet.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Shklar wants to find the real traitors of the working class he should not look for them in Rassviet but in other places. Above all he should look at himself and at his comrades in Moscow and elsewhere, for never in history have there been such traitors to the working class as the Bolsheviks have proved themselves to be.</p>
