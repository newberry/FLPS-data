   <p>Even though it may seem incredible that a small group of people who believe in the philosophy of pacifism can play a role of world importance among millions who live in fear of an impending war, nevertheless, under present conditions of world chaos and confusion, impossible things become possible, and even probable.</p>
   <p>"The darker the night, the brighter the stars," as the saying goes, and for that reason, on this background of world gloom that grows thicker every day, the forces of light become more and more conspicuous, and begin to attract a great deal of attention.</p>
   <p>Now it is obvious that there is no force sufficiently powerful to retard the historical succession of events, and the new world war, therefore, is inevitable. It is inevitable not because of the political situation which makes governments <pb facs="5423967_2_0664.jpg" n="2"/>quarrel among themselves. Even if the Germans reconciled their differences with the French, and Stalin fell into the embrace of Hitler, the situation would not change one iota. One need only look at the figures of rising expenditures for rearmament in all countries in order to be convinced of the absurdity of the course which humanity is following. If war breaks out during the next two or three years, each government will spend the last cent of its money on rifles, guns, and gasses, instead of food, clothing, and other necessities for its people. The results of such a procedure are easy to foresee. The moment is rapidly approaching when the inevitable consequences of armament [preparedness] will bring the situation to a climax because all the conferences called for the purpose of reducing armaments and military appropriations, have failed miserably.</p>
   <p>Thus the impending war can be considered inevitable, and now we may as well look ahead and see just what will happen after the war is over. If the last war destroyed a number of states politically, lowered the morals of humanity to an unprecedented degree, and gave birth to the ugly and bloody tyranny of Bolshevism, <pb facs="5423967_2_0665.jpg" n="3"/>then what worse catastrophe can humanity expect from this new and more horrible war?</p>
   <p>To assume that humanity, depraved by new mass murders, will mend its ways and turn into meek lambs, would be contrary to all known experience. One can expect the existing forms of tyranny to be destroyed, and their place taken by some new forms which will be even worse, for by that time there may be left only one healthy cell in the whole sickly organism of humanity.</p>
   <p>I should like to speak briefly of this single healthy cell. At the present time there are several groups and organizations in existence which are opposed to war. The Bolshevik "League Against War and Fascism" and "The International League of the Opponents of War," headed by an English lord are two extremely different types of such organizations. There are also a number of religious sects and groups which sincerely desire peace, but their activity is not co-ordinated and the work is done in a haphazard manner. These organizations and groups are still divided by remnants of national chauvinism and by the fear of being <pb facs="5423967_2_0666.jpg" n="4"/>compromised in the eyes of their imperialist governments. Others try to curry favor with the Bolshevik International. All this makes their efforts to preserve peace ineffective, and all of their activity is centered around conferences and the printing of leaflets and other material which nobody reads.</p>
