   <p>In today's issue of Rassviet there is an interesting letter from our reader, S. Zhukov, concerning Russian newspapers.</p>
   <p>S. Zhukov writes that for twenty years he has read four Russian newspapers and has always found in them the same faults: revilement, calumny, altercation and insult.</p>
   <p>S. Zhukov declares justly that not only do individuals revile each other, but so does the press. This [type of] statement adds to the disorganization of the Russian colony and does not inspire it to purposive action and thought to endless internal quarrel.</p>
   <p>S. Zhukov justly concludes in his letter that it would be better if the Russian newspapers would stop quarreling and would try to unite the Russian workers into one solid organization, because only then can the Russian colony <pb facs="5423967_2_1663.jpg" n="2"/>improve its economic condition and enrich itself with the cultural wealth that other nationalities possess.</p>
   <p>Certainly, it is impossible to deny that colonists and Russian newspapers slander each other, but S. Zhukov unfortunately did not point out to the readers the reasons for the existence of such conditions.</p>
   <p>Many Russian colonists including S. Zhukov, know what the first Russian newspapers were like and what aim they held. They must know that the first Russian newspapers were purely commercial. Their aim was not to organize the Russian workers and raise them to a higher cultural level, but to keep them disorganized and helpless, to exploit the Russian people who by fate were cast on the shores of a foreign country.</p>
   <p>The newspaper was, and always will be respected by the people as a teacher; since it did not teach the people an ethical code, the readers naturally lacked one. If the Russian colonists still slander each other, it is not surprising <pb facs="5423967_2_1664.jpg" n="3"/>and they cannot be blamed because they have been educated in such spirit and taught to act in such manner by their teachers.</p>
   <p>Some modern Russian newspapers are still aiming for commercial goals. Naturally these newspapers are not interested in the union or enlightenment of the Russian people, and so on their pages is printed not what would develop and organize the people culturally, but that which would be profitable to the newspaper from a purely commercial point of view. Other newspapers are purely partisan; again their aims are not to unite the people but to lure them to their particular party; against those who will not join, calumny, prevarication and slander are thrown. The same paper opens its pages to persons who purposely bring disorganization into the Russian colony so that they may with greater ease lure it into their partisan traps.</p>
   <p>These partisan and commercial newspapers always have had bitter arguments with those who unveil the rottenness of such papers, and with those who encourage the widest organization and cultural enlightenment for the Russian <pb facs="5423967_2_1665.jpg" n="4"/>colony.</p>
   <p>Commercial and partisan newspapers are more afraid of genuine workers' newspapers than of fire, because the sooner the people become more cultured and more organized, the weaker the various adventurers will become. Rassviet is a genuine workers' and colonists' newspaper, unveiling the schemes of commercial and partisan newspapers and therefore it is not amazing that profiteers and political adventurers inveigh against it.</p>
   <p>Rassviet called and still calls for enlightenment and unity for the Russian people. Rassviet opens its pages not to slander nor to answer personal attack, but to those who bring into the colony the spirit of organization, culture and solidarity. And if sometime on its pages the editor or readers seem to criticize a disorganizer and adventurer, it is only because it is necessary. It is not [in the nature of] an attack but is done for the purpose of self-defense and as a safeguard.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1666.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The pages of Rassviet are open to any Russian organization which has an ethical cause, and to any expression of honest and sincere opinion. That is why Rassviet is the only newspaper that is exclusively the workers' organizational newspaper and why Rassviet should be in the home of every Russian colonist who is willing to see the colony strong and organized. The wider Rassviet is distributed, the sooner the Russian colony will release itself from various adventurers and be assimilated into one working family.
