   <p>This article, without any title, but signed R. L. Osski, reports that at the mass meeting of May 1st, presided over by Dr. Krasnow, and attended by three thousand Russians of Chicago, it was resolved to send to President Wilson a telegram with the following contents:</p>
   <p>"We greet you, Mr. President, as the head of the great-hearted American people in relation to a friendly Russia, and we thank you for your ever well meaning attitude towards Russia, which was expressed in your solemn promise not to permit a general peace at Russia's expense, as a counteracting measure to a one-sided interference in Russia's affairs without a summons to the Russian democracy, which summons will soon go out to all allies in general, and (we thank you) for patiently waiting until an authentic national will is formed in Russia, to whom Russia's honor and freedom will be dear, and who will return her to the fighting lines.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_0708.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are extremely glad to help friendly America all we can, and are therefore happy to have been called upon by the Federal Government to assist with the Liberty Loan, yet our entire hope to save the ideas of democracy in the world we place on a speedy revival of co-operation by Russia with all the Allies against the disgrace of an Eastern front opened to the Germans. We trust that Russia will arise and that you will help our perishing country. Long live the great American Nation! Long live her worthy leader, President Wilson!"</p>
   <p>Before closing, the entire audience gave three cheers for America and President Wilson, and also for the great, powerful, undivided Russia.</p>
   <p>(Signed) R. L. Osski</p>
   <p>May 7, 1918.</p>
