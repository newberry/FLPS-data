   <p>The Supreme Court, as is known, by its decision of May 27, found that establishment of codes for industries is a kind of legislation which is contrary to the constitutional guarantees. These codes were the Kernel of NRA organization, for they regulated the prices on manufactured products, and fixed the minimum wages and the hours of labor in each industry. The Court has decided that Congress, by authorizing the President to establish such codes, has delegated its own rights to make laws to the executive branch of the government, and as a result of this surrender of power to the executive branch of the federal government has acquired an increased authority over commerce and trade at the expense of individual states.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Court based this decision on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which regulates State and interstate commerce. According to the <pb facs="5423967_2_0785.jpg" n="2"/>Constitution, when trade is carried on within a state, only the State authorities have the right of control over it. But when certain trade goes beyond the limits of a state, then the federal government steps in and controls it. However, the Supreme Court itself finds it most difficult to draw a line between intrastate and interestate trade in respect to division of control over trade and industry in the country between state and federal governments.</p>
   <p>The whole problem, in consequence of the decision passed by the Supreme Court, looks like a basic problem revolving around the principle of preservation of the rights of individual states, but at the same time, because of the absence of any clearly drawn line between the jurisdictions of the state and federal governments in the sphere of commerce and industry, the problem remains obscure and is not understood by the people.</p>
   <p>To the layman, it is incomprehensible why the federal government cannot stop unhealthy speculation, which undermines the confidence of depositors, and why it cannot put an end to exhaustive child labor at a time when grown-up men <pb facs="5423967_2_0786.jpg" n="3"/>cannot find any employment in industry or trade. The NRA organization, designed to control industry and wages and hours of labor, of course, had had quite a few enemies, but they did not belong to the progressive elements in present-day society. On the contrary, they belong to that class of people which, clinging to its reactionary thought, attempts to pull the country back to the crude ways of unrestricted individualism and egotism.</p>
   <p>It is quite natural that the decision of the Supreme Court on the unconstitutionality of the code authority has played into the hands of the reactionary forces, and they, posing as defenders of the Constitution and of the rights of individual states, have directed their hardest blows against the whole social policy of President Roosevelt, in the hope that their attacks will reduce to ruin the whole structure of the New Deal and make President Roosevelt's reelection for a second term quite impossible. As if to counteract this reactionary movement, another trend of an opposite nature is developing in the country. Progressive political groups and, particularly, the labor unions, realizing that abolition of the code authority will carry them back to the <pb facs="5423967_2_0787.jpg" n="4"/>conditions which did not satisfy them before, i.e., to poor pay, long hours of work, open shops, child labor in competition with union and unrestricted exploitation, look for ways and means to preserve the NRA organization and make it lawful.</p>
   <p>What the outcome will be of the fight between these two opposing camps it is difficult to foresee. It all will depend on which side can develop greater activity and thus sway public opinion to its side.</p>
   <p>In a democratic country, after all, public opinion is the decisive factor in any controversy on social matters.</p>
