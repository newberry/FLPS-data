   <p>On Sunday, February 3rd, at Kimball Hall, a concert of special interest to Russians, will be given by the Russian pianist, Vitaliy Schnee. The performance will begin at 3:30 in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vitaliy Iakovlevich Schnee graduated from the famous Conservatory of Petrograd, where he studied under the direction of the great Anna Nikolayevna Esipova, whose pupils also were: Sergey Prokofiev, Lev Pyshnov, Leonid Kreutzer, Alfred Mirovich, and other well known artists.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. I. Schnee gave several concerts in the city of Petrograd and other cities of Russia, until the World War interrupted his work in this field.</p>
   <p>In 1917, the German occupation of the city of Minsk, found him the director of the White-Russian Conservatory.</p>
   <p>There he again began giving concerts, and his performances in the entire Northwest territory earned the enthusiastic praises of critics.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_2_1131.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There after he traveled to Germany where, for over three years, he continued his concert career.</p>
   <p>Eventually Mr. Schnee arrived in the United States; settled in the city of Chicago, where he has lived for five years, and is becoming well known among the musical circles of America.</p>
   <p>His concert of the last year, in Chicago, as also his previous performances (arrangements for two pianos), were highly praised by the critics, and established his reputation in the musical society in the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schnee maintains two studios in Chicago, where he teaches piano. The recitals of his pupils also helped to establish his reputation as one of the finest teachers of music in the city of Chicago.</p>
