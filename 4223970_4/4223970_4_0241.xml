      <p>Among us Lithuanians, there have been many and various projects: how to uplift 
our nation and how to improve the life of our people. But one of the
most important problems among us is entirely forgotten, as though it had no
bearing on the problem of uplifting our nation. This is the question of
enlightenment, that is what our people are seeking. Everyone knows that
the progress of a nation comes from the enlightenment of her people. Every
nation that has educated people stands culturally higher than the nations
who do not possess such individuals. Regarding this problem, every Lithuanian
regardless of his political views, agrees--our nation must be uplifted culturally...
Very often we have heard rumors about the establishment of
Lithuanian schools, but they always remain talk.</p>
      <p>At this time I will not speak about the need of Lithuanian schools, I want to
<pb facs="4223970_4_0242.jpg" n="2"/>
speak about the poor Lithuanian students who are attending schools in
this country. You will find that many among us will say that we do
not care who goes to school..... with such an attitude toward our students,

we show that we have no respect for our nations..... We Lithuanians have a

very cold attitude toward our students.</p>
      <p>Although our Lithuanian students foresaw the cultural need of our nation,

they did not want to be lost among the other national groups; our students

have organized a society of their own, known as the Lithuanian Students

Association of America. By attending the American schools, they have found

out that if they do not organize among themselves, they will be lost in

the waves of Americanization. For this reason they are publishing the 

students' monthly journal, The Dream of Youth. In order to assure the 

existence of this journal, the students have established a fund, to raise 

money for the publication...

On September 7, the Lithuanian Students Association will have a banquet for

<pb facs="4223970_4_0243.jpg" n="3"/>
the benefit of their journal, The Dream of Youth. Now then--how many

Lithuanians will attend this banquet in order to help the poor

Lithuanian students to continue their publication of The Dream of Youth?

The future will answer.</p>
