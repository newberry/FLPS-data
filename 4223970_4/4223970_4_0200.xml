      <p>On Sunday, January 24, at 11 A.M., about fifty young Lithuanians from all
Lithuanian colonies in Chicago assembled at Ausra Hall in answer to a
recent call through the newspapers to the Lithuanian youth of Chicago
to become more strongly organized.</p>
      <p>The main points on the agenda were as follows: Make arrangements for a "get-acquainted" entertainment for the youth of Chicago, and elect an organizational 
committee for the purpose of forming a city-wide organization of the Lithuanian youth of Chicago.</p>
      <p>Mr. M. Petrauskas was elected chairman of the meeting. Mr. F. Motuzas
acted as secretary.</p>
      <p>After discussions a motion was made and seconded to hold "get-acquainted"
entertainment. An arrangement committee of five was elected to carry out the
motion.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0201.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>An organizational committee of three was elected to form a city-wide organization
of the youth of Chicago. The organizers will launch their organizational
campaign at the "get-acquainted" entertainment, which will be held during Lent.</p>
      <p>Apparently our young people are not satisfied with the small units of restricted
youth organizations, such as the Catholic Knights of Lithuania, which now exist
in Chicago. They are interested in an organization along non-partisan and non-religious
lines.</p>
