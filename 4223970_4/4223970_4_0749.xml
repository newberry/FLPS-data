      <p>Last Saturday a concert in the honor of and for the benefit of Joseph Sernas
[Adomaitis] was held in Milda Hall, 3140 South Halsted Street. A group of
the most talented Chicago Lithuanian musical and theatrical artists participated 
in the program.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sernas became popular as a writer and author many years ago, and had been
editor of the newspaper Lietuva (Lithuanian) for many years. He has been
forced to relinquish his duties as editor on account of failing health. Now
he is financially embarrassed, without shelter and means or support. The new
owners of Liotuva are sorry they cannot aid Mr. Sernas, at present, in any
other way except to sponsor this concert. He is in dire need of immediate
assistance.</p>
      <p>The literary committee of the Lovers or the Fatherland society has recommended
<pb facs="4223970_4_0750.jpg" n="2"/>
that all the literary works of Mr. Sernas be published and in that
way he would become financially independent for the rest of his life.
This recommendation has been made in view of the general belief that the literary 
career of Mr. Sernas has come to a close.</p>
