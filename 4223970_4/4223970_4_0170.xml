      <p>Who we are? Why, none other than the Marquette Club of the Lithuanian
Alliance of America, Chapter 260, from Marquette Park. The Marquette Club,
folks, in case you do not know, is the Junior Division of Chapter 260 in
the largest of Lithuanian organizations of America, namely, Susivienijamas
Lietuvin Amerikoj (Lithuanian Alliance of America).</p>
      <p>In this thriving new Lithuanian community, the younger Lithuanian folk have 
formed a club, the only requisite for membership being that you are of
Lithuanian parentage, so that we may perpetuate the language. The club meets
regularly on the first and third Thursdays of each month at Gage Park, and 
has entered its second year of existence. All sports are sponsored. The
baseball team, under the direction of Anthony Schnukas, has attained national
prominence, with a record of twelve games won and three lost for the 1929
season.</p>
      <p>Yet, as we look back, we find that accomplishments of the weaker sex come
<pb facs="4223970_4_0171.jpg" n="2"/>
vividly to the front, for our charming group of girls has been instrumental

in the success of our undertakings.</p>
      <p>One of the features of the Marquette Club is the maintenance of a news

column under the caption "Marquette Murmurs," which appears from time to time 

in the leading Lithuanian publications of the country. In this column a

section is devoted to local gossip, as described in our previous articles.</p>
