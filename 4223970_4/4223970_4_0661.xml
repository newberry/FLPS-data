      <p>The revolution in Russia aroused the revolutionary movement in Lithuania,
where our brothers are doing their best to free themselves from the
Russian yoke. In every corner of the United States, including Chicago,
the Lithuanian people are trying to help the revolutionary movement and
collect money for the revolutionary cause.</p>
      <p>The society Liberty has received many appeals from various committees,
asking for donations to the revolutionary movement in Lithuania. As there
are various disputes among the revolutionary committees as to whom and
where the money is to be sent, we, the members of the society Liberty,
held a meeting on February 4, 1906, at John Pauga hall, 675 S. Union
Avenue, to talk the situation over and to find the best way for all
people who are willing one way or another to help the revolutionary
movement in Lithuania. At this meeting, in order to satisfy the people,
we have decided that every society, organization, and club in Chicago,
should elect three members to represent their organization. All such


<pb facs="4223970_4_0662.jpg" n="2"/>

committees shall hold a meeting and make the best plans for collecting

money for the revolutionary movement in our fatherland.</p>
      <p>We, the Liberty Society, have elected for such a committee the three

following members: Anton Zimontas, Anton Radauskas, and Frank Golubiskas.

Our society is donating $50 for the revolutionary cause in Lithuania,

and later we shall donate more. We are asking all the Lithuanian organizations 
of Chicago to do likewise, to elect such committees as we have

done. Such societies, when they have elected their committees, should

notify the secretary of the Liberty Society, Anton Rudauskas, 3252 S. Morgan

St. He will call a meeting of these committees to enable them to express

their views and to decide the best ways to help our brothers in Lithuania

to overthrow the Russia yoke.</p>
