      <p>We see that among us there are Judas' hypocrites, the rulers of the
fatherland! Today when the Russian government is not successful in
its war with Japan, there are some degenerate hypocrites, betrayers
of the fatherland, who are praying and begging God to help Russia
against Japan. (We are) sorry that such Lithuanians know how to
speak the Lithuanian language; most of these Lithuanians belong to
the Polish Alliance and to the Lithuanian Roman-Catholic Alliance
of America. This Lithuanian Catholic Alliance is the lover of all
kinds of lies; that has been proved in the trial against the Lithuanian 
National Alliance of America.</p>
      <p>We of the fourteenth branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America,
have decided to nuke a protest against all the immoral demoralizers:</p>
      <p>Whereas, the Lithuanians have heard by now that the tsar, with his
ministers, told the Cossacks in 1893 to massacre Lithuanians and to
<pb facs="4223970_4_0718.jpg" n="2"/>
rape the young girls, when the Lithuanians desired to uphold their
church! If any Lithuanian is begging God to help the tsar, he is no
trace Lithuanian, neither is he a good Catholic!</p>
      <p>2. It must be remembered that the Russian hangman massacred and still

is massacring the Lithuanians. He is massacring the inhabitants of the

cities of Kishinev, Homel, Mogilev, Babruisk, Sluck and Piusk. The

Russian Cossacks forcibly pushed 4,000 poor Chinese into the Amur

River and drowned them!</p>
      <p>Lithuanian Men and Women.</p>
