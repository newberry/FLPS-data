      <p>In No. 15 of Lietuva, Mr. Mikolainis stated that Lithuanian students
seeking education should come to America to complete their education
in the American universities, because the educational courses in
American universities are on the same level as the European. Further, 
Mr. Mikolainis states that the Lithuanian students who were given
help after their graduation forget Lithuania. But what guarantee
can we get from students graduated in the American universities
that they also will not break away from activity among Lithuanians?
We have Dr. Sliupas and Dr. Bacevicia, who came from Europe as 
students, completed their education in America and now are very
active in behalf of Lithuanian national affairs. But what about
others? There are many Lithuanian doctors, lawyers, chemists,
<pb facs="4223970_4_0715.jpg" n="2"/>
engineers, pharmacists in America, and yet they do not participate
in Lithuanian national affairs.</p>
      <p>Many American students are attending the universities of Europe, in 
Paris, Berlin, Berna, Vienna, etc. Does the foreign education denationalize 
American students? It does not.</p>
      <p>The students of European universities are idealistic, while the 
students in America are egoistic, they have no ideals. Their highest 
hope is the dollar.</p>
      <p>It is much better for the Lithuanian students to complete their

education in European universities, because these students will

be more idealistic, while in America such students would become

businesslike professionals. The Lithuanians as a whole could get


<pb facs="4223970_4_0716.jpg" n="3"/>
no benefit from such professionals.</p>
      <p>Education in European universities is cheaper than in America. In

Europe, the university students can get jobs much easier, teaching

preparatory courses or teaching children to write essays. In America

such things are impossible, unknown. If we are in need of a professional 
class in America, such professionals could come from Europe to

America and make their abode here.</p>
      <p>To control marriage is impossibie. To say that when the Lithuanian
professional marries a. girl of another nationality it denationalizes

him, is not so. There are many Lithuanian professionals married to

girls of other nationalities, yet they are good Lithuanian patriots.</p>
