      <p>Vincent Miseika was born on July 20, 1870. He attended primary school
at Linkuva, Lithuania, and graduated from a six-year course in the Technical 
High School of Panevezis, Lithuania, completing his seventh year of
technical high school at Pinsk, Russia. Later, for one and a half years,
he attended the Institute of Technology of Riga, Latvia. He worked as
draughtsman for a year and a half in an army fort. For a year and a half
he was imprisoned in the Liepojus (Libau) jail as a political agitator of
the Social-Democratic party. In 1900 he came to Waterbury, Conn., where he
lived for about eighteen months.</p>
      <p>In 1902 he came to Chicago, where he worked in various factories.</p>
      <p>Through the recommendation of K. Gugis and A. Lalis, the Aurora Society gave
<pb facs="4223970_4_0743.jpg" n="2"/>
him financial help to attend school. He went to the University of Illinois,
where after six months he had a nervous breakdown and was forced to quit
the university. When he came back to Chicago he went back again to work in
the factories.</p>
      <p>When the Aurora Society was organized and its activity began on a larger

scale (the school and the library of Aurora were established in 1912), Mr.

Miseika became overseer and teacher of the school, in which position he

remained until 1922.</p>
      <p>When the Aurora's school and library were closed, he began to work for

Naujienos where he stayed for nine years. Later he went into the real

estate business, in which he is at present.</p>
      <p>He devoted most of his life to the progressive movement.</p>
