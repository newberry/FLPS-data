      <p>The Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnus, Lithuania has its museum and there
is no doubt but that later on, it will become the national museum of Lithuania.
The society is collecting various ethnographic objects and fabrics, which
reflect Lithuanian life, art and culture. The Lithuanian Science Society is
collecting all writings and books dealing with Lithuania and Lithuanians
for the archives and libraries. The Science Society hopes to place all the
collection in this museum which we are trying to establish in Vilnus, and we
have no doubt but that this museum will become the National House of Lithuanians. 
In this house there will be a section for the American Lithuanians
that will reflect their American culture. Therefore, I appeal to the American 
Lithuanians, who are sympathetic toward this project, to help establish
such a section in the Lithuanian National Museum of Vilnus. It is necessary
to obtain pictures of individual American Lithuanians, men and women, their
families, weddings, christenings, schools and students, the homes in which
<pb facs="4223970_4_0632.jpg" n="2"/>
they live, their stores, groceries, saloons, banks, offices, factories, churches,
convents, cemeteries, funerals, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is necessary to have photographs of the active Lithuanians,
the Lithuanian Alliance conventions, various societies and their branches,

the society charters, society emblems, and various medals, etc.</p>
      <p>All of you, if you have such pictures, and are willing to donate them to the

National Museum of Vilnus, please send them to the Lithuanian Alliance newspaper 
office, Levyne, 307 West 30th street, New York, N. Y.</p>
      <p>Dr. J. Basanavicius, representing the Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnus,

Lithuania.</p>
