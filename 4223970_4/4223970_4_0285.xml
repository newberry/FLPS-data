      <p>Statistics pertaining to Lithuanian emigration to America during the year of
1914 are published in the Tevyne (Fatherland), official organ of the Lithuanian
Alliance of America. The following is a part of the statistics which are of
interest to every Lithuanian:</p>
      <p>Lithuanian immigrants who arrived in America during the year of 1914 are
classified as follows: A total of 21,584 Lithuanians were admitted into the
United States. That number was composed of 12,282 males, and 9,302 females.
According to ages, 2,040 were less than fourteen; 19,059 between fourteen and
forty-four; and 485 above forty-four.</p>
      <p>The literacy of the above-mentioned immigrants is as follows: 707, of which
278 are males and 429 are females, can read but cannot write; 9,001, of which
4,389 are males and 4,612 are females, cannot read or write. Altogether
9,708 cannot write.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0286.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>The financial status of the immigrants is as follows: 1,056 brought at least
fifty dollars each; 15,249 brought less than fifty dollars each. The immigrants
were found to possess a total of $427,564 during the examinations at Ellis Island.
Non-immigrant Lithuanians brought a total of $37,565 into the United States

during the year of 1914. Lithuanian immigrants brought a total of $3,263,720

into the United States up to and including the year 1913. With the 1914 figure,

the total is $3,691,284. By adding to that total the sum of $37,565 which

non-immigrants brought in 1914 we find that from the year or 1899 up to and

including the year of 1914 Lithuanians brought a total of $3,728,849 into the

United States.</p>
      <p>The above statistics include only those immigrants who were officially

registered as Lithuanians. It is a well-known fact that many Lithuanian

immigrants were erroneously registered as Russians, Poles, and Germans.</p>
