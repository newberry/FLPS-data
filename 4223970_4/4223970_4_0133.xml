veteran friends, dared to demand what was coming to them - the bonus or
work. At this memorial meeting the idea was born of organizing a Lithuanian
legion branch. Most of the action was taken by J.M. Mickeliunas, and after a
few meetings, the Lithuanian branch legion was organized under the name, Stanley
Harris Post No. 271. This honor was given to Stanley Hurris becaue he was
the only American who was killed in Lithuania, when he was fighting there for
Lithuania's independence. In the beginning thirty-seven members joined this
new Lithuanian legion branch, and at the end of the year there were eighty-seven
members.</p>
      <p>When Darius and Girenas flew across the Atlantic to Lithuania, and when they
were killed in Germany's woods, not far from Lithuania, the Lithuanian legion
No. 271, arranged a great memorial meeting in their honor. At this commemoration 
it was decided, in honor of the lost friends to change the Lithuanian
legion's name to Darius-Girenas. With permission of the central authorities,

this was done.</p>

      <p>The Lithuanian-Darius-Girenas branch No. 271, for the last several years,

received the first prize for getting more members than any other legion branch;

at present they have about four hundred members.</p>
      <p>The Darius-Girenas Post devoted much time and energy to the raising of money

for the Darius-Girenas monument which was erected in Marquette Park. It also

helped the flight of Vaitkus across the Atlantic. Every year it participates

in the Memorial Day celebration at the Lithuanian National cemetery. It

participated in the Chicago World's Fair on July 4, and takes part in every

other important celebration or festival.</p>
      <p>In 1934 they organized a Lithuanian Women's Darius-Girenas Branch 271. At

present the branch has one hundred and fifty members. In 1935 they organized

the Sons of the Lithuanian Legionnaires. At present there are twenty-eight

members. In 1936, they organized a girl's branch, The Girl's Drum and Bugle Corps

of the American Legion Auxiliary Darius-Girenas Unit No. 271.</p>
