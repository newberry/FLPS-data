      <p>Chicago Lithuanians continue to donate generously for the relief of the
war-stricken people of Lithuania. All factions are arranging mass meetings 
for Stasys Simkus, the famous Lithuanian composer, who recently
arrived in America as representative of the War Relief Society of Lithuania 
to solicit donations to the Society.</p>
      <p>The following is a list of the latest mass meetings, with amounts collected,
that were arranged for Mr. Simkus by the National Fund (a war relief fund
set up by Lithuanian-American Catholics): Town-of-Lake district, Holy Cross
Parish Hall, June 25, $125.51; Melrose Park, June 26, $55.50; West Pullman,
SS. Peter and Paul Parish Hall, June 28, $33.81; and Roseland, Illinois,
All Saints Parish Hall, June 29, $56.26. The total collected at these 
four meetings is $251.08.</p>
      <p>The following two mass meetings for Mr. Simkus were arranged by the 
<pb facs="4223970_4_0571.jpg" n="2"/>
Naujienos (News) and the Lithuanian Assistance Fund (a war relief
fund set up by Lithuanian American Socialists): Cernauskas Hall,
1900 South Union Avenue, June 19, $47; and Juknis Hall, Cicero, June 26,
$24.12. A total of $71.12 was collected at these two meetings.</p>
      <p>The Roseland, Illinois, lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America

arranged a mass meeting for Mr. Simkus on June 18 at which $12.27 was

collected.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund of Chicago (a war relief fund

set up by Lithuanian-American Nationalists) arranged a meeting for Mr.

Simkus in the Englewood district in Baukas Hall, at which $28 was collected.</p>
      <p>A total of $204.97 was collected at four other mass meetings, as described

in the last issue of the Lietuva. (Lithuania).</p>
      <p>Although the mass meetings for Mr. Simkus are being arranged hurriedly and 



<pb facs="4223970_4_0572.jpg" n="3"/>
without much publicity, the attendance is unusually large. The

audience of each meeting listens attentively to Mr. Simkus as

he speaks and describes present conditions in Lithuania. His talk on the

hardships of our sisters and brothers in Lithuania leaves a deep impression

upon the audience.</p>
