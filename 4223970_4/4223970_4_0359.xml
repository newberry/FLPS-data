      <p>The 25th anniversary or the arrival in America of William Juodvirsis was
commemorated at a banquet on June 28th in the home of Miss Ona Kucinskas,
24 West 33rd Street, Chicago. Many relatives and friends attended. Among
those present were Peter Petruskevicius, William Vitkus, John Vitkus,
Anthony Juodvirsis, and Mrs. Vizinis, from Shenandoah, Pa.</p>
      <p>Historical records show that Lithuanians had started to emigrate to America
more than two hundred years ago. Simonas Daukantas, famous Lithuanian historian, 
states in his Lietuvos Istoria (History of Lithuania) that in 1688 
a group or Lithuanian pilgrims left Lithuania by way of Ryga, Latvia, and 
formed the first Lithuanian colony in America. They settled on Guadeloupe 
Island, which is a part of the West Indies, in the Caribbean Sea. This 
Lithuanian colony, which came to America in much the same manner and for
the same reasons as the pilgrims of the Mayflower, did not stay long on
Guadeloupe Island. About three years later they were dispersed by British

soldiers, who attempted to wrest control or the island from the French and
the colony moved to New York, which was then a small town, known as New
Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>The 200th anniversary of the founding of the first Lithuanian colony in
America was appropriately celebrated in 1888 by the Lithuanians of America

at Shenandoah, Pa.</p>
