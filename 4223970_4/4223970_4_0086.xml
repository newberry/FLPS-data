      </div>

    <body>
      <p>In the last number of Lietuva we announced that the Rev. Krawczunas,
with a few old women and some so-called singers, held the parish meeting
in the church in the name of the parish, and that the priest elected his
own committee and the committee says that the budget of the church is
sound and that all the money was spent by the priest for the benefit of
the parish.</p>
      <p>We have no doubt that the priest did spend all the parish money. Anyone 
could spend the money if we give him the full power, even without the
proof of the books giving the priest's accounting that all the money of
the parish was spent and the debt of $25,000 made. We were not questioning
whether the priest spent or kept the money; we are asking him what did he
spend the money for? For God's glory, or for his servant's benefit?</p>
      <p>Besides the lots, for which statements show $5,085 was paid, there
were no other debts and it could not have been, but the priest shows that
he had paid certain debt of $10,410.37; therefore, we begged the priest
<pb facs="4223970_4_0087.jpg" n="2"/>
to explain for what and for whom the debt was paid.</p>
      <p>To our request, neither the priest nor committee gave us the
right answer. The priest, in order to answer us, denounced us from the

pulpit; that the infidels are attacking him without justified cause and

that he was even shedding his tears. We did not ask the priest for his

tears; we demanded the accounting of how he had spent the people's

money. Did the money go for some other cause or for the purpose for

which it was donated by the people?</p>
      <p>The people, who donated their money for the church, now when they

are demanding the account of their money are called infidels by the

priest. That proves that the priest uses infidelity as his weapon to

close the lips of the people who are demanding the account of their

money and for what purpose the priest had spent it. We raised the question,

not about God, but about the money, but instead of answering the money

matter, the priest is sticking in God. Is money the God of the priest?</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0088.jpg" n="3"/>
      <p>We recognize God as God, as the Creator of all things, and we

believe that God does not demand any money. If the parish monies were

unsuitably spent, if the parish debt is kept in secret, for this we

are not accusing God, but we are accusing those who used the money for

their own selfish benefit, and who made the debts without the permission,

knowledge, or consent of the parishioners -- and for this the priest is

calling us infidels.</p>
      <p>Only such a person can say that who does not believe in God himself,

and who holds the dollar as his God.</p>
      <p>It was announced in our church during, the sermon that it was not fair

for the faithful to demand the account of the funds, which were donated

to God. It looks to us that such a sermon suits only medieval ages, but

is not for today. Today even the devotees are watching that their donations

to God be spent for God's glory, but not for the priest's private affairs.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0089.jpg" n="4"/>
      <p>The parishioners were endeavoring to get more specific explanation,

protests were made, and our Reverend even got sick on account of

this turmoil, and yet he would not surrender the budget. If somebody would

have tried to take the altar from the priest, really, the priest would

have not defended the altar so hard as he is defending the parish treasury

and the secrecy of the debt he had made. Now we see that the priest is

valuing money much higher than God. No wonder the priest calls the people

infidels, because they demand the priest give accounting of their donated

money.</p>
      <p>Let us take the honest account, how much money we would need for a
 
complete establishment of such a church property:</p>
      <table>
        <row>
          <cell>The twelve lots were bought for $600 each </cell>
          <cell>7,200</cell>

          <cell>

          <cell>30,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>

Grading, planting trees, fences. etc. </cell>
          <cell>2,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>

Total </cell>
          <cell>775,000</cell>
        </row>
      </table>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0090.jpg" n="5"/>
      <p>Now, someone will ask where to get that much money? The last statement 
shows that there are three thousand parishioners. If the priest

would have called the meeting and told the three thousand parishioners

what he needed the money for, then the parishioners would have assessed

themselves, ten dollars each member, and in three years they would have

had the fund of $90,000.</p>
      <p>For this amount of money our church of today would have been completed, 
the church yard fixed, the sidewalks layed of asphalt, and in

the treasury we would have $15,000 left for other necessities. There

would have been no debts, the priest would have been good, and we good

to the priest; there would have been no riots, neither the calumniators

nor the infidels. But what would the priest do if there have been no

debts? On what excuse would the priest have asked the people for more

money.</p>
      <p>The priests have established the serfdom for us, to pay $6 per head

a year, now then, you poor ignorant little fellows must pay, your children
<pb facs="4223970_4_0091.jpg" n="6"/>

and your children's children will pay, and there will he no end to the debt,

because the debt on the church will grow indefinitely. Is it not the same

way with the Poles?</p>
      <p>We have this situation because the priest holds the money higher than

God himself and the affairs of the parish, and for this reason only the

priest, with all his power, wants to control the parish treasury, and whoever 
is against the priest's scheme, the priest calls him an infidel. Today

we have seen the priest's statement of 1895:</p>
      <table>
        <row>
          <cell>Income of 1895 </cell>
          <cell>$16,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>

          <cell>34,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>

          <cell>15,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell> 
Total of three years' income is </cell>
          <cell>65,000</cell>
        </row>
      </table>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0092.jpg" n="7"/>
      <p>Now then, what has the priest done with those $65,000?</p>
      <table>
        <row>
          <cell>He has built the residence for </cell>
          <cell>$9,000 </cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>The church basement for </cell>
          <cell>18,000</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell>Total </cell>
          <cell>27,000</cell>
        </row>
      </table>
      <p>But at the same time the priest made the same amount of debt on the

church; now then, where did the people's money go to? We are not asking

for anything more than for an explanation of where the money went to?

Where was the money invested? Did the money go for God's glory, or for

the banquets for the priest's personal guests, or for the increase of

the prestige of the priest's name by increasing his savings account in

the bank?</p>
      <p>

When our societies, they are the founders of the parish, were trying 
to call the parish meeting, our rector, though he did not try to

stop the meeting directly, informed the delegates that if the societies

dared to raise the question about the parish budget, they would be
<pb facs="4223970_4_0093.jpg" n="8"/>

thrown out from the parish. Furthermore, he is threatening that if the

societies dared to ask him for a complete accounting, then he would force

the parish to pay the wages for the nuns he had brought to the Lithuanian

school, and the wages to his assistant, to whom, as the priest says, he

is paying the wages from his own pocket (or he may pay from the parish

budget because the budget is not under the control of the parish.)

The parish hired only one priest, Krawczunas, to fulfill the service

of the parish, and for such a service the parish pays him the wages. If

the priest cannot fulfill his duties, as he is traveling around in Chicago

and organizing new parishes, this also increases the priest's profit, then

he himself must pay the wages to his assistant who is staying at the parish,

when our priest is collecting for himself more money outside of his parish.

About those Polish nuns who do not know the Lithuanian language, we have

no benefit from them, and while the priest brought them from his own

accord, so there is no necessity for the parish to keep the nuns.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0094.jpg" n="9"/>
      <p>
At present the priest announced in the church that he wants to

collect more money from Lithuanians. For what does the priest need the

money now? For the upkeep of Polish nuns, or to pay the interest on

that secretly made mortgage? If the money is needed for the parish

necessities, then the parish meeting ought to be called and stated

what for the priest needs the money and how much, then the parish can

decide for what and how much money is needed; but not like up to the

present time, the money was collected from the people and nobody knows

what for the money was spent, and at the same time the debts of the

parish were increased fast.</p>
      <p>

Therefore, all the societies must call a general meeting and

elect their own collectors. Then those people who want their money under

control of the parish can donate their money to the collectors elected

by the parishioners. Even though the priest does not like such arrangement, 
the parish budget would be under the control of parishioners, and

there would be no necessity to beg the priest to give accounting of

parish money. Then our rector would have no right to invest the parish
<pb facs="4223970_4_0095.jpg" n="10"/>
 
money for his private gain. Do this without delay. It is necessary for

the parishioners to have unity among themselves, and to take the

parish under their own control. Then the rector will be for the parish,

but not the parish for the rector, as we have at present. Then the
disagreement between the priest and the parish will disappear, because

the priest will then take care of the church and the faithful, but not

of the financial matters. Then our rector will understand that he is

called here to be religious leader, but not a ruler and financier. Not


the nose for the snuffbox, but the snuffbox for the nose, as the saying

goes. Then the parish will not be for the priest, but the priest for

the parish.</p>
