      <p>The Socialists shout that all workers of all lands should unite in order
to repel capitalistic exploitation. That is an honest and true policy,
because an enemy can be defeated only with a united effort. However, the
workers of America appear to be opposed to that policy. American labor
organizations are the greatest enemies of immigrant workers. It appears
that only China surpasses America in hatred toward foreigners. This
hatred shown immigrant workers is mostly propagated by American labor
organizations.</p>
      <p>Probably, the greatest enemy of immigrant workers in America is Gompers,
president of the American Federation of Labor. He is working hand in hand
<pb facs="4223970_4_0335.jpg" n="2"/>
with American fanatics and chauvinists; he is the author of
all kinds of restrictions against immigration. Unity of all
workers cannot be accomplished by fostering hatred and prejudice
against immigrant workers. American industry, also, cannot get along without 
immigrant workers, because industrial progress is impossible without the
aid of the working class.</p>
      <p>The population of the United States is increased only by immigration. If

the borders are closed to immigrants, then America will probably find itself

in the same predicament as France, whose population has already ceased to grow.

American labor organizations are asking the Congress of the United States to

either stop or limit immigration. It is believed that such restrictions on

immigration would make it possible to maintain higher wages longer. This

being true, it would be possible to maintain higher wages, but only for a

short time. A restriction on immigration would produce a shortage of labor

and a curtailment of industrial operations; then employment opportunities 

would decrease and the high wages would tumble. However, American labor

<pb facs="4223970_4_0336.jpg" n="3"/>

organizations are concerned only with the wages of today;

they show very little concern for what is liable to happen

after a couple of decades.</p>
      <p>At the present time, many bills for the restriction of immigration are

being considered by the Congress of the United States. One of these bills

calls for such a passport system which does not exist even in despotic

countries, such as Russia and Turkey. It is not at all surprising,

therefore, that many protests are being made against these bills,

However, it is uncertain whether or not the protests will stop the

fanatics in the Congress and Senate from approving these bills. Most

of the enemies of immigrants are members of the Republican party, which

is now in power; a majority of the congressmen and senators are Republicans.</p>
      <p>A vigorous protest against all the immigration and alien restriction bills

has been made by the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce of New York.

Organizations of other nationalities are also planning to make protests.</p>
