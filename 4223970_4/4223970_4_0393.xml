      <p>Every Lithuanian should respect the real meaning and spelling of his Lithuanian
name. There is no reason why we should like to use the names of other nationalities.
The Lithuanian people are an old race and their language is an old
one, and everyone born of this race ought to be proud of this ancestry. Lithuanian 
language is not only the oldest language of the white race, but also is
the key language to the ancient civilization of the white race. The Lithuanian
language is the only language which has preserved its archaic forms of the old
Sanskrit. It has outlived in its original form all the languages of the world.
This has been proved by two great authorities, Parijanus Dwight and Joanus
Taylor.</p>
      <p>And every person should maintain a high respect by at least keeping his father's
name intact. The Italians, Germans, French and English carry on their father's
<pb facs="4223970_4_0394.jpg" n="2"/>
names and bear them with pride. Why should the Lithuanians hide
themselves beneath modified names?</p>
      <p>Many of us do not know that Lithuanian names are actually short though they
are written long, and involve Slavic, Polish and Russian elements. The true

Lithuanian names do not end in "sky," "ski," "vich," "wich," nor "vicius."

The genuine Lithuanian endings are "a" as in Kudirka; "tis," "ius," "us,"

"ys," "as." For instance, Sinkiewiz, to be truly Lithuanian should be

Sinkus. The name Ziliauskas Zilius, originally was either Zilaitis, Zilius

or Zilis. Likewise, the name Kaltavicius is Kaltaitis, Kaltas or Kalcius.</p>
      <p>All this shows that if our names were purely Lithuanian, they would be short

names, and we would not have to adopt new and insignificant ones, [thus] losing 
our Lithuanian identity. We should preserve our short, convenient Lithuanian 
names, and furthermore we would not be confused with Slavs, Poles or

<pb facs="4223970_4_0395.jpg" n="3"/>

Russians whenever one of our number comes to the front.</p>
      <p>Other races show a great tendency to have long unpronounceable names; let us

keep our simple Lithuanian names, and so help to uphold the once glorious

Lithuanian fame.</p>
