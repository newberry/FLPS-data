      <p>Far from her native shores, across 3,500 miles of the Atlantic
the newly rebuilt Lithuanica II is flying through the skies of
Lithuania, her goal of two years at last realized.</p>
      <p>Rebuilt after her spectacular crash in Ireland, this American
made plane is being flown by army fliers in Kaunas, the capital
city of Lithuania.</p>
      <p>The gasoline tanks, installed for the trans-Atlantic flight have
been replaced by comfortable seats. Her long, dreary nightmare on
that fateful night of October, 1935, now only a memory, the $40,000
Lithuanica has earned a fitting reward with service in the Lithuanian
army.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0377.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>The second flight was organized by Chicago Lithuanians to complete
the first flight which was started by Capt. Darius and Girenas.
The second attempted non-stop flight from New York to Kaunas was
made by Lieutenant Vaitkus of the United States Army, but he was
forced down in Ireland during a severe storm.</p>
