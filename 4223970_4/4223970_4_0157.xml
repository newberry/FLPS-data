      <p>p.6.....The importance of becoming a citizen of this country cannot be over-emphasized. 
There are still many Lithuanian mothers and fathers who have not
become a citizen of this country some because they have been too busy making
their living; others have wanted to become citizens but some one has told them
that unless they know the name of the ship on which they arrived they cannot
become citizens. Many have had no one to turn to for advice or assistance
in these matters. The lawyers have long been charging prohibitive fees for this
service, and now since the Federal Government has taken over all naturalization
matters and have taken out all the profit from this service by prohibiting any
one to charge more than a given sum it is harder than ever to find anyone
interested in the immigrant question.</p>
      <p>The law has been changed so many times that ordinary people have not been
able to keep up with the changes.</p>
