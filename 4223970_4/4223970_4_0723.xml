      <p>The late Mr. Sabonis brought forth the proposition that the Lithuanians,
at their birthday, instead of having drunken parties should remember
national affairs. In remembering this project I am donating my wages
for one day of one dollar, which should be divided as follows: 50 cents
for the martyrs and 50 cents for the writer Mr. Visztalis. My birthday
is on the 28th of August. If all would act likewise, or only those who
are reading the newspapers, a lot of money would be collected, and with
that money we could accomplish much for the national good. Donations
for national affairs would uplift us among the enlightened Americans.
Instead of celebrating our birthdays with drunkenness, why not donate
this money for a cultural cause? The Russian government in Lithuania
persecutes and exiles (people) to Siberia for trying to enlighten their
brother Lithuanians. Many such Lithuanian martyrs are suffering in the
prisons of Russia. These martyrs are starving. Is it not our duty to
help them? This could be done very easily if we would not waste our
money in drunkenness, as even with one tenth of the amount spent in
drunkenness we could get very great results.</p>
