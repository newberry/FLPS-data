      <p>Lithuania was not forgotten at the recent meeting of the St. Casimir Society
in the Lithuanian Parish Hall.</p>
      <p>A suggestion was made that the Society contribute to the fight to win independence 
for Lithuania. Several of the members were opposed to a donation from the 
treasury on the grounds that the Society did not have much money. "Let us be
glad we have enough to take care of our own affairs," they said.</p>
      <p>Then J. J. Palekas, the president, pointed out that the Society had two one-hundred-dollar 
Liberty bonds, and that it would be possible to donate at least 
one of them to Lithuania. The members were all willing, and unanimously voted
to contribute a hundred-dollar Liberty bond.</p>
      <p>The election of officers for 1919 was then held, and the following men were chosen:
J. J. Palekas, president; K. Albrektas, vice-president; K. Valkauskas, recording
<pb facs="4223970_4_0421.jpg" n="2"/>
secretary; T. Vaicis, financial secretary; and V. Klimas, treasurer.</p>
      <p>This society has been in existence for only five years, but thanks to efficient
leadership, it is growing. It is not to be outdone by other societies in causes
devoted to the fatherland.</p>
