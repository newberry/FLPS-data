      <p>p.5.. On February 16, Lithuania began her thirteenth year of independence. Once a
powerful nation, master of vast domians, Lithuania is today struggling to hold her
independence.</p>
      <p>For two centuries before the World War, Russia governed Lithuania and was a cruel and
severe lord, as was Poland. But it could not govern the spirit that burned within the
Lithuanians' loyal hearts.</p>
      <p>After that, the Germans laid waste Lithuania's farm lands. The World War did not help
to put things right.</p>
      <p>However, on February 16, 1918, in the historic capital of Vilna, the Independence of
Lithuania was declared. Even though independent in theory, Lithuania was still molested
first by Bolsheviks, then by the Poles. Finally, in October, 1919 a treaty was signed
by Poland and Lithuania regarding boundary lines. To no use, however, because
four weeks later Poland marched on Lithuania and occupied the capitol, Vilna, together
with the provinces of Grodna and Swalki. Poland, utterly forgetting her own plight
<pb facs="4223970_4_0397.jpg" n="2"/>
in the immediate past, from the very first day of her resurrection embarked upon a

policy of violence and oppression. Volumes have already been written on her depredations 
and transgressions against practically all her neighbours and her forcible

seizure of their territories. The cases of Vilnus, Eastern Galicia, the Polish
Corridor, etc., are known to all the world. Some of the din over these territorial

disputes has subsided during the past few years, but the strife over Vilnius, on the

contrary, seems to have acquired new vigor. Lithuania cannot forget Poland's

aggressiveness since 1919. The clouds that have darkened the political horizon of

Europe, have not weakened Lithuania's persistence in her rightful claims. She demands

Vilnius (Vilna) back from Poland. She refuses now, as fifteen years ago, to enter

into diplomatic or commercial relations with Poland, in spite of the fact that both

countries are full-pledged members of the League of Nations. "First, territorial

readjustment, than diplomatic and commercial relations," is Lithuania's reply to all

direct and indirect invitations to parleys.</p>
      <p>During the peace negotiations at Versailles of 1919, the Poles mystified the delegates

of the Allied and Associated Powers contending that the Lithuanians, Ukrainians, White

Russians and the people of Eastern Europe were eager to link their fate with the

reconstructed Poland. This contention was utterly false, but the Polish delegates
<pb facs="4223970_4_0398.jpg" n="3"/>

succeeded in inducing the allied statesmen to insert into the text of the Treaty of

Versailles several clauses, obscurely promising Lithuanians and the other national

minorities autonomous rights, in case they should be included in the Polish Republic.</p>
      <p>But the favorite Polish argument, which they particularly used at Marshal Foch's

headquarters, was that Poland needed Vilnius because, if given to Lithuania, it

would facilitate the Bolsheviks combining with Germany. The Polish argument was

reflected by the prominent American journalist, Frank H. Simonds, who wrote in 1921,

"If the Lithuanians get Vilna, a railway line will be opened between Germany and

Russia and the extension of German activity into Bolshevist Russia will be made

possible. If the Poles keep Vilna, the Germans and Bolshevists will be separated."

The numerous articles in the allied press of 1919-1925 in the same view prove that

the Polish contentions were taken seriously at the time. But how cynical they

appear now that Poland has concluded treaties of friendship with Soviet Russia and

Germany.</p>
      <p>In spite of all these abuses the Lithuanians kept up hope and courage. They are a

nation free and independent with Kaunas as their temporary capitol until they

regain their historic capitol, Vilna.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0399.jpg" n="4"/>
      <p>Lithuania's history is rather tragic, when we think of her former grandeur, but it

is also interesting and rich.</p>
