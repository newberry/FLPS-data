    <body>
      <p>This society was organized on November 5, 1936.</p>
      <p>The Circle's purpose: The purpose of this Circle is (1) to organize
the Lithuanian youth who were born in the United States, and before
the World War were bought to Lithuania by their parents and reared
there. After the war, when Lithuania got its independence, these
American-born Lithuanian youth came to America.</p>
      <p>(2) To become cultured, to spread enlightenment and culture amongst
themselves, to study the art of performing theatricals and to engage
in amusements and festivals, to read articles on social and current
problems, to improve the Lithuanian language among ourselves, and to
create good feeling among the Circle's members, to help each other
as much as conditions permit.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0153.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>(3) This Circle is independent of any political party, has nothing to
do with the political or religious views of its members.</p>
      <p>The initiation fee is $1; the monthly dues are 10 cents. It has about
60 members.</p>
      <p>President, A. Povilonis, 3204 Lituanica Avenue</p>
      <p>Secretary, A. Butkus, 3500 S. Union Avenue.</p>
