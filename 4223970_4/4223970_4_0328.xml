      <p>A conference which was attended by the representatives of sixteen nationalities 
was held at the Union League Club on May 8. Various methods of making
a successful protest against the Dillingham Bill, restricting immigrants,
were discussed. Many prominent Americans attended the conference. The
leader of the movement is the famed millionaire, A. A. McCormick. The Lithuanians 
were represented by Dr. A. L. Graiciunas, chairman of the Immigration 
Committee of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies' Alliance.</p>
      <p>It was decided to call a gigantic public mass meeting at the Auditorium
Theater on May 19, where the protest against the curbing of immigrants'
rights will be discussed. A committee comprising various nationalities was
chosen, headed by Mr. McCormick. It went to Mayor Harrison and asked him
to bring this matter before the City Council. The City Council has already
<pb facs="4223970_4_0329.jpg" n="2"/>
gone on record as favoring the protest resolution.</p>
      <p>The largest local commercial organizations, such as, the Association of
Commerce and the City Club, have promised to add their weight to the
protest.</p>
