      <p>On Sunday evening, April 23 (Easter Sunday), the Independent Youth Chorus
sponsored an evening of entertainment at Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and
Oakley Avenue. The event was a real youth affair as the audience and participants 
in the program were nearly all young Lithuanians, and the spirit
of youth prevailed throughout the evening. The main number on the program
was the presentation of a play entitled "Trys Mylimos" (Three Sweethearts).
Although all the players were amateurs, it may be truthfully stated that
they performed as good as (if not better than) certain patented [professional]
actors and actresses. Their acting kept the audience wide awake and in a
happy mood.</p>
      <p>Another interesting part of the program was a dialogue delivered by Mr. K.
Sirvinskas and Miss Davis. The program was concluded with a number of songs
by the Independent Youth Chorus.</p>
      <p>The program was followed by dancing. Everybody had a good time.</p>
