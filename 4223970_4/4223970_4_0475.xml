      <p>The local branch of the National Fund sponsored a mass meeting in the Immaculate 
Conception Parish Hall last Wednesday night, November 27.</p>
      <p>The Reverend F. Kemesis was invited to speak, but he had been called unexpectedly 
to New York; so other speakers had to be found.</p>
      <p>Disregarding party differences, the sponsors obtained the services of three
speakers. The first speaker was Ignas Sakalas, a member of the editorial
board of the Draugas. He sketched briefly the present situation of Lithuania,
and stressed the necessity of collecting donations for the cause of Lithuania's
independence.</p>
      <p>The second speaker was the Reverend Sarafinas. He made a deep impression on
his listeners when he sketched the present position of Lithuania, and the need
for donations to win total freedom and independence.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0476.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>Then followed the collection of donations.</p>
      <p>After the collection, the local pastor, Reverend A. Briska, announced the latest
news from Europe. The news was that a cabinet had been formed in Lithuania;
that the natives, armed with pitchforks and scythes, are stopping trains taking 
food out of Lithuania to Germany; that a Lithuanian army is being formed. From 
this news it is apparent, the speaker said, that Lithuania is beginning to
govern herself independently, and that we must donate, not cents or nickels, but 
dollars--tens and hundreds of them--to help her obtain absolute independence.

It will cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to participate in the peace conference, if we are permitted to do so.</p>
      <p>"For my part," he said, "I donate one hundred dollars now, and expect everybody 

here to donate according to his means."</p>
      <p>After such urging, the donations flowed again. Those who had donated a dollar

to the first collection, now increased their donations to five dollars, ten

dollars, and more.</p>
      <p>The Reverend A. Briska has set a good example for our other Lithuanian priests.

When a priest gives a generous donation his parishioners also do so.

Then followed a speech by J. I. Bagdziunas. He urged the listeners to donate

money to whichever fund they prefer, so long as they do donate. He said that

all of the funds have the same purpose: to obtain freedom for Lithuania. The

speaker also mentioned the necessity of unity; and urged that the Lithuanians

refrain from slandering each other and go forward hand in hand, for in unity

there is strength.</p>
      <p>The speaker pointed out that we have the best example of benefits gained by

unity from the war. Before America entered the war the French, English, and

Belgians fought separately, each seeking glory for themselves. But when the

Americans entered the war they saw the mistake and insisted that the Allies fight

in common under one command. They did so, and what happened? In a few months

of united action the Kaiser was totally defeated. Therefore, let us unite

and we will undoubtedly attain our ends.</p>
      <p>After one more speaker the meeting came to an end.</p>
      <p>The audience was not very large, only about 150 persons being present, but

$829.00 was collected.</p>
