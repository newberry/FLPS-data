      <p>The petition to be delivered to the ambassador of Japan in Washington, D. C.
praying that the Japanese government, when it took one-half of the Sackalin
Island from Russia, should not deliver to the Russian government its former
political prisoners, but let the Japanese government give free choice to the
political prisoners of former Russian government to go free if the said
prisoners so desired.</p>
      <p>I, with my friend, took the petition and went to Lithuanians to get their
signatures. I am sorry to say that many Lithuanians scolded, scored and
denounced us for getting the petition to free the former Russian political
prisoners, who at present are under the Japanese rule. Many of the Lithuanians
stated that these prisoners knew what they were doing; that they knew they
would be imprisoned for their activity against the Russian government's regime,
etc.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0692.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>Those Lithuanians who scolded us did not come to this country of their own
will or wish; for one reason or another they were forced to leave Lithuania.

If they had not come to America they would themselves be in Russian jails.</p>
