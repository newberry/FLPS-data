    <body>
      <p>The Commerce Department in Washington has published the 1910 census volume,
dealing with immigration and the nationality of immigrants.</p>
      <p>This census shows that in 1910 there were 211,255 Lithuanians. Of this number,
140,963 were born in Lithuania, and 70,725 were born in the United States.</p>
      <p>In general, the number of Lithuanians given above, is not true. Of course, it
is not the fault of the Census Bureau; it is the fault of the Lithuanians
themselves. If we are not mistaken, this is the first census in which the
Lithuanians had the rubric "Latvian". . . . .</p>
      <p>This census does not give the exact number of Lithuanians. We think there are
<pb facs="4223970_4_0324.jpg" n="2"/>
between four hundred and five hundred thousand Lithuanians in this
country. Another point is that the Lithuanians did not have their
rubric, they had the same rubric as the Latvians. The enumerators
knew nothing about Lithuanians; they recorded persons as Lithuanians only
when the Lithuanians demanded that this be done.</p>
      <p>There were many Lithuanians who stated that they were Russians, Germans, and
Poles, because they did not know any better..."</p>
      <p>We believe, that in the next census (1920), there will be more Lithuanians,
because the Lithuanians will understand the value of their nationalism, and
will demand that they be placed in the Lithuanian rubric.</p>
      <p>If the American-born Lithuanians become Americanized so rapidly, then what can

be said about the Russianized, Polonized and Germanized Lithuanians?

<pb facs="4223970_4_0325.jpg" n="3"/>

In reality, the Lithuanians are not Russianized, etc., but they themselves 
do not know what they are. Among such Lithuanians, many are

found who call themselves "Americans". If parents do not know what

they are, then what can you expect from their children?</p>
      <p>It is our duty to take into consideration the affairs of our younger generation,

so that the younger generation shall not disappear without leaving any benefits

to our nation. In order to keep them from denationalization, we must pay

attention to our children, the schools, etc.</p>
      <p>We must take care of not only our children, but also of those thousands of

Lithuanians who are coming to this country, so that they shall not fall into

the waves of Americanism. We find that the greatest cause of Americanization

is the public schools, and yet, we, the grown-up people, pay no attention to

those who are rapidly becoming denationalized.</p>
