      <p>We have received the following letter from the Lithuanian National Council:</p>
      <p>"In the name of a million Americans of Lithuanian descent, we wish to thank
you for your report of June 9, wherein you state that Lithuanians have requested 
American aid in their movement for national independence.</p>
      <p>"The problem of Lithuanian Independence is a vital problem for Jews and
Lithuanians alike. The existence of a large Jewish population in that country 
has created a mutuality of interests. Should Lithuania be swallowed by
Polish Imperialism, both nations, i.e. Jews and Lithuanians will suffer a
recurrence of Polish pogroms such as has been seen already in the territories 
occupied by Polish soldiers.</p>
      <p>"In Lithuania Jews have found  a friendly welcome ever since the thirteenth
<pb facs="4223970_4_0408.jpg" n="2"/>
century when Lithuanian kings invited the Jews to their
land. This friendly relationship between Jews and
Lithuanians exists to the present day. Witness the large number of Jews
who are members of the Provisional Lithuanian government. A special
Commission for Jewish cultural interests has already been formed as the
first step in advancing the program giving full National and Cultural Autonomy in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>"We tender our thanks to the Jewish Courier for its expression of sympathy
toward the movement for Lithuanian independence."</p>
