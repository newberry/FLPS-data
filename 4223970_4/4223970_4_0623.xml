      <p>Last week's lecture tour in Chicago and vicinity by our honored guests was
as successful as that of the previous week.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ycas was in Omaha, Nebraska, where he collected $100 for the Lithuanian
Science building in Vilnius [Vilna]. The St. Anthony Society of Omaha promised
to donate $100 from its budget. Also, the Omaha branch of the Lithuanian
Alliance of America will give a banquet on September 7 and the profit will
be donated to the Lithuanian Science building of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian students of Valparaiso University, even though they are poor,
collected $24.50 and donated it to Dr. Basanavicius when he delivered a
lecture to the North Side Chicago Lithuanian colony. In the hall, $77.40
more was collected.</p>

      <p>Last Saturday at Lapinskas hall in Melrose Park, lectures were given
by Dr. Basanavicius, and B. K. Balutis, editor of Lietuva. The collection 
was $58.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America arranged lectures for Dr. Basanavicius in
the Lithuanian district of Kensington, not far from Roseland, where he
collected $40.</p>
      <p>We have received a letter from the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of
America, Branch 123, Dorrisville, Illinois, containing a promise to donate

$25 to the Lithuanian Science building of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>Another letter was received from the St. Joseph Society of Toronto, Canada.

The Lithuanians there invite Dr. Basanavicius and Mr. Ycas to come there to

deliver lectures.</p>
      <p>We are glad to announce, that the president of the Lithuanian Alliance of

America, Pranas Zivatkauskas, has written an appeal to all three hundred

branches of the Lithuanian Alliance urging them to male contributions
