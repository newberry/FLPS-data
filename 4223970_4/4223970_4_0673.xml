      <p>Kensington. The local branch 74th of the Lithuanian Alliance of America,
on Dec. 30, 1905, held a concert for the benefit of the revolution in
Russia and Lithuania. To this concert were invited the Dr. Kudirka
Theatrical Singers Society from Chicago. Besides the songs, there were
speeches and declamations.</p>
      <p>The chairman, Dr. Algmanavicia, stated the purpose of this concert; then
asked the choir to come on the stage. The choir sang the Marseillaise.</p>
      <p>Mr. J. Jancauskas delivered a very energetic speech which showed how the
revolutionists are fighting for the cause of freedom and laying down
their lives for the destruction of despotism. The speaker said that we
cannot at present participate in the struggle for freedom, so we must
participate by donating our pennies. Then Mr. Gugis spoke. He urged that
<pb facs="4223970_4_0674.jpg" n="2"/>
the people join the struggle of the Russian people in order to help
as much as we can our brothers who are fighting for liberty. Mr. A.
Petraitis spoke about socialism. He explained very logically what

socialism is. Poems were read by Misses S. Laukiute, A. Laukiute, and

M. Kabasinskiute. Miss Kabasinskiute read the poem "Liberty." The

public was moved by this poem. Honor to the mothers for rearing such

girls.</p>
      <p>For the revolutionary cause in Russia was collected $19.70. The money

was sent to the Social-Democratic Party in Lithuania. Lithuanians of

Kensington vicinity, wake up and take the example of the Lithuanian

Alliance of America, Branch 74. Join in action to help our brothers

overthrow the despotism of the tsar.</p>
      <p>Down with the wrongdoers! Long live brotherly love! Long live socialism!</p>
      <p>The Guest.</p>
