    <body>
      <p>The old Dillingham-Burnett Bill against immigrants, which demands that
every immigrant know how to read and write, attempts to restrict immigration. 
This is the bill which was vetoed by President Taft, but has
been returned to Congress for further consideration.</p>
      <p>The American workers of the American Federation of Labor, and other
strong trade unions (as the Young Mechanics' League), have been working
for a restriction of immigration to the United States for a long time.
They argue that the untrained immigrants, especially those from the
Southern and Eastern parts of Europe, are scaling down the wages of
the American workers. For this reason they are trying their best to
stop immigration. The last time they almost succeeded. Congress passed
the bill, but thanks to President Taft, it was vetoed.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0321.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>Now, the bill has again been brought before Congress.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Foreign [Language] Newspaper League of Chicago, in order
to get a clearer conception of how the affairs of the bill stand, invited
Congressman [Adolph J. Sabath] of Illinois, to come to Chicago. He is
known as the greatest opponent of this bill.</p>
      <p>Congressman Sabath delivered a lecture about this bill at the La Salle

Hotel. He explained to the delegates of the foreign [language] newspapers

(among them were representatives of the newspapers Lietuva and Katalikas)

that the majority of congressmen are in favor of the bill, and in a few

weeks, Congress may again pass it.</p>
      <p>According to Sabath's statement, the American labor organizations, through

their delegates, are working hard, and with their influence are putting

pressure on the congressmen. Unless the foreigners of this country make

an energetic fight, the congressmen will be unable to resist the pressure

<pb facs="4223970_4_0322.jpg" n="3"/>

of these organizations and will have to pass the bill.</p>
      <p>The bill can be stopped, if without delay immigrants in every city will

call protest meetings, and will demand of their district congressman in

Washington, that he vote against the bill.</p>
      <p>This bill, as we previously mentioned, demands that every immigrant

pass an examination, and if he is unable to read and write in his own

language, he will not be permitted to enter the United States.</p>
      <p>Congressman Sabath said that he had introduced a bill countering the

Dillingham-Burnett Bill, but, according to his statement, he had little

support in Congress. The majority of congressmen have a tendency to

restrict immigration, in one way or another.</p>
