      <p>The enemies of freedom in America are preparing fetters for the poor,
especially for the foreigners, to whom we Lithuanians belong. The
arrival in America of Prince Henry of Prussia means only one thing:
to make an agreement with the United States government in order to
stop agitation among Lithuanians, Poles and other nationalities in
this country against the oppression of these nationalities by Russia
and Germany. Remember that these despots do not want to have enlightened
people. In Washington, D. C., already a bill has been introduced to
persecute those who are agitating against foreign nations. Do the
Lithuanians take notice of such a bill that will do us much damage?
I wish that the Lithuanians would not slumber on this matter, that
they would spread the news among Americans about the sufferings of
Lithuanians under the yoke of Russia. At present we have nothing better
than a small book in the English language, The Bestiality of the 
Russian Tsardom Toward Lithuania, in which I and the Rev. Zurba
<pb facs="4223970_4_0368.jpg" n="2"/>
presented the facts of the persecution of Lithuanianism. It seems to 
me that this book would do some good for the Lithuanians if the book 
would be distributed among the more prudent Americans. I wish that
every good Lithuanian would distribute that book by selling it or by
giving it free. The societies for this cause could do very much. I have
several thousand copies of this book, even though Mr. Oszewski did 
not print in his catalog the book's name. One copy of the book is
5 cents, while 100 copies are $2.50. Now is the proper time to spread
the book among the Americans.</p>

      <p>P.S. The money from the sale of the books I will give to the
Lithuanian Freethinkers Alliance.</p>
