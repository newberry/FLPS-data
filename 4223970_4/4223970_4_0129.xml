      <p>The prophecy of G. Wiastelianskas is fulfilled. He said that when there
were many priests among Lithuanians in America, then the exploitation of
Lithuanians would be in full swing.</p>
      <p>The priest wants to build a church as soon as there are few Lithuanians.
But when Lithuanians build their church, the priest assigns the church to a
bishop. So the bishop has the church and Lithuanians pay the debt and the
debt increases every year. The more go to church, the more they are duped. 
Lithuanians become slaves of the priest, live a miserable life, hope for no 
better life, except after death.</p>
      <p>We need no church, we need schools, education. The only way to give
education and culture to Lithuanians is through education. We need teachers to
teach natural science but not dogmas.</p>
      <p>Why do our priests not open schools? Why don't they educate the people?
The priest wants to exploit but not educate his people. When people are ignorant 
the priest exploits them and lives a dissolute life. The sooner the Lithuanian 
will convert churches into schools the sooner they will make progress
and will improve their own living conditions.</p>
