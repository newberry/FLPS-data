      <p>Monday, Jan. 19, In Kauno, Lithuania, workers' blood was shed when
Kauno sluggers sent bullets into the masses of working people.
To remember this bloody Monday a mass meeting will be held Sunday,
Feb. 22, at 2 P. M. All Chicago Lithuanian workers must be present.</p>
      <p>Following is the advertisement inserted in the same pager. Vilnis,
on February 20, 1925:</p>
      <p>Mournful mass meeting or Remembrance of Kaunas Workers Slaughter, Sunday,
Feb. 22, 1925, at M. Meldazis Hall., 2244 W. 23rd Place, at 1 P.M.
Speakers Comrades R. Mizara, V. Andriulis, H. Jagminas, and a little girl
from the "Budding Flower of Youth Society".</p>
      <p>Mournful songs will be sung by the Lithuanian choir. A funeral march will
be played by the International Workers' Orchestra. Other mournful melodies
will be played by the Lithuanian Workers Student's Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Comrades, workers, the heart breaking news has reached us. On January
<pb facs="4223970_4_0406.jpg" n="2"/>
19th the Lithuanian government shed workers' blood. On this day our rulers
slaughtered three workers and injured over 30. Mounted police have trampled
masses and cut them down with cattails; also people hidden in the churches
were not overlooked. And what for? Just because hungry people went to the

city hall to beg for a piece of bread. Instead of bread the self-elected

government fed them with lead bullets. Three are killed, thirty injured

and how many of the arrested will be sent to death?</p>
      <p>Comrades, workers, can we neglect the Lithuanian workers? Can we keep

quiet before this government of slaughterers? No! Let's gather all at

this mournful mass meeting and vigorously protest against this self-elected 
government.</p>
      <p>Invited by</p>
      <p>American Workers Party</p>
      <p>Lithuanian Section, 8th District.</p>
