      <p>Yesterday $55.40 was sent to Washington. The sum represented the donations 
made to the Lithuanian cause in the McCormick Club Hall on November
14, 1918, during the annual affair of the Our Lady of Vilna Parish.</p>
      <p>The guests had an enjoyable time dancing, chatting, etc. Six prizes were
raffled off. They were cash prizes of fifty dollars, twenty-five dollars,
ten dollars, seven dollars, five dollars and three dollars. The first
three prizes were donated to the parish by the winners. The fourth prize
was won by Mrs. Petrauskas, the fifth by Mrs. Grasilda Ciesunas, the sixth
by the parish.</p>
      <p>While the people were enjoying themselves, the cornetist sounded a call,
urging the gathering to come closer to the stage. Then Mr. John Bagdziunas
asked the audience to be kind enough to listen to his message. In his
<pb facs="4223970_4_0463.jpg" n="2"/>
speech he sketched the present plight of Lithuania and urged those present
to donate as much as possible for the cause of Lithuania's liberty.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that money is needed by the Funds at the present time.</p>
      <p>The following donations were received: [Editor's note: There follows a
long list of contributors]</p>
      <p>Sixteen dollars were collected in smaller donations, making a total of

$55.50. This sum was sent by Mr. Bagdziunzus to the Executive Committee of

the Lithuanian Councils in Washington, D. C.</p>
