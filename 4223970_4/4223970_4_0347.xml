</title></bibl>

      <p>The Lithuanian organizations in the Bridgeport Chicago Lithuanian
colony commemorated the 40th anniversary of the Lithuanian mass
immigration to America, on October 10, at St. George's Hall,
52nd Place and Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue. The program was
unusually long; it started at 5:00 P. M., and continued until 9:00 P. M.
The admission price was fifteen cents. The hall was filled to capacity.</p>
      <p>The main speakers were: Reverend Kraucunas, Mr. Marcinkevicius, Mr. Balutis,
Attorney Bradchulis, Mr. Dambrauskas, and Mr. Mazeika.</p>
      <p>The audience was entertained with music and recitations during the intermission 
periods, between speakers. Recitations were delivered by Miss
Horodecka, Miss Sinus, Miss Nevardauskas, and Miss Miknis. A piano solo
was played by John Bijanskas, Junior; a duet was sung by Mr. Janusauskas
and Miss Jaksevicius. The St. George's Parish church choir sang five songs.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0348.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>Mr. Balutis read a letter from Reverend Zilinskas, famous statistician,
who was the first to suggest the celebration of the 40th anniversary of
Lithuanian mass immigration to America. The following interesting information 
was gathered from that letter:</p>
      <p>The first Lithuanians who came to the United States during the mass immigration 
period settled in the state of Pennsylvania, in the coal mining regions.

People from the whole world were emigrating to America for more than a

hundred years before the year of 1869. Lithuanian emigration was delayed

by the feudal system in Lithuania, when all the common people were the

personal property of the feudal lords; many Lithuanians made repeated attempts

to emigrate, but were nearly always captured, returned to their masters,

and severely punished. However, at that time, slavery existed in America

also. When Lincoln abolished slavery there was a shortage of workers in

the United States; for that reason efforts were made through agents to


<pb facs="4223970_4_0349.jpg" n="3"/>
import workers from other countries. Therefore, after the abolition of 

serfdom in Lithuania and slavery in America, Lithuanian mass emigration
to America started in 1868 and 1869.</p>
      <p>(According to Simanas Daukantas, famous Lithuanian historian, and the

Lithuanian Encyclopedia, a large group of Lithuanians, led by the Latvian

prince, Jokubas Ketleris, emigrated to New York by way of the Guadeloupe

and Tobago Islands in the year of 1691 and formed a colony, which they

named Ausra--Dawn, near the Hudson river.)</p>
      <p>The first Lithuanian immigrants in the United States were persecuted a

great deal; it was much harder for them to settle here than it is for

present-day immigrants. When the number of Lithuanian immigrants increased,

a strong hatred developed against the Poles, who attempted to dominate the

the Lithuanians; as a result, Lithuanian Americans completely severed all

relations and contact with Polish Americans. At present, it is estimated

that there are from 250,000 to 300,000 Lithuanians in the United States.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0350.jpg" n="4"/>
      <p>The position of the Lithuanians in the United States is much lower than

that of the English, Germans, and Jews, who control all the industrial

and commercial institutions of the country. Nearly all Lithuanians are

servants of people of the above mentioned nationalities; their position

is nearly the same as that of the former negro slaves.</p>
      <p>The number of the Lithuanian-American intelligentsia is so small that they

can be counted on one's fingers; and there are probably only two women

members of the Lithuanian-American intelligentsia. It appears that our

people are not anxious to assist their children to lead better lives; they

are saying: "I work hard, let my children work also." However, our young

people thirst for an education--that is proven by Valparaiso University,

Valparaiso, Indiana, where, in a comparatively short time the number of

Lithuanian students has risen to one hundred and fifty.</p>
      <p>Mr. Balutis spoke about the great value of time and about the progress of

mankind. He made many interesting comparisons. People formerly worshipped


<pb facs="4223970_4_0351.jpg" n="5"/>

lightning as a god, to which even human sacrifices were made; but today

we have harnessed and hitched that very same lightning to a wagon, and

also employ it for lighting and heating purposes. Formerly, the Queen

of Sheba traveled to Solomon on a camel, but today people are not very

anxious to ride even in streetcars; we ride in automobiles and fly in

airplanes. We have been endowed with all these improvements by time,

which is more valuable than gold and diamonds; it is impossible to bring

back wasted time even with all the gold and diamonds in the world. Therefore, 
when we waste time, we waste the most valuable thing in our lives.</p>
      <p>Let us reflect and ascertain what good we have accomplished during the

past forty years of our life in America; by doing so we can learn how to

make better use of our time in the future for the glory and welfare of

our people. Instead of thinking about the social affairs that are

scheduled to take place next week, let us think about what we did during

the past week. Time offers the greatest opportunities in our lives; it

pays big dividends to those who take full advantage of it. If we waste

the time of our lives than let us not complain if we continue to remain


<pb facs="4223970_4_0352.jpg" n="6"/>

at a miserably low financial and intellectual level. If we spend our time 
in saloons, instead of studying and reading books, than we are certain to

perish as a distinct national group; unless we strive to improve our position, 
our second generation will become "Anglo-Saxonized."</p>
      <p>What have we accomplished so far? Thanks to the efforts of our leaders

of the past forty years, we are now conscious of the fact that we are

Lithuanians, a distinct national group; prior to that time we were crows

embellished with foreign feathers. We must continue to progress, because

we have covered only half the distance of the road to equality with the

progress of other nationalities. Our parents must strive to send their

children through the higher institutions of learning. A father who sends

his son to work in a factory, before he completes his education is a thief

and a criminal, because he is robbing his children of their good fortune.

It is of utmost importance for us to have not only good schools, but also

good textbooks.</p>
      <p>After Mr. Balutis' talk, a collection was made to form a fund for the



<pb facs="4223970_4_0353.jpg" n="7"/>

publication of school textbooks in the Lithuanian language. Thanks to 

the efforts of Mr. Balutis the collection netted a total of $74.75. It 

is estimated that at least $150, the net proceeds of this affair, will

go to the textbook publication fund.</p>
      <p>Mr. Balutis' address was very successful and fruitful; such a splendid

oration is bound to remain in the memories of the people for a long time.</p>
      <p>Attorney F. P. Bradchulis, one of the oldest Lithuanian residents of Chicago,

spoke about the Lithuanians of Chicago. The following interesting information 
has been gathered from his talk:</p>
      <p>In the year of 1884 there were altogether eighteen Lithuanians living in the

Chicago area. The first Lithuanian organization in Chicago, the Varpas

(Bell) Society, was formed in 1886. The most active Chicago Lithuanian

leaders at that time were: Joseph Grinius (publisher and editor of the

first Chicago Lithuanian newspaper, the Zelmuo-Sprout, which was printed in

1886), John Varanka, Mr. Spokas, and Mr. Novackas. All these men are now


<pb facs="4223970_4_0354.jpg" n="8"/>

deceased. Later, the St. Casimir Society was organized; still later,

the Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania Society, non-Catholic, was formed.</p>
      <p>On account of obstructionist tactics of the Poles the Lithuanian Roman

Catholics of Chicago tried for eight years before they finally received a

Lithuanian priest from the local bishop. The Poles tried with all their

power, including the use of shameful tactics, to dominate and Polonize

the Chicago Lithuanians. The Poles formed an organization of traitorous

and Polonized Lithuanians, the Unia Lubelska (Union of Lublin) Society,

which is still in existence.</p>
      <p>(According to documentary evidence, located in the files of the Chicago

Evening American, the first Lithuanian family, the Baltramaitis family,

came to Chicago in a covered wagon in 1823.)
</p>
      <p>Mr. Bradchulis pointed out in his talk that Chicago is the largest "Lithuanian

city" in the world. He also spoke about the dire consequences that result


<pb facs="4223970_4_0355.jpg" n="9"/>

from holding our meetings in saloon halls--he urged the use of the hall

in the Lithuanian Community Center. He stated that there are good and

bad features about emigration. He estimated that at least ten per cent 

of the children of the 300,000 Lithuanian-Americans will become denationalized. 
Therefore, we must strive as much as possible to uphold Lithuanianism 
in America; whether or not we shall continue to exist as a distinct

national group largely depends upon how we rear our children.
</p>
      <p>One of the participants in the musical program of the evening was John

Bijanskas, Junior. Although only fourteen years of age, he has displayed

great talent and ability in playing difficult piano compositions, such as

"Suppes Ouvertura," "Poetas Ir Kaimietis" (The Poet and the Peasant).
