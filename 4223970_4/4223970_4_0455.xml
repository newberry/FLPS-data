      <p>The St. George Parish made much noise about collecting donations [to the cause
of Lithuania's Independence]. Such enthusiasm is a good thing, but why must
the nationalists be slurred at the same time?</p>
      <p>That is what happened at the mass meeting held for the National Fund. The 
local pastor, Reverend M. L. Krusas, advised the audience to donate to no
fund but the National Fund, which is dominated by the Catholic Church.</p>
      <p>In his speech Reverend Krusas said "It does not pay to donate to other funds; 
donate only to the 'Catholic' National Fund.</p>
      <p>"Some kind of solicitors", he continued, "are going from house to house,
giving some kind of receipts [for the donations they received]. Do not give
to them for they who do not go to church do not love their fatherland."
(Editor's note: The priest was referring to the solicitors for the
<pb facs="4223970_4_0456.jpg" n="2"/>
Lithuanian Independence Fund, who give special receipts for the donations
they receive.)</p>
      <p>He then added: "We could easily collect ten thousand dollars, but we feel
sorry for the good Catholics because their hearts could burst, but the Nationalists 
would only go mad with anger."</p>
      <p>(Editor' s note: They would not go mad with anger, but would rejoice, if you
should donate to the cause of the fatherland through the Lithuanian Independence 
Fund]. It seems that the people who discourage other people from donating 
to the Lithuanian cause through any Fund other than the National [Catholic]

Fund are mad.)</p>
      <p>One individual promised to donate five hundred dollars. Others donated generously; 
for instance, Council 16 of the Knights of Lithuania, which has only

twenty-five members, donated $614; St. Ann's Society donated $231; the local

lodge of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance donated $100; Reverend Krusas

donated $100 and promised $100 more; P. Daugela and P. Budreckis

donated $100 each.</p>
