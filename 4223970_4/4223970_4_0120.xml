      <p>Until three years ago there were few Lithuanians in Chicago. A few years ago 
the Society of Saint Casimir the Prince was organized. This society took
care of its members only and paid no attention to other Lithuanians in Chicago.</p>
      <p>When I saw that Lithuanians died without confession, I decided to get a Lithuanian priest.
    At first <gap unit="words" extent="5"/> decided to call a Lithuanian mass meeting. <gap unit="lines" extent="3"/> petition, and elected a committee <gap unit="lines" extent="1"/>
Lithuanian priest.</p>
      <p>But when the Society of Saint Casimir heard about our meeting it got mad at us, 
and called a meeting in Bridgeport. <gap unit="lines" extent="2"/>
<pb facs="4223970_4_0121.jpg" n="2"/>
also made a collection. They had no appointed treasurer, so the deposited money
with the Polish priest. <gap unit="lines" extent="2"/> build a church for Lithuanians somewhere in the wilderness
out of Chicago.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanians soon found out who were the swindlers <gap unit="lines" extent="2"/> twelve lots for the church.</p>
      <p>Then two weeks later <gap unit="lines" extent="9"/></p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0122.jpg" n="3"/>
      <p>At first A. Naweckas and Lukoszewicius made a protest against the priest, 
then Dzialtiewa proved to the people the bad deeds of the clergy, and cited
such priests like fathers Wargyris, Juadiszius, Lenkawiczius and others.</p>
      <p>It was said that in all good parishes neither bishop nor priest controls
the parish treasury, but the parish committee. The people approved and
elected a committee of twelve members. This newly elected committee went to
the priest. The priest was against this committee, but when the priest saw
that he could do nothing he agreed that the elected committee have full rights
to collect money.</p>
      <p>There was a commotion among parishioners when they found out that the
priest assigned four of the twelve church lots for himself. Then the parishioners 
made a protest against the priest for grasping those lots. Priest Kolesinski 
got mad and said: "Everything is going to the devil."</p>
      <p>On Sunday in the church, the priest was hollering: "I do not need any committee, 
I have my own committee of four. I myself will pay wages to them."</p>
      <p>Of course, our priest does not care for prudent people. He has his committee 
of four Polanized Lithuanians who can sign their names only by a cross
<pb facs="4223970_4_0123.jpg" n="4"/>
mark. Brothers, we the committee of thirteen are elected by parishioners and
only by them we can be thrown out. We do not need such a priest.</p>
      <p>Here is a man lieing on a deathbed, calling for a priest, but the priest
says, "Let him die like a beast, because he did not give money for me." And
that man died without a priest! Did our Lord teach that way, did He preach
His mission for money, did God tell him to do that? The priest must be priest.

Did St. Francis the Silesian act like that? He went to India, and in five

months he built seven hundred churches, converted thousands into Catholicism,

but our priest is afraid to build even one church. Our priest wants to fill

up his pockets with money, like he has done in Pittston, Pennsylvania. The

priest even tore the pages from a book where the names of donators are

written. When the priest is contemptuous of the committee, he is also contemptuous 
of all the parish.</p>
      <p>Brothers, read Lietuva, you will convince yourselves of the priest's manners</p>
      <p>Committee of the parish: Armonas; A. Newackas, J. Polakas,
F. Janbacziawiczia, J. Twerionas, A. Kasparas, K. Lukoszius,

P. Wodminas, N. Peza, D. Nemunis, J. Kazlauckas, sec.; J.

Piatkus, N. Urbonas, J. Dzialtiva.</p>
