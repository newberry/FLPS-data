      <p>At a meeting of several Lithuanian societies, held at Milda Hall, it was 
decided to send the following resolution to President Woodrow Wilson:</p>
      <p>"Whereas, our President, Woodrow Wilson, on January 8, 1918, restated to the
world the American war aims and terms of peace, and</p>
      <p>"Whereas, The terms so announced expressed the highest aims and principles of
democracy and justice, and</p>
      <p>"Whereas, No mention was made as to the future of Lithuania among the
various oppressed nationalities which should be given freedom and independence,
and</p>
      <p>"Whereas, The Lithuanian nationalities have struggled and fought for freedom
and independence since their partition between Germany and Russia, and
"Whereas, The Lithuanians, being neither Slavs nor Teutons, have been compelled
<pb facs="4223970_4_0539.jpg" n="2"/>
for centuries to fight against the aggression of both these races, and</p>
      <p>"Whereas, Upon the declaration of war by the United States. against Germany,
our sons have in great numbers volunteered for service in the Allied armies,
and are fighting for the freedom of oppressed nationalities and for the
principles of democracy as expressed by our President; therefore, be it</p>
      <p>"Resolved, That we beseech our President officially to recognize the Lithuanian

national movement and give to Lithuania the same consideration accorded the

nationalities of Belgium, Serbia, and Poland, and the various oppressed races

in Asia, and to include Lithuanian delegates in any peace conference to be

held after the war.'"</p>
      <p>[Translator's note: The resolution appears in English.]</p>
