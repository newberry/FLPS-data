      <p>Joseph Gurinskas came to Chicago May 15, 1885; started to work at a tailor
shop; worked through the winter making $3 per week. Later when he learned
the tailors' trade he continued to advance in efficiency. He has now worked
in the trade for 29 years.</p>
      <p>When in 1886 the St. Casimir the King Society was organized, Joseph Gurinskas
was made treasurer and held the position for 14 years. He also devoted much
time and effort in organizing the St. George's parish.</p>
      <p>Joseph Gurinskas was a member of a building and loan association of another
nationality. When he saw what benefit such a financial organization gives
the people, he started a similar organization for Lithuanians. On March 25,
1897, the Keistutis Building and Loan Association was organized. He is still
a member of this financial association.</p>
      <pb facs="4223970_4_0747.jpg" n="2"/>
      <p>As Joseph Gurinskas was always active, he attended a meeting of the Polish
organization Lubelska Unija. At this meeting the Poles were trying in a
"brotherly" way to take control of Lithuanians, but the Lithuanians saw at
once the selfish aim and the falsity of the "brotherly" love which Poles

professed toward the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians demonstratively left

the meeting.</p>
      <p>Joseph Gurinskas married Miss Ona Zemeliute, Feb. 16, 1885. At present he

is 73 years of age and resides at 3347 Lithuanica Avenue.</p>
