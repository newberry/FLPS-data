      <p>A mass meeting for the purpose of collecting funds for Lithuania's independence 
was held recently in St. Michael's Parish Hall on the North Side. The
speakers were Reverend Miksis, who came from Siberia not long ago, and Attorney
V. Rutkauskas.</p>
      <p>Reverend Miksis revealed the barriers which Lithuania must overcome before it 
can gain its independence. He urged the people to be generous with their
donations for Lithuania's cause.</p>
      <p>While Reverend Miksis was speaking, someone in the audience began to heckle
him, obviously desiring to create a disturbance. But he was not successful; 
instead, he was forced to get out of the hall. A considerable number of
people led him to the door. It is unfortunate that some people attend mass
meetings, not to listen, but to provoke disturbances.</p>
      <p>A total of $103 was collected at the meeting.</p>
