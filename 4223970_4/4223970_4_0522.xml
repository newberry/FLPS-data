      <p>Four Lithuanian societies in Englewood created a Branch to Aid Lithuania
some time ago. How many hundred dollars they have raised to help Lithuania,
the Lietuva has reported previously. This small Lithuanian colony has
taken an important place in Lithuania's service and, undoubtedly, when
Lithuania takes stock of her benefactors in the future, much gratitude will
be due to this colony because of its great effort to aid Lithuania during
her greatest misfortune.</p>
      <p>Now again this Branch to Aid Lithuania has donated eighty dollars to the cause
of Lithuania's liberty. This sum has been received by the Lietuva, and will
be sent to the Lithuanian Independence Fund. If all the Lithuanian colonies
were as active, half of Lithuania's tears would be wiped away, and the prospect
or Lithuania's independence would be twice as strong as it is now.</p>
