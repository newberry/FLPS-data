      <p>It seems to me explanation is unnecessary as to the struggle for freedom 
in Lithuania. Our brothers are shedding blood and offering their lives
for the cause of liberty in Lithuania, in order to free our fatherland
from the yoke of the tsar. The people everywhere are collecting money
for the revolutionary movement in Russia. Take the Jews, they have no
territory of their own, no fatherland in Russia, and yet they have
collected over a million dollars in the United States in order to help
the revolution in Russia. Now then, how much have we Lithuanians contributed 
and collected in Chicago for the cause of the revolution in
Lithuania? I am ashamed to say that the Lithuanians of Chicago have
contributed only $500 and yet in Chicago there are over 30,000 Lithuanians.</p>
      <p>Why have we donated such a small amount? Because our brains are controlled
by the saloon keepers and the priests. The Lithuanians are spending their
last penny for drinks in saloons. When they go to church, the priest, before
<pb facs="4223970_4_0660.jpg" n="2"/>
the collections, tells them that they should not drop pennies in his
collecting plate and in a very short time the plate is filled with silver
dimes and quarters.</p>
      <p>Let us organize ourselves and help our brothers in our fatherland to

fight for freedom. After freedom is won we will find God and Socialism.</p>
      <p>Chicagoan.</p>
