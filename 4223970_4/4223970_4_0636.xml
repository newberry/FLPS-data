      <p>This Saturday a prominent guest will come to Chicago. He  is Mr. J. Vanagaitis
from Prussian Lithuania. He is a well-known editor and publisher of the
newspapers, Birute and Allgemeine Litausche Rundschau. These newspapers
are very important for the revival of Lithiuanian nationalism in Prussia.
These newspapers are the sparks of inspiration for the denationalized
Lithuanians in Prussia. These newspapers are taking dangerous chances,
as is the Lithuanian newspaper Aurora--Ausra in Russian Lithuania.
There is no question that he must be supported because of his high ideals.
Mr. J. Vanagaitis will acquaint us with the Lithuanian national movement
in Prussia, and for that purpose he came to this country and to Chicago--
to get subscriptions for his newspapers. We wish the best of success for
him. Whoever wants to help him revive Lithuanianism in Prussia, may subscribe 
to his newspaper Birute.</p>
