      <p>Who said we have no spirit? No feeling for our ancestral country?
Young folks of Lithuanian descent lately have been showing more and
more concern for the Lithuanian future and more interest in Lithuanian
group activity.</p>
      <p>For some time now, Direct Echoes has been attempting to bring the
various Lithuanian young people's clubs closer together with the hope
that in friendly and unified attempts these clubs could eventually
accomplish worthwhile results.</p>
      <p>The recent "Get-together," sponsored by Direct Echoes, of representatives
from a number of Lithuanian young people's clubs in Chicago, proved that
there was a great and sincere desire among all to do something to boost
<pb facs="4223970_4_0164.jpg" n="2"/>
the Lithuanian name in America, to do something of great
benefit in bettering the Lithuanian situation.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian young folks are not only desirous of doing things, but
they actually do them. Several clubs, including the Marquette,
Universal, and Burnside branches of the Lithuanian Alliance of America,

and the Golden Stars, have all agreed to contribute the profits of

their dances to a general fund to secure a club-house where the

Lithuanian young people could enjoy themselves in gymnasium, library,

art room, or dance hall.</p>
      <p>Hurrah! "It is enthusiastic and determined beginnings like this that

will make bigger and better things possible.</p>
      <p>Direct Echoes is most sincere in wishing success for the above movement

<pb facs="4223970_4_0165.jpg" n="3"/>
and certainly hopes that other clubs will turn their

efforts toward some serious purpose. Indeed, why can't
the Lithuanians do the many things that other groups

are doing?</p>
