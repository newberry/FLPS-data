      <p>A few years ago Dr. V. Kudirka, who was sick with tuberculosis, appealed
to the American Lithuanians for financial help, so he could live his last
days free from starvation. In three years we have collected only $41.
Even in regard to this small amount of money we have had argument with the
newspaper Kardas (The Sword), whether to give him the money or not. Kardas
objected to giving it to that sick man, Dr. Kudirka. There have been
more arguments and insults to that writer than the amount of money collected.
Dr. Kudirka was left and forgotten in the claws of death, but when he
died we organized societies in his name. He died neglected by his brothers
and on his dying bed he knew that his work to uplift the ignorant
Lithuanians was in vain.</p>
      <p>Now we have another similar case. Another writer of ours appealed to
his brother Lithuanians in America. He is very sick and needs help without
delay. He must go to a foreign hospital to become cured. His appeal was
published in Lietuva. Other newspapers did not publish his appeal. They

ignored him. The readers of Lietuva donated $23. With such an amount of


<pb facs="4223970_4_0648.jpg" n="2"/>

money our writer will not get fat. Among the friends in Chicago we have

collected more. But to go to a foreign hospital with this amount is

impossible; in one place the sum of $7 was collected, but they refused

to give the money, saying that if the writer is not a Socialist, they

will hold the money. One of them wrote to us and stated that if that

writer is a Socialist he will give from his own pocket $30. I gave the

answer they sent to us the $7, but no $30 was ever received.</p>
      <p>The writers among Lithuanians are good as long as they work without any

remuneration, but when they get sick, they are good for nothing. When

they die we make than national heroes, benefactors, etc.</p>
      <p>It must be mentioned that during the last years Dr. V. Kudirka got more

help from Poles than from Lithuanians, even though he had not contributed 
literary work to Poles. He also received help from the Lithuanian

clergy, although Dr. Kudirka wrote nothing in favor of religion. We never

pay our writers as long as they are alive, and for this reason many of

our best writers have left the Lithuanian nation, have gone over to other

nations, writing for them, and enhanced the glory of these nations. Thus

Lithuanian writers have helped to make the Polish nation famous in the

literary field.</p>
