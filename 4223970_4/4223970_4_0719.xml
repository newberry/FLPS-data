      <p>The Russian tsar for all the past ages was and at present is the tool
of darkness and tyranny, the worst enemy of liberty and enlightenment
because he endeavors to keep all in darkness and slavery, darkness
and slavery being the support of his tyranny and the power of his
throne.</p>
      <p>We understand that Russian politics and tsarism have as their chief
aim graft and public thievery. From time to time they have reduced
the people to serfdom, which subjugates its victims by destroying
all ideals of progress, culture and freedom.</p>
      <p>It is well known that the Russian regime took over our fatherland
Lithuania, locked her in the dungeons of darkness and slavery, prohibited 
the press, destroyed the language of the people, hung our
<pb facs="4223970_4_0720.jpg" n="2"/>
fathers for going against the tyrannic regime, robbed us of our
national assets, destroyed our castles, schools, churches and other
educational institutions, and grabbed large parts of our best land.
Now they wish to destroy our love of freedom, our love for our

fatherland.</p>
      <p>It is known that tsarism throughout the ages stood and still stands

as the guardian of the most immoral reaction, the upholder of the

worst conservatism in Europe; it uses the power of militarism and

despotism to destroy the freedom and the progress of all the nations

of Europe and of Asia. It took the role of the world's gendarme to

stop the progress of all humanity.</p>
      <p>We the Lithuanians, in a meeting on the 24th day of April, 1904,

sponsored by the Sons of Lithuania society, publicly condemn the

policies of tsarism. We desire to see its complete collapse in a

short time. We desire to see the progressive Japanese nation destroy

<pb facs="4223970_4_0721.jpg" n="3"/>
the despotism which is trampling liberty and culture. With this decision

we are inviting all the revolutionary energy to fight against tsarism

and its servants. We are dedicating ourselves to the purpose of

acquainting the whole civilized world with our wrongs and with the

injury to all humanity, coming through the oppressions of tsarism.</p>
      <p>Down with tsarism! Long live liberty and civilization!</p>
      <p>In the name of all the Lithuanians,</p>
      <p>The Sons of Lithuania Society.</p>
