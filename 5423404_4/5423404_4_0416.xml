   <p>A few days ago it was reported from Springfield that the State Senate had passed a bill introduced by Senator Jewell for the purpose of putting teeth in the existing parole law, and preventing abuses of its regulations. Up to now, unreasonable leniency has been practiced toward released prisoners who, upon gaining their freedom, have returned to a life of crime.</p>
   <p>If the bill is passed by the House of Representatives and signed by the Governor, a loophole in the law will have been closed--a hole through which, in the past, criminals in large numbers have slipped with the aid of shady attorneys and unscrupulous politicians.</p>
   <p>Originally the parole law was passed for the purpose of giving certain <pb facs="5423404_4_0417.jpg" n="2"/>criminals, who seemed to deserve it, another chance--a chance to redeem themselves and get a new start in life. It was not at all intended as a means by which hardened lawbreakers might be granted their freedom to return to a life of more and better-planned crimes. But this is exactly what has happened all too often. It has been proven that during the last few months no less than twelve murders and many other major crimes have been committed here in Chicago by criminals who have been released from penal institutions on parole, not only once but several times. Even criminals with long and frightful records are known to have gained their freedom in this manner, and the point has been reached where the police and other law-enforcing authorities are often unable to cope with the situation. Such a state of affairs must not be permitted to prevail, and it is to be hoped that Senator Jewell's bill will become law.</p>
