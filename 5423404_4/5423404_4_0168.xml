<title level="a">TO SHELTER THE AGED SWEDISH M.E. CHURCH LAYS THE CORNER-STONE OF A REFUGE</title></bibl>

   <p>It is to be known as the Bethany Home and will accomodate fifty-six persons. A hospital and a home for children to be added.</p>
   <p>The corner-stone of Bethany Home of the Swedish M.E. Church was laid yesterday afternoon. The home is located next to the corner of Paulina and Webster Avenue in Ravenswood. On the corner stands the Swedish Church under the auspices of which the exercises of yesterday afternoon were held. The church was filled to overflowing when the Rev. C.G.Nelson, the pastor opened the exercises by reading a hymn, which was sung by the congregation. After the singing, Rev. Nelson read from the Scripture the story of the Good Samaritan. Following this was a prayer by K.H. Elmstrom for the successful completion of the home.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0169.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. William Henshen delivered an address. He spoke of the nobility of the work and thanked the founder of the home, John R. Lindgren of Evanston, for his gift of $10,000.00 for the work. Dr. Henshen explained that the home is to be non-sectarian. After Dr. Henshen's address, Miss Edith Mountain rendered the soprano solo "Calvary" and Dr. F.M. Bristol made a short talk. After Dr. Bristol's address, the congregation adjourned to the foundation of the home, where the corner-stone was laid by the Rev. Alfred Anderson. The ceremonies were concluded with a prayer by Prof. Albert Ericson.</p>
   <p>The new Bethany Home will, when completed, have accomodation for fifty-six aged people. The structure will cost $25,000.00. The intention is to ultimately add to its wings to be used as an orphan assylum and hospital, respectively.</p>
