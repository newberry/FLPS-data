   <p>The police force has a very meager Swedish clientele amongst its law-breakers; and we are proud of it. Therefore, it hurts us to tell of the fate of Otto Bjerkman, who has descended the downward path and is now a graduate burglar. Several burglaries have been committed by him, but most of the stolen goods has been recovered.</p>
   <p>What makes this case so sad is the fact that Bjorkman always has been well liked by his friends, and was looked upon as a well-merited man. His services in the World War were rewarded with the French Croix de Guerre and the American Military Modal, a special distinction.</p>
