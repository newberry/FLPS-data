   <p>Numerous plans have been afoot toward the realization of the long-nourished idea of the bringing about the building of a large lodge or assembly building for the Swedish people of Chicago. Most of these plans have died in their infancy. This time, however, the prospects are more concrete than ever before. A month or so ago the Svea Society organized a committee for the purpose of stimulating interest for the idea among all the other Swedish ledges and societies in Chicago. The plan was to encourage and assist in the organizing of a similar committee within each individual ledge or society. The plan has met with success, for four Swedish societies have already joined with Svea in this endeavor, namely: Independent Order of Svithied, the Viking Society, Society Thor, and the Scandinavian Brick Mason's Association. All of these organizations have large memberships and are very progressive, all of which tends to speak for the success of the idea. Finally, we are prompted to add that a joint meeting of the five societies mentioned has been set for October 4, at which time several ether organizations are expected to join the movement.</p>
