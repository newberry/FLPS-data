   <p>The problem of a fair and practical immigration policy is an intricate one, and it is not surprising that those who are charged with the formulation of such a policy are in a quandary. Many opinions which have been expressed on the matter are so lacking in understanding that it is evident that they are the expressions of people who are entirely uninformed on the subject. However, the Declaration of Independence has set forth certain principles which still hold good, and which will serve very well as a standard for our national conduct.</p>
   <p>According to the Declaration of Independence a free nation may claim the right to determine what kind of immigrants it will admit to citizenship, and also the right to bar those who may be expected to compete with the country's own workers on terms detrimental to the latter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1607.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>No right-thinking person will deny the right of the United States to determine who shall be admitted to the country. If our Government decides to bar those who are ignorant and therefore undesirable, who is to dispute its decision? And if it wishes to admit those whom it considers desirable, who is to stop it from doing so?</p>
   <p>Many years ago, restrictions were imposed on immigration from China and Japan, restrictions which were based on racial considerations. Considerations involving education, training, and general qualifications for citizenship are just as important. To be sure, the quota law provides in part for such selective immigration, but only in part. Then, too, it causes many difficulties for immigration authorities, as well as for would-be immigrants.</p>
   <p>It is now proposed that those who want permission to enter America be examined and selected in their own homelands before departure for these shores, and it might be a fairer policy to admit them on the basis of their own individual merits, rather than simply to admit a definite number from each country, <pb facs="5423404_4_1608.jpg" n="3"/>i. e., a certain percentage of the number of their nationals who came here before the year 1890. As for the immigrants from western and northern Europe, just as many would be admitted under such an individual merit system as are now being admitted under the quota law, if not more.</p>
