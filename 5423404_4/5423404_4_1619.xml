   <p>Judge Gary is still clamoring for changes in our immigration law that will permit a greater number of people to enter this country, thus causing a reduction in wages. The Judge declares that America's immigration regulations, as they now stand, constitute a danger to the economic life of the nation.</p>
   <p>The immigrants that Judge Gary is longing for are of the type that will beg the foremen in his steel plants to let them work twelve hours a day at an hourly rate which is far from sufficient to provide a satisfactory standard of living for people with ordinary American requirements. He actually states that he considers it a danger to this country to prevent such people from coming here in unlimited numbers.</p>

   <p>Immigration Commissioner Husband, of Washington, declares, on the other hand, that "on the whole, the quality of the immigrants whom we are admitting now is better than it has been for the last thirty-five years". But Mr. Husband is concerned with their value as human beings and prospective American citizens, not with their value as wage slaves in Judge Gary's steel plants.</p>
