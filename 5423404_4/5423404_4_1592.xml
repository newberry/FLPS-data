   <p>The addition of the national origins provision to the Immigration Act of 1924 has been postponed twice because it was considered impractical as a basis for the computation of immigration quotas. But it will go into effect next July 1 unless the Congress, when it meets in extra session next month, votes another postponement or decides to abolish the provision altogether.</p>
   <p>If the new law should become effective, Sweden's quota will be reduced by two thirds, to 3,314, a reduction of about 6,000 in the present quota. If this law had been properly prepared on a basis of justice and fairness, no Swedish-American would object to it. But it has been clearly established that the law is impractical, that it is not based on realities, and that the quotas computed according to it are the results of guesswork. On the other hand, it is generally recognized that the present quotas are so <pb facs="5423404_4_1593.jpg" n="2"/>adjusted as to serve America's best interests, and are arrived at by sound reasoning.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, the duty of all citizens who agree with President Hoover that the National Origins provision represents an ill-conceived idea, and should not become law, to let the proper authorities know what they think about it. They can best do so by writing their representatives in Washington and ask them to vote for repeal of the law or for another postponement. In order to make it easier for our countrymen to voice their displeasure over this law, we are printing below two form letters, which should be addressed to Senators and Congressmen. Copy them and send them to Washington D. C. [Translator's note of the letters are of course in English in the original.]</p>
   <p>(Date)</p>
   <p>Hon.</p>
   <p>(Name of Senator)</p>
   <p>United States Senate.</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1594.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As one of your constituents, I ask that you vote for the repeal of the National Origins provision of the Immigration Act and for the continuance of the quotas based on two per cent of the 1890 census, thereby supporting the President in his opinion on this question.</p>
   <p>(Name)</p>
   <p>(Address)</p>
   <p>(Date)</p>
   <p>Hon.</p>
   <p>(Name of Congressman)</p>
   <p>House of Representatives,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1595.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Being one of your constituents, I strongly urge that you give all possible support to the President by voting for the repeal of the National Origins provision of the Immigration Act and for the retention of the quotas based on the 1890 census.</p>
