   <p>The prevalence of delinquency and crime among our young people is one of the most serious aspects of present day society. In our large cities it has become necessary to establish special courts for young offenders, and these courts are kept busy.</p>
   <p>Many people who have studied this problem are inclined to feel that in many cases the parents are to blame for the misdeeds of their children, and that they are the ones who should be punished. There can be no doubt that many fathers and mothers neglect their parental duties.</p>
   <p>Under certain circumstances, such as poverty and sickness, it may be practically impossible for the parents to supervise the activities of their children, and in cases of that kind it is not fair to accuse them of laxity. However, <pb facs="5423404_4_0419.jpg" n="2"/>quite often one may observe how parents not only close their eyes to the misbehavior of their children, but actually encourage them in their wrongdoings; and we believe that such parents should be held responsible before the law. They are morally guilty of the misdemeanors of their children.</p>
   <p>Alma L. Binzell, who teaches child training at the University of Minnesota, holds that neither the children themselves nor their parents are to blame for the present deplorable conditions. In her opinion the responsibility rests on the state, which is guilty of gross neglect by not teaching parents and prospective parents the principles of child training. We grant that the statements of such an expert carry considerable weight, but it is difficult to imagine that such preparation for parenthood as she advocates would entirely wipe out this serious social evil. There are more effective methods, and we shall briefly call our reader's attention to one of them:</p>
   <p>In a recent issue of the Fort Dearborn Independent, a periodical published <pb facs="5423404_4_0420.jpg" n="3"/>by Henry Ford, we read about the wealthy Charles Pratt, who spent much time planning the most effective way in which to spend his money for the benefit of humanity. He soon discovered that there was not much he could do for the adults, but that there were no lack of opportunities to do plenty of good among children and adolescents. He founded the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn for the purpose of training the "hands, heads, and hearts" of its pupils.</p>
   <p>The eminent educator of Philadelphia, Dr. C. R. Henderson, was instrumental in the establishment of the Drexel Institute, which is conducted on the same principles as those guiding the Pratt Institute.</p>
   <p>In his miniature industrial society, the late Elbert Hubbard also demonstrated the advantages of combining theoretical teaching with practical work; and he further showed that an individual, given the proper environment, could be trained to make his living while attaining knowledge and a high degree of culture.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0421.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These three men have amply demonstrated that those whose hands and thoughts are occupied with interesting and useful work tend to become mentally efficient and well balanced in every respect, and have nothing to fear from the evil outside influences which are so numerous and strong in our society today.</p>
