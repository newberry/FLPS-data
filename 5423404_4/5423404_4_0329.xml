   <p>Year after year, as regular as a clock, reports appear in the Swedish-American press which give us a feeble impression of the immense sums that are sent annually from Swedish-Americans here to those near and dear in Sweden. Some brief comments usually are added to the reports intending to make it clear to the senders of the money how splendid is the country in which he or she is living, while at the same time making it clear to the receiver of the money how miserable are the circumstances under which he or she has to exist.</p>
   <p>We have heard also how the rumor goes, at street corners and elsewhere, when Swedes come together, of the great assistance rendered old Sweden by her sons and daughters here; and many Swedish-Americans profess their ignorance by declaring that Sweden would hardly be able to carry on except for the millions sent her from Swedes in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0330.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The sums of money sent by Swedes in the United States to the destitute in Norrland have been viewed and reviewed many times in the Swedish-American press, both in weeklies and in monthlies, and even in calendars. And why? Simply because there were some of the poor people in the sections where the need had been great, who did not think of sending letters of thanks to some of those who thought they had been working too hard in the interest of the poverty-stricken at home.</p>
   <p>Let us, however, take a look at the figures which tell the story of the amount of money which passed through the mails from the United States to Sweden in 1903. The official report gives the amount at $2,753,074.78. This is regarded as a large sum, and yet it is ridiculously small when one considers that the United States received from Sweden during the same year 46,028 vigorous and capable men and women who, in accordance with the American immigration laws, had to bring with them to America an aggregate amount of $1,380,840, and in addition to this amount, there was sent through the mails to the United States from Sweden the sum of $433,441.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0331.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Some time ago, the President of our country stated that every adult is worth $5,000 to the country if he is capable of working. If President Roosevelt is correct in this statement, the United States has received an additional $230,000,000 from poor Sweden during 1903.</p>
   <p>If President Roosevelt exaggerated the value of the immigrant, then we are guilty of the same mistake.</p>
   <p>A matter which ought not be overlooked in the present discussion is the fact that the greater part of the money sent home by Swedish-Americans was simply repayments of loans incurred when the young man or woman was setting out for the country in the West, and for which loan the old people at home, in many cases, had signed.</p>
   <p>A Swedish paper, mentioning about the large amounts of money which, in all probability, will find its way from America to Sweden before Christmas, <pb facs="5423404_4_0332.jpg" n="4"/>goes on to say: "It needs to be remembered that these remittances are frequently not primarily proofs of economic advance, but rather expressions of a warm heart and a generous mind." If our memory does not fail us, it was the English economist, Thorold, who said that among all the various groupings in human society the maidservant shows the greatest thoughtfulness as regards her parents and other near relatives. This statement seems to hold good most particularly in regard to the Swedes.....For it is a generally known fact that the greater part of the money sent from America to Swedish homes has been sent by maidservants, who have been able, through their ability to save and their generosity towards their families, to send very large sums to their dear ones at home.</p>
