   <p>A large crowd of interested people gathered last Sunday afternoon at Lincoln and Cleveland avenues to witness the solemn dedication of the new Augustana Hospital. Nice weather prevailed during the whole Service, which began with singing a hymn. The Rev. L.G.Abrahamson, President of the Augustana Synod delivered an address. He spoke of "The Good Samaritan", The Rev. M.C.Ranseen, chairman of the Board of Directors for the hospital then read a list of the newspapers and other items to be placed in the dedication box namely: The Chicago Tribune, Svenska Tribunen, Svenska Amerikanaren, Augustana and other papers. The box was then placed in the stone and Pastor Abrahamson hit it three times with a hammer and pronounced the Benediction. The Service concluded with a hymn.</p>
   <p>The congregation continued the celebration at the American Congregational Church close to the hospital ground, where the chorus of the Immanuel Church sang. Speeches were made by Doctor Erland Carlson and the pastor of the church, <pb facs="5423404_4_0064.jpg" n="2"/>Doctor O. Olson. Rev. Ranseen read a history of the Augustana Hospital. Between May 28, 1884, when it was opened and up until January 1, 1893, 1,023 patients have been received, of which 73 died and the others were restored to health. After the offering was taken for the benefit of the hospital the festival came to a conclusion with prayers and hymns.</p>
