   <p>Last Saturday, the Svithiod Order celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. A quarter of a century has passed since Lodge No. 1 was organized with a membership of forty-five. (Now this lodge has 479 members, and the Order as a whole, contains about 4,000 members in twenty-seven lodges.) The day was celebrated with a grand festival at the Northside Turner Hall last Saturday evening, to which only members of the order were admitted. About 600 people partook of the banquet. The president of the lodge, Mr. Hjalmar Hedin, gave a pleasing oration of welcome. The orations for the occasion were given by Editor F. A. Lindstrand and Judge Axel Chytraeus to which the audience listened with marked interest. The boys of the Harmony Club sang as never before, and they reaped vigorous applause for their splendid presentations. An ode to the day was read by P. M. Person, <pb facs="5423404_4_1220.jpg" n="2"/>and Gottfried Holmquist won a storm of applause through his interpretation of the jolly poem "The Monk".....</p>
   <p>An unusually appealing pantomime depicted the early struggles of the Svithiod. Medals or jubilee tokens were distributed to all the participants in the festival. The Hall was richly decorated with flowers and a mass of Swedish flags.</p>
