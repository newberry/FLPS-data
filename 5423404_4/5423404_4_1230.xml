   <p>The North End Dramatic Club gave an evening entertainment last Tuesday at Steinway Hall, for the benefit of Miss Nordenholm. The entertainment was attended by a very large and appreciative audience who followed the program with great interest.</p>
   <p>The program offered good things exclusively. Miss Marie Shedlock won enthusiastic applause by reading several of H. C. Anderson's best pieces. Two minor pieces, "Two Roses," and, "A Most Mixed up Affair" were played creditably. The former, a part in the construction undeniably faulty, did possess, in contrast, a well - defined type, perfectly interpreted by Mr. Harald Gren. His presentation, in addition to the pleasant humor breathing through the whole piece, makes one shut one's eyes to the cardinal <pb facs="5423404_4_1231.jpg" n="2"/>fault of the piece, its weakness in construction. The other play referred to, the chief roles of which were presented by Mr. and Mrs. Stecher, was beautifully enacted, particularly the amazingly sure dialogues, perfectly accentuated. The music produced between the acts was well played by a highly trained orchestra.</p>
