   <p>Dr. Albert Ericson died on Monday of last week in his home, 2118 Orrington Avenue, Evanston. He had been in poor health for the past two years, but his remarkable energy and love for his work enabled him to remain quite active up to a couple of months ago.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ericson was born in 1840 in Stockholm, Sweden, where his father was pastor of the Katarina congregation. He came to America in 1859 and began immediately to study for the Methodist ministry. For a number of years he was editor of Sendebudet, (The Messenger) and in 1875 was appointed head of the Swedish department of the Methodist Theological Seminary in Evanston, in which capacity he served until his death.</p>
