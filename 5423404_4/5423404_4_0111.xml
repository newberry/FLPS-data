   <p>p.11........The Swedish Societies' Committee for the Home for the Aged held its quarterly meeting at the Sherman Hotel, Monday January 11, in the evening. The meeting was well attended and the sentiment of the best. Various questions were considered, but that which seemed to interest most deeply those present was the question of providing means to defray the expences of the home and enlarge it. Mr. B. Oswald, one of the members for life of the society suggested a rather attractive solution. If all the members for life would subscribe an annual sum, for the purpose, he said, the problem would be solved. Personally he would give $10.00 per year.</p>
   <p>The committee on concert in Orchestra Hall reported. A number of lodges paid their annual dues, and new members for life were welcomed into the society.</p>
