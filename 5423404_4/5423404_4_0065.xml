   <p>The new Augustana Hospital, which is under erection at Lincoln and Cleveland Aves. will be the largest Swedish Hospital in the city, six floors high besides the basement. The corner stone ceremony will be held February 12th when several of the pastors of the Augustana Synod will officiate. Although the hospital is intended to receive the rapidly increasing Swedish population in Chicago, it will now as before open its doors to other nationalities and creeds and thus be "nonsectarian".</p>
   <p>The Augustana Hospital came into existence on May 28, 1881, when the Illinois Conference of The Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod, through its Board of Directors, and its chairman, the Rev. Erland Carlson, rented the corner <pb facs="5423404_4_0066.jpg" n="2"/>lot at Lincoln and Cleveland Aves. with a frame building standing on the lot, which was made into a hospital. On the day of February 1, 1882, the Conference decided to accept the ownership of the lot and house; the Rev. Erland Carlson made an offer to buy the property for $35,000. The seller donated $1,000 to the hospital at the same time. Funds for the purchase were obtained through subscriptions, a bazaar, which netted the sum of $10,000, and donations.</p>
   <p>The first doctor at the hospital was Truman W. Miller.</p>
   <p>As the present hospital is insufficient the Conference decided at its meeting in Chicago, February 17-22, to erect a new hospital on the large ground this year if possible. Architect L. G. Hallberg was appointed to make the drawings and to figure out the cost. The erection started November 22nd, but has been so much delayed on account of the intense cold that the foundation only has been laid.</p>
   <p>The work has started again and the new building will soon be erected.</p>
