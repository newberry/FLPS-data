   <p>Last Sunday was a red-letter day for all those Chicago Swedes who are interested in the activities of the Society for the Swedish Home for the Aged, for on that day the new building of the Home, which the Society maintains in Evanston, was dedicated. The ceremony put the finishing touches on an undertaking which was started several years ago, and which has cost those that have been in charge much work, time, worry, and money. But on that happy day all of this was forgotten.</p>
   <p>C. S. Peterson, the president of the Board of Directors of the Home, was in charge of the day's program. He declared in his introductory speech that the Home as it now stands is the greatest Swedish institution of its kind outside of Sweden.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0096.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The dedication speech was delivered by Pastor Joshua Oden. Several other prominent Swedes addressed the audience, among them Congressman Carl R. Chindblom, who outlined the past history of the Home. He stated that it is now valued at $350,000, and that $30,000 annually is required for its maintenance.</p>
   <p>The program was enlivened with music played by the orchestra of the Great Lakes Navigation School, and with songs offered by eighty members of the Swedish Singers' League. Refreshments were served in the new dining room, which, together with the up-to-date kitchen, was especially admired by all the housewives. Buttons on which appeared a picture of the Home were sold throughout the day and brought in a considerable sum.</p>
