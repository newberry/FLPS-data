   <p>In this and preceding issues we have reported the details of the failure of one of Chicago's largest state banks, the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank. Each succeeding day brings to light additional rotten details regarding the crash and those who engineered it. Paul O. Stensland, who until very recently was held in high esteem by the community, has become the central figure of the worst bank scandal that has ever occurred in Chicago. For several years he lived a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde existence: outwardly highly respectable, but inwardly and covertly an embezzler, a master thief, and a common libertine. Twenty thousand victims of his bank robbery call down curses on his head, while he has disappeared and apparently neither pauperism nor even loss of life [among the depositors] is troubling his conscience or what he uses for a conscience.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0378.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Millions of dollars belonging to poor people have dribbled through his fingers until with his speculations, which were losing propositions, next to nothing is left for those who had saved the pennies that made their few rainy-day dollars. If half of the dirt reported in this scandal is true, there are no mitigating circumstances in favor of Paul O. Stensland, whose hypocritical cape has fallen; he now stands unmasked before the world. His fall was not brought on by weakness or unseen impulse; for several years he has been using the money of the bank for his own selfish desires. Apparently he has left his co-workers to suffer for his crimes while they place the blame wholly on him.</p>
   <p>One asks, "what have the bank directors done during the last five or more years?" Their negligence of duty is self-evident and we cannot see how they can expect to escape unscathed or unscorched when the whole scandal is published for the view of the entire world.</p>
   <p>Something must be done to so arrange our banking system that our deposits will be safe, even though they earn nothing. The organization of postal savings <pb facs="5423404_4_0379.jpg" n="3"/>banks as they now exist in Sweden and other European countries would be at least one step in the right direction.</p>
