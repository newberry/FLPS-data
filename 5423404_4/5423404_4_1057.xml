   <p>Election day is close at hand. Next Tuesday, November 2, the battle at the polls will take place, and it will be decided who will be president of the United States for the next four years. The final decision rests in the hands of the people, and it is the duty, inherent in citizenship, of all men and women who have the privilege of voting to cast their ballot. The election is an important one for the American nation, and the result may have far-reaching implications. It is always difficult to predict the outcome of an American presidential election with any degree of certainty, but it seems to us that at the present time all signs indicate a Republican victory.</p>
   <p>The Democratic party has been at the helm during the last eight years, and it <pb facs="5423404_4_1058.jpg" n="2"/>should be admitted that its leaders can point to certain accomplishments. But the great mass of our people seems to have tired of the Democratic administration, which certainly has erred in many respects, and to have made up its mind that the Republicans are entitled to an opportunity to show what they can do. Such a change of administration is altogether desirable in these rapidly changing times. The policies of the Republican party are based on a solid foundation, and its banner carrier, the intelligent, experienced, and careful Senator Warren G. Harding, certainly is well fitted to steer the ship of state through the dangerous narrows.</p>
   <p>To-day the United States is standing at the crossroads, and it is of the utmost importance that we choose the right course. The alliance known as the League of Nations, which was founded by the great powers after the World War, has assigned to itself a kind of police authority, for the purpose of directing the conduct of nations from its headquarters in Europe.</p>
   <p>The Democratic presidential candidate advocates America's unqualified membership <pb facs="5423404_4_1059.jpg" n="3"/>in the League, while the Republican candidate takes the stand that we should stay out of it under its present setup, because by joining at this time we would jeopardize the freedom of action of the United States.</p>
   <p>World peace is close to the heart of Senator Harding, and he is a strong advocate of American participation in the reconstruction of the war-torn world, and of the liberation of humanity from the misery of recurrent wars. He favors co-operation among all nations for that purpose, but believes that the goal can best be reached through voluntary agreements; and that this nation should be left entirely free to act according to its own judgment and conscience, without having to yield to outside pressure of any kind. We are in full agreement with this point of view. It seems to us that this stand offers the best chance for a happy solution of the world's problems.</p>
   <p>As regards our internal national policies, Senator Harding has proposed a <pb facs="5423404_4_1060.jpg" n="4"/>reconstruction program containing the following main points:</p>
   <p>Laws and regulations which only cause confusion and misunderstandings should be abolished.</p>
   <p>Our tariff laws must be changed and improved, to better fulfill their purpose.</p>
   <p>Our tax system must be revised and improved. Excessive profits should be heavily taxed.</p>
   <p>Bureaucratic control and unnecessary experimentation must cease.</p>
   <p>Closer co-operation between government and business must be brought about in order to promote domestic as well as foreign trade.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1061.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Our merchant marine should be enlarged, and subsidized if necessary.</p>
   <p>The mail service must be improved. The merit system should be introduced in the appointment of federal employees. Ability should be rewarded, and unnecessary services abolished. Duplication and overlapping of work within the various departments of the Government must be avoided. Experts should be consulted in order to improve administrative efficiency.</p>
   <p>These are some of the outstanding points in Senator Harding's program, and they may all be summed up in the slogan "America first." That is the essence of his ideas of government, and it carries a real appeal to the American people. That is the reason why the Senator enjoys an even greater popularity today than he did at the beginning of the campaign; and if we have gauged the sentiment throughout the country correctly, his victory on election day is assured.</p>
