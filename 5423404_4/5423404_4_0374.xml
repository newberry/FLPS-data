<title level="a">CHICAGO'S WORST BOY AN ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD SWEDE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Eleven-year-old Thomas Olson, 271 West Erie Street, is, according to the North Side Police Station, Chicago's toughest boy. His record in the Juvenile Court is a very black one. On Wednesday of last week, he obtained a revolver and informed his friends he intended to follow in the footsteps of the famous "Car Barn Bandits". To another eleven-year-old, he said that he intended to live on hold-ups. As the boy approached a spot on Huron Street, our bandit jumped out of hiding and, with the revolver pointing at the other boy, ordered him to throw up his hands. The victim, having no idea the revolver was loaded, put up a fight and a bullet passed close to his head. Thomas Olson then tried to get away from his victim, but a policeman arrived in time to arrest him. Thomas' record reads: burglary at 44 Bismark Court; incendiarism, 52 Jensen Court; and two horse and buggy thefts.</p>
