   <p>At the Zion Evangelical Swedish Lutheran Church yesterday a jubilee service, was held in celebration of the tercentenary of the establishment of the National Church of Sweden. Great interest was taken in the occasion, and the church was well filled.</p>
   <p>The service was conducted by the pastor, the Rev. C. Granath, assisted by the Rev. L. A. Johnson, Rockford, Illinois, the Rev. Mauritz Stolpe,and the Rev.Dr.E. Carlson.</p>
   <p>The service commenced with the singing of the 268th Psalm, Swedish collection. Reading of scripture and prayer led by the Rev. C. Gramath followed, after which the male chorus of the Immanuel Swedish Lutheran Church sang a hymn. The subject of the celebration was then announced in a short speech by the pastor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1505.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The hymn "Forever with the Lord," to Gounod's music, was sung by Mr. P. R. Carlson. The Rev. L. A. Johnson next addressed the congregation on the subject of the Upsala movement of 1593, which culminated in the establishment of the National Church of Sweden.</p>
   <p>Another hymn by the Immanuel Chorus followed, when the Rev. Mauritz Stolpe took the pulpit. His subject was the "Confessio Augustana," which embodies the tenets of the Lutheran Church of Sweden.</p>
   <p>The closing address was given by the Rev. Dr. E. Carlson.</p>
