   <p>Trustworthiness and respect for law and order are the two outstanding virtues of the Swedish national character. These characteristics have their foundation in Swedish culture and environment and is imbued in their thoughts and actions. Writers of history, have time and again held forth as particularly characteristic of the Swedes, their willingness and efforts to adjust themselves to new surroundings, and faithfulness towards their adopted countries. Such qualities place their stamp on freeborn men and women, and have made the Swedes good American citizens. Every page of Swedish-American history reflects the good character of the Swedes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1550.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Delaware Swedes were God-fearing, law-abiding pioneers, and their descendants played an important role in the later period of colonial developement following War of Rebellion. The later emigrants from Sweden followed in their predecessors footsteps, and made important contributions in their different fields of endeavor. Many of them served in the Union Army.</p>
   <p>American citizens of Swedish descent, have offered many sacrifices on the altar of their adopted country. Part of this has been written and preserved for posterity, but not all or enough. Names such as John Hanson, John Morton, and John Ericsson, and a large number of officers and privates in the U. S. army and navy are mentioned, but the list is incomplete; this is to be deplored for it is a well known fact that in Illinois every fifth Swede and in four states <pb facs="5423404_4_1551.jpg" n="3"/>every sixth Swede, fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. The loyal Swedes have not been given full honor or credit for their services and sacrifices during that time of need.</p>
   <p>America is now fighting for the liberty of the world. Thousands of young men of Swedish descent serve in the army and the navy, and other thousands will be called to service. It is of the utmost importance to us all that a complete account of all these people is maintained, with this thought in mind, The Swedish Historical Society of America, has taken steps to gather this data, and is also appealing to the general Swedish public in the following <pb facs="5423404_4_1552.jpg" n="4"/>resolution adopted at its last meeting.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Historical Society feels proud of the grand support our countrymen have given to the Red Cross, Y. M. C. A., and the Liberty Loan drives. It is also particularly inspiring to see the great number of men serving under the flag. Service flags in the homes, offices, shops, churches, yes, everywhere, tell the story of their contributions better than we can express it in words; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, It is one of the main objects of the Swedish Historical Society to gather and preserve records of historical value for future generations; and, <pb facs="5423404_4_1553.jpg" n="5"/>Whereas, The Society has taken steps to maintain permanent records of enlisted men of Swedish descent, who are now called or will be called to service later; therefore,</p>
   <p>Be It Resolved, That the Swedish Historical Society of America, through the press, invites all Swedish and Swedish-American societies to cooperate with this Society and through their secretaries and by mail, to furnish the S. A. S. secretary with the names of all persons, who serve their country in one way or another.</p>
   <p>The resolution speaks for itself. Cooperation is necessary, if the objective shall be reached. The appeal should find sympathetic response in all citizens of Swedish birth or descent..</p>
