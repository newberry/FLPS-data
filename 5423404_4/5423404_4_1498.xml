   <p>The annual conference of the Society of the Swedish Episcopal Churches in America was opened last Wednesday with services in St. Ausgarius Church where the sermon was delivered by the Rev. Erik Forsberg of Minneapolis.</p>
   <p>The Rev. J.G.Hammarskold, General Missionary, was the preacher the following Sunday. Seven sessions have been held during the conference.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the local religious newspaper The Church should become a general publication, that copies should be sent home to Sweden's bishop and to other prominent clergy in the Church of Sweden and that a translation of the Swedish paper should be sent to the Bishops in the Episcopal Church of America. .....</p>
   <p>The members of the conference paid their respect to Bishop McLaren in Chicago, who greeted them very cordially.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1499.jpg" n="2"/>
