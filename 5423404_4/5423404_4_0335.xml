   <p>Mr. Robert Lindblom, president of the Central Aid Committee for the destitute in Norrland, Sweden, recently presented his final report concerning the work of the Committee and the results achieved. In this report he stated that Mr. G. G. Falk was the first to take up the question of aid, and [the first to start the organization for aid]. Dr. John Enander felt hurt at this, if one is to judge from the "correction" which he presented in the Hemlandet for July 29. In this "correction" he informs the public, very modestly, that he, not Mr. Falk, is the one who started the movement.</p>
   <p>For the sake of Dr. Enander we regret being unable to agree with his "correction", but we must accord honor where honor is due. The fact that on November 14, the doctor called a meeting at the Sherman House in Chicago, of the Swedish-American newspaper men does not prove that the doctor started the aid movement. At the <pb facs="5423404_4_0336.jpg" n="2"/>meeting at the Sherman House, nothing was accomplished, and before Dr. Enander had announced the meeting of newspaper men, the old, faithful, and benevolent Mr. Gustaf G. Falk had visited our editorial office and expressed his desire that an aid committee be organized. We have reason to believe that what Mr. Falk told us, he also told the other Swedish-American editors in town. Whether or not Dr. Enander was stimulated by Mr. Falk in calling the Sherman House meeting on November 14, or in joining in the call for the mass meeting at the Sherman House on November 21, when the Central Aid Committee was formed, is of no importance. The meeting called by Dr. Enander accomplished nothing whatever..... In the report of this meeting which the meeting's secretary, Nils Mannow, inserted in the Svenska Nyheter for November 18, we read: "Dr. Enander acted as chairman, but the discussions did not lead to anything, for the meeting was informed that on the coming Friday a mass meeting concerning the same matter would be held here in Chicago, and it was decided to let matters rest until the result of the mass meeting is known....."</p>
   <p>Memory plays a trick on Dr. Enander when he asserts that "in the days following <pb facs="5423404_4_0337.jpg" n="3"/>the meeting of November 14, Mr. Falk obtained the signatures of certain Swedes to a call for a mass meeting".</p>
   <p>The call to the mass meeting for November 21 was published in the Svenska Nyheter on the same date as the report from the meeting called by Dr. Enander. Svenska Nyheter goes to press at noon on Monday, and notes for publication are required to be in the editor's hand on Saturday afternoon at the latest. Consequently, the twenty-two Swedish men and women who signed the call to the mass meeting must have done so before the meeting on November 14.</p>
   <p>In the above we have merely desired to establish the truth of Mr. Lindblom's report concerning the part played by Mr. Gustaf G. Falk, and it is by no means our intention to detract from the energetic work of Dr. Enander in collecting money for the destitute in Norrland.....</p>
