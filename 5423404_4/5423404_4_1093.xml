   <p>The Swedish National Association of Chicago held its annual membership meeting last Monday night in the Northern Hotel. The various committees reported on their activities during the past year. The Committee on Credentials reported that practically all the lodges and societies belonging to the Association had appointed new delegates for the current year.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Charities reported through its chairman, Mrs. Andrietta Wolt, that the number of needy Swedes in Chicago is large at the present time, and that the funds available for the Committee are far from sufficient. Almost every day the United Charities call upon the Committee to take care of some Swedish family which is asking for help. Cash is urgently needed, as well as clothing of all kinds, and Mrs. Wolt appealed to all members to aid the <pb facs="5423404_4_1094.jpg" n="2"/>Committee in its work. It was also reported that arrangements for the charity ball which the Association will give in the Merry Garden ballroom on February 15 are well advanced, and that tickets will be on sale soon.</p>
   <p>The treasurer reported that the Association's cash balance as of January 1, 1923 amounted to $2,265.81. Income during the year was derived from the following sources: Net profit on the summer festival, $1,903.75; the concert, $83.50; and several minor items. Total income during the year: $2,193.50. The largest disbursement went to the Committee on Charities, which received $800. Cash balance as of date: $3,181.61.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected, and the new president is C. S. Peterson. The retiring president, Oscar S. Ohlander, introduced the new officers and outlined briefly the activities and purposes of the organization.</p>
