<title level="a">APPEAL FROM SWEDEN TO SWEDES IN THE UNITED STATES</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>By the time this appeal is published, it will probably be generally known that thirty-two of the largest employers in Sweden within the machine industry, have put into effect a lockout against their workers. The lockout began on July 7, and involves about 20,000 men. The purpose of this blow [which is to date the most violent used] so far by the Swedish Association of Manufacturers against their workers, is simply to destroy our sole bulwark, our organization. We are determined to fight desperately for the right to maintain the organizations which have proven in many cases to be our only defense against economic pressure, and the persecution which Swedish employers often carry on against such workers as are thinking independently, and have the courage to express their convictions.</p>
   <p>The labor unions in Sweden are heavily pressed because of the constant fight which [they have had to carry on recently] against the employers who are using the poor times within the industry and the poverty resulting from crop failures as weapons to decrease the wages of the workers. Because of this situation we appeal to you, compatriots and fellow workers, to extend such help to us as is <pb facs="5423404_4_0345.jpg" n="2"/>possible; to inform every Swede you meet of the fact that here is a subjugated class, a class to whom rights are denied, [a class] which is struggling against being drawn still deeper into social misery.</p>
   <p>For the Swedish Union of Iron and Metal Workers,</p>
   <p>Ernst Blomberg.</p>
