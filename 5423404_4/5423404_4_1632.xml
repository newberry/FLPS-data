   <p>A well-organized propaganda campaign is going on at the present time for the purpose of bringing about repeal or modification of the restrictions on immigration now in operation. As usual, the argument is presented that there is a shortage of labor in this country. The fact is that there is no labor shortage, but rather a shortage of work.</p>
   <p>No fair-minded observer will deny that the present restrictions on immigration operate to the advantage of the great mass of the American people. If any change should be made at all, it ought rather to be in the direction of even more severe limitations.</p>
   <p>The driving power behind this agitation is, of course, the desire of the <pb facs="5423404_4_1633.jpg" n="2"/>big industrialists to lower wages or to prevent them from rising. They first tried to accomplish this by means of the open-shop movement, which was an attempt to break up the trade-unions. But this attempt failed dismally, and they are now trying to have the immigration laws changed for their advantage.</p>
   <p>There could scarcely be any valid objection to an increase in immigration if measures were taken to admit only elements which could reasonably be expected to become an asset to the country. But it is a well-known fact that only about half the number of the really desirable immigrants that we are prepared to admit are actually taking advantage of the opportunity to come here. The big industrialists, however, want the least desirable and the least enlightened people, those with the lowest living standards, who would be content to submit to poor working conditions and low wage scales. These people would weaken the position of workers who demand higher living standards.</p>
   <p>We are glad to say, the majority of American workers belong to the latter class.</p>
