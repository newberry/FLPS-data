   <p>In many Swedish churches here in Chicago last Sunday afternoon, memorial services for King Oscar were held. In the Immanuel church, the service was attended by the Royal Swedish Consul Lindgren, and by fifteen foreign consuls. Also officiating were: Dr. G. A. Andreen, prayers were said by Pastors J. W. Swanbeck, and Gottfried Nelson; and address and a song by Gustav Holmquist. A telegram of sympathy to Dowager Queen Sophia was read, and sent later to Stockholm. The churches were decorated in black with the picture of the departed King in front of the church.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian-Americans held a special memorial service for their former King Oscar at Vor Frelsers Kirke last Sunday afternoon with Pastors B. E. Bergesen and Alfred Johnson officiating. The former said "that when the history of Norway is written, the page concerning King Oscar will be one of the most beautiful, and that no word of bitterness is going to be written of it."</p>
   <p>One of the most solemn memorial services for the deceased King Oscar II was <pb facs="5423404_4_0995.jpg" n="2"/>held last Wednesday night in St. Ansgarius Swedish-American Episcopal Church, under the auspices of Svithiod Order. The church was draped in mourning and could not accommodate those who wished to attend the service. The Rector of the church, the Rev. Herman Lindskog, who has delivered so many fine memorial speeches, surpassed himself as an orator when he delivered the memorial address of the late King of Sweden, Oscar II. The Svithiod chorus sang under the direction of Prof. Ortengren.</p>
