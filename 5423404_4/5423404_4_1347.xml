   <p>The Illinois Scandinavian Grand Lodge of I. O. G. T., held its annual meeting August 31 to September 1 and 2 in Waukegan, where 64 delegates from 25 lodges, three children's lodges, and four district lodges were present. The Grand Lodge membership, which at the beginning of the fiscal year, was 2,356, has diminished by 366, leaving a membership of 1,990. This decline in membership is attributed to the greatly curtailed immigration and the military service.</p>

Berg, in behalf of <pb facs="5423404_4_1348.jpg" n="2"/>the Veterans presented Mr. Axel Nelson, with a beautiful World Lodge Regalia, in appreciation of his energetic work in the interest of the Order, during his three years incumbency as Grand Templar.</p>

   <p>"S. T.," John N. Groff, Chicago; "S. R.," Alfred Larson, Rockford, Ill.; "S. V. T.," Andreas Jorgens, Chicago; "S. F. B. T.," Victor Nygren, Rockford; "S. S.," Eric Ericson, Chicago; "S. Skm.," Carl Johanson, Rockford; "S. V. L.," Alf. Sundstedt, Lake Forest, Ill.; "S. S. L.," Mauritz Hokanson, Rockford; "F. S. T.," Axel Nelson, Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. I. E. Odell was elected Deputy Chief of the World Lodge. The next annual meeting will be held in Chicago, at the invitation of the lodge, "The Swedes in Illinois."</p>
