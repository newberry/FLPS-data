   <p>Last week we published an appeal by Miss Alma Hedin of the Save the Children Society of Stockholm, Sweden, in behalf of the hungry, cold and sick children of central and southeastern Europe. The appeal, which was addressed to the Swedish-American public, told of the suffering in those parts of the old world; and much has been written and said about it on other occasions, but we doubt that it is possible to adequately describe the situation in all its misery. But the reports that we have are sufficient to convey to us an idea of the horrible conditions which exist in those countries. The most pitiful war-time stories pale in comparison with what is going on now.</p>
   <p>What makes it so much sadder to contemplate, is the fact that those who are made to suffer the most now are so innocent of any wrong-doing. For they are the children, who certainly have not done anything to cause the plight in <pb facs="5423404_4_0282.jpg" n="2"/>which they are, and whom the world depends on as the future bearers of our civilization. Their mission should be to lead the world in its forward march toward brotherhood and peace. Instead, they are now forced to roam the countryside, more or less naked, in search of food, and, like wild animals, they have to subsist on plants and fruits in fields and forests. Thus the innocent ones must suffer for the crimes of the rulers. What is going to happen to those that survive?</p>
   <p>Save the children! We must save them or watch the next generation go to its destruction before our eyes. If there is any feeling in our hearts at all for innocent sufferers we must show it now.</p>
   <p>The aid proffered by Swedish-Americans, in money and goods, will be added to that tendered by Sweden where the work is already well organized. Many individuals and communities have responded generously. In that manner the maximum efficency in distribution is obtained, and the contributor is assured that his contribution reaches those who need it most.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0283.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Cash contributions will be received by the Tribunen-Nyheter and acknowledged in our columns. The money will be forwarded to the Swedish headquarters in Stockholm. As it would be too difficult for us to handle clothing and other merchandise, such commodities should be sent to Hilmar Lundbeck, care of The Swedish American Line, 24 State Street, New York City.</p>
   <p>There has never been a more deserving cause.</p>
