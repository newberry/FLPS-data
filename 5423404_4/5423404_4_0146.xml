<title level="a">SWEDISH BAPTIST OLD PEOPLE'S HOME DEDICATED</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>The Swedish Colony of Chicago is proud of another Swedish benevolent institution thay have established. The Swedish Baptist Old People's Home at Morgan Park was dedicated on Saturday, September 29. The outstanding lawyer of our Swedish Colony, Harry Olson, was the speaker of the day. He emphasized especially the need of havens for old people, due to the fact that when one gets to be forty-five or fifty years old it is almost impossible to obtain work at a living wage. With such old people's homes they at least have a haven to steer for, where they may enjoy the last years of their lives without the humiliation of being sent to a poor house.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson strongly favored the passage of laws whereby a worn-out, faithful worker would be awarded an old age pension by the State. Such laws are already in force in several European countries, and he saw no reason why such laws could not be enacted in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Other speakers at the dedication were Reverend C. J. Almquist, Superintendent of the Home; Reverend G. A. Hegstrom, president; Dr. Peterson from Minneapolis; J. O. Engstrom from Brooklyn; Reverend L. Arlander from Oakland, Nebraska; Dr. Frank Peterson, Chicago; Dr. R. E. Keating, the physician of the Home.</p>
   <p>A collection for the building fund was taken up, $1,100 being donated. The building cost $13,000 to erect, and every dollar was raised among the Swedes in Chicago and Morgan Park. The institution has proved a success in every way.</p>
   <p>May the Home management experience no difficulty in raising funds necessary to expand their establishment as the applicants for admission increase in number!</p>
