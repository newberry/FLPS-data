   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Synod continued its work yesterday at the church , corner of Sedgwick and Hobbie Streets. The edifice was crowed throughout the day and evening. In the morning the Rev. P. M. Sanquist, of Kansas, preached an elaborate sermon appropriate to the Synodical Communion, which followed. In the afternoon the building was inadequate to accommodate the throng in attendance, the feature being the ordination of nine graduates from the Theological Seminary at Rock Island.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened with singing and prayer, after which the Rev. Dr. Hasselquist preached, taking his text from I. Samuel, iii, 19. This was followed by the reading of selections from the Scriptures, and this by going through the ordination services of the church, which are beautiful and impressive. The following are those ordained: C. A. Swenson, etc, etc.................</p>
   <p>In the evening the exercises were specially for the benefit of the Sunday school, consisting of music and bried addresses.</p>
