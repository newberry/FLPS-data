   <p>One of the latest issues of the Saturday Evening Post contains an editorial which deals with immigration. It is based on a recent statement by Secretary of State Stimson, in which the Secretary points out that the immigration regulations adopted by the Government have prevented at least one million people, who wished to come here, from entering the country. The editorial writer commends the Government's immigration policy, but declares that it was adopted much too late, and that ever since 1890 immigration has been a detriment to the country.</p>
   <p>The editorial goes on to say that immigration is to blame for the great frequency of crime in this country and for the high cost of operating our <pb facs="5423404_4_1586.jpg" n="2"/>public schools, as well as for unemployment and high taxes. And it is further claimed that communists, anarchists, and other revolutionary elements are recruited from the ranks of the immigrants. The writer concludes his discourse with the statement that the Government should have shut the doors on immigration thirty years ago.</p>
   <p>This editorial writer disregards entirely the fact that the population of this country consists of immigrants and the descendants of immigrants. Were it not for immigration the aboriginal redskins would still be in possession of the country. And who deserves most of the credit for the rapid development of the Middle West and the Northwest if not the early immigrants from Northwest Europe, particularly from Germany and the Scandinavian countries? Since the writer insists that since 1890 immigration has not benefited the country why did he not raise his voice in protest when the so-called national origins clause was included in the present immigration law, a clause which provided for a reduction in the number of Protestant <pb facs="5423404_4_1587.jpg" n="3"/>immigrants from the Germanic countries, while it permitted an increased immigration from the Catholic countries of Southeastern Europe?</p>
   <p>It is true that before 1890 immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe was beginning to overtake that from the Northern and Western countries, and it is also true that crime is more prevalent in the former group than in the latter, but both of them have made incalculable contributions to the industrial and commercial development of the country. The importation of Italian gangsters, which has taken place during the last decade for the purpose of handling the illicit alcohol traffic, should not be blamed on immigration but rather on corrupt politics.</p>
   <p>All in all, immigration has been a blessing to America. It has contributed to the cultural as well as to the material progress of the country, and also injected fresh blood into the old population stock. That fact is fully realized by thinking people, but a narrow-minded attitude toward immigration <pb facs="5423404_4_1588.jpg" n="4"/>has, nevertheless, developed during the last few years. The above-mentioned editorial is typical of this attitude. It is prejudiced and misleading and serves no good purpose.</p>
