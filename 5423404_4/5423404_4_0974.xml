   <p>In last week's issue we carried reports of the conventions of about ten great Swedish-American societies, at which tens of thousands of our countrymen were represented. It has been gratifying to observe how Swedish-American organizations have come to life again during the last two years, after having been more or less paralyzed during the war. Mass inductions have taken place more often than at any previous time, and most societies have witnessed a considerable increase in their membership. And, after all, this condition is only natural.</p>
   <p>It is clear that when the public begins to appreciate fully the advantages of belonging to a sick benefit association, the membership of that type of <pb facs="5423404_4_0975.jpg" n="2"/>organization will increase immensely. And when our countrymen discover that those associations in which the Swedish language is used are more advantageous to them than any other, it is equally clear that the Swedish sick benefit associations will begin to prosper.</p>
   <p>Our societies are very useful for reasons other than strictly economic. When one belongs to a society for the sake of the sick benefit, it indicates a desire for economic security; but there is, as a rule, a search for cultural security also, and a double purpose is thus served. The distress caused by cultural isolation can be very great.</p>
   <p>We will conclude these reflections by quoting from Richard Berggren's report on the Vasa convention held in New York last summer. "The delegates to the Grand Lodge were instructed not only to vote against the translation of the ritual into English, but to agitate actively against such a procedure. It had <pb facs="5423404_4_0976.jpg" n="3"/>been rumored that an attempt would be made to make English the official language of the Grand Lodge.</p>
   <p>"The overwhelming sentiment at the convention was that the primary purpose of the Vasa Order is the preservation of our Swedish culture, and that the very essence of that culture is our Swedish language."</p>
