   <p>The May festival which was held last Saturday at the North Side Turner Hall sponsored by Svithiod Club, was well attended by the Swedes. The hall was decorated with Swedish and American flags, palms, and flowers. After the orchestra had played a festival march, the Grand master, Hjalmar Hedin, greeted the crowd and welcomed the public to Svithiod's 28th. May feast. Svithiod Singing Club, under the direction of Prof. John Ortengren, sang several May and spring songs.</p>
   <p>The festival speaker for the evening was the Rev. Herman Lindskog, Rector of St. Ansgarius Swedish-American Episcopal Church. He delivered an inspiring address, straight from his heart. He praised the Swedish May songs because they are forerunners of the spring, whether they are sung in Sweden or in America. Not long after they are sung, and spring will be <pb facs="5423404_4_1186.jpg" n="2"/>here!</p>
   <p>Then came the evening's most beautiful number, the crowning of the May bride, Miss Lilly Hedin, Rector Lindskog did the crowning, and spoke nicely, comparing it with the recent wedding in Russia of Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Princess Maria.</p>
