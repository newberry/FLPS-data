   <p>A new term for the so-called "hyphenated American" has now been coined, namely, "near American", which brings to mind "near beer", a beverage which is being sold in localities where the sale of real beer is prohibited.</p>
   <p>An Episcopalian minister from Oak Park used this new term when he recently addressed a mixed gathering of members of several societies, and discussed such subjects as "undivided citizenship" and related issues. The pastor whose name is Godolphin, boldly attacked the foreign language press in America, and accused it of being instrumental in preventing newcomers to this country from becoming real Americans. It was evident that by "real Americans" he meant those that speak English only, and who cheer for Great Britain during the current war. The pastor's accusations are, of course, both misplaced and unjust. The foreign language press is, as a rule, just as wholeheartedly American as the Anglo-American newspapers, even though <pb facs="5423404_4_0991.jpg" n="2"/>it is not entirely on Britain's side in the present conflict.</p>
   <p>The Sons of the Revolution have started a movement in Washington for the purpose of doing away with the hyphen, which is so irritating and which is supposed to be at the bottom of so much trouble. Vice-president Marshall is said to have declared that when the war is over he will demand a law against it. But this hyphen, denoting the national origin of recent immigrants to this country, has been adopted as a matter of course, and we believe it should be allowed to die a natural death when and if it becomes superfluous. Its significance is historical and cultural, not political.</p>
