   <p>Whenever immigrants are travelling or have settled down one hears about "The poor immigrants."</p>
   <p>Poor? Yes, if one means that they are lacking earthly possessions. Surely he is poor, when he has not even a country he can call his own, because the newly arrived immigrant is in this position, as well as fighting the uncertainties of his new existence. Yes, he is poor, for often he has not more than $10 and has a wife and some times ten children to care for when he arrives in a foreign country. Many have not even a dollar and even more children. But I am of the opinion that while these heroic immigrants in my story lacked gold and property and other worldly goods,.....they possessed qualities more valuable than gold, which consisted of good strong bodies, desire to work, will power, <pb facs="5423404_4_1049.jpg" n="2"/>religion, good manners, simple living. Such were the pillars upon which they founded their wealth. The fruits of their work and ability soon evidenced itself in fertile fields, well filled barns, beautiful homes and money.</p>
   <p>Other treasurers soon came to light, because the spirit of song and music had followed the people from their native land and chosen its home among the oaks. Sometimes it as hard for the older ones, who carried most of the burden, but then the younger ones sang away many a trouble. All the hardship of existence are gone, and the song becomes clearer and louder, as the joy and tone of living becomes more discernible. The songs of the birds are no longer the only music heard because one hears the tunes of a piano from more than one house. The change is noticeable and becomes more so every year, because prosperity is more and more evident and so is the culture; new talents are discovered among the younger generation and a new spiritual world is dawning for all.</p>
   <p>No, the immigrants are not poor. It is not America who makes them rich, but it is they who make America prosperous and rich. But the immigrant knows that despite his strength and will power he could not have become economical or prosperous in <pb facs="5423404_4_1050.jpg" n="3"/>Europe or America. He, therefore, thanks God, who has reserved for him a land like this, where he can use for his own and common good those treasures God has bestowed upon him.</p>
