   <p>Sweden has decreed a nation-wide mourning upon the death of King Oscar II. Swedes in America are to have a part in it. Sunday morning, December 8, at 9:00 A.M. the flag at the Stockholm Castle, Sweden, was lowered half mast, signifying the passing of the old beloved monarch, King Oscar II. The first telegram from a foreign country was a telegram of sympathy from President Roosevelt to the new king of Sweden, Gustav V. It was as follows: "I feel deep sympathy for your Majesty and for the Swedish people for the loss of a glorious father and a respected monarch."</p>
   <p>The new king of Sweden, Gustav V, took the oath at noon in presence of his cabinet and members of the royal household. His motto is: "With the people for the country." The name of his Queen is Victoria. They have three sons. The oldest, Gustav Adolph is now Sweden's crown prince. The funeral of the dead king will take place in Riddarholmskyrkan, December 19. Officiating will be the Most Reverend Ekman, Primate of Sweden, and Archbishop of Upsala, assisted by the Rt. Reverend Billing, Bishop of Lund.</p>

   <p>The Swedes in Chicago voiced their sympathy in the following telegram to the dead monarch's Queen, Sophia: "The Swedes in Chicago mourn deeply and sincerely the passing of the beloved King Oscar, and send your Majesty their sympathy and respect." A committee, headed by the Royal Swedish Consul, John R. Lindgren, decided to hold a service in memory of "King Oscar II Sunday, December 15 at Orchestra Hall with addresses, music, and songs. Dr. A. J. Carlson at the University of Chicago will speak on "King Oscar as a man," and Dr. G. A. Andrew's topic will be: "King Oscar as monarch."</p>
   <p>Another memorial service will be held by the Svithiod Order in St. Ansgariuss Swedish-American Episcopal Church, Wednesday night, December 18, at 8 P.M. The Svithiod chorus will sing, and the Rector of the Church, the Rev. Herman Lindskog will speak. In its obituary, the Svenska Kuriren pays tribute to King Oscar. He has always been a good king to his people and greatly beloved by them.</p>
