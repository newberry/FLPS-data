   <p>At a recent meeting, the Swedish National League decided to invite the Swedish explorer, Sven Hedin, to give a lecture here in Chicago during his forthcoming visit to the United States.</p>
   <p>This occasion, together with similar previous ones, draws attention to the fact that the present Swedish National League is not at all the same organization which was given this name years ago. That name has lost its original significance, and is, therefore, now entirely misleading. We suspect that this fact is unknown to many people both here and in Sweden.</p>
   <p>There was a time when the Swedish National League represented the Swedish public and everything Swedish in Chicago, but that is now a thing of the <pb facs="5423404_4_0225.jpg" n="2"/>past. One of its chief functions then was to find jobs for unemployed Swedes, free of charge. At the present time it has the same rules as any ordinary commercial employment agency, and wants "money on the line."</p>
   <p>With all due respect for Mrs. Othelia Myhrman's energy and talent for organization--she has for years been practically the entire "National League"--the existing remains of the original organization has no right whatsoever to invite Dr. Hedin, or anybody else of similar prominence, in the name of the Swedes of Chicago. What Swedish societies, clubs, parishes, or other organizations does the Swedish National League now represent? In order to avoid further misunderstanding the organization should take a name more indicative of its present scope and activities.</p>
   <p>If a famous and distinguished Swede should come here at the League's invitation, innocently assuming that it is simply a friendly visit to receive the homage of admiring countrymen, he should soon find that <pb facs="5423404_4_0226.jpg" n="3"/>there is more to it than that, and that his name has been used as bait byselfish interests in order to make money. If our memory serves us correctly, that was exactly what happened two years ago, when Minister Lagerkrantz visited our city.</p>
   <p>It is high time that people both here in America and back home in Sweden become acquainted with the real standing of the Swedish National League. They should be informed that it is a private organization, which does not represent the Swedish public of Chicago.</p>
