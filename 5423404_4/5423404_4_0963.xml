<title level="a">THE LANGUAGE QUESTION IN OUR CHURCHES</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A few days ago, we read in one of the official church organs that a congregation in Austin, Chicago, had decided, on the recommendation of its pastor, to return to the old arrangement of conducting the Sunday school separately from the Sunday morning gospel service. Both in the Sunday school and in the church, the Swedish language is used exclusively, and it is worth noting that the pastor in question was born and raised in America.</p>
   <p>On the same day, we also received a report from the meeting which was held last October by the Association of English Churches. At that meeting, the language question within the Augustana Synod came up for discussion and the opinions expressed by several speakers were tolerant and sensible. The reason for such a broad-minded attitude is undoubtedly that those members of this Association who have thought the matter over carefully, do not feel <pb facs="5423404_4_0964.jpg" n="2"/>that any propaganda in behalf of the English language in America is necessary. The English took care of that a long time ago, and no missionary activity is required at this time in order to preserve the predominance of English in this country. Most of the English-speaking congregations, with a view to the future, seem to feel that the English language should be given equality with Swedish within the Augustana Synod, and that attitude is quite reasonable. The problem will in time solve itself automatically.</p>
   <p>But the same report cites a pastor whose contribution to the discussion indicates anything but tolerance and understanding. The speaker seems to forget that the religion which he tries to impart in the English language is the same as that which was preached to our forefathers in Swedish. He claims that, for sixty years now, religion has taken second place to the language question in the Augustana Synod. The answer to this assertion is that, if it is true, the religion and the task to which he has dedicated himself cannot amount to much.</p>
   <p>When he compares Swedish language with castor oil which is being forced <pb facs="5423404_4_0965.jpg" n="3"/>down children's throats, and which they have to swallow against their will, he confesses his lack of regard for the purposes of the church and for the people without whom there would be no Synod and no congregation. We suspect that he does not know the men who are his co-workers and leaders within the Synod--such men as Dr. Brandelle, its president, and Dr. Lincoln, to mention just two, or Pastor Sjogren, the president of the Association of English Churches. They were all born in this country and received their religious training within the Swedish-American church. Was their religion forced upon them in Swedish as castor oil is forced upon unwilling children?</p>
   <p>We are sure they will be the first to agree that they are spiritually richer and have a deeper understanding of both religious and worldly problems than would be the case had they not come to know the religion of their fathers in their fathers' language. It has been said that with every new language a person learns, a new soul is born within him.</p>
   <p>The comparison between Swedish and castor oil was based upon a talk which the pastor once had with a young girl who told him how she had hated to study <pb facs="5423404_4_0966.jpg" n="4"/>the Swedish primer, and how she had to memorize the Swedish catechism without understanding it. Anybody who was born and raised in Sweden had exactly that same experience. We have never seen a child who took any great pleasure in studying the primer of any language, and what child has ever understood the catechism?</p>
   <p>The pastor went on to say that from now on we should not import pastors from Sweden. He might as well have said that our congregations should not admit as members those who come from that country. As a matter of course, the church imparts religious instruction in English to those who do not understand Swedish, and in Swedish for those unable to understand English. On the day that immigration will have ceased, there will be some justification for the pastor's remarks. But even fifty years ago there was much talk about stopping immigration, and yet immigration is still continuing. And the Swedish churches will for some time continue to need Swedish pastors.</p>
   <p>The speaker seemed to consider the activities of the church from a political rather than from the religious and cultural point of view. Our churches <pb facs="5423404_4_0967.jpg" n="5"/>should be entirely free of politics, but in that respect they still have a good deal in common with the old Roman church.</p>
   <p>The whole attitude of the good pastor is explained by his complaint that his church is being called a foreign church. But he does not deserve much sympathy on that count. We believe that the fundamental purpose of genuine Americanism is to train everybody in such a manner that they become good citizens and good people. In our opinion, the Swedish contribution to this kind of Americanism is second to none, and we can well use some more of it. We also believe that the Swedish spirit can thrive within English-speaking congregations, and it is a pleasure to note that some of their leaders have absorbed and preserved within themselves the essence of Swedish culture.</p>
