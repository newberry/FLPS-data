  <body>
   <p>The President by special proclamation has designated the Fourth of July as the foreign-born citizens' day in appreciation of their loyalty. The program with the exception of the speakers is ready. The Swedish Choral Club some time ago announced that it would sing, and so will the Swedish Singers' League. [Instrumental] music will be furnished by the Swedish-American Orchestra, and a large American flag will be dedicated.</p>
   <p>Several independent societies have announced that they will march to the festival grounds, but a joint parade of all societies is hardly possible with so many of their officers, leaders, and members in the service.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the Vasa Order, the Viking Order, and the Scandinavian League had a meeting Thursday evening at the Viking Order's office, where those present all expressed themselves against any joint parade.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1114.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A parade was not considered necessary in order to make the day a success; besides, its cost would be too great for the many different societies, which not only have many of their members in the ranks but also are contributing heavily to various calls for funds. The delegates promised, each within his organization, to appeal to all members to take part in the festivities and to do their share toward making this day a grand success.</p>
   <p>By the chairman of the independent societies' committee, Mr. Joel Soderlund, the following appeal has been issued:</p>
   <p>"At a meeting of representatives from the independent Swedish societies it was unanimously decided that since President Wilson had proclaimed the Fourth of July as the foreign-born citizens' day in appreciation of their loyalty, all representatives of the Swedish race should be invited to meet at La Salle Street between North and Chicago Avenues and to march en masse past Lincoln's statue, where the Swedish-American Ladies of Chicago and the Swedish Branch of <pb facs="5423404_4_1115.jpg" n="3"/>the War Savings Committee will fall in, then north in Lincoln Park to the festival grounds at the end of Fullerton Avenue near the Linne monument. It was further decided that American flags of any and all dimensions shall be carried ahead of the procession, followed by banners, emblems, and service flags of the various societies which participate. Then will follow Americans of Swedish birth or descent, regardless of the society or club to which they belong, with only one purpose in mind, to show the undoubted loyalty to his country of every American citizen of Swedish race."</p>
   <p>To Swedish-born ladies the following appeal has been sent us for publication:</p>
   <p>"An appeal to all Swedish-born ladies in Chicago and vicinity! At a meeting held in Chief Justice Harry Olson's chambers on Saturday, June 15, attended by representatives from all the Swedish ladies' organizations in Chicago, it was resolved that we as American citizens of Swedish birth should participate in the grand patriotic demonstration planned by the Swedish population of Chicago <pb facs="5423404_4_1116.jpg" n="4"/>for the Fourth of July in Lincoln Park. All our Swedish-born ladies living in Chicago are most cordially invited to take part in this demonstration. We shall assemble at Lincoln's statue at 2 P. M., from which in orderly fashion we shall march five blocks to the Linne monument, where we shall be joined by the rest of the parade.</p>
   <p>"It was also decided that all participants shall be dressed in white, and that each shall carry an American flag. Let us all on this day in a worthy manner show our loyalty and patriotism."</p>
