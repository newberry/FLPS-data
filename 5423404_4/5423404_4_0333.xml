   <p>Mr. Robert Lindblom, president of the Central Aids Committee of Chicago, has received the following letter of thanks from the Central Aids Committee of Stockholm, Sweden:</p>
   <p>"To the Central Committee of Chicago for the Collection of Funds for the Destitute in Sweden:</p>
   <p>"The Central Aids Committee, having completed its task, desires to express to you its deep gratitude for your energetic work which resulted in the collection of such a magnificent sum--the largest of all the great sums collected in America--for the benefit of our compatriots in those northern parts of our country which have suffered from crop-damage.</p>
   <p>"As will appear from the records of the Committee, which will be forwarded to you as soon as they are printed, it has been possible to prevent much intense suffering, thanks to the sizeable contributions of which such a large share has been collected among our compatriots on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0334.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The Committee begs to request that you convey to the contributors to your Committee our heartfelt thanks for their great assistance during this trying year. The Committee also desires to thank you for your splendid and valuable collaboration in this greatly needed task.</p>
   <p>"On behalf of the Central Aids Committee,</p>
   <p>Juhlin-Dannfelt,</p>
   <p>J. Stadling."</p>
