   <p>For some time services in the First Swedish Methodist Church, at Oak and Orleans Streets, have been disrupted by a gang of young loafers in that neighborhood. On Thursday evening, the twenty-three-year-old Louis Lutz, accompanied by several companions, tried to enter this church during the service. Hjalmar Westberg, the church beadle, met them at the door and refused to let them enter. The young men left, but returned in a few minutes reinforced by other youths. To scare the gang away Westberg fired two shots. One of the shots struck Lutz in the back, bringing him down; this aroused the ire of the gang who assaulted Westberg, intending to manhandle him. Westberg then took flight but police officers Stromberg and Belsky took him in hand and did all they could to protect him from the angry gang until the patrol wagon full of officers arrived from the Chicago Avenue station. Westberg was quietly taken to the police station and Lutz was taken to the Passavant <pb facs="5423404_4_0373.jpg" n="2"/>Hospital, where his wound was pronounced serious.</p>
   <p>A conference with the clergy of the Lake View district revealed the disturbances at various churches and the result is the increase of patrolmen on duty during church services. The gangs who have found pleasure in disturbing worship in the neighborhood will have to find other activities for their pleasure.</p>
