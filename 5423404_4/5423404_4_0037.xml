   <p>A well-attended festival took place Friday evening in Orchestra Hall. After the prayer, the hymn "Our God Is Our Refuge" was sung by the audience. Dr. Andreen explained the purpose of the festival, which, he said, was to get the Augustana people to harmonize with the Mission and the Augustana Hospital, to which the proceeds will be donated.</p>
   <p>Alfred J. Pearson, professor at the State University of Des Moines, Ia., gave a very interesting speech, in which he pointed out that which the Swedish, people have done, especially their progress in putting their stamp on this country's English literature (sic). He spoke of the Swedes as new builders and pioneers ever since the first ones came to this country, and he mentioned many prominent Swedes who have performed great invaluable services to the United States. The National's Choir and the Wennerberg Choir, under Professor Emil Larson, sung splendidly some of Sweden's prettiest songs. Professor and Mrs. Frederick Frederichsen pleased the audience with their music. The last number on the program, "Lilla Messa," was sung by seven singers. It was the first time August Soderman's play had been played in Chicago. </p>
