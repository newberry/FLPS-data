   <p>Saturday, the Swedish Singers' League held a special Song meeting in King's Hall, where songs, which are to be sung at the Ambulance Society's great meeting in Medina Temple March 10, were practiced. Several questions of importance were considered and decided upon. One of these was that the singers should go to Graceland Cemetery in a group on the approaching Decoration Day, and with song honor the memory of singers and friends of song, who have passed into the Great Beyond.</p>
   <p>It was also agreed, as in previous years, to honor the memory of the Swedish Flower King, "Linne," with a song program at his statue in Lincoln Park. The date for this festivity was set for May 25. All singers belonging to the League.</p>

   <p>Many singing societies are requested to be present at the meeting March 10, where several important questions, which were tabled at the last meeting, will receive a final consideration.</p>
