   <p>The American Daughters of Sweden, Chapter One, held their annual meeting at the Swedish Club, on Wednesday evening, January 26, at 8 P.M. Mrs. F. T. Westberg was chosen president. She is well known among church people in this city. During the last three years she has been treasurer of the Women's Church Federation Protectorate, an organization with offices at 25 North Dearborn Street. This organization concerns itself with girls who are strangers in Chicago and with immigrants. In the last year it has assisted about a thousand immigrants and eighteen hundred other girls. Mrs. Westberg is also secretary of the Augustana Home Mission, which has established a nursery at 2042 Lane Court. She is vice-president of the Lutheran Women's League of Chicago and Vicinity and a member of the board of directors of the Federation for Aged and Adult Charities. She is also president of the South Side Augustana Synod's campaign for Swedish America's three-hundred-year jubilee. With such leadership this chapter is prepared for a lot of very active work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1081.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first vice-president is Mrs. Emmy Evald. It is hardly necessary to present this brilliant woman. Our Swedish countrymen, both here and in Sweden, know her and her work. The second vice-president is Mrs. W. A. Nelson, also president of the Linnea Society on the South Side, a non-sectarian charitable organization among our people. The third vice-president is Mrs. Carl Highfield, who is among our friends in the Mission Alliance. The recording secretary is Mrs. J. C. Mathison, who has accomplished a lot of good work for the Bethany Home for the Aged. The corresponding secretary is Mrs. Hjalmar Lundquist; the financial secretary is Mrs. Charles Rosherg, a woman of extensive interests and connected with the Swedish Societies' Old People's Home in Evanston; the treasurer is Mrs. Max Hedman, also well known. The board of directors has fifteen members, of whom all are prominent women.</p>
   <p>This organization must be congratulated. Two teams have been organized to work for the three-hundred-year jubilee of the arrival of the first Swedes in America, one under the leadership of C. A. Carson, and one under Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, who was president of the chapter this last year. The <pb facs="5423404_4_1082.jpg" n="3"/>present membership is seven hundred, and the chapter is steadily growing.</p>
   <p>It is already a certainty that this organization will make great progress and become a club of which Swedish women may justly feel proud.</p>
   <p>Mrs. F. T. Westberg,</p>
   <p>[President]</p>
