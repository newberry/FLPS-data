   <p>The report for 1914 has now been published, and shows that the Home in North Evanston is filled to capacity. Forty-nine aged people are being cared for in the institution. Since its opening it has provided a home for ninety-three dependent old people. About one third of this number has been admitted entirely free of charge, while the rest have contributed $26,500 toward their own maintenance, or $275 per person. The total cost of caring for the residents is about $6,500 per year, or $138 per person, and the $275 which some of them have paid thus covers the cost of a two-year stay at the Home. Some of them have now lived there for thirteen years. More than three fourths of the operating expenses must, therefore, come from outside sources such as friends and benevolent organizations, and to that extent the Home is a charitable institution.</p>
   <p>Its board of directors and other members of the League connected with its administration work without pay. The value of the Home and its furnishings is conservatively estimated at $50,000.</p>
