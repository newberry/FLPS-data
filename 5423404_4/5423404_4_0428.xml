   <p>Almost every day during the last few weeks, the newspapers have carried reports of murders or attempted murders in Chicago; the situation seems to be getting worse instead of improving.</p>
   <p>Last year, according to official records, 118 murders were committed in our city, as compared with fifteen in Paris and twenty in London; thus Chicago is leading those two world centers in the proportion of about eight to one and six to one respectively. When one considers that the British capital has a population at least three times as large as that of Chicago, and that its criminals are reputed to be the most vicious in the world, one must wonder just what causes this high murder rate here.</p>
   <p>It is not likely that the hoodlums, thieves, and bandits of those European <pb facs="5423404_4_0429.jpg" n="2"/>capitals have any more real regard for the sacredness of human life than their Chicago colleagues. We suspect that the reason they ply their trade in a less bloody and murderous manner is that, over there, the tools of murder are not as easily accessible as they are here.</p>
   <p>While in the European cities there is strict control not only over the sale of weapons but also over those that may carry them on their person, here in Chicago any tramp is permitted to carry about with him a revolver, brass knuckles, knives of all descriptions, burglary and other tools, depending upon his needs.</p>
   <p>According to police records, of all suspects arrested here during 1902, not less than 911 carried a revolver--not to mention those that were in possession of knives and stilettos.</p>
   <p>And it is a curious fact that most of the stores dealing in murderous weapons <pb facs="5423404_4_0430.jpg" n="3"/>are located in districts most often frequented by the lawless element. Receivers of stolen goods, whose places of business are often called pawnshops, display revolvers and other types of weapons in their windows, and anybody may buy with no questions asked.</p>
   <p>To be sure, there is a law making it compulsory for a dealer to keep an account of his sales of weapons, and also to keep on record the name and address of the buyer, but it is safe to say that this law is not being observed. If one has got the price, he can without much difficulty buy anything he wants.</p>
   <p>Of the 118 persons who were murdered in Chicago in 1903, seventy-eight were shot to death, and it is reasonable to conclude that if revolvers had not been so easily obtainable, the number of those killed in this manner would have been less.</p>
   <p>We need a law by means of which the sale of revolvers and other weapons to <pb facs="5423404_4_0431.jpg" n="4"/>unworthy persons may be effectively checked. Also,the police should at all times be on the sharpest lookout for persons carrying such weapons.</p>
   <p>If such precautions were taken, the number of murder victims would decrease, as well as the number of those unhappy perpetrators [of crime] that we now send to the penitentiary and to the gallows.</p>
