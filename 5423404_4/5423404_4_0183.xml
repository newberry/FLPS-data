   <p>The Chicago Lutheran Home Mission Society held its annual membership meeting last Wednesday, February 23, at the Central Home, 1346 North La Salle Street.</p>
   <p>The report submitted by the president of the Society, Pastor J. Jesperson, was very encouraging, as was the financial report which was read by the treasurer, Louis M. Nelson. During 1920 the gross income amounted to $33,241.40, and the value of buildings and other properties increased $10,000. The society's liabilities were reduced according to plans. Pastors C. O. Bengtson, Carl Christenson and Gottfred Olsson, and also the laymen Axel Ostrand, Chas. E. Hallberg, C. G. Brunell and Emanuel Munson were newly elected members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The board of directors was authorized to expend $50,000 on an addition to the Central Home. It has been evident for some time that there is a real need in Chicago for a larger Lutheran Home and hospice.</p>

   <p>The past year was by far the most successful one in the history of the Society. At the end of the meeting, the president, on behalf of the organization, thanked all those who with their time, talent and money had contributed to its welfare and success.</p>
