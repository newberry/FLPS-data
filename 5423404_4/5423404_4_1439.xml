   <p>The Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America held its annual convention last week here in Chicago, and at the same time observed the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding.</p>
   <p>The convention was held at North Park College, and was opened by the Swedish Mission Covenant's president, Reverend C.A. Bjork, last Tuesday night. Delegates from many distant parts of the country attended. Dr. P. Waldenstrom of Sweden is here for the occasion as a representative of Swedish Mission Covenant organizations. At the opening meeting he delivered greetings from friends in the fatherland, and read a message from the King of Sweden, in which His Majesty in complimentary terms congratulated the Mission Covenant on its great work, and wished it continued success. This message was also read during the concert, the following night, and on both occasions it was received with great ovations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1440.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The concert in Orchestra Hall Wednesday night was very successful, and every seat in the great hall was taken. The outstanding feature of the program was the jubilee cantata, "A Song of Praise," sung jointly by the Mission Covenant's excellent choirs.</p>
   <p>At Thursday's meeting the report was read and discussed, and on Friday new officers were elected. They are: Reverend E.G. Hjerpe of Chicago, president; Reverend E.A. Skogsbergh of Seattle, Washington, vice-president; Reverend M.J. Eggan of Chicago, secretary. Reverend T.A. Frykman of Jamestown, New York,was appointed president of North Park College, and Reverend C.A. Bjork, retiring president of the Mission Covenant, was named honorary president for life with a pension.</p>
   <p>On Friday night a meeting was held at the Mission Church on the North Side during which a congratulatory telegram from President Taft was read and received with much appreciation by the delegates. At this meeting pastors <pb facs="5423404_4_1441.jpg" n="3"/>of various Swedish-American denominations delivered messages of greeting and good will from their congregations.</p>
   <p>Saturday afternoon ten divinity graduates were ordained into the ministry at a ceremony at North Park College, and two young men were ordained as missionaries to Alaska. At another ceremony later in the evening, three nurses who had completed their training at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Bowmanville, Illinois were given their diplomas.</p>
   <p>The festivities ended last Sunday when some seven thousand people participated during the day, and a song service in the Mission Church signified the passing of the first half-century of the Swedish Mission Covenant's history.</p>
