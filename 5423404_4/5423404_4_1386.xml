   <p>The First Swedish Free Church congregation, whose temple is located on the southeast corner of Berwyn and Ashland Avenues, is about to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. This congregation dates back to the time when Swedes were numerous on the near North Side, and its original name was the Oak Street Mission. Among its founders was the noted educator, Professor J. G. Princell, who died some sixteen years ago.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that ten of the charter members are still living and taking part in the activities of the church. Among them is Mrs. Princell, the widow of the founder. She is a frequent contributor to Chicago-Bladet, the Free Church publication. Another charter member is M. C. Holm, well-known <pb facs="5423404_4_1387.jpg" n="2"/>singer and musician.</p>
   <p>For many years now, the activities of this congregation have centered around the Summerdale district, and its church, which was dedicated in January, 1926, is one of the finest in that part of the city.</p>
   <p>During the past fifty years this church has been served by seven pastors; namely, J. G. Princell, J. W. Stromberg, Axel Nordin, G. A. Young, Victor Swift, A. L. Anderson, and Frank W. Anderson. The latter has been its pastor for the last seventeen years.</p>
   <p>The fiftieth anniversary will be marked by a great Bible conference, which will begin Tuesday, November 18, with opening addresses by Reverend Frank W. Anderson and Reverend G. A. Young. A detailed program for the conference will be found in the next issue of this newspaper.</p>
