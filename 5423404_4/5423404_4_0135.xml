   <p>As previously reported, the Old People's Home Society sold its property in Park Ridge last February, and made immediate preparations for building a more modern structure in another locality. A committee was appointed to pick the most suitable place for the new home, and North Evanston was agreed upon. A corner lot at Evanston Avenue and Grant Street, 428 feet wide and 190 feet deep, was for sale for $5,500, and it was decided to buy it. At a recent meeting the building plans prepared by Architect Andrew Sandgren were approved and accepted, and the home, when completed, will cost $100,000. At the present time the Society has at its disposal only $18,000, and only the middle section of the building will be completed now, while the wings will be left for a more opportune time. The work has been given to the contractor, Peter J. Plantin, and is to be completed by August 15 of this year, at a cost of $27,000.</p>
   <p>When the whole building is finished it will be a dignified monument to <pb facs="5423404_4_0136.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish-Chicago. It faces Evanston Avenue, and the style is colonial, with Ionic columns in the center. The building material will be a cement compound with the outer surfaces covered with pressed stone; the cornices will be of cut stone. The interior is to be both attractive and practical, with oak woodwork throughout. The right wing will contain an auditorium, and the basement will include dining room, kitchen, baths, and storerooms. The home is planned so as to accommodate fifty aged residents.</p>
