   <p>General C.J.Stalbrand, who was Artillery Chief in John A. Logan's regiment, died yesterday in Charleston, S.C.</p>
   <p>It would not be fair to the memory of this man to say, only these few words, because Stalbrand was one of our most prominent Swedish-Americans. General Sherman said at one time that Stalbrand was the bravest man in the armies of The Union.</p>
   <p>Stalbrand was born in 1821 in Skane, Sweden. He was enrolled in Wendes Artillery Regiment, where he was promoted to a sergeant. He resigned and came to America, and landed in Chicago, where he struggled hard to make a living. He got work in the "Recorders Office," and later became chairman of the Svea Society.</p>
   <p>Then the Civil War broke out and Stalbrand enrolled as Captain of Company G in the Illinois 2nd Artillery Regiment on March 4, 1861. He was promoted <pb facs="5423404_4_1569.jpg" n="2"/><!-- 5423404_4_1568 omitted, duplicate of 5423404_4_1569 -->to Major at the end of the same year. General Logan very much appreciated Stalbrand's service.</p>
   <p>Stalbrand was sent by General Sherman to Washington to inform Pres. Lincoln of Sherman's famous march through Georgia and that he had occupied Savannah.</p>
   <p>When Abraham Lincoln had read the reports and was going to bid the messenger farewell he said, "Goodby, Brigade General Stalbrand."</p>
   <p>Stalbrand had thus advanced from a sergeant in a Swedish Artillery Regiment to the post of Brigade General in the glorious army of the Great Republic!</p>
   <p>We find Stalbrand as the owner of a plantation in South Carolina after the war He was elected to Congress in 1870. Although Stalbrand was not very well known among the younger generation of our countrymen in the United States we will never forget that Carl Johan Stalbrand was very prominent in the great fight for the Union.</p>
   <p>"Peace over his memory." </p>
