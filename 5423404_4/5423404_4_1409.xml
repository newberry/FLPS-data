<title level="a">THE MISSION LEAGUE'S CONVENTION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Swedish Mission League of America held its fortieth annual convention in Chicago June 18-22.</p>
   <p>The various reports showed that the organization is enjoying steady progress. Of special interest to Chicagoans was the announcement that during the past year a fund of $350,000 was collected for the continued operation and expansion of North Park College, the League's school in North Park.</p>
   <p>This year, the Mission League observes its fortieth anniversary. These have been active years for the mission friends, and their organization has done much good in various fields. It is represented by a total of 469 preachers, and is engaged in educational work among immigrants and young people, besides operating hospitals, homes for the aged, and children's homes, and publishing newspapers and periodicals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1410.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There is friendly co-operation between the American organization and the Mission League in Sweden, and they send delegates to each other's conventions. Two prominent mission leaders from Sweden were present at the Chicago convention.</p>
