   <p>The First Swedish Methodist Church at Oak and Orleans Streets observed the sixty-third anniversary of its founding with a homecoming reunion last Sunday, April 25.</p>
   <p>Former members of the congregation who are now living in other parts of the city or outside the city were invited, and a special effort was made to locate the oldest ones. The committee in charge of the celebration went in for some nifty detective work, with the result that several of those who belonged to the church in the early days were found and asked to attend the affair, thus making it much more interesting.</p>
   <p>During the day the congregation was addressed by Pastors N. O. Westergren, K. H. Elmstrom, William Swenson, A. N. Sorlin, and Alfred Anderson.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1428.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Pastor Westergren is now eighty years old. Alfred Anderson, the present pastor, came to the congregation many years ago, and is well known among Methodists throughout the country.</p>
