   <p>The Swedish National League held its regular annual meeting at the Sherman Hotel last Monday. A new board of directors was elected. For president, John E. Ericsson, one of the League's honorary members, was elected unanimously, as were most of the officers; first vice-chairman, Allen Johnson; second vice-chairman, Mrs. Tillie Nordstrom; secretary, A. W. Berglind; treasurer, Harry S. Sandburg. The trustees, elected were: A. W. Johnson, with forty-seven votes; Franklin Lundquist, with forty-four votes; and Oscar S. Ohlander, with twenty-eight votes.</p>
   <p>The reports of the secretary and treasurer were accepted together with that of the finance committee. There was $836.50 cash on hand against $733.02 at the beginning of the year. Among the larger items of expense is noted one <pb facs="5423404_4_1108.jpg" n="2"/>of five hundred dollars for the charity committee, which used $350 for charity within the city, and one of one hundred dollars for the fire victims in Minnesota. Eric Hagberg reported for this committee which was appointed to collect funds for the benefit of the suffering Minnesota countrymen, victims of forest fires. The committee had already collected more than $700. It is expected the amount will increase to $1000 before the end of the month.</p>
