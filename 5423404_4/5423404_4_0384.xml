   <p>We are living in a time when the public is checking up on the service of its public servants, especially the so-called political bosses. Our own countryman, John A. Linn, the Swedish-American clerk of the Circuit Court, could not evade his Nemesis. As stated elsewhere in this issue, the often referred to Nemesis caught up with him, and he pleaded guilty.</p>
   <p>It is a sad thing for the Swedish-American colony of Chicago to see one of its countrymen, a public official at that, spend the greater part of his remaining life behind prison walls because of his own dishonesty.</p>
   <p>We are not inclined to increase any man's burden, but after seriously considering the charges made and proofs presented, we cannot criticize his sentence as being severe. On the other hand, in considering the entire case, he received a very light sentence. His pleading guilty had much to do with the leniency shown him in receiving such a light sentence.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0385.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The lax supervision of such offices as those he held made misappropriation of County funds easy and customary. In spite of this condition, considering, too, that Linn not being a poor man, but rather wealthy from private business profits, we cannot feel that no sympathy should be shown him. His personal financial condition was no reason whatever for his becoming a thief. Our sympathy unstintedly goes to his family, who will suffer with shame wherever they may be known, through no fault of their own. One result was the resignation of his son, who was a prominent official of the Board of Commissioners of Lincoln Park.</p>
