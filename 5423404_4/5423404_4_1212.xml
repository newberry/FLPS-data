   <p>The concert given by the Svithiod Singing Club [Swedish male chorus] at their hall on Wrightwood Avenue was a complete success. The well-arranged program and prominent guest artists drew a full house.</p>
   <p>The Svithiod chorus opened the program with the stirring "Mitt Fosterland" (My Fatherland), drawing the limit of enthusiastic and appreciative applause. The following number on the program was played by Miss Elsie Oberg, violinist: Vieuxtemps'" Bohemienne Concerto," Op. 40. A baritone solo was then rendered by N. W. Anthony. Next on the program was Miss Clara Svenson, who is already quite highly esteemed by the eastern musical public.....</p>
   <p>The storm of applause left no doubt in anyone's mind as to her having won the hearts of her Chicago countrymen, with her wonderful talent and personality.</p>

   <p>The final number was Lindblad's "Stridsbon" (Battle Prayer) sung by the Svithiod Chorus in a most masterful manner. Their encore number was "Du Gamla, Du Friska" (Thou Aged, Thou Active) with the popular Swedish tenor, William Dahlen, singing the solo portions. The concert was followed by dancing, which lasted well into the night.</p>
