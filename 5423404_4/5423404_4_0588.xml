   <p>If the decision rendered by Judge Landis in the controversy between the employers and the unions in the building industry is accepted by both parties, it is expected that construction will experience a great upswing in the near future....</p>
   <p>The Swedish architect Andrew Sandegren has just completed the drawings for a large apartment building which is to be erected on the northeast corner of Sheridan Road and Lunt Avenue at an estimated cost of $300,000. It will be named the Erdanelle Apartment Hotel, and the builders and owners are S. A. Danielson and John S. Erickson. It will be four stories high and will contain fifty-four apartments, which are expected to be ready for occupancy next April.</p>
   <p>A. F. Carlson has just started the construction of an apartment building at <pb facs="5423404_4_0589.jpg" n="2"/>Simpson Street and Sherman Avenue, in Evanston. It will contain thirty-six apartments, and the cost is estimated at $160,000.</p>
   <p>E. R. Peterson will soon begin construction on an apartment building at Haskins Avenue and Juneway and Jonquil Terraces. It will contain thirty-six apartments, and the cost is estimated at $175,000. Paul F. Olson is the architect.</p>
