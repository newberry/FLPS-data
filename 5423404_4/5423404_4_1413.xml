   <p>The old edifice located at Sedgwick and Hobbie Streets, which may truly be called the cradle of the Augustana Synod, will be offered as a gift to the Illinois Conference, to be used for whatever purposes it is best suited. This was the unanimous decision made at the last meeting of the congregation. The transfer will be made as soon as the new temple is ready for use.</p>
   <p>This decision will please everybody who is interested in the activities of the early Chicago Swedes, and who may have entertained some fear in regard to the future fate of this old, historical structure, which is so rich in memories, and which undoubtedly ranks among the most interesting Swedish churches in this country. Many a Swede has been wondering whether this venerable house of worship would eventually be sold to strangers or simply be torn down, as has happened to so many other monuments to early Swedish enterprise here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the banquet which was recently given in honor of Mrs. Emmy Ewald, the Swedish <pb facs="5423404_4_1414.jpg" n="2"/>consul, Carl O. Von Dardel, voiced similar apprehensions, and expressed the hope that some means might be found whereby the old church might be preserved and retained in the custody of the Conference. On the same occasion, Dr. Peter Peterson stated that he was confident that it would always remain the property of Swedish Lutherans.</p>
   <p>Just what use will be made of the church in the future has not yet been definitely decided. It will, most likely, be used for some missionary activity and for special meetings.</p>
