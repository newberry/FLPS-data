   <p>A group of prominent Chicago Swedes has obtained an option on a large tract of land near Itasca, Illinois, and is planning to establish a country club whose members will be Swedes from Chicago and vicinity. The land comprises two hundred acres, and is located close to the St. Paul Railroad and to highways leading to Chicago. The site is considered ideal in every respect. Near by is the Medinah Country Club.</p>
   <p>The agreement stipulates that unless a certain amount of the purchase price is paid on or before next February 1, the deal is void. A drive for the signing of charter members is now going on. It seems that prospective members are being offered a very attractive proposition. An excellent golf course will be laid out on the property, and there is a fine place for an artificial lake. The area is so large that it is planned to subdivide parts of it into <pb facs="5423404_4_1089.jpg" n="2"/>building lots, where charter members will have an opportunity to build summer homes, or, for that matter, year-round homes. It is considered likely that the value of such homes will increase considerably in the course of a few years.</p>
   <p>The proposed name of the club is the "Nordic Country Club", The organizing committee consists of C. Hjalmar Lundquist, Geo. E. Carlson, C. Hilding Anderson, Franklin C. E. Lundquist, Rudolph W. N. West, Joel C. Carlson, Herman W. Carlson, Nils J. Lindskog, Chas. R. Rosberg, and E. F. T. Lundquist.</p>
