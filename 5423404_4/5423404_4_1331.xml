   <p>Our Forefathers Day was celebrated last Saturday at Central Music Hall in a big way. When the Nordstjernan band opened with the"Festival Overture "every seat in the richly decorated hall was occupied by interested Swedes.</p>
   <p>The platform was nicely adorned with American and Swedish flags. The chairman for the evening, Lawyer N.N.Cronholm, opened the meeting and asked the Rev. C.A. Evald to read a prayer.</p>
   <p>Cronholm spoke thereafter in English. He mentioned the history of Sweden. "Here in America," he said,"Swedes are known for their industry, labor and quietness. One would never find among them any nihilists, anarchists, socialist, or other "1sts."</p>
   <p>Mayor Cregier said some nice things in regard to the Swedes good work in Chicago and of their doing their share to build up the city. The next speaker was the <pb facs="5423404_4_1332.jpg" n="2"/>Rev. Herman Lindskog, followed by Editor J.A.Enander, who was the main speaker of the evening.</p>
