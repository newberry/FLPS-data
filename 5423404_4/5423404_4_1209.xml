   <p>The Swedish-American Republican Club held its annual state meeting at the La Salle Theatre on Friday March 9. The meeting was opened at 11:00 A.M. by Julius Johnson, and the delegates were welcomed by Mayor Dunne. Various committees gave some very satisfying reports, and committees for the coming year were appointed as follows........ J.E. Swanson, treasurer, reported receipts $635.92; disbursements $404.85, and a balance on hand of $231.07. The auditing committee having approved the report, it was enthusiastically accepted.</p>
   <p>Among the officers elected for the coming year are the following Chicagoans: John Kjellander, Gustaf Peterson, and Axel Thompson... On Friday, March 10, the club held its annual John Ericsson banquet at the Auditorium. Over seven hundred were served at the <pb facs="5423404_4_1210.jpg" n="2"/>banquet, while Edwin A. Olson, a Chicago attorney, officiated as master of ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The main speaker of the evening was Charles J. Bonaparte, who spoke on "The American Navy," especially emphasizing the invention of the "Monitor" by John Ericsson, the Swede, whose idea of a revolving turret has been followed by all navies of the world.</p>
   <p>Lawrence Y. Sherman, Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, gave a very interesting and enlightening talk on the anarchists and their friends in America, berating Congress unsparingly for its lack of interest in stopping the anarchistic agitators in our country.</p>
   <p>A first class sextette entertained during the banquet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1211.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The fact that Chicago's big daily papers have finally recognized the prominence and influence of the organized Swedes caused us to be both surprised and pleased to see such a number of reporters and cameramen representing these papers during both the business meetings and the John Ericsson banquet.</p>
