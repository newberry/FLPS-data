   <p>Last Thursday, Midsummer Day, the Swedish Methodist Bethania Home for the Aged celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding. Friends of the Home gathered in large numbers for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The program opened at two o'clock in the afternoon with song and music by visiting choirs, and speeches by Professor C. G. Wallenius and Reverend Alfred Anderson. The latter, who has taken an active interest in the Home since its founding, reviewed the history of the institution.</p>
   <p>The need of a home for aged people made itself felt early among the Swedish Methodist Congregations in the Middle West. But it was at the district meeting in 1889 that definite plans were begun. A committee was then appointed to study the question and make recommendations, and Reverend Alfred Anderson was among <pb facs="5423404_4_0107.jpg" n="2"/>its members. It soon became evident that it was useless to make plans for such a Home without first securing substantial financial backing and, fortunately, there was a man on the committee who had both the will and the means to see the undertaking through, namely the banker, John R. Lindgren.</p>
   <p>He donated five thousand dollars to the Home, and announced that he would give five thousand more if the congregations would raise a similar sum among themselves. This proposition was gladly accepted, and within a short time the sum was secured. Lindgren did another surprising thing when he announced that he would donate an additional ten thousand dollars if the congregations would match the gift, and again they responded by raising their share. It should be remembered that Mr. Lindgren made these generous gifts to honor the memory of his parents.</p>
   <p>The home was first established in South Evanston, and the first superintendent was Mrs. Anna Malmstrom. To start with there were only three aged residents, <pb facs="5423404_4_0108.jpg" n="3"/>but the number increased rapidly and it soon became necessary to look for larger quarters. It was decided to buy the north section of the block bounded by Winnemac Avenue on the north and Paulina Street on the west, and a building for the Home was erected on the lot. Since then the institution has been growing steadily, and now cares for forty old people, of whom eleven are over eighty years old, and three over ninety.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of securing an income for the Home, two large buildings have been erected which have proven to be good investments. In addition to this, contributions in various forms are also received from the congregation.</p>
   <p>Reverend John Bendix has been Bethania's financial agent and actual director for many years, and still serves in that capacity. Reverend Alfred Anderson is chairman of the board of directors.</p>
