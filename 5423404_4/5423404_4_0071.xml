   <p>The Linnaen Hospital ("Linne-hospitalet") is now the official name of the institution formerly owned and maintained by Dr. Sven Windrow under the name of the Chicago Maternity Home. A Board of Directors has been created and is comprised as follows: Dr. C.G. Paoli, president; Robert Lindblom and Andrew Chaiser, vice presidents, of whom the latter also holds the position of treasurer; and Dr. Sven Windrow, secretary. Other members of the Board are Dr. N.P. Pearson, Alex. Johnson and J.N. Soderholm. Superintendent is Dr. Windrow, and his first assistant Miss Anna Malmquist.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday Dr. Windrow had invited the representatives of the press of Chicago and the local medical associations to view the hospital building on Diversey Ave. All the visitors were unanimous in their appreciation and approval of the institution.</p>
   <p>The hospital, in its re-organized state, plans to petition the Cook County Board of Commissions for financial aid in order to carry on a more intensive program. At the same time a movement is afoot to raise a fund by subscription among the Swedish people for the purpose of purchasing a building site and the erection of a new hospital. In such manner the new hospital would become a Swedish institution in spirit and character, and as such become the realization of a hope long cherished.</p>
