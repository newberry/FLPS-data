   <p>The Sofia Aid Society of Washington Park Hospital held a meeting at which the following officers were elected: Mrs. C. E. Anderson, chairman; Mrs. J. W. Hillstrom, first vice-chairman; Mrs. George E. S. Johnson, second vice-chairman; Mrs. T. Rolfe, secretary; Mrs. J. A. Lengby, correspondence secretary; Mrs. A. Ahlgren, financial secretary; Mrs. William Westerlund, treasurer. The Executive Committee consists of Mrs. Hjalmar Olson, Mrs. H. Knall, and Mrs. C. O. Young.</p>
   <p>During its four years of existence the Society has spent $4,604.52 to help the poor and the sick. This item amounted to $400.54 during last year.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held at the elegant home of William Westerlund, 6440 Greenwood Avenue, where the guests were entertained with a special program, the main feature of which was the songs of Mrs. Hannah Butler.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0299.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Society will hold its Aid Bazaar on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, 4th, 5th, and 6th of next March, in the new annex of the Washington Park Hospital, 60th Street and Vernon Avenue. Special programs will be offered each evening.</p>
   <p>Admission 25 cents. A number on each ticket entitles the holder to a chance on a drawing for a 350-dollar piano. Coffee will be served each evening, and on Saturday evening a warm luncheon will be served for 25 cents.</p>
   <p>The Society hopes to have a full house every evening of the bazaar, since the entire proceeds will be used to help the poor and sick.</p>
