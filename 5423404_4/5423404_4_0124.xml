   <p>The last year has been a very happy one in the operation of Home for the Aged in Evanston. Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson have donated $7,000, and for their generosity, they will be residents of the home, gratis for the remainder of their lives. $4,827.61 has been paid out for the care of the residents at the home. Improvements on the property have been made at a cost of $717.85. There was $2,296.29 in the treasury on April 1. Fifteen aged persons have been admitted to the home, and six persons have died. There are thirty-eight persons living there now.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Home are now going to take under consideration the establishment of a fund from which the expenses for the upkeep of the Home will be paid. The following officers were elected: Albert Swanson, president; Gustav E. Miller, vice-president; Henry B. Engstrom, secretary; L. V. Hult, financial secretary; and G. Hallbom, treasurer. The directors are: Charles Gustavson, John Streed, John P. Severin, L. V. Hult, Mrs. Laura Rapp, and Mrs. Hannah Nelson.</p>
