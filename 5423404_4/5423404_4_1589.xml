<title level="a">REVISE THE IMMIGRATION QUOTAS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The solution of the immigration problem which supposedly has been brought about by the so-called National Origins law is so unsatisfactory to the majority of Americans, and so obviously detrimental to the future sound development of our nation, that it is actually worse than no solution at all. For instance, it puts no brake at all on the mass immigration from Mexico, and this fact, together with the dissatisfaction over the unfair quota stipulations for Germany, Ireland, and the Scandinavian countries, will in all probability cause the question to be taken up for reconsideration during the next session of Congress.</p>
   <p>Leaders within the American Federation of Labor, and others to whom the immigration question is of great concern, have warned against the increasing influx of labor from Mexico. That country alone sends to the United States almost half as many emigrants annually as arrive here from all Europe, and the Mexicans belong to the lowest paid class of workers, the class which the immigration act of 1924 <pb facs="5423404_4_1590.jpg" n="2"/>was designed to keep out.</p>
   <p>This cheap labor is employed principally in the sugar industry, in the cotton fields, and in railroad maintenance work, but is gradually filtering into our industrial centers, displacing American labor by underbidding it.</p>
   <p>At the present time there are more Mexicans in the American South than there are in the border states of Mexico itself, and there are more of them in Los Angeles than in any Mexican city outside of the capital. Not only do they tend to lower the American standard of living, but they seldom establish permanent homes and stay put. They have a tendency to move from one locality to another, and the majority of them are not inclined to become American citizens.</p>
   <p>This mass immigration has now been going on for so long that it would not be practical to stop it abruptly and entirely, and suddenly deprive farmers and industries in the Southwest of this cheap labor to which they have adjusted their production, but it is imperative that something be done to keep it within bounds.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1591.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The National Council for the Revision of the National Origin Quotas is an organization, headed by representative citizens, which has been formed for the purpose of conducting a campaign against the quota law, as it now stands. Its president is Victor Ridder, a German-American of New York City, and among its committee members we note the Swedish-Americans Ernest H. Trysell, of Detroit, Michigan, and Francis J. Plym, of Niles, Michigan.</p>
   <p>This organization will lead in the fight against the admittedly unjust quota law, and its activities will not be confined to campaigning among the various foreign groups who may seem to be most concerned. Every American citizen, regardless of nationality, will be urged, in the name of fairness and justice, to voice his protest to Congress, so that a resolution providing for the revision of the law may be introduced during the next session.</p>
   <p>On the strength of President Hoover's statements in regard to this law, the above-mentioned Council is justified in counting on the Government's support in its endeavour to bring about a return to the old and more equitable quota system.</p>
