   <p>p.7..............It is the American Sons and Daughters of Sweden with its officers; many leading men and women, and the many thousands of Swedes in different parts of the country, who are back of this movement - the most comprehensive ever undertaken among men and women of Swedish birth or ancestry in this country.</p>
   <p>The work, in connection with collecting funds to accomplish this gigantic program, has been started. It has already been under way for nearly a year, and $400,000.00 have been gathered in. But this is not enough. We must continue in order to reach the goal. We must reach the $1,500,000.00 figure, in order to make the whole plan a success.</p>
   <p>Up to now we have succeeded in bringing the John Morton Building - a part of the program - under roof. The finishing is left as well as the interior.</p>
   <p>When this is done, we will turn to the other parts of the program.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1078.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From all parts of the country we receive the most encouraging reports of the warm interest in this grand idea, and also considerable cash donations.</p>
   <p>Head-office address is: Room 1300, Capitol Building, Chicago, where all information may be obtained, either in person or by correspondence.</p>
   <p>The people who are directly behind this affair are the following - men and women with names, which guarantee, that this undertaking is a worthy one, and supported by all Swedish men and women in the country:</p>
   <p>Amondus Johnson, President.</p>
   <p>Mrs. C. A. Ewald, Vice President.</p>
   <p>Julius Lincoln, Recording Secretary.</p>
   <p>Algot Ohlson, Corresponding Secretary.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Joseph Princell, Corresponding Secretary.</p>
   <p>E. R. Jacobsen, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Board of Governors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_1079.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>C. A. Gustafson, Chairman.</p>
   <p>Alfred Anderson.</p>
   <p>M. N. Gustafson.</p>
   <p>E. Jacobson.</p>
   <p>Almondus Johnson.</p>
   <p>Oscar E. Landstrom.</p>
   <p>Julius Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Gust. Lindquist.</p>
   <p>O. W. Osterlund.</p>
   <p>John E. Sjostrom.</p>
   <p>Emil Tyden.</p>
   <p>Peter A. Waller.</p>
   <p>J. M. Westerlin.</p>
   <p>Peter A. Waller, National Campaign Director.</p>
   <p>Frank Torell, Associate Director.</p>
   <p>There are, besides these,many thousands of persons throughout the width and breadth of the land, who are just as anxious to see this "American Sons and Daughters of Sweden's" national undertaking brought to a successful finish.</p>
