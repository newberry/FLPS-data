   <p>The Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod gather in Chicago for their forty-ninth synod meeting. Once again this Swedish daughter church in America, the Augustana synod, held its large meeting to transact such business as is necessary. This time Chicago was selected as the gathering place. The pleasant and convenient church on the corner of Barry and Seminary Ave's. in Lake View was the location where the convention was held. It was not chosen because of its size or beauty only, but also in order that its twenty-fifth anniversary might be celebrated at the same time.</p>
   <p>The Synod's delegates gathered there on June 5th A.M. to consider such matters as comes before such gatherings. Sunday, June 7th, this church celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its Sunday School.</p>
   <p>Dr. G.A.Brandell, Chairman of the Kansas Conference, opened with prayer.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gustaf Nelsenim, Chairman of the New York Conference, delivered the morning message. Josef Anderson, Iowa Conference leader, preached at the aftercoon <pb facs="5423404_4_1451.jpg" n="2"/>Song Services. On Monday, the 8th, confirmation of ninety-four members took place, and the speaker was Dr. J.A.Krantz. On Friday, the Sunday School teachers held their meeting under the auspices of the North Chicago district. This meeting was well attended and Pastor C.A.Randolf from Stanton, Ia. spoke on the graduated Sunday School. Prof. W.M.Broman played an organ solo and Miss Effie Johnson sang.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday the ministers held their conference, after which the 25th anniversary festival of the church was held. Dr. CA.Brandell led in bible reading and prayer. After an organ solo and a song by the church choir, the pastor of the congregations, Gottfred Nelson ,gave an interesting speech about the history of the church. The ladies quintette sang. Pastor F.A.Linder, Illinois Conference Chairman gave the main address, and an enlightening message was given by a former Pastor, Carl Almen, who is now Superintendent for the Deaconess College of Omaha, Neb. Pastor P.M.Lindberg gave the farewell blessing and a jubilee offering was taken <pb facs="5423404_4_1452.jpg" n="3"/>Friday the Synod President, Dr. E. Norelius spoke. On Friday the Synod's business was really started, and President Norelius gave an account of the past year's accomplishments; it was a well written document, with a warning of the necessity of holding fast to Christ the teacher, and a warning against the falling away, of which he gave examples. Dr. Norelius gave a short historical talk of past Synod meetings especially the one held in Chicago forty-eight years ago. He mentioned important events that have taken place since last year's convention, such as the passing of King Oscar V, and the crowning of King Gustave V, and also stated that the principles of the latter have made deep impressions.</p>
   <p>Now followed a resume of reports from the eight conferences, also a report from the Sunday School's president showing what he has accomplished and what he asked others to do.</p>
   <p>In conclusion reports about the Pastors who passed away during the year, by K.A. Danell, C.J.Beckman, John Vikstrand, S.P.Lundahl, J.L.Franzen and E.J.Sanders. A brief discussion followed in regard to the fifty year jubilee <pb facs="5423404_4_1453.jpg" n="4"/>to be held next year. The financial report showed on hand $249,535.91 with debts of $53,955.42,leaving a balance of $195,380.49; a bequest of $27,000.00 in the Oscar II fund. The Hasselquist fund of $10,485.29 and a general endewment fund of $16,938.08, the Churches' Historical Fund $11,908.14,and four other funds totaling $92,175.37. Altogether a treasurer's balance of $287,755.86. This is proof of the sound financial standing of the Synod at the present time. Reports from committees of young people's societies were not included. Committees appointed at the synod's meeting in Stanton, Ia. in 1905 and the last one held in Denver, Colo. asked to be relieved of their work. A committee appointed at a meeting at Rock Island, Ill., Apr. 3, 1907 now presented its plans to the synod.</p>
   <p>On Friday evening a Norwegian Pastor came to greet the brethren from Augustana Synod as representative of the Norwegian Church of America. Dr. L.A. Johnson presented the pastor with greetings and thanks, and it was decided to send a minister as delegate from the Augustana Synod to the next convention of the Norwegian Church of America. Afterward discussion was held on missions and it <pb facs="5423404_4_1454.jpg" n="5"/>was decided to send the Synod's own missionaries to other lands, particularly China, so that the Synod's missionary management and not the General Council would have charge of them and support them. At the same time the question of nationality was discussed by many and Dr. M.C.Ranseen spoke of how important it was not to let nationality make any difference among Lutherans.</p>
   <p>In the evening Pastor C.A.Lysander from St.Peter's congregation in Malmo, Sweden brought a hearty greeting from Sweden, and the Swedish States' Church to all Swedes in America. The greeting was delivered in a faultless manner. Pastor Lysander is a son of the well-known Prof. Culbert Lysander in Lund. He is here studying church affairs in the Augustana Synod. Pastor S.G.Ohman from New Britain,Conn. spoke of building a memorial to King Gustave in recognition of his taking the Throne last Nov. 6. This was well taken. Saturday the synod disbanded after the ministers had a meeting in the afternoon when the question of economy was discussed and the financial condition. The question arose what should be done with farms donated to Augustana College when outside of Paxton. Some thought such farms should be sold and the income used to build an auditorium <pb facs="5423404_4_1455.jpg" n="6"/>at Augustana College, such as they have at Lundsborg. Some thought they better use the income from the farms to support ministers who had been sent away. Others thoughtan auditorium should be built nearer Rock Island, where the people there would be benefited. Dr. G. Andreen read his report of Augustana College, this was well presented and understood. In the evening a concert was held at the church. An organ solo by Prof. M.W.Broman and Emil Larson,a singer from the Wennerberg's Men's Choir, also songs by Anna Bjork and Bertha Carlson from the church choir. Dr. L. A. Johnston from Moline, Ill. spoke of Christ's Church and its reality to the world. Ladies home and head missionary societies had a meeting Friday at the Augustana Hospital where Mrs. Wahlstrom is Superintendent, and they were served lunch.</p>
