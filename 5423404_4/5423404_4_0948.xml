   <p>Addressing a recent social gathering of the local branch of the Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America, the well-known speaker, Dr. S. G. Ohman, quoted a high United States government official.</p>
   <p>This official was watching a group of Swedes who had just arrived at Ellis Island on their way to the New World when he turned to his companions and asked, "What difference is there between these people and ordinary Americans?"</p>
   <p>"This remark," said Dr. Ohman," coming from a highly placed American, is quite flattering to Swedes, and especially to the newcomers. It indicates that people of the northern races are welcome in this country, and that the Swede, thanks to the good education he has received in his own country, his ability as a <pb facs="5423404_4_0949.jpg" n="2"/>worker, and his general conduct, is capable of winning the respect of native Americans. When the word 'greenhorn' is used now, it is chiefly due to thoughtlessness. Like all other immigrants, the Swedish newcomer has much to learn here, as has everybody else when he comes into a new country to live. But when he has had some time in which to adjust himself to the new environment, he is found to be an able and dependable worker, well equipped to compete with immigrants from other countries as well as with native Americans.</p>
   <p>"For all this, he is greatly indebted to his fatherland. It had made him what he was when he arrived here, and he would be very shortsighted if, after having lived here for any length of time, he should proceed to cut the ties which bind him to the old land and to his countrymen. This would be just as absurd as the attempt of a student who has transferred to a new school to forget what he has learned before. And life may well be compared to a school, no matter where one happens to live. Incidentally, the immigrant is taking chances by separating himself from his countrymen. Nobody is so strong and independent that he does not at some time or other need the help of his fellow men, and <pb facs="5423404_4_0950.jpg" n="3"/>when that time comes nobody is closer than one's own nationals.</p>
   <p>"You newcomers, hold on to your connections with Sweden and with your countrymen: Join some Swedish society: There are plenty of them, religious societies as well as others. It is also wise to subscribe to a Swedish-American news-paper. It is the best means of keeping informed on what is going on in the Old Country, and it also covers the more important news in America and else-where in the world. Such a paper also helps one to follow the activities of his countrymen here, and it assists him in keeping his own language fresh in his memory. It means a great loss to us if we forget the language which our mothers taught us, and which was our heart language in the happy years of childhood and early youth."</p>
