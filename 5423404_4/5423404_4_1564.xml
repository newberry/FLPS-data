   <p>A Swedish-American meeting of veterans of the Civil and,the Spanish American wars, was held yesterday at the North Side Turner Hall. The group organized itself under the name of "The Swedish American Veteran's Association." The following were elected officers for the period of six months: Ernest G.Dahl, president; Charles Stark, vice-president; O.B.Swanson, secretary; George Ydeen, secretary of finances; August Lundval, treasurer. Among the members of of this new organization are men, who fought in the Civil War, seamen who fought under the command of General Dewey, and others who fought in the battle of Santiago, and men who were stationed in the Philippines and in Cuba. A rather heated argument developed between a Civil War veteran, and a veteran of the Spanish-American war. The bone of contention was,as to whether those former soldiers who did not serve in any war, would be eligible for membership of this organization. It was finally decided, that those soldiers, who have taken active part in the fight against Indians have the right to the membership. Another heated debate <pb facs="5423404_4_1565.jpg" n="2"/>ensued, covering whether non-citizen veterans of the Spanish-American war, should be admitted to membership. This question was settled in the veterans favor. A bright future has been predicted for this new association, judging by the great number of Swedes who have participated in various wars.</p>
