   <p>The annual membership meeting of the First Swedish Evangelical Baptist Congregation was held last week. Editor E. Wingren presided. The report showed that the congregation now has a membership of 501, and its Young People's Society has 123 members. There are 314 pupils in the Sunday School. Encouraging reports were also received from the Symfoni Choir and other groups affiliated with the congregation.</p>
   <p>The treasury reported a gross income of $4,727.25, and the receipts of $32,602.08 for the building fund, making the total 1914 income $37,329.33, which was $64.22 less than the total disbursements during the year. The debt had been reduced by $2,000.00. The congregation's property is valued at $115,000 and the total liabilities amount to $69,373. Mr. John E. Spann, secretary of the finance committee, stated that the financial status was very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>The new pastor, Eric Carlson, of Rockford, Illinois, will take over his duties next March 1.</p>
