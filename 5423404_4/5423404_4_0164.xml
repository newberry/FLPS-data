   <p>The new home for old people, this time for those of the Swedish population, was dedicated yesterday. It is located in Ravenswood, a very nice suburb, and was built by the Swedish Methodists. Bethany Home is its name.</p>
   <p>Rev. Alfred Anderson, the pastor of the Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago district, officiated at the dedication ceremonies under the open sky, although the weather was very unfavorable.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0165.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The bishop spoke on the topic, "Charity for the Aged," and after a very impressive sermon, he proceeded with the dedicatory ceremonies. Dr. C. E. Mandeville and others, also addressed the audience.</p>
   <p>The festivities continued in a neighboring church. Rev. H. G. Jackson, and Professor A. Erickson of Evanston were chief speakers. The occasion was enhanced by performances by church choirs.</p>
   <p>Bethany Home is a three-story building with a basement, and is located on Paulina Street, just north of Lawrence Avenue in Ravenswood. The site was purchased for $13,000, and about $20,000 was spent for the erection of the building. The interior lay-outs and furnishings are arranged in accordance with the requirements of comfort and sanitation. The rooms for the aged are attractively furnished.</p>
