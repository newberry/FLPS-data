   <p>On last Sunday, Ingeborg, the splendid Swedish-American Ladies Society, celebrated its fifth anniversary in a private entertainment at the South Side Turner Hall. A number of the friends of the society were invited to the celebration.</p>
   <p>The festival began with music by the Iduna music band. Following, a brief report was given of the five years' activity of the celebrating society, and of its present standing. The society has 175 members; in sick aid, it has paid $1,638, and in addition it has made donations of considerable amounts. The income of the society during the five year period was $8,130.16, and the total expenses $4,407.68.</p>
   <p>Miss Carrie Lind, president of the society, had charge of the anniversary. Mr. Joel Mossberg, accompanied by Miss Karin Lindskog, sang some of his highly prized songs. Mr. Robert Johnson rendered Gosta's lusty poem: "Nar man ar herre i sitt hus" (When man is master in his house) in a most effective manner. Editor F. A. Lindstrand was the orator of the evening, <pb facs="5423404_4_1249.jpg" n="2"/>delivering a most interesting speech on "Sister love." In his speech, he emphasized the power of woman, and power of the heart. In times of illness and suffering, it is the language of woman's heart that carries effect.</p>
   <p>At six o'clock, the signal for supper was given and those present were led to the second floor where an appetizing supper was served......</p>
