   <p>The central committee for the Swedish Society Building project met last Sunday, to replace Mr. Wahlgren, who has asked to be relieved from his duties as chairman. O Wessman was unanimously elected to the chairmanship of the committee. In addition Dr. Sven Windrow was elected secretary and Andrew Chytraeus, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Each and every one of the ten representatives from the individual lodges and societies taking active part at this point, was given five lists for the solicitation of subscriptions on shares. Lists were also taken by each one of the committee members. A minimum of $5,000. was set for collection by each stock seller. To stimulate the interest for increased activity among the solicitors, two of the committee members, Chaiser and Chytraeus, jointly donated a prize of $50. to go to the most successful salesman of shares.</p>
