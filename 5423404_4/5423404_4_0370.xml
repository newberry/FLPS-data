   <p>Justice can, at certain times, display speed in making judgements, especially in cases involving the small law breaker but during the last week Justice was so well-greased for speed, that the prison doors admitted Paul O. Stensland, the country's worst bank crasher, a few hours after his return from Morocco, where he had fled from Chicago, the scene of his embezzlement, forgery, etc.</p>
   <p>We could easily publish several columns regarding Stensland and his former employees' trial, but what good would it do. Stricken depositors could not regain their savings; the excitement and sorrow he caused can not be wiped out; those whose lives were cut short by suicide or shock cannot be brought to life again.</p>
   <p>The proper thing for us to do now is to strike while the iron is hot, to make rearrangements in our banking system that will insure the poor working-man's <pb facs="5423404_4_0371.jpg" n="2"/>deposits so that a bank collapse, such as that of the Stensland Bank, will be impossible in the future.</p>
   <p>We started the campaign for postal savings banks throughout the country, similar to those of Sweden and other European countries and we shall keep the campaign going until we get results appreciated from coast to coast.</p>
