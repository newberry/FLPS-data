   <p>"The Immanuel Woman's Home Association" a society incorporated under the laws of Illinois has recently purchased the beautiful property at 577 LaSalle Avenue, between Germania Place and Carl Street, just South of North Avenue. This home will open soon as a home for working girls and women travelors. Like the many other societies of the Immanuel congregation, this women's society will be self supporting. They intend through this work to further the congregation,good work and invite young and old single women of their faith to come and live there.</p>
   <p>That this is a worth while undertaking should be understood by all the friends of the churches. At the same time they have the congregation's friends thinking more and more about the thought which is printed on pages 23 and 24 in the congregation's (Manuel). There in concentrated form this thought is brought out. "As facts have presented themselves during the passing years there should be a home brought forth in some other part of the city, therefore it is no longer a larger undertaking if the members perform their duties."</p>
