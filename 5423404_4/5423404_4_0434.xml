   <p>The customary list of Saturday evening and Sunday casualties at the hands of the lawless elements of Chicago this week unfortunately contains the name of a fellow countryman.</p>
   <p>The police records of the case read as follows: While patrolling their beat on Milton Ave. late last Sunday evening, police officers Reynolds and Reddy of the East Chicago Ave. station saw a group of men engaged in what appeared to be a friendly wrestling bout. They paid no attention to the incident, until all of a sudden they heard the sound of a shot from the direction of the wrangling group of men. They rushed to the scene and found one of the men lying on the ground with a bullet wound in his chest, from which blood was gushing. The other men were seen running away from their victim. Policeman Reynolds stayed to care for the wounded man, who was in a dying condition, while officer Reddy started in pursuit of the fleeing men. Several shots were fired by Reddy after the scurrying bandits, who returned the fire, but without hitting their pursuer. Presently one of Reddy's shots hit one of the bandits, who stopped and was arrested. He gave his name as Joseph Wright. Shortly afterward another member of the gang, Edward McCabe, was arrested. He had a bullet wound in his back, but tried to, explain that he had received this wound accidentally while walking along Chicago Ave. The police are searching for the other murderers, who are believed to be members of an organized gang, to which the police ascribe many</p>

   <p>The murdered man, whose pockets had been ransacked, could not be identified at first as there were no other clues than the initials J.S.J. on his clothing. His dead body was taken to Klaner's morgue on Chicago Ave.</p>
   <p>The body of the murdered man has later been identified as that of Axel Lund, a Swedish man, who had been employed as a cutter in the tailoring establishment of Roberts. His residence was at 1355 W. Lake St. Five of his assailants and murderers have been arrested. They all are members of a veritable gang of criminals, who have had their headquarters in the building at 60 Milton Ave. This house was particularly well suited for their purpose, as to location as well as in other respects, inasmuch as the police have found a secret underground tunnel leading to a back yard, and various hidden doors of exit, etc. The leader of the band is a notorious ex-convict by the name Jerry (Edward) McCabe. Needless to say, they all are Irish.</p>
