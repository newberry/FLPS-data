   <p>Last Wednesday, the Norwegians of the city celebrated their Seventeenth of May with a great public festival at Brand Park. The weather was not of the best, but this fact did not seem to have any deterrent influence as far as our brothers, the Norwegians, were concerned, for at least three thousand of them had gathered, and the inclement weather did not at all influence the enthusiasm called forth by the various speakers.</p>
   <p>The first speech was delivered by Senator Albert J. Hopkins, and it was received with thunderous applause. Nothing but praise did his speech contain, concerning the Norwegian-Americans, and Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota was exalted by him as an example for every immigrant from Norway to <pb facs="5423404_4_1315.jpg" n="2"/>follow. The Norwegian Glee Club sang immediately after the Senator's speech, upon which Reverend C. W. Finwall gave the special oration for the day. His speech evoked great enthusiasm among the Norwegians, and he did not fail to touch on the question of separate consuls for Norway, which question he hoped might be solved successfully for Norway.</p>
   <p>In the evening, the Norwegian Singing Society gave a concert at Wicker Park Hall which was crowded to capacity. The speaker of the evening was Doctor Olof Bohmer, and he, too, dwelt on the political crisis in Norway. He expressed the wish that the two sister nations might soon come to an agreement concerning the matters at issue, which might prove beneficial to both nations.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian singing society, Bjorgvin, gave a concert the same evening at <pb facs="5423404_4_1316.jpg" n="3"/>Schoenhofen's Hall, and there, too, great enthusiasm prevailed in the crowded hall. In addition, various other Norwegian societies held social gatherings during the evening.</p>
