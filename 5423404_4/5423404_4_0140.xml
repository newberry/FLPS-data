   <p>On April 6th, the society held its annual meeting in the Schiller building, and fifty nine delegates representing thirty nine societies were present. The financial report for the year showed an income of $3,505.76, and expenditures for the home and other expenses were $2,685.48. The treasury has a balance now of $2,468.87. The home in Park Ridge is clear of debt, as is also the cemetery.</p>
   <p>The society also owns the property at 2814 Princeton Ave. During the year five old people have been taken in, one has passed away, leaving twenty-two people in the home at this time. The following donations have been received: Frithiof Lodge No. 5, Independent Order of Svithiod; $25 Balder Lodge No. 12, Independent Order of Svithiod; $25 Verdande Lodge Nos. Independent Order of Svithiod; $25 Gylfe Lodge No. 6, Independent Order of Svithiod; $25, Jenny Lind Rebekha Lodge No. 551, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, $119.48.</p>

   <p>Society Gustaf II Adolf $25, besides a number of small donations from individuals. The following officers were elected: Chairman, Alfred A. Norton; vice chairman, John A. Landgren; corresponding secretary, C.A.Bergman; financial secretary, Edward Lundquist; cashier C.A.Olson. Members of the board of directors Henry Schreil, Gust Flodin, John G. Hultgren, Charles Gustafson, Mrs. Anna Johnson and Mrs. Hulda Dahlgren all for two years; and Gust Odman, G.E.Miller, Oscar B. Swanson, N.F.Folson, Mrs. Milda Valentin and Mrs. Laura Rapp, for one year. The newly elected Chairman is well-known here. A few years ago he graduated from the University of Minnesota, and later took an examination for lawyer; he also practiced in Minneapolis until about five years ago when he came to Chicago. Here he has taken a lively interest in various Swedish societies, of which he is a member, and as delegate to the Old People's Home Society, he has been particularly active. When the previous chairman, Mr. Henry Schreil resigned, it was natural that the vice chairman take his place, and Mr. Norton's personality and crafty business ingenuity assures the society of a practical business administration.</p>
