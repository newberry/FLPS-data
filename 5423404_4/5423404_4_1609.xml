   <p>A question related to current immigration regulations has been brought up by Mr. Hilmer Lundbeck, director of the Swedish American Line. Even though it is of considerable importance to many European countries, it has not received much attention, but now it looks as if it would be taken up and decided upon during the present session of Congress. It concerns those people who go to Europe for a visit, and then return to the United States. Are they to be included in the immigration quota of the country in which they are visiting? It is the practice now to include them in the quota, and Mr. Lundbeck thinks, and so do we, that this is not in accordance with intention of the immigration law.</p>
   <p>The law provided for one category of travelers, designated as "exempted persons," to which belong former immigrants who have lived in this country for more than one year, who have then gone to Europe for a visit, but who have returned to America within six months. They are, of course, permitted to re-enter, but <pb facs="5423404_4_1610.jpg" n="2"/>they are counted in the quota of the country in which they have been visiting.</p>
   <p>Of the 20,042 Swedes who were admitted this year, the Swedish American Line has carried no less than seven thousand of such "exempted persons". The majority of them had already taken out their first papers here. Thus the number of real immigrants who could be admitted was reduced by seven thousand. Since it is the purpose of the immigration law to admit as many as possible of the northern races, Congress may be expected to make the necessary change. We understand that Senators and Congressmen who have been approached on the matter are so inclined. They realize that the rule in regard to "exempted persons" is not fair in practice.</p>
