   <p>The confirmation class, starting November 1st,,will be divided into two classes, one in English and one in Swedish. Afternoon and evening classes will <pb facs="5423404_4_1522.jpg" n="2"/>be arranged.</p>
   <p>St.Ansgarius is the oldest Swedish church in Chicago and one of the oldest in the country. It was founded in 1848.</p>
   <p>The first church built, was destroyed in the great Chicago fire of 1871. The second and present church building was erected in 1872. Jenny Lind, the famous Swedish opera singer, called the Swedish Nightingale, donated a priceless communion silver chalice and paten to the church in 1851. When the great fire broke out in 1871 the silver was saved by an old Swedish woman. She hurried inside the burning church, brought out the silver, placed it in a buggy, which she then drove to the prairie outside the city limits, and kept it there until danger was past. The silver must always be kept in this church according to a letter, written in 1851 by the donor herself.</p>
