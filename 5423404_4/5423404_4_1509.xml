   <p>The Illinois Conference of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Churches of the Augustana Synod held its twenty-second regular annual meeting last week under the auspices of the local Gethsemane Church, corner of May and Huron Streets. Pastor Evald delivered the invocational sermon, whereupon the various reports were read.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Conference now comprises one hundred thirty-seven congregations, with a total membership of 25,256. The total value of real estate owned by the congregations amounts to $825,575.</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was decided to erect an orphanage at Joliet, provided that the administration of that town will contribute with a sum of $8,000. towards the costs of construction. The building site for this proposed orphanage has been donated to the Synod. - A report from the trustees of the already existing orphanage at Andover, Ill., was read and approved.</p>
   <p>Election of officers resulted as follows: L.A.Johnston, Vice-president; C.E. Cesander, secretary, and G. Lundahl, treasurer. A Mission Committee was appointed, headed by M.C. Ranseen.</p>
