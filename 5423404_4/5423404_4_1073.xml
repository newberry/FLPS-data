   <p>At a meeting and reception held last Tuesday, March 20, by the American Daughters of Sweden at the Drake Hotel.</p>
   <p>The subject of Miss Addams' talk was "The Swedish Women's contributions towards World Peace", and she dwelt at length upon such names as Ellen Key, Selma Lagerlof, Mathilda Widegren and Dr. Anna Wicksell. Miss Addams stated that during her travels in Sweden she made the observation that the Swedish woman is on a higher level culturally than her sisters of other nations, U.S.A. included. With great warmth Miss Addams also pointed to the fact that Sweden is the only country where children born out of wedlock have the same legal right to inheritance as legitimate children. She also complimented Sweden for being one of the pioneer countries of woman's suffrage.</p>
   <p>The meeting was conducted by Mrs. Greta Ericson, chairman, and refreshments were served, during which a program was rendered.</p>
   <p>Twelve new members joined the Society at this meeting.</p>
