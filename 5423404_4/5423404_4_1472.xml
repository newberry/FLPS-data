<title level="a">SWEDISH EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN TRINITY CHURCH GETS NEW PASTOR</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>At the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church, corner Barry and Seminary Avenues, a ceremony of great importance took place last Wednesday evening: the minister of the church, G. Nelson, was installed in office. The president of the Augustana Synod, Reverend D. C. A. Hemborg, conducted the installation service; he was assisted by ministers from the whole Chicago district....The ceremony was very solemn.</p>
   <p>Reverend Nelson has been pastor at the Trinity Church for only a short time, but he has already won great popularity, not only among the members of the parish but among outsiders as well. In spite of his youth, Reverend Nelson impresses us as a man who fully realizes both the contents and the extent of the duties and opportunities connected with his calling.</p>
