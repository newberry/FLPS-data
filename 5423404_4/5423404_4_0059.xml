   <p>The concert at the Auditorium last Thursday evening drew a large audience, and the repeated and enthusiastic applause gave strong testimony to the quality of the presentations. The concert was a benefit affair, the objective being to collect money for the new hospital at the Barmhertighets hemmet (Home of Mercy).</p>
   <p>About five hundred singers from the various choirs belonging to the Mission Friends in Chicago and its suburbs formed the great choir of the concert, and under the leadership of Director A. L. Hvassman gave strong evidence of excellent training.</p>
   <p>First on the program came an organ solo by an able organist, together with some Swedish national songs such as "Hell dig du hoga Nord," (Hail Thee Thou High North), "Du gamla, du friska" (Thou Old, Yet so Vigorous), the song to the King; "Norden arett brodralag" (The North Is a Union of Brothers), by <pb facs="5423404_4_0060.jpg" n="2"/>the much advertised male chorus. We suggest that to give full effect, these pieces ought to be rendered in quick tempo. They were sung rather too slowly.</p>
   <p>The great number of the program was Handel's (Messiah) "Why Do the Nations." This was sung by Professor Gustaf Holmquist, and his splendid baritone brought the piece out beautifully. As an encore he sang "Fageln pa lindequist," and it is a question which of the two numbers was more excellently sung.</p>
   <p>The chorus of five hundred voices was heard in the oratorio, "David and Saul," by the well-known Paul Stenhammar, but more brilliant was the execution by the same chorus of Gounod's "Nazareth." In this piece, the director succeeded in obtaining a blending of voices in a manner that is rare in such a large chorus. The members are living far apart so that their practicing together becomes next to impossible. Those who have any knowledge of the difficulty in directing a large chorus in an opera of the type of "Nazareth" will deeply respect Director Hvassman for the skill displayed on this occasion....An outstanding soloist participating was Mrs. Harriet Smulski, accompanied by Miss Tillie Rose. She sang Meyerbeer's "Lieti." Thunderous applause rewarded <pb facs="5423404_4_0061.jpg" n="3"/>her singing, and she was presented with a bouquet of beautiful roses.</p>
   <p>Several additional numbers followed, one of which was "Bjorneborgerne's Marsch," and the male quartet adapted a suitable tempo in the singing of this song. Later, Gounod's "Gallia" was rendered in which Mrs. Smulski sang the solo parts. The concert was concluded with the singing of "Fremat, hemat" (Forward, Homeward) by the male quartet. It was an evening of noble enjoyment, altogether too soon ended.</p>
