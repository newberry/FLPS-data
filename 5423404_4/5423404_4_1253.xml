   <p>The Swedish National Association's midsummer festival last Sunday at Elliott Park was favored by the most beautiful weather. On Saturday morning, the weather was threatening; the sky was overcast and the weather forecaster in the Auditorium tower saddened the hearts of the young and picnic-loving with his prediction that wet and foggy weather would prevail both Saturday and Sunday. But the fellow had made mistakes before and he did this time. On Saturday afternoon the sun did shine in all its splendor, and on Sunday morning again, it made everyone's heart glad, so brightly it shone. The day was brilliant, and not too warm, but at night the rain fell, but not until all the people, except the committee on arrangements, had been lucky enough to reach their homes.</p>
   <p>In the morning, train after train was speeding out to the beautiful park where all the beautiful colors of summer greeted the eye. We counted twenty trains of twelve coaches each. The traffic chief told us that between twelve and thirteen thousand tickets had been received from passengers, and considering <pb facs="5423404_4_1254.jpg" n="2"/>this, it is fairly certain that about 18,000 people participated in the festival. It seemed as if just the children were as numberless as the stars in the heavens. The choruses of the singing societies, Iduna and Frithiof, gave numbers in various sections of the park. Director Ernest Lindblom and his boys seemed tireless. The music bands of the societies, Iduna, The Vikings, and The North Star played on their instruments so that the hills gave echo. Mr. Clarence S. Darrow, senator and attorney, made a brief, but vigorous speech in which he, unlike most American speakers, prodded the Swedes as being laggards. He warned us against political backwardness, and urged us to follow the lead of the young and progressive Sweden.</p>
   <p>Miss Hilda Peterson was crowned as Queen of May, and was presented as such by a committee of eleven. In memory of the event, she was presented with a beautiful gold watch. Mr. C. J. Erickson spoke for the May bride, and his speech was fine, both as to form and contents. The May pole was decorated by Mr. Axel Ahlstedt, and was raised at 1 P. M., to the strains of music. Never did we see a more beautiful May pole. Editor Frithiof Malmquist then read an ode <pb facs="5423404_4_1255.jpg" n="3"/>to the day, written by himself. The poem is printed in the present number of this paper.</p>
   <p>The net income from the festival is estimated at about $2,000. The committee on arrangements consisted of Mr. Klas Ostergren; Mr. S. A. Nelson; Mrs. Othelia Myhrman; Mr. K. L. Lundstrom; Mr. Albert Beckman.</p>
