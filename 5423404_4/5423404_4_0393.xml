   <p>John Alfred Skoog, who gave the aliases of Charles Bennet and Zukowski, was arrested late last night when caught passing counterfeit twenty-dollar bills.</p>
   <p>Skoog stated that he had passed about thirty of the spurious bills last Thursday. The police went to his home at 4931 Justine Street where they found quite an elaborate counterfeiting outfit, also, one hundred and fifty dollars in good currency and a bank book with several hundred dollars. After searching the house, they also found a great bundle of counterfeit money; the money was so well made that there was some argument as to whether it was good money or bad money.</p>
   <p>Skoog told the police that he had learned his trade in Stockholm where he had made quite a number of eight-hundred crown bills; he was caught and served six years there.</p>
