   <p>A telegram from Rock Island informed us a few days ago that the delegation from Rock Island County - thirty-five men - to the convention at Princeton of the Swedish-American Republican State Leagues, had voted unanimously to support a proposal to change the name of the league to John Ericsson's League. The reason for this attitude, according to the report, was the suspicion and dislike manifest in the country against "hyphenated" Americans.</p>
   <p>We take it for granted that the report is true, but we doubt very much that a proposal as mentioned will receive many votes if brought before the national convention. Yet it is a theme for melancholic thought that such a proposal could originate at Rock Island, a place that assumes to be the capitol of Swedish culture in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_4_0985.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Whether the report is a true picture of the attitude toward the foreign born population in America is a matter which really need not be discussed here. If it prevails, it is yet lacking both in good reason and in significance.</p>
   <p>The foreign element in the United States has at present an important role to enact for it must use all the influence it can muster toward keeping our nation neutral relative to the European War. And this influence we can best wield by announcing freely and openly that we do not consider our obligations toward our adopted country to be of a nature that requires us to bury our feelings and refrain from opinions in order to serve special interests which are as foreign to our way of thinking as well as inimical to the welfare of America, present and future.</p>
   <p>When the Swedish-American Republican Leagues meet to honor the memory of the great Swede John Ericsson, they also need to remember that they can lay claim to no part <pb facs="5423404_4_0986.jpg" n="3"/>of his greatness. We become neither better nor worse for having come from the same country as Captain John Ericsson. Our worth depends upon our own labor for and service to the American Republic, even though these may be far more modest that those of John Ericsson.</p>
