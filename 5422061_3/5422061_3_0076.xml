   <p>The Hungarian Society celebrated on November 12 the twenty-fifth anniversary of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Arpad Sipos in the Congress Hotel. On this occasion Mr. Sipos showed the cinema pictures which he took in Europe last summer when they were touring there on their vacation. He showed, with the able and expert help of Mr. Andrew Junkunc, pictures of the procession of the Holy Right Arm in the St. Stephen's Day festival, some of the harvest festival at Mezokovesd, and others.</p>
   <p>The real purpose of the affair, to celebrate the wedding anniversary, was kept secret from Mr. and Mrs. Sipos to the last minute, when the president greeted them with an address. There were present, besides the members of the Society with their families, the officers and some of the members of other local and out-of-town Hungarian associations. They had an opportunity to enjoy the beautiful, unique, and colorful pictures mentioned above and also those taken <pb facs="5422061_3_0077.jpg" n="2"/>of the Hortobagy, on the shores of Lake Balaton, of Lilafured, of the monuments of Budapest, of the dedication of the monument to the American general Bandholz, of the celebration of the July Fourth festival at the Washington monument in Budapest, of the picturesque Murakoz, which was the native place of the great Hungarian hero Nicholas Zrinyi, of the Alps, of the Black Forest, of the World Exposition in Paris, and of many other very interesting things. The pictures were taken with a really developed sense for selecting the right object in the right place. Even the inscriptions and the headings composed by Mr. Sipos indicated unmistakably the meaning of the various objects, and always linked them with their significance in connection with the Trianon treaty, which always touched the hearts of the sons and daughters of Hungary.</p>
   <p>After the running off of these films, which were by no means a few in number, no less a personage than that great photographic artist, Clyde Brown, who can look back on at least forty years of photographic career as a staff photographer <pb facs="5422061_3_0078.jpg" n="3"/>of the Chicago Daily News, congratulated Mr. Sipos on his ability as a photographer and on the splendid achievement of taking these films. The Hungarian Society had invited Mr. Clyde Brown to this celebration in order that the leaders of the various Hungarian associations might have an opportunity to make the acquaintance of this friend of the Hungarians and to thank him for the beautiful pictures taken by him in Hungary, which appeared in the Daily News in series, and which were accompanied by such unusually sympathetic headings, displaying so much good will toward the Hungarians. Those present thanked him for all these, thereby demonstrating that the Hungarians are never ungrateful and never ignore those personalities of the American press who show friendliness toward the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>After the showing of the films the Hungarian Society remained assembled for several hours, celebrating the silver-wedding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Arpad Sipos, an event which bound more closely their ties of friendship.</p>
