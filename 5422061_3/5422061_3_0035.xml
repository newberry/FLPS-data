<title level="a">THE AWAKENING OF HUNGARY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Out of the terrible chaos into which the Magyar nation fell at the end of the World War a weak sound of awakening is audible.</p>
   <p>The nation's financial collapse was caused by the general lack of confidence in Hungarian money. Neither foreign countries nor the Hungarian people believed that the Hungarian crown had any real value.</p>
   <p>For a long time the problem of this desperate economic situation could not be solved. At last Lorant Hegedus was appointed finance minister; he is a representative of the liberal faction. The Horthy government expected of Hegedus the solution of the economic crisis. Hegedus had to resort to radical methods to save the Hungarian economic situation from total collapse.</p>
   <p>At present the whole European money valuation is in the hands of stock <pb facs="5422061_3_0036.jpg" n="2"/>exchange speculators, and so it is impossible to foresee the effect on the Hungarian crown of Hegedus's energetic maneuvers. It is most important to establish credit and confidence by public economy in Hungary, and we think that this result will be obtained by the expert methods of the new finance minister.</p>
   <p>As Hegedus expresses it, he is counting on American Magyars to aid him in his work. We do not know his intentions in detail, but we can guess what they may be. It does not matter what conditions are in this country. Whether we are working or not, whether we have coal and a winter coat or not, everybody envies us in Hungary because we live in the country of dollars,--and in Hungary today the dollar is the symbol of abundance, prosperity, and wealth. Everybody in Hungary dreams of the dollar.</p>
   <p>The people of Hungary think that it is quite natural that every one of us should have a bank account and a steady well-paying job or business.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_3_0037.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Therefore everybody turns to the United States and writes here for help. They consider it quite easy for an American to make a twenty-dollar contribution to a stranger when they air their complaints about the miserable condition and the small pay of Hungarian state officials.</p>
   <p>In Hungary twenty dollars is ten thousand crowns, and for that they can buy shoes, a little lard and flour, and a few pounds of sugar. They do not realize that here many American Magyars toil for a whole week for twenty dollars, and that a whole family can live for a week on twenty dollars in this country too; American families can even buy shoes of cheap quality on twenty dollars a week. Not only do simple-minded Hungarians misunderstand our situation, but the more intelligent people, such as merchants, have distorted ideas about us. We might expect the merchants who want to do business with us to have more sense.</p>
   <p>Let us take as an example the circular sent to the United States by a <pb facs="5422061_3_0038.jpg" n="4"/>well-known music publisher of Hungary. The prices in the catalogue are quoted in dollars and cents for the convenience of American Magyars. One section of the circular reads:</p>
   <p>"The purpose of every Magyar is to raise the low rate of exchange of Hungarian money, and we can accomplish this only by establishing the prices of our products in foreign money values. The greater the value in foreign money which comes to our country, the sooner will our public economic condition become strong, and the former value of Hungarian money be restored in foreign countries.</p>
   <p>"Every cent which comes to Hungary is a new source of energy; every cent brings us nearer to the occupied territories unjustly taken away from us and our brethren [in these territories]. You will make a patriotic sacrifice if you order even the smallest article because you will contribute a brick to the rebuilding of our ruined public economy. Of these small bricks <pb facs="5422061_3_0039.jpg" n="5"/>which our brethren [in America] contribute will be built up the new, strong, united, working Hungary."</p>
   <p>It sounds well in the circular, but when we looked over the catalogue, we found that the price of the simplest song or dance was seventy-five cents. Now aside from the fact that seventy-five cents is worth from three hundred to four hundred crowns, ten times the Budapest price [of these pieces of music], the price is ridiculous from a business viewpoint because here we can buy any piece of music for ten cents in the Woolworth stores.</p>
   <p>And so, no matter how warm the interest may be which our patriotic hearts feel for the rate of exchange of Hungarian money and for the economic condition of Hungary, we do not wish to be taken for numbskulls and simpletons, though we should be willing to pay for the postage and the wrapping. A [price list] like this may produce a smile of amusement or a frown of anger, but it will never bring business.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_3_0040.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Here is another good example: A Hungarian weekly magazine wanted to get subscribers among American Magyars. The yearly subscription was 580 [sic] crowns in Hungary. The postage on the magazines would be 24 crowns per year, and so if they had offered a year's subscription for 504 crowns in the United States, they might have gained quite a few subscribers here, since 504 crowns are equivalent to one American dollar. In accordance with Hungarian business reasoning, however, the subscription price was made ten dollars to American Magyars, exactly ten times the subscription rate in Hungary. We doubt whether a single American Magyar can be found who is willing to pay ten dollars a year for a magazine. They cannot see clearly over there in Hungary. It would be well for Minister Hegedus to come here and make an extensive examination of us in America, so that he could give some enlightenment to the business world of Hungary. The finance minister would be convinced that our hearts are filled with warm sentiment for our native land, and that we are willing to do many things for Hungary; but we cannot endure being exploited and treated as simpletons.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_3_0041.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We will either give of our own free will without demanding compensation, or we will buy things on an honest business basis.</p>
