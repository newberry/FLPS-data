   <p>In the human-ocean which is America, there are many Hungarians, who have many-fold, deserved that a monument should be erected to their memory. If not otherwise, so at least in the columns of the newspapers. Joseph B. Mayer arrived in America some thirty-five years ago, but he is even today as typically Hungarian, as though he stepped just yesterday on the shores of America. One thing stands without question: In the Hungarian Culture achievements he merits an outstanding place in all Chicago. In Chicago he is the creator and pioneer of the Hungarian Singing Club and the amateurship. For five years he was the president of the Chicago (Hungarian Singing Club) Dalkor. He has been teaching the Hungarian Workers' Singing Choir for eleven years. In Milwaukee he was teaching for twelve years and many of his students became good artists. One can not praise as highly enough the pioneering and rearing effects of his teachings. He arranged 235 theatrical plays in Chicago and vicinity. He was born in Budapest, where he finished his high-school. In Milwaukee he finished his studies at the musical-conservatory. Here you have in a nutshell the story of a life rich in activity and achievements.</p>
