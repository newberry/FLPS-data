   <p>One of the hardest working men in the Hungarian South Side community of Burnside is Karoly Tarjanyi. He has worked tirelessly for several decades for the benefit of all Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Outside of the many Hungarian public activities in which he has been involved, he has done many great things in the life of the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Church. He is also responsible for the idea of the promotion of a Hungarian school, although this idea has not become a reality. Today a grand Hungarian Reformed Church has been erected with a parsonage, and with space left for a school building. This development is due to the serious and sacrificial work of Karoly Tarjanyi.</p>
   <p>He is one of the most respected of all the Hungarians on the South Side.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_3_0097.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He is also active in the social life of the Chicago Hungarians. He takes part in all Hungarian activities. His particular characteristic is that he is outspoken, and continually supports righteousness and truth.</p>
