   <p>It is only a few years ago that we were in Hungary. This was before the War, when peace prevailed throughout the nation. As humble tillers of the soil, it was in that land across the sea that we first saw the first life-giving rays of the sun. There it was that we first enjoyed the warmth of this beautiful sun until we grew up and found ourselves facing the terrible hardships of life. The large number of native-born Hungarians who live in this country is proof enough that the hardships of life in Hungary once clouded the sky of their future happiness. </p>
   <p>Here in the United States we simply told one another that we could not make a living in Hungary. We can, unhesitatingly, state that we very seldom ran across a Hungarian in this country who could brag that the people entrusted with the responsibilities of the Hungarian government ever told him to remain there or that they would see to it that laws would be enacted <pb facs="5422061_3_0053.jpg" n="2"/>to insure him a comfortable living in return for his hard work. If they ever asked us to stay, it was at the point of a bayonet and because they realized that they needed us in order that they might continue to live a life of luxury. These conditions drove the Hungarians out, who were unable to settle until they reached the gates of American farms, mines, and industrial centers.</p>
   <p>We all left and no one seemed to care much about us. The same carelessness that has bred trouble in Hungary, has driven us out by the thousands in search of better living conditions. After the exodus it seemed, as if only the priests, ministers, and land barons remained in Hungary.</p>
   <p>As the years went by, civilization was struck a dramatic blow by the World War. The unfortunate Hungarians were drawn into this world conflict by the same people who oppress the working people of Hungary.</p>
   <p>The situation existing today has again brought about the same shameful conditions <pb facs="5422061_3_0054.jpg" n="3"/>that we hoped had ended forever. Today in Hungary the government is oppressing and killing the wage earner. In the nation from which the Hungarians of America came, that is, where we could not get our daily bread, the people who have been taking the bread right off the tables of the wage earners are wading through the blood of the workers and the Jews.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that on this earth there are thousands of people not clear-minded enough to realize that after 1900 years it is years it is only natural that the human mind has developed and produced many new things, such as, electricity, wireless,and the airplane. That is why in this supposedly cultured world of ours, we find a little nation where murder and the blood of innocent people is flowing freely and with impunity. We can understand the good, thinking, faithful people, who in their condemnation weigh others according to their own standards, when they say that there isn't any White Terror or murder of the Jews in Hungary. They don't murder the workers, yet the Christian attitude of tolerance is gone from the Hungarian people. This attitude has been felt by all nations surrounding Hungary, and these nations have expressed <pb facs="5422061_3_0055.jpg" n="4"/>themselves as not being able to stand the foul air being let off by Horthy.</p>
   <p>A whiff of foul Hungarian air has come across to us in this country. We Hungarian-Americans are being visited by Karoly Huszar, former Prime Minister of Hungary.</p>
   <p>He was the highest officeholder in Hungary at one time, a powerful man in political life. He has come to visit us in order to see us and talk to us. But we wonder whether he will see us or talk to us.</p>
   <p>Since Karoly Huszar has reached the United States, countless meetings have been arranged for him, and not once has he made a personal appearance. Many of the best organizations in the United States have made special arrangements to have him make personal appearances, but he has excused himself one way or another, thereby proving that he is here for no good, but to promote the activities of the White Terror.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_3_0056.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Karoly Huszar was prominent in the organization of the Hungarian government that instilled fear and hate into the people of Hungary.</p>
   <p>Karoly Huszar is the Prime Minister blamed for the thousands of severe sentences, and murders inflicted upon innocent people. Now he has the nerve to come here among us who know him so well; he comes here as a wolf in sheep's clothing claiming that he is here for the purpose of freeing Hungarian prisoners in Siberia.</p>
   <p>Karoly Huszar committed a great crime against the Hungarian people by coming into this country as a Hungarian, and claiming that he would attend several gatherings where respectable Hungarians would pay strict attention to his advice.</p>
   <p>From New York we get the news that Karoly Huszar will not return to Hungary with a satisfied heart; instead he will go back disgusted and disappointed with the reception given him by the Hungarians. The great Hungarian colony <pb facs="5422061_3_0057.jpg" n="6"/>of New York and vicinity spoke at the great Hungarian meetings, where there was no misunderstanding about the attitude of the Hungarian people, and rejected openly the visit of the representative of the White terror.</p>
   <p>This same reaction has taken place in the other large cities which he visited. We hope that this feeling will spread all over the country to every spot where there are respectable Hungarians and that they will take the same attitude.</p>
   <p>The signs indicate that Karoly Huszar has more hopes of success in cities of the Middle West. His stay in New York was unsuccessful, but things may be different in Chicago. This is the reason why it is not sufficient that we alone know the tactics of the White Terror; we must also show Huszar, who can see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears, that the Chicago Hungarians know what he has done to those Hungarians who live across the sea.</p>
   <p>Chicago Hungarians, we must prepare to receive this guest!</p>
