   <p>Sandor Sebald, world famous Hungarian violinist, died Friday at the Grant Hospital. He was 65 years old.</p>
   <p>His death leaves a void in the musical world. Sebald's true worth will be appreciated in the future. His technique could not be equalled by the greatest virtuosos, but was imitated by envious violinists. He composed many classical works, but did not care about publishing them. He played them rarely to his music loving friends.</p>
   <p>The tragedy in this great man's life was that he was not satisfied to become a mediocre violinist only, and there were but few experts who could fully appreciate his artistry.</p>
   <p>Sebald spent most of his life abroad, but he loved his Mother country and proudly referred to the fact that he was a Hungarian. He came to Chicago <pb facs="5422061_3_0081.jpg" n="2"/>in 1912, and for a while, was concert master of the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Later, he taught at the Chicago Musical College. He founded the Chicago String Quartette, which enriched the musical life of our city.</p>
   <p>He had no relatives in America, but found friends, who took care of him during his illness and were with him until his death.</p>
   <p>Funeral services were held at the chapel of the Graceland Cemetery. Two of his songs were sung by his friend, Corrado, of the American Opera Company.</p>
   <p>Dr. Elmer Horvath said farewell to the great master in behalf of the Hungarians.</p>
