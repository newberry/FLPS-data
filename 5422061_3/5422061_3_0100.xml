  <body>
   <p>In the history of the Hungarian Americans there is one individual whose career is almost incomparable, and the man to whom we refer is the popular Joseph Byfield. There is hardly a Hungarian, regardless of whether he is a greenhorn or an old timer in America, who has not heard of the proprietor of the Sherman, Dearborn and Ambassador Hotels.</p>
   <p>Mr. Byfield was fourteen years old when he came to the United States. His uncle once took him to the old Sherman House and asked him how he liked it, and he replied prophetically that some day he would be the owner of that hotel. As we all know, when Joseph Byfield became a man, the hotel became his. Joseph Byfield was not only a leader in the hotel business, he also was interested in the manufacture of restaurant equipment, in the canning industry, and in the manufacture of cotton goods.</p>
   <p>When the City of Gary was first opened as a subdivision, Mr. Byfield saw <pb facs="5422061_3_0101.jpg" n="2"/>the great possibilities [of the town] and he purchased large tracts of land which he later sold at a great profit. He also has large real-estate holdings in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Joseph Byfield has not taken a very active part in Hungarian activities, but his thoughts and feelings are still truly Hungarian. This fact was proved when on September 22, 1918 he donated the use of the White City Stadium to the Hungarian republican movements which were starting in Chicago at that time; on this occasion he was also one of the prominent speakers. Among the many things he said was the following:</p>
   <p>The Hungarian people as a nation never had a greater enemy than the Hapsburg family. The Hungarians of America know very well, and can understand what it means when a state, in this present period, must live under the rule of imbeciles. The Hungarian-Americans found out what real liberty was, in this country. So naturally the creation of an independent Hungary means little, unless that independence is combined with democracy. But a democracy <pb facs="5422061_3_0102.jpg" n="3"/>can only be established and can only be successful in a republican state; the only way we can assure the future of Hungary now that it is independent is by removing the Hapsburg king from his throne and making it a seat of democracy for the Hungarian republic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Byfield's remarks received thunderous applause, and then when everyone had quited down, he made a promise. He promised that he would be willing to sacrifice his entire wealth in order that the Hungarian republic might be realized. According to his statements, Hungary would never be in a position to take the correct steps unless we Hungarians are available to give advice to those in Hungary, so we must wake up. We have a great job ahead of us, and the alarm has sounded; we must answer. Joseph Byfield then read a telegram received from Toby Rubovitz, who is one of the oldest leaders in the fight for a republic. The contents of the telegram were as follows:</p>
   <p>If the Hungarian people wished for a republic during Kossuth's time, they wish for it now more than ever. They can't speak because they are muzzled, <pb facs="5422061_3_0103.jpg" n="4"/>They cannot act because their hands are tied; for these reasons we in America must act. These words are highly applicable to the situation existing in Hungary today. We all know that it was Joseph Byfield who was instrumental in promoting child welfare work among the children of Hungary. We collected $55,000 for this fund and $2,000 of this was donated by Joseph Byfield.</p>
   <p>When Dr. Balthazar, bishop of the Hungarian Reformed Church, was in Chicago for the first time, Joseph Byfield donated a large sum of money for the cause of cultural development in Hungary. There has hardly been an instance when donations were needed by individuals or groups that he has not given wholeheartedly as long as the cause was worthy.</p>
   <p>At the time that the names became known of those Hungarian-Americans who had received distinguished service crosses, the name of Joseph Byfield could not be found among them. Even though the Hungarian people turn away from thoughts of the terror-ridden Horthy regime, they cannot understand why Joseph Byfield never received any mention of recognition when he was the <pb facs="5422061_3_0104.jpg" n="5"/>one who deserved it more than anyone else. The omission of his name seemed very odd to us, so we thought we would get the facts. We looked up Mr. Byfield and asked him if he knew why he had not been honored. His simple answer was that Scheffbeck, the Hungarian consul, wanted to decorate him with the Horthy distinguished service cross but he would not accept it because sometime ago, he had refused to accept the American distinguished service medal.</p>
   <p>Here is a man who has remained loyal to the promise which he made in 1918. He has remained faithful and loyal. The Hungarians have always respected Joseph Byfield, but for his latest patriotic deeds the Hungarians have locked him in their hearts and will think of him always with deep appreciation. We sincerely hope that the example set by Mr. Byfield will be a guide in showing us the duties of Hungarian-Americans.</p>
