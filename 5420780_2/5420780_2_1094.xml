   <p>Senator C. C. Andersen and Congressman C. Hordum, two veterans of the Danish Socialist Party, celebrated an unusual jubilee on June 22nd last. On this date, thirty years ago, Andersen was elected a member of Social-Demokraten's Committee of control, and Hordum as representative for the same paper, later advancing to the position of business manager.</p>
   <p>At the time these two men took hold of the reins the paper was about to sink into oblivion. A few thousand faithful subscribers clung to it, however, but the situation was so bad that a leading conservative paper, Dagstelgrafen (Daily Telegraph) declared Socialism "an artificial movement" that was doomed to fail in Denmark. But Andersen and Hordum went to work with an enthusiam that is still a worthy example for others to follow, and soon they were effectively assisted by two other good workers, Messrs. P. Knudsen and E. Wynblad. At an important meeting, shortly after the departure of Pio and Geleff, Hordum made the statement that the paper should be kept going "cost what it may. Without a press we are helpless in our efforts to <pb facs="5420780_2_1095.jpg" n="2"/>keep the party intact."</p>
   <p>The paper was saved, and turned out to be the very soul of a movement of which workers of Denmark have reason to be proud.</p>
   <p>We have a particular reason to recall this incident because the Socialist Party in Chicago is going through a critical period similar to the one prevailing in Denmark thirty years ago. The Socialist Party of Chicago has at last succeeded in establishing a daily paper which naturally experiences difficulties, but it must and shall be maintained if for no other reason than for the good start. The paper was virtually created out of nothing and without extensive preliminary arrangements, and yet it is now, after but a few months, adequately and modernly equipped. It is rapidly approaching the point at which the publishers will be able to declare that it pays for itself. Cessation of its publication at this moment would therefore be a shame and an irreparable damage to the socialist movement in this country, especially if it occurs only on account of an unforgivable indifference and lack of understanding on the part of those whose interests the Daily Socialist seeks <pb facs="5420780_2_1096.jpg" n="3"/>to protect.</p>
   <p>Should the paper fail to weather the storm, we can say as Hordum said thirty years ago, that our most important channel of propaganda for our principles is lost and our strength as a unit is broken.</p>
   <p>It must not happen, and this is Revyen's exhortation to its thousands of subscribers: Do what you can to make this incident which occurred in little Denmark thirty years ago an example to be followed in this great country. Buy and read the Daily Socialist; advertise in it!</p>
