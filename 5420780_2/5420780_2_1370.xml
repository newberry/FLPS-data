   <p>During the official ceremonies of the Danish National Festival which will be held tomorrow in Riverview Parks, a resolution, adopted by the National Committee, will be road.</p>
   <p>We quote its introductory statements: "Grateful for the opportunities offered them in America, citizens of foreign birth feel they can make no better return than that which consists in incorporating in the nation all that is best in themselves and the races from which they are descended.</p>
   <p>"It is not sufficient, however, to make this contribution in silence. In order to give it full effect, it will be necessary to record at least some of the salient features from time to time, as occasion arises, and to perpetuate their memory.</p>
   <p>"There is, perhaps, no better way to accomplish this purpose than by commemorating the life-work of some of the eminent men who have come <pb facs="5420780_2_1371.jpg" n="2"/>from foreign lands and devoted their lives to the upbuilding of the American nation."</p>
   <p>The resolution goes on to point out the accomplishments of our countryman, the late Dr. Christian Fenger, and his contributions to American medicine, and finally proposes that a memorial tablet, commemorating his outstanding services to the city and to the country, be placed in the new Cook County Hospital. All Danes will second this resolution.</p>
