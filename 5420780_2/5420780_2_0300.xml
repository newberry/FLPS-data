   <p>Among the oldest and most famous oculists in Chicago, is Dr. Thompson State and Madison Streets. His highest ideal is being of service to suffering humanity. Many of the suffering are of the opinion that they cannot a ford to consult an oculist so skilled and famous ad Mr. Thompson. However, no one is refused consultation or treatment, irrespective of financial standing.</p>
   <p>Dr. Thompson and his excellent staff of assistants regard mercy as a point of honor, wherever. circumstances call for it. In order to avoid abuses, Dr. Thompson has his own system of convincing himself as to whether or not an applicant for free service is actually in need of it. He asks him or her, a few questions, and if the answers are satisfactorily confirmed during a brief investigation, which follows, the <pb facs="5420780_2_0301.jpg" n="2"/>patient is treated courteously and free of charge.</p>
   <p>Dr. Thompson belongs to the hardy type of Americans who hail from the Scandivian countries. His parents are still living in Bronderslov, Denamrk, and are in good health. Dr. Thompson emigrated in the early sixties and began the business which he proudly regards, as the biggest and best equipped of its kind in America.</p>
