   <p>Voluntary health insurance in Denmark has developed to a unique extent. In 1933, it included more than two-thirds of the population, and about eighty-two per cent of all persons capable of being insured. The passing of the National Insurance Act in April 1933 (effective October 1, 1934) left this voluntary law practically unchanged.</p>
   <p>While the Old Age Pension Law of 1922 did not call for any contributions on the part of the recipients, the new Social Reform Law provides that every person upon attaining the age of twenty-one, and all persons between the ages of twenty and sixty, upon the enforcement of the act, if not actually insured against sickness, shall at least become an "inactive" member of an approved sick club, or State controlled sickness insurance association. All persons applying for "inactive" membership must submit to the same medical examination, and fulfill the same requirements as laid down by their State Board of Health as those imposed on persons applying for "active" <pb facs="5420780_2_0113.jpg" n="2"/>membership. Having once fulfilled these conditions, they are eligible at any subsequent date to become "active" members, irrespective of their age or state of health at the time of the transfer. It was thought advisable to impose this minimum of general compulsory sickness insurance because experience had proved that in a great many instances people regretted their failure to join a club in time, thereby debarring themselves from the benefits administered by these associations. The new law, therefore, calls for general participation at a low rate of contribution; namely, two crowns per annum for persons up to twenty-five years of age, and thereafter, two and one-half crowns per annum. These small contributions compensate the sick clubs for undertaking the risk of having to accept such persons as "active" members at a higher age.</p>
   <p>The Danish Crown is currently quoted around twenty-one and one-half cents. Under the provisions of the new law, all active or inactive members of sick benefit clubs are automatically insured against invalidity. The premium <pb facs="5420780_2_0114.jpg" n="3"/>collected annually for invalid insurance amounts to six crowns for those who became members of sick benefit clubs before their twenty-first year, and seven crowns for those who became members after their twenty-first year.</p>
   <p>The law also provides that the invalid pension, which becomes effective when the total earning capacity for a person is reduced to two-thirds, as well as the Old Age pension, which is granted from the sixty-fifth year, shall be founded upon a basic rate of pensions according to sex, residence, income, and capital.</p>
   <p>The following table shows the annual benefit in the form of invalid pensions or Old Age pensions which can be granted under the new law to various categories of persons residing in various localities where the cost of living differs:</p>

   <p>Persons with private incomes exceeding two hundred crowns per annum for married couples, and those with one hundred crowns per annum for single persons, are not entitled to full Old Age pensions. If the income is larger, corresponding deductions are made in the Old Age pension in such a manner that the income plus the reduced amount of Old Age pension never exceeds the maximum Old Age pension.</p>
   <p>The number of persons pensioned in the five year period, 1928-1932, averages ninty-nine thousand, and the amount expended amounts to sixty million crowns per annum.</p>
