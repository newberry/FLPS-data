   <p>Paul J. Benson came to Chicago from Denmark in 1869. He was naturalized as an American citizen in 1884. In 1887 he formed a partnership with Albert W. Rixon to conduct a men's and boys' clothing business at 947-951 Milwaukee Avenue, where the sons of the founder, George R. Benson and Walter L. Benson, and the grandson, Paul B. Benson, still have a clothing store.</p>
   <p>In 1896 the company was incorporated, with Paul J. Benson as president and treasurer and Albert W. Rixon as secretary. In 1914 the Benson &amp; Rixon Company originated the idea of selling two pairs of pants with every suit. They then opened stores in various parts of the city. At the present time they are operating stores at 1301 North Milwaukee Avenue (the original location), 4824 Broadway, 206 South State Street, and 1040 Lake Street, Oak Park.</p>
   <p>They recently purchased the building on the southwest corner of State and <pb facs="5420780_2_0332.jpg" n="2"/>Quincy Streets, and expect to move their State Street store to the new location in 1937, the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the firm.</p>
