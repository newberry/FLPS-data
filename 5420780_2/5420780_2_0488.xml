   <p>Axel B. Johnson, whose stepfather, Anton B. Schroeder, composed "Greetings to Denmark," is supervising the arrangement of Victor's new Danish Music Album of records which will shortly be on the market. Mr. Johnson has worked hard to have his idea of producing Danish music on records carried out, and now that he has almost reached his goal we take this opportunity of congratulating him and thanking him for what he has done for Danish music.</p>
   <p>As yet, we have not had the pleasure of hearing any of these Danish records, but judging by the enthusiasm they created in the East we have reason to believe that this album contains the most wonderful collection of Danish music it is possible to put on records.</p>
