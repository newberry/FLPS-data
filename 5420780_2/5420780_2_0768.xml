   <p>The Danish singing society Harmonien of Chicago voted last spring to start preparation for an excursion to the San Francisco exposition in 1915, to sing at the dedication ceremony of the Danish pavilion. Action was immediately taken for financing the trip by the establishment of a fund to which every member of the society is to pay a monthly contribution. This fund has already reached over $600, and with such a flying start it may be considered certain that the plan will be realized.</p>
   <p>At the same time, Harmonien's proposal that other Danish-American singing societies join the plan, has met with such enthusiastic response that the prospects are excellent for a real Danish singers' pow-wow in San Francisco in 1915, and this again may be the beginning of the formation of a National Danish-American singers' league. The Danish Brotherhood's singing society Magneten, of Chicago, is planning to cooperate with Harmonien in this matter, and a final decision will be made at an early date.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0769.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Societies in the East, as well as on the West Coast, are also expected to be interested in this undertaking, and it might thus be possible to muster a Danish male chorus of 400 or 500 voices for the San Francisco exposition.</p>
   <p>The men in charge of the Danish building and exhibit are, of course, heartily indorsing the plan, and will give the singers all possible cooperation.</p>
