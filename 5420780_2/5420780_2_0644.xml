  <body>
   <p>The old actor, F. C. Volquartz, who celebrated his eightieth birthday half a year ago, died last Sunday. He had lived in Chicago for forty-three years. Mr. Volquartz belonged to a wealthy family of Copenhagen; having received a good education, he occupied various positions in offices here. He was for a while in the recorder's office, where Henry L. Hertz was working at the same time.</p>
   <p>His interest and talent, however, centered about the stage, and it was in the capacity of an actor that he became prominent among the Danes in Chicago. Acting on the stage was to him a sacred calling, and to the work he devoted much time and effort.</p>
   <p>During the past few years his sight gradually failed him and his voice lost much of its vigor; he withdrew to privacy, sustained by his inheritance from his family. His wife died some years ago. Four sons and a daughter survive him.</p>
