   <p>Last Thursday, October 16, the Youth Society of St. Stefan's Church celebrated a Danish fall festival, seventeenth century style, in Lincoln Center on the South Side.</p>
   <p>The dancers wore period costumes, some of them even wooden shoes. Old grandfather dances the first dance with products of the harvest in his hands, while grandmother served bear and slices of baked apples.</p>
   <p>Each one of these old Danish dances has its own story to tell, and they ought to become very popular among our countrymen on this side of the ocean. Those who do not already know them now have a good opportunity to learn them. Miss Dagny Pedersen has just arrived here from Denmark with the purpose of teaching these beautiful old Danish dances.</p>
   <p>Over five hundred people were present, among whom were a number of Americans, who were very much interested.</p>
