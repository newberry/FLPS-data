  <body>
   <p>The Society for a Danish Old Peoples' Home had a picnic at Kolze's Electric Park. About eleven hundred were present. Mrs. Cathrine Toft made a little speech in which she stated that for years two hundred women of the Danish colony in Chicago, which has twenty thousand Danes who were born in Denmark, have been carrying on the job of collecting enough money for the erection of a Danish Old People's Home in Chicago. She would like the whole colony to take a more active part in this great work.</p>
   <p>The public was asked to vote upon the question whether the Home should be built nearer Chicago or not. Only a small part of the crowd voted. But the result was that the majority was for building the Home nearer the city.</p>
