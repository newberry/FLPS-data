   <p>In preparation for the great Scandinavian Industrial Art Exhibit, which will open in Chicago in the near future, a small but exquisite collection of Danish-American silver-smith art has just arrived. This will be the first Scandinavian exhibit of its kind to be arranged here, and it is therefore being anticipated with great interest. It is housed in O'Brian's Art Gallery, on Michigan Avenue, where the previews have been well attended by art connoisseurs and many items are already sold.</p>
   <p>The American press is hailing the exhibit as the finest of its kind which has ever come to Chicago.</p>
   <p>The collection of silver-smith work comes from the new art colony at Milton, on the Hudson river, which has recently been established by Danish artists, and which is a counterpart of the Danish-American Skagen in the old country.</p>
