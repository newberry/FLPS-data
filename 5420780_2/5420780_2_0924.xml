   <p>In January this year the Ways and Means Committee of the Danish Rigsdag approved the expenditure of fifty thousand Kroner for a collection of scientific models to be presented to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and thus one more link was added to the chain welded by Dr. Max Henius in his ceaseless, unselfish effort to promote good-will and a better understanding between America and Denmark.</p>
   <p>The history of this appropriation goes as far back as 1930 when Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert, then director of the Museum, realizing that Denmark figured conspicously in a great many branches of scientific research, mentioned to Dr. Henius the desirability of obtaining from Denmark originals or replicas of the apparatus, charts, etc., used by Danish pioneer scientists, as for example: Tycho Brahe, Hans Christian Orsted, Ole Romer, Julius Thomson, Valdemar Paulson.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0925.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Martin Knudsen, S.P.L. Sorenson, Niels Bohr, all men of international fame.</p>
   <p>Dr. Henius brought the matter to the attention of the Danish government, with the result that the above mentioned appropriation of fifty thousand Kroner was made.</p>
   <p>The following commission was then appointed by the Secretary of State; Frederik V. Peterson, Undersecretary Dept. of State, Chairman; Otto Wadsted, Danish-Ambassador and Minister Extraordinary to U.S.A., Vice Chairman, Prof. Dr. Niels Bohr, Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Copenhagen. Director Benny Dessau, Chairman of the Danish Commission for Expositions in foreign countries; Dr. Martin Knudsen, Professor in Physics, Copenhegen University; Dr. August Krogh, Professor in Physiology, Copenhagen University; Dr. Svend Lomholt, Director of the Finsen Laboratories, Copenhagen; P.M. Michelson, Chairman of the Danish Arts and Crafts Society; Prof. A. W. Morkeberg, Director of the Royal <pb facs="5420780_2_0926.jpg" n="3"/>Danish Agricultural College, Copenhagen; Professor, Dr. N. E. Norlund, President of the Royal Danish Science Association; Director Chr. H. Olesen, Chairman of the Society for Development of Danish Industries, Prof. Dr. P.O. Pedersen, Director of the Polytechnic Institute, Copenhagen; Dr. Valdemar Paulsen, Pioneer Radio Engineer; Professor, Dr. S. P. L. Sorensen, Director of the Carlsberg Laboratories; Dr. E. Buch Andersen, Professor in Physics, Aarhus University, Secretary.</p>
   <p>When the names of the members of this commissions were published in the Danish press one of the Reading newspapers expressed the opinion that it was undoubtedly the most distinguished commission on that had even been appointed in Denmark.</p>
   <p>The first meeting was held in Copenhagen February 6th, 1933; Dr. A. M. MachMahon, Curator of the Division of Physics, who had been delegated by the Museum of Science and Industry to go to Denmark and lend his assistance <pb facs="5420780_2_0927.jpg" n="4"/>in planning the work of the commission, and Dr. Max Henius were present as invited guests.</p>
   <p>It was brought out at the meeting that the Century of Progress international Exposition authorities had requested the Museum of Science and Industry to loan them the Danish scientific exhibit for the duration of the exposition and for that purpose had reserved a space 20 x 40 feet in the Hall of Science. Although the Museum will be opened to the public in May 1933 the request was granted; this would necessitate the midels being ready for shipment on April 19th in order to have them installed in the Hall of Science by the 1st of June, the opening date of the Exposition.</p>
   <p>A working committee consisting of Professor Martin Knudsen, Director Benny Dessau and Undersecretary Frederik V. Petersen with Professor E. Buch Andersen as secretary was elected and went to work immediately to make the exhibit as comprehensive as possible in the short time at disposal.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0928.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As far as it has been possible to ascertain the exhibit will include models of Tycho Brahe's "Uranienborg" and "Stjerneborg" as well as of some of the instruments which he devised and used; specimens illustrating the work of Ole Romer and Niels Bohr; replicas or the original apparatus used by Hans Christian Orsted; and others. Dr. Niels C. Ortved of Detroit has already presented the Museum of Science and Industry with a bronze tablet, executed by the Danish sculptor Bundgaard, commemorating the centenary of Orsted's discovery of electromagnetism.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Professor E. Buch Andersen, will accompany the collection of models and will personally supervise the installing of the installing of the various exhibits in the Hall of Science in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Through the courtesy of Director A.O.  Andersen, the Scandinavian-American Line will ship the collection of models without charge from Copenhagen to New York.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0929.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>To Denmark falls the honor of being the first country in the world whose government has made an appropriation for a donation to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and this is fit and proper because of the important role Denmark has played and is playing in the advancement of science.</p>
