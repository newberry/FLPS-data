  <body>
   <p>The Old People's Home Society has for some time been working on plans for the erection of a new building for the home, as the old one is becoming more and more inadequate, not to say unsafe, as a residence for old and more or less infirm people.</p>
   <p>The original plans called for a $30,000 building, but the society finds itself unable to finance such an undertaking, and it has recently been proposed that three cottages be built, each with accommodations for ten people, at a total cost of about $10,000. The old building would be remodeled for use as an administration building, and as the place for a central heating plant, assembly hall, communal kitchen, and the superintendent's quarters.</p>
   <p>This would seem to be a very practical and sound plan. Later on one or more cottages might be added according to need and financial resources.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_1693.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The board of directors accompanied by building experts will visit the home tomorrow to make a survey of the possibilities, which will then be discussed at the society's meeting on Wednesday, February 11, in Dania Hall. At that time the finance committee will also hand in its report, and certain changes in the by-laws will be proposed.</p>
