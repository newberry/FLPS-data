   <p>p.2...."Harmonien's"concert last Saturday was attended by some five hundred people, a few hundred less than usual.</p>
   <p>The chorus managed its part beautifully, and when finally the soldiers' chorus of "Faust" thundered through the hall, one might have thought that the applause would never cease. If we should undertake to criticise, we would say, that the tenor parts were somewhat weak.</p>
   <p>The stately and dignified director Mosberg, who at the opera, has sung the role of the "King in Hchengren", and the"Devil in Faust" sang several solo parts in his well schooled,pleasing voice. In conclusion he and his charming wife, who reminds one of Oda, as she looked forty years ago, sang a duet.</p>
   <p>The performance ended with a ball, which was attended by an unusual number of comely young matrons.</p>
