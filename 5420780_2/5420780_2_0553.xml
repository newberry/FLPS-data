   <p>Professor Marinus Paulsen, accompanied by Mrs. Paulsen, arrived on schedule last Tuesday from his trip abroad, obviously refreshed in more than one way Professor Paulsen says he has been greatly benefited by his musical studies for which he had an opportunity, although limited, while in Europe. He remembers orchestra leader Anton Svendsen, in particular, as a good teacher. Although urged strongly on several occasions, Professor Paulsen did not find time to arrange concerts in large cities in Denmark, until he reached the hoe-town of his parents in the vicinity of Aalborg, from whence he himself had departed at the age of four. Here he had to give a concert, and the village hall was packed to capacity with an audience listening in awe, to Professor Paulsen's musical performance.</p>
   <p>Professor Paulsen is going right away to work as a teacher at the Musical College of Fort Wayne, Ind., and conductor of the Danish choruses in Chicago. If he can spare the time he will accept an engagement with the Central Conservatory <pb facs="5420780_2_0554.jpg" n="2"/>of Music located in Chicago. Recently this institution appointed Miss Clara Jensen as a vocal teacher.</p>
