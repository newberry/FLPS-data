   <p>The outing arranged by the Brotherhood lodges last Sunday was favored by beautiful weather, a little too warm maybe, but fortunately the large trees in the park afforded shade, and towards evening a fresh, cooling breeze blew in from the northwest. Harm's Park is conveniently located and laid out for such an affair, and we think it may be a suitable place for next Year's National Festival.</p>
   <p>Due to the heat, people were late in arriving, and when the first speaker appeared on the platform, his audience was rather small, but people kept on coming, and at the height of the festivities the attendance was estimated at 2,500.</p>
   <p>There were Danes from all over the city, from the South, West and North sides, <pb facs="5420780_2_1475.jpg" n="2"/>Austin and West Pullman, and the brother lodges of Muskegon, Michigan, and Dwight, Illinois, were also represented.</p>
   <p>Ole Nielsen's orchestra and the Singing Society gave the signal for the formal opening, and the chairman of the arrangement committee, Mr. John Schmidt, delivered the welcoming address and appointed Mr. Rolf Rasmussen master of ceremonies. Consul George Bech spoke for America, and concluded by proposing a "Long live the United States."</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Rydber spoke for Denmark and Henry Gydesen for the Danish Brotherhood lodges. Senator Juul in his speech, strongly recommended that the Brotherhood get busy and erect its own club building.</p>
   <p>Governor Dunne, who was unable to attend in person, was represented by Dr. P. C. Clemensen, who conveyed the Governor's greeting to the Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Later on, athletic events and a demonstration of Danish folk dances took place.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_1476.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The great crowd started for home around midnight, after a well spent summer Sunday.</p>
   <p>The affair rated space in the metropolitan papers. The Tribune mentioned the folk dances as the principal feature, and was kind enough to estimate the attendance at 7,000.</p>
