   <p>Someone has said that great men are a part of the Infinite, brothers of the rocks, the seas, the rivers and the mountains, and it seems eminently fitting that the faces of great men might well be carved into the imperishable granite, into the rock-ribbed mountains of their country. Art and Nature have met here at Rushmore Mountains. Here we find a lofty grandeur, Rushmore Mountain, towering far above his brother peaks, a well-selected formation of granite that will endure throughout the ages to come as a national memorial. Here our nation has asked Gutzon Borglum to cut into imperishable granite the features of the illustrious Father of our Country, George Washington, as well as other noble statesmen who have cut into the pages of History an imperishable fame.</p>
   <p>As we gaze upon these noble masterpieces of sculpture on such a gigantic <pb facs="5420780_2_0581.jpg" n="2"/>scale, a feeling of awe comes over us and catches the inspiration of the permanent and enduring nature of brave and noble deeds of statesmanship.</p>
   <p>It seems here that Mother Nature has spread before us an appropriate background and setting for the work of the sculptor which must follow. Far away from cities and buildings, far away from studio and chisel, far away from the maddening crowd, one can look upon the lofty mountain top and catch, as it were, a glimpse into the great Infinite, and feel his kinship with Mother Nature.</p>
   <p>At the instance of President Coolidge, our Congress wisely left the selection of location and details of construction, as well as the design and general idea, to Gutzon Borglum, who is of Danish descent, bold and aggressive in thought, fearless and free, well equipped to carve the heroic likenesses of our patriots.</p>
   <p>His studies and concepts of historical faces and figures in many branches <pb facs="5420780_2_0582.jpg" n="3"/>of art have long since been recognized by our government and have placed him in the front rank as a sculptor and artist and have endeared him especially in the minds of those who are familiar with the history of our country and government. It is interesting to note that Borglum's creations possess some of the characteristics of Thorvaldsen's, and yet Borglum's creations stand strictly in a class by themselves.</p>
   <p>Gutzon Borglum is the son of Doctor James De La Mothe Borglum and Ida Michelson, and was born in 1872 in Idaho. His parents came West over the Oregon Trail and settled in Idaho as frontiers-men.</p>
   <p>He began his education in the public schools in the cities of Freemont and Omaha, Nebraska. Later he began to pursue art as a study in San Francisco. His originality began to assert itself, and he went abroad to continue his studies. In Paris he studied at the Julian Academy Elode des Beaux, where he obtained the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Law. He is very <pb facs="5420780_2_0583.jpg" n="4"/>versatile and among other things shows an unusual talent for aero-dynamics. He exhibited his paintings and sculptures in a salon, of which he later was made an associate.</p>
   <p>Subsequently, he divided his time among European cities and capitals, still pursuing his art, especially sculpture.</p>
   <p>Among his various attainments are the following:</p>
   <p>Sheridan equestrian statues in Washington, D. C., and Chicago; Colossal bust of Lincoln in the rotunda of the Capital at Washington; heroic group of statuary in bronze in Newark, entitled "Wars of America;" designer of confederate memorial on the face of Stone Mountain in Georgia; designer of confederate memorial coin struck in honor of confederate soldier, and many others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Borglum has never been continuously active as a member of any one political party since the nature of his work requires him to mingle with many organizations in this country.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0584.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Borglum is very happily married to Mary Montgomery, who has been of great assistance to him in arranging the details of his business matters. They have two children, Mary Ellis, fourteen, and Lincoln, eighteen.</p>
   <p>He is now planning a visit to Poland, and during this visit he will unveil his bronze statue of our late President Wilson. He has stated that he is proud of his Danish ancestry and has acquired a very fluent knowledge of Danish, and takes great pride in discussing Danish matters in the mother tongue. He has also expressed his intention of visiting his ancestral castle in Jutland during the coming year.</p>
   <p>The main dedication took place at Mount Rushmore, August 10, 1927. President Coolidge was present and delivered a memorial address.</p>
   <p>The dedication ceremonies of the completed face of Washington took place on July 4, 1930, with appropriate historical addresses and a program.</p>
