   <p>The premiere of the new comedy, "A House Divided," by H. S. Sheldon, a Danish-American, was presented last Monday at the Whitney Opera House.</p>
   <p>"A House Divided" is not characterized by the same piquant nervous tension of "The Havoc" and it was not carried to dizzy heights by a master such as Henry Miller. It is an average play, defending sound, moral, and human virtues. It appeals to your sympathy and emotions and ends happily. Being well written and rich with humor, the play has perhaps a better chance to succeed than its more formal predecessor.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0641.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The theatre was filled to capacity and at times the audience became extremely enthusiastic. At the close of each act the performers had to appear again and again. At the end of the third act, the audience applauded for about fifteen minutes but Sheldon was too modest to appear and take a bow...</p>
   <p>...The play should appeal particularly to Danes, because it is one of our own members who has a successful start on the road of dramatics.</p>
