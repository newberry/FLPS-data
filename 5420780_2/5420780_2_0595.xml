   <p>The second annual exhibition of paintings by the Northwest Side artists is being held at the Noel State Bank, Milwaukee and North Avenues.</p>
   <p>Last year, the exhibit was received with enthusiasm, and was so successful from the standpoint of attendance that yielding to the insistent demand of many art lovers who are also customers of the institution, it was decided to hold the exhibit every year. The second annual exhibition is now being held.</p>
   <p>A goodly number of paintings are on display. Work and productions of Charles E. Hallberg, Mr. Larson, and other prominent artists are exhibited.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0596.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The Mountains," a painting by Schmidt attracts much attention because of the very atmosphere of the west which the picture brings. Charles E. Hallberg's, "The Atlantic," is the source of much admiration of lovers of the sea. The painting, "First Snow" by Larson, has been the means by which the artist pictures nature in all its beauty in Winter.</p>
