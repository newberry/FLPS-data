   <p>In the wrestling match between the Dane Jess Pedersen, and the American Charles Cutler, held in Riverview Park last Wednesday, the first came out with flying colors. There were nearly 5000 people present, the largest crowd which ever attended a wrestling match in Riverview Park....</p>
   <p>...Jess Pedersen has received another challenge to wrestle in Riverview Park. There are also rumors that several prominent wrestlers from the western states, among others the well-known "Strong Swede," Jess Westergaard, are very eager to have a chance with the newly arrived master. If at all possible, Jess Pedersen is going to rive each and every one a chance so as to qualify himself for the decisive about with Mahmout and Gotch in which the winner is to be declared world champion.</p>
