   <p>page 7 column 8...P. Marinus Paulsen is one of the best known of American conductors and has, in addition, won distinction as a violinist and composer. He was born in Aalborg, Donmark, and at and early age came to Chicago, where he received his education supplemented by a short finishing course in Europe. His teachers were Race, Listenann, Palk, and Svendsen of Copenhagen. Among his larger compositions is the sacred cantata "Love Triumpant." In 1923 he won the $1,000 prize offered by the Chicago ever for the best one poem with "Four Oriental Sketches," conducting, its first performance in said theater.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paulsen's identity with the Sherwood Music School has aided a great deal in winning success for that institution.</p>
