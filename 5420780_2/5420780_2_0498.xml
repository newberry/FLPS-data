   <p>Friday, June 5th, organist, George Dupont-Hansen, will give a concert in Danish Trinity Lutheran Church. Mr. Dupont-Hansen has given quite a few concerts around Chicago, and his selections have always been well chosen. He has been a conductor of Danish church choirs in Chicago for many years, and thanks to his ability, these comparatively small groups have been able to organize choirs whose performances must be classified among the best in Chicago.</p>
   <p>George Dupont-Hansen's choir consists of one hundred and fifty young voices whose songs will please your ear. This will be a jubilee concert, inasmuch as Dupont-Hansen has been an organist for Trinity Lutheran Church the past thirty years, as well as conductor of Danish choirs. His many friends, members of the church or not, surely will fill the church in appreciation of Dupont-Hansen's many years of tireless, unselfish work for the promotion of Scandinavian music.</p>

   <p>The Northern Trio will assist at this concert.</p>
