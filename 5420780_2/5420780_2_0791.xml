   <p>p.2.col.4........The Scandinavian Workingmen's Chorus are greatly pleased with the success of their concert on Saturday September 18, at Wicker Park Hall. There was no "skimping" in either quantity or quality of entertainment and the enthusiastic appreciation by the audience was evident throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>The chorus presented a very good selection of songs, both old and new, with pleasing efficiency and the offerings of the visiting Swedish Quartet "Runan" of Kenosha were well received. The greatest applause of the evening was given the women's Chorus "Illinois "under the leadership of Mr. Mosberg.</p>
   <p>One visiting soloist was Miss Dagney Christensen who played a difficult composition by Vieuxtemps with an ease and mastery that was a revelation to all. Her reward was prolonged applause and the presentation of a large boquet and several encores were in order.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0792.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Joel Mosberg, director of "Illinois," appeared in several excellently rendered vocal solos and Mrs. Lucinka Hansen (now lecturing on Socialism throughout Chicago) won many friends by her declamations including Drachmans "English Socialists." It was regrettable however,that her mellow pleasing voice should be hampered by the exceedingly poor acoustics of the Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>This condition made the otherwise excellent address of Mr. Tholin, in an appeal for funds for the Swedish General Strike relief, difficult to hear, though a sizeable collection was taken up. The excellent program was followed by dancing until nearly daylight and in the opinion of all the evening was one well spent.</p>
