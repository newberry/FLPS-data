   <p>The School Board here in Chicago elected Peter Mortensen Superintendent of Schools to fill a vacancy caused by the death of John D. Shoops.</p>
   <p>The new Superintendent was born in Wisconsin of Danish parents. He worked his way through high school, college, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Chicago. In 1897, he became a teacher in the Chicago Public Schools and advanced to Principal at the Key School in Austin, and later Superintendent at the Chicago Parental Schools.</p>
   <p>So we see that Peter A. Mortensen is a man who has worked his way up. He is a man with progressive ideas, and we feel he will more than fill his <pb facs="5420780_2_0264.jpg" n="2"/>new position because no one can or will tell him what to do, even though he was elected by a Thompson (Big Bill) majority.</p>
   <p>Our new Superintendent is an old friend of Doctor Peter Clemensen, who, also at one time, was a member of the Chicago School Board. Mr. Clemensen's personal efforts did much to elect Mortensen to the Board.</p>
