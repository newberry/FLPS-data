   <p>The board of directors of Arbejderen thanks all who have helped to keep the paper going for the last four years. When Arbejderen began publication it had four pages, but in 1898 it was decided that the number of pages should be increased to six. Four hundred dollars was raised for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Three months after the paper moved to Chicago a split took place within the three Socialist sections of this city. The result was that the paper was never able to secure enough subscribers to meet its expenses. The police and the creditors took over the paper--or, more correctly, closed it down.</p>
   <p>Those whose subscriptions for the Arbejderen had not run out were a great <pb facs="5420780_2_1108.jpg" n="2"/>problem, but Mr. Botker, the editor of Revyen, was good enough to take over this obligation.</p>
   <p>Revyen is also a socialist paper, but it prints stories and news in order to appeal to as many people as possible. Since the Socialist convention in Indianapolis, Revyen has declared itself for Debs and Harriman, who are the candidates in the current national campaign who were supported by Arbejderen.</p>
