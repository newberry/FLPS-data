   <p>p.2.col.4........The womens chorus"Illinois" is as popular as ever as shown by the capacity audience at Wicker Park Hall on Saturday, October 23. The concert under the direction of the new director, Mr. Bergren proved the excellence of this chorus in that their efficiency had in no way suffered through a change in leadership.</p>
   <p>The program was well received and heartily applauded the welcome to Mr. Bergren left no doubt as to his triumphal entry into the esteem of Illinois' faithful public although the magnetic presence of the veteran director Mossberg was missed by his many admirers. A pleasing incident of the concert was the reappearance of Mrs. Huseby whose temporary absence from the chorus, had been strongly felt by all.</p>
   <p>Mrs. L.A.C.Hanson, extraordinary pianist, was called back again and again and was given a large giant boquet in appreciation of her wonderful talent and willingness to oblige. Hans J. Hess, cellist, also gave the audience real pleasure with his solos and had to respond with several encores.</p>

   <p>Lunch was served following the concert after which dancing was enjoyed for several hours to music by Schmidts popular orchestra. The evening was deemed a success from beginning to end and "Illinois" was much encouraged with the results.</p>
