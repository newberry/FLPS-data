  <body>
   <p>The Danish Lutheran Children's Home has had a pretty bad year. The number of children at the Home went down from 28 to 10. The cause seems to be that it is easier for families to get relief if they have children in their home, or they have found it impossible to pay for the child at the Home.</p>
   <p>The daily work is now done by Christence Holm and Dorothy Eriksen. Elkjer Nielsen has been treasurer of the Home for three years, but he refused to be re-elected, and in his place P. C. Petersen was elected, who has been the treasurer of the Home for ten years. Niels Jensen was appointed secretary, a job he has filled for fifteen years.</p>
