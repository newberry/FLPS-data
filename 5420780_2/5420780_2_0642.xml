   <p>A group of Danish men and women took advantage of Miss Gerda Henius' performances Monday night in the chief female role of "The Round Up," for a visit to the McVickers' Theatre in company, and with subsequent supper in the Auditorium. A committee, consisting of Messrs. Wm. Mogensen, Magnus Holm, and C. H. W. Hasselriis, had undertaken the buying of tickets to 100 of the best seats on the floor, and every one of which was sold to some Dane. There were, therefore, many will known Danes present in the theatre, with ladies elegantly gowned. As usual the theatre was crowded.</p>
   <p>Miss Henius played her role in this genuinely American melodrama with a tact and ability which explains her swiftly gained leading position. Without a doubt, she has a bright future on the stage. She was warmly applauded, not least so by her many Danish friends, and was presented with a beautiful bouquet.</p>

   <p>At the supper following the play, Consul Bech presided, and a number of speakers commented on and complimented the young' homemade' star.</p>
   <p>Dr. Henius said that the evening had been one of the happiest in all his life. On his own and his wife's behalf, he thanked the audience for the honor shown his daughter.</p>
   <p>Miss Henius has recently become engaged to one of the favorites of the American scene, Rapley Holmes.</p>
