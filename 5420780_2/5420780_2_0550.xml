   <p>p.2.col.2.................An exceptional evening's entertainment way enjoyed by Chicago's Danes at Schoen oefen's Hall on Friday October 8. The never to be forgotten occassion was the song recital (really a tone lecture on Denmark) by Mrs. Rosenberg one of Denmark's most beloved singers.</p>
   <p>To her own accompaniment she sang the old songs of the old land, folk songs of the farmer and fisher folk, of home and village: all in such a way as to grip the hearts of her listeners in an irresistible manner. The word and tone pictures of story, character and environment in the daily life of Denmark were so touchingly real that even one not understanding the language and lacking all knowledge of Denmark could feel a drawing as of some mysterious power that caught and held one spellbound.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0551.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Tomorrow evening Walhalla Hall will undoubtedly he filled to capacity when this gifted artist will give a tone lecture on "The Danish Folk Songs." The program will not be a repetition except in its almost sacred appeal to the hearts of those fortunate enough to attend. An evening under the magic spell of this wonderful artist will stand out as an unforgettable event in any music lovers life.</p>
