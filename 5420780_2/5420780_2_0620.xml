   <p>The famous Danish sculptor, Carl Rohl-Smith died in Copenhagen, Denmark at the age of 40 years.</p>
   <p>He studied at the Royal Academy of Copenhagen and later at Berlin and Rome. He came to America in the eighties and he secured work with the terra cotta factory in Perth Amboy. Later he moved to Chicago, where he became famous for his statue of Franklin at the Chicago world's Fair. He also made the monument in memory of the Fort Dearborn massacre of 1812. This monument is now located at the foot of 18th Street, and depicts an Indian chief saving a white woman. He also made the statues for the Iowa monument at Des Moines. These statues were modelled here in Chicago. His last piece of art was the Sherman monument in Washington. He was well-liked by the Danes who visited his in his studio in Chicago.</p>
