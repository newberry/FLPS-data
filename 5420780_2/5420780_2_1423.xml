   <p>In November 1872, Dania was the only large Danish society in Chicago, with a membership of four hundred. The society held its meetings in an old building on Milwaukee Avenue (at that time No. 17), a building that was quite dilapidated, but in those days tastes were very plain.</p>
   <p>At that time, the president was John Klug, a small man, only five feet tall. William Lund, later known as a journalist, was the manager. "Niels I Taarnet" (Niels in the tower) whose full name was Niels Uhrenholt, was one of the best liked men in Society Danis at that time. He was an uncle of Doctor Jenny Baun, who was the wife of Kristian Baun.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_1424.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For many years, the president was George Hoffman, who was one of the charter members, who remained a member until his death. Hoffman had been wounded in the Civil War, and made quite a name for himself as a soldier.</p>
   <p>We will here mention a few of the "old timers": M. Solomonsen Okenholt, Fritz Frantzen, M. Houlberg, Peder Kristensen, N. Herskind-Petersen, and C. H. C. Nielsen.</p>
