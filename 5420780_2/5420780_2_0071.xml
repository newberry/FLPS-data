   <p>Nothing short of conscription and compulsory military training will ever give us an army that can be relied upon to defend this country in time of war. The duty of defending the country belongs to the young men. The President, as I understand it, has the power, as commander-in-chief of the army, to compel all able-bodied men to serve the country in time of war. To give the President or Congress such a power may be a necessity, but it is a crime, nevertheless, to commandeer young men into the army, and send them to the front without first giving them a thorough military training.</p>
   <p>The government should have courage and foresight enough to place the national defense system of our country in a state of efficient preparedness. This cannot be done by patriotic sentiment. It can be started at one stroke of Congress and the President, compelling every able-bodied young man between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four to serve one year, at the least, with the <pb facs="5420780_2_0072.jpg" n="2"/>colors, with no exception to be made between the poor and the rich.</p>
   <p>I am against training high school boys, because it diverts the attention from their studies at an age when they are of no use for the national defense. What good are the Boy Scouts, the high school boys, or a handful of trained soldiers, or any number of regiments raised by Col. Roosevelt and others, if war should come? This whole thing lacks organization.</p>
   <p>DR. PETER CLEMENSEN</p>
   <p>Member Chicago Board of Education</p>
   <p>The Revyen (Review) agrees with Doctor Clemensen that the children of the schools should not be mobilized. But if we are to have universal military training, the ideal would be along the democratic lines of the Swiss, the arming of the people, just as Victor L. Bergen, member of Socialist Executive Committee has proposed.</p>
   <p>A final disposition of this question will be out of place until peace has <pb facs="5420780_2_0073.jpg" n="3"/>been declared, that is, if the German militarism is permanently checked. Then we can expect a partial disarmament and limitation of armaments throughout the world. What is to be done now should be of a temporary nature only, in order to meet the situation caused by Germany.</p>
