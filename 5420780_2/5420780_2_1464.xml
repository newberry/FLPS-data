   <p>The Danish Brotherhood (Det Danske Brodersamfund) was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, on January 2, 1882. Any Dane between eighteen and forty-five years of age may join after he has been examined by a doctor and found to be of good health. There is a life insurance of $250, $500, or $1,000. A sick benefit of $5.00 to $10.00 a week is paid out according to whether one pays fifty cents or one dollar insurance per week.</p>
   <p>The headquarters of the Brotherhood is in Omaha, Nebraska. The executive committee is made up of five members, The Supreme President, The Supreme Vice-President, and three Supreme trustees. A convention is held every fifth year to which every lodge elects one delegate. In 1910 the convention was in Fresno, California, and the convention of 1915 will be held in St. Paul, Minnesota. Danish is spoken at the meetings, and all religious and political discussion is prohibited during the meeting.</p>
