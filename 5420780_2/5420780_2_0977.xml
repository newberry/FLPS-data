   <p>The great festival for the Danish poet, Holger Drachmann, took place Friday, May 4, in Central Music Hall down town. The hall was not full, but at least a thousand were present, most of whom were Danes, though there were a few Norwegians.</p>
   <p>Miss Ingeborg Sorensen played the great organ and Harmonien sang, directed by Mr. Lanzky. The chorus did not sing very well, perhaps because of insufficient time for practice. Mr. Thorvald Otterstrom showed himself to be an excellent pianist, and the audience enjoyed the two pieces he played.</p>
   <p>Holger Drachmann was introduced by Peter Noer. The poet read a prologue he just had written. His voice was not very strong, but everyone in the great hall could hear every word he said.</p>
   <p>Later there was a small party for the poet at the Bismarck Hotel.</p>
