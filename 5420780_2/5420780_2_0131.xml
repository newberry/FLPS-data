   <p>Why don't we in this country learn the art of minding our own business? One would think that we have enough problems to contend with within our own borders without always butting into foreign entanglements. Besides, who appointed the great Uncle Sam as savior of the world? If we are so capable of adjusting foreign difficulties, then why not set things right at home? Instead, we are demonstrating our inability to properly straighten out our own affairs. It is more charitable to say that our leaders are unable, than to say they are able and unwilling.</p>
   <p>Probably one of the most absorbing issues irritating us now is the bitter struggle ensuing between the pro-and anti-communistic factions. Uncle Sam, of course, sternly frowns on all communistic tendencies. Much of the hostility, <pb facs="5420780_2_0132.jpg" n="2"/>no doubt, is caused and receives its momentum from lack of real facts and the unreliable information fed the public by our chauvinistic press. For instance, most of our information about Soviet Russia, the cradle of communism, comes to us second-hand from Finland, Warsaw or Riga, to say nothing of the journalistic prattle dumped on us by the exiled grand dukes who since the decline of the czaristic regime, suddenly have taken up writing fairy tales, usually as a side line for surplus energies after slinging hash all day in some Paris or New York cafe.</p>
   <p>There was a time when people were prone to be skeptical toward newspaper "scoops", and we opened a journal aware that we should "believe nothing we hear and only half of what we see." But that open-mindedness, of course, was before the Russian Revolution. It is always easy to believe what we want to, regardless of its being just or not. Anyone with a grain of sense knows <pb facs="5420780_2_0133.jpg" n="3"/>that a newspaper is the mouthpiece of a few leaders, and has no conscience when it comes to twisting and distorting facts in order to mould public opinion.</p>
   <p>Perhaps our American leaders learned their strategy from the early Romans. What did they do? When the Roman Senate passed a measure a little too raw for even the Roman slaves to stomach, and the people showed signs of unrest and possible rebellion, then the leaders staged a big show in the arena. Prisoners were thrown to the lions (political preferred); it was a heyday, with excitement, interesting spectacles, entertainment. As a result, the people forgot for the time being, anyway, their own troubles. Their attention was distracted from the main issue. Human nature proves true to form. And our leaders, knowing this trick, resort to the same thing. They distract the <pb facs="5420780_2_0134.jpg" n="4"/>attention of the people from the vital issue of the day. Our twenty-four million souls reduced to poverty and starvation by the careless mistakes made by the Trinity--Hoover, Wall Street, and our Administration--have their minds taken off their troubles by being given tales of the evils of communism. Instead of clearing up the domestic troubles, our "gladiators" of the government divert the attention of the people by dwelling on the faults of other countries. Clever, indeed, but certainly not human.</p>
   <p>We admit that no country today lives an absolutely independent existence. Not being isolated from the rest of the world, naturally the affairs of foreign soils indirectly affect us. But, before meddling, or rather deliberately rushing headlong into someone else's business, why not try to clean up our own mess. It is indeed laughable that we, the instigators of the Monroe Doctrine, are the first to belie it; we do not practice what we preach.</p>
   <pb facs="5420780_2_0135.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>In other words, let us learn to stay in our own backyard; let us realize that reform begins at home.</p>
