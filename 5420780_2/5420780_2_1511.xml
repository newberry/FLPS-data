   <p>p.2.col.5........Danish Oddfellows, of Chicago's South Side gathered at Walhalla Hall on Sunday evening October 24, for a social session that was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Music, songs, recitals and reading in abundance made a dull or monotonous moment impossible.</p>
   <p>A tasty supper was served by master-baker Petersen, followed by dancing. Just as the dance was in full swing it was interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Cook, from the North Pole, with a load of souvenirs for the guests. Dr. Cook had made the long trip in a sleigh a-la-Santa Claus, but the motive power was a small donkey with phenominally long ears. Beautiful roses were presented to the ladies while the men were given - lobsters. As the last souvenir was handed out, the final bow of the venerable and generous Doctor was greeted by a beautiful snow storm (confetti). The mechanics of this arrangement was the work of Magnus Holm.</p>

   <p>Dancing was resumed and there arose a heart breaking moon when the orchestra played Home Sweet Home "already" at one o'clock instead of waiting for day-light as is so often the case "when good fellows (Danes) get together."</p>
