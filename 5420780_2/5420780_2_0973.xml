   <p>Mr. Volkmar Johnson writes a very interesting article about the greatest marquerade in the history of Dania; this event took place February 28, 1874.</p>
   <p>The Tammany and the Tweed ring went to pieces about this time. Among those that suffered from this catastrophe was also a Danish merchant, Jesper Nicolai Hansen, called Oil-Hansen. Hansen was a sailor from Helsinger, Denmark. He came to Chicago and became the first prominent Hansen on the Northwest Side. He died soon after. His oldest son, Nic Hansen, and another brother came a lot to Dania;but as he was not born in Denmark he could not became a member of said society. But he was nevertheless well liked by all. Later on he became head-bookkeeper in a National Bank in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1874 the Mukker-party was at its height. It was anti everything and much hated by the Germans in Chicago. The result was that old captain Hanzen <pb facs="5420780_2_0974.jpg" n="2"/>from New York with German money started a Danish paper, Friheden (Freedom); and Hoffman Schmitt, a Dane, became the editor. The aim of the paper was to fight the Mukker-party. Dania therefore resolved to make their masquerade a political event.</p>
   <p>Tickets went to two dollars pro persona. All scenes and costumes were realistic and up-to-date. The two most prominent men of the whole affair were Hoffman Schmidt and Gustav Mueller. (See Revyen, December 8, 1900)</p>
