   <p>The discussion of political bossism at the meeting of the Sunset Club the other night was both interesting and instructive. But it is a source of surprise that the Club should attempt to tackle such a knotty problem without calling to its aid the greatest expert authorities in the city. Why was not the Honorable "Bobbie" Burke invited to read a paper on "How I Became the Pooh-Bah of Chicago"? And why was not the Honorable "Billy" Lorimer requested to address the Club on "A Boss in Defeat"? It goes without saying that either of these gentlemen could have brightened his discourse with the most fascinating glimpses into the sacred recesses of the boss.</p>
   <p>As it was, the discussion was instructive, though the Honorable "Bobbie" Burke probably would characterize it as amateurish. Mr. Madden struck home when he said:</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0188.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The leaders are chosen from the ranks. If the character of the men in the ranks is not what it should be the leaders will not be the most suitable men. The American who boasts of his own political indolence proclaims his own shame. If the best men took active part in politics they would be able to select better men for leaders, for the men who are leaders must be men whom the majority of the people can follow. Unless political indolence is prevented you will never be able to overthrow the bosses.</p>
   <p>"Political organization and leadership are necessary in a free country. The work done by the boss is work that must be done. It remains with the people whether the leaders are to be servants or bosses. If all citizens would do their duty there would be no place or opportunity for bosses. If the good people would do their duty the standard and aim of political leadership would be what it ought to be. But the best people are the worst citizens, and in consequence we have the boss."</p>
