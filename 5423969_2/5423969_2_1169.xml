   <p>Christian Jevne was born in 1839 in the Vang church-electorate, near Hammar, Norway.</p>
   <p>In 1864 he came to America, staying in Detroit for a short while. Not liking Detroit, he left for Chicago, where he arrived July 4th of the same year (1864). In Chicago his uncle, Otto Jevne, had operated a large wholesale and retail grocery house since the early part of 1857.</p>
   <p>Christian Jevne became a partner in his uncle's store, and in 1869 opened his own store at 41 East Kinzie Street. Here he stayed until 1871, when his store--then a very large one--was destroyed by the Chicago Fire. He then opened a store at Randolph and Halsted and one at 1 - 3 North Clark Street.</p>
   <p>In 1878 he moved to 110 - 112 West Madison Street and also opened a larger store at Market and Randolph Streets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1170.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In 1884 his Madison Street store burned to the ground--a total loss.</p>
   <p>In 1892 he opened a store at 109 - 111 Wabash Avenue, and in 1894 he opened another in the old building where his uncle had his store.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jevne had the largest grocery concern in America, and at his death owned about a dozen large wholesale and retail stores. We think that it was well done--to build up an estate of this size in less than thirty years.</p>
