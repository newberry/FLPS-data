   <p>The concert given last Saturday evening by the Norwegian Singing Society at Wicker Park Hall was very well attended and was a success in every respect.</p>
   <p>The program opened with orchestra number "Fra Diavolo under the direction of Professor J. W. Colberg, and this number as well as "Nordic Dancer" by Edvard Grieg was warmly applauded.</p>
   <p>Miss Estella Merica, well known in musical circles played two violin solos and won much applause, the people clamoring for more. She has excellent control of her instrument and her appearance is natural and attractive. Mrs. Harriet Smulski gave two soprano solos, "Mymphs and Fauns" and "Selections from Queen of Sheba", accompanied on the piano by Miss Dagmar Anderson. Mrs. Smulski possesses a pure, clear voice of considerable range. Listening to her is genuine artistic enjoyment. She was called on for additional numbers by the enthusiastic audience. Both she and Miss Merica were presented with bouquets of flowers.</p>

   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society sang several new and difficult numbers with considerable success. The "Saeterjentens Sondag" (The Sunday of the Dairy Maid), sung by a male chorus with Mr. Charles P. Hansen as tenor soloist, was well executed. Mr. Hansen's voice is very pleasant, yet, after having heard the number sung by female voices, the presentation by an all-male chorus sounded slightly strange... The Norwegian Singing Society, under the direction of its new leader, Mr. Christian Nilsson, proved on this occasion that it is able to produce fine singing. Thus the well-known number by Reissiger, "Olav Trygvason", was sung excellently in every respect. Christian Nilsson's composition, "Our Country's Flag and Heroes", was a great success as was Soderman's "Brollops Marsch" (Wedding March)...</p>
   <p>After the concert there was dancing, and a late supper was served in the dining hall by Mrs. Mathias Pedersen.</p>
