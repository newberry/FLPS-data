   <p>Ben Blessum is exhibiting a collection of paintings at the Palette &amp; Chisel Club, Atheraeum Bldg., Van Buren and Wabash Avenue. It is a pleasure to know that our Norwegian-American Artist have anything so beautiful. The collection is rich in variation of motives and colors, there is no monotony, every picture is different. It is said, art does not exist for the sake of pleasure alone, but also as an educational means. This collection if of particular educational value; they depict our beautiful fatherland from seashore to mountain highlands, in sunshine and fog, in storm and still; they depict interiors and costumes of years long gone by.</p>

   <p>Ben Blessum has been in Europe from three to four years. Most of this time he spent in Norway traveling about in the southern and western parts. Saetersdalen seems to have had a particular attraction for him, and he has many paintings from this beautiful valley. It is the first time we have seen such a collection here. In Minneapolis they have a Scandinavian Art Society. Wouldn't it be within its scope to show this collection to our countrymen there?</p>
