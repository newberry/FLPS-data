   <p>The Norwegian National Singers League (N.W. Division) held their annual banquet in Bjorgvin Hall on Monday, October 21st. It is tactfully admitted throughout the Norwegian colony that no Norwegian group ever puts on a better or more enjoyable social evening then does the Singers League. The banquet on Monday evening was its thirteenth anniversary and the figure "13" had no dampening effect on the enjoyment and good fellowship of this lively group.</p>
   <p>At the head table were placed the main luminaries; speakers and officers as well as special guests. Here were Lyder Birkedol, A. Th. Thorstensen, Birger Osland, Dr. Doe, Julius Jaeger, Dr. Warloe, Grundeland, Oftedahl &amp; Zimmerman and Rosendahl-last, but not least, Emil Bjorn, elected for the thirteenth time as chief conductor of the League.</p>
   <p>Birger Osland spoke for the League, pointing out the fact that our Norwegian singers were the greatest power in the country in the preservation of our <pb facs="5423969_2_1597.jpg" n="2"/>Norwegian traditions and culture. He (Mr. Osland) has recently traveled extensivel among the Norwegian colonies of the Middle-west and he has always found the Norse-man a lover of music, especially of the old Norwegian songs as presented by the various male choruses in their visits here and there throughout the Northwest.</p>
   <p>Julius Jaeger, who was recently elected president of the Northwest division of the National Singers League, spoke for the League, extolling its work and progress and thanking those who brought about his election for their faithful display of friendship and confidence. He exhorted each individual singer to continue giving every effort, first to the big convention to be held in Chicago and then the tour to Norway in 1914. This trip will be the event of a lifetime in many ways and should be worth every effort.</p>
   <p>"Wild rumors," said Mr. Sather, "are going the rounds regarding the 1914 tour. These should be corrected; for instance, 'a chorus of one thousand' from America-impossible! the trip to cost $600 per man-absurd. All the singer needs <pb facs="5423969_2_1598.jpg" n="3"/>is $300, the report is circulated to scare the singers out of taking part and to injure the League.</p>
   <p>A new spirit of understanding and cooperation was born at this banquet and we trust it will never wane.</p>
