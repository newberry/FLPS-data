   <p>As a rule harmony always prevails in Norwegian male chorus circles, but recently a spirit of envy and jealousy has entered them that has caused much discussion and heartache. Outsiders have sent in unjust criticisms against certain decisions and appointments made in reference to the 1914 Norway tour of the Norwegian Singers' League, and it looks as if a small group that have no thought of going to Norway, are trying to throw the proverbial monkey wrench into the machinery.</p>
   <p>Miss Signe Lund, famous pianist and one of our best musical composers, was appointed by the League to write the cantata for 1914. No sooner was the appointment made than envious attacks began to come in, most of them insinuating that the appointment was due to favoritism and demanding a competition for the cantata assignment. The cantata committee, fully aware of Signe Lund's <pb facs="5423969_2_1587.jpg" n="2"/>ability and personal interest, reaffirmed her appointment. The vicious attacks made against her have discouraged Miss Lund, and she has withdrawn. Carl Hausen, of Minneapolis, chairman of the committee, reveals part of Signe Lund's letter, which reads: "The dirty and spiteful remarks that have been published in Chicago papers and in Sangerhilsen (Singers' Greetings), the official organ of the N. N. S. L., have begun to have the desired effect. I was naturally, pleased to have been named to write the cantata and had in addition to the great amount of work I have to do in preparation for my own jubilee concerts, already put quite a bit of time into the composition of the cantata, but due to this controversy I have lost heart and can not continue with it. "The cantata committee, therefore, will have to get another to do this work. An unfriendly attitude toward the composer would affect the rendition of the cantata, turning it into a work unworthy of the occasion. Let my <pb facs="5423969_2_1588.jpg" n="3"/>enemies secure their own composer now, and let us hope they will show their appreciation of the new appointee by co-operation and a masterful rendition of the new cantata, a rendition I could never expect to get from this group after this incident. I have always done my best to work in harmony with the Singers' League; always ready to serve, but this is the last straw and I am tired and sick of the whole affair."</p>
   <p>Thus we humans reward our most faithful friends at times. We regret such heartlessness.</p>
