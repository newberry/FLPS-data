   <p>When we declared war against Spain in 1898 for the sake of liberating the oppressed people in Cuba, was it a wise policy of the United States to meddle with the affairs of the Old World? By so doing it seems to me we violated the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
   <p>Is there any reason now for fighting and killing the Filipinos? Does not liberty and freedom belong to them as much as to the Cubans, or even more so? Certainly it does. All men are created equal, and it is natural for most men to do as they are done by. Therefore, if the Filipinos keep up their fighting as long as possible, I do not blame them, for did not our forefathers do the same in 1776 when they fought with such energy against their mother country, England?</p>
   <p>It seems to me the mistake was made in the beginning of the war in the Philippines. Why did not the United States guarantee to those people peace and the <pb facs="5423969_2_0555.jpg" n="2"/>same freedom that they did for the Cubans?</p>
   <p>But what would you do now? is the question. Say to the Filipinos: "Lay down your arms, return to your villages, and we will give you the word of a great and powerful nation, one that can, if it will, crush you as an eggshell; we will do by you just as we promised to do by the Cubans."</p>
   <p>It is foolish to say that this would imply our defeat. If the foe were something near our size it would be so. But the strength of a giant is not called in question when he is magnanimous to a pigmy.</p>
