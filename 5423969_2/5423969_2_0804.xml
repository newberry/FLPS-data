   <p>Editor Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>It gives me great pleasure to see that you have given space in your paper for Ungdommen (The Youth), something that has long been awaited. Now I want to speak a few words to my young fellow citizens on liberty, for no one can become a good citizen until he has learned his lesson in liberty.</p>
   <p>We live in a land of large and generous liberty. But even liberty has its limits, and they are sometimes quickly reached and easily overstepped. And there is much that passes for liberty which is in reality but another step toward severe bondage. The realization of these false ideas of liberty is a curse rather than a blessing. It brings disaster both to the individual seeking it and to the community of which he is a part.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0805.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What is true liberty? The great fault with nearly all popular ideas of liberty is that they are narrow, false, and grounded in selfishness. They usually express a desire to break away from lawful restraints for the sake of supposed personal advantages. But true liberty is not freedom from law but perfect obedience to the higher laws. We can no more enjoy liberty without law than we can enjoy daylight without the sun. The brighter the sun, the brighter the day. The higher the law, the more clearly seen and obeyed, the larger the liberty enjoyed. This is the conception of liberty given to man by the Great Teacher. When others boasted to him of their freedom, he declared:</p>
   <p>"If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."</p>
   <p>"Or, as the poet Cowper has put it:</p>
   <p>"He is the free man whom the truth makes free, and all are slaves besides."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0806.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But how does the Son make free? Simply by impelling men to do as He did. And how did He do? Listen:</p>
   <p>"I came not to do mine own will but the will of Him who sent me.</p>
   <p>"This liberty is obedience to the highest law, even the law of complete unselfishness.</p>
   <p>And this conception of liberty is more than a theory of the Great Teacher. It has reached the point of practical demonstration in our modern life. The peculiar trend of present day tendencies makes this doubly necessary.</p>
   <p>Young fellow citizens, shall we not apply our best efforts to the task and by every possible means assist in cultivating citizens who shall be free indeed?</p>
