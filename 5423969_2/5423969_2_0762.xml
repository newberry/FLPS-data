   <p>Theodore Roosevelt's administration forms one of the most important chapters in the history of our country. His successor undoubtedly is right in saying that in twenty-five or fifty years President Roosevelt will be ranked with Washington and Lincoln as one of the foremost presidents of this country, and that at such a future day Mr. Roosevelt, like his two great predecessors, will stand in the consciousness of the people as an instrument of Providence, placed in power in order to meet a crisis in our history which is surpassed in importance only by those which Washington and Lincoln were destined to solve.</p>
   <p>Many and great problems have been solved during the seven years that Mr. Roosevelt has been the leader of our government. Skandinaven has in the past given an outline of the work he has accomplished; yet this outline only mentions the most outstanding achievements. A great deal of the work done by Mr. Roosevelt has been of the kind that prepares the way for results which will become manifest <pb facs="5423969_2_0763.jpg" n="2"/>only later. The days of Roosevelt's administration have been busy days for all those holding positions in the government service. He is a man who is ever active, and he demands that all the servants of the people shall do their best, each in his sphere. He has shaken up things, and has speeded up governmental activities in every line.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt has been a sort of political revivalist. He has awakened the sleeping political conscience of the people, and has taught the people to see that "this thing we call law" is not an empty phrase, but a power to which everybody must bow, whether he be big or little, rich or poor: mighty companies and the lone individual are alike subject to this power. The simple truth that law is law had been nearly forgotten, at least by the money-bloated corporations. President Roosevelt has shown them and taught them that the law must be obeyed, and so much has been achieved that his successors must follow in his <pb facs="5423969_2_0764.jpg" n="3"/>footsteps.</p>
   <p>He has also called attention to a number of new questions in various fields--questions which now have become the subject of general discussion. Few of these were new in the sense that they were original with Roosevelt. He has the ability, however, of making any question he considers into an outstanding question, which, in the course of time, will automatically come to a head. As an example of this, may be mentioned the question of the preservation of our natural resources, such as coal and oil, reforestation, utilization of waterways, etc. It is largely due to President Roosevelt that these questions are now presenting themselves to our people as practical problems to be solved by our nation.</p>
   <p>The settlement of the great coal strike was something new in American politics. The prevailing technical interpretation of the Constitution did not approve of government interference in the differences between capital and labor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0765.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Roosevelt showed the people, however, that it was both proper and helpful to the country for the government to take steps to settle the coal strike, and the people are grateful to him for having broken a new path in this field.</p>
   <p>It is natural that a man as active and alert as Mr. Roosevelt should occasionally become too active. Some people think that he has been too outspoken in many fields, others that he has not been dignified enough; that he has interfered in minor matters when there was no need to do so; that he has spoken on many occasions when it would have been better for him to have kept quiet. A large number of his opponents in Congress have been chewing on this for quite some time. He has merely proved by his attitude and his actions how very straight-forward he is. The American people want him to be just the man he is, the honest, fearless, courageous, aggressive servant of the people, rich in great deeds and possessing insignificant faults.</p>
   <p>He will have his place in history as a great pioneer in our politics; a leader <pb facs="5423969_2_0766.jpg" n="5"/>who has led the people to new heights where a clearer atmosphere and a broader outlook are to be found.</p>
