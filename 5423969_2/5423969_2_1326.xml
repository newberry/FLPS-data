   <p>The Chicago Norske Klub, in cooperation with the Norwegian Club of Chicago, extends a cordial invitation to the public to attend its eleventh art exhibition. The affairs will be an Art Fair at the Chicago Norske Klub, 2350 N. Kedzie Boulevard, Nov. 26 to Dec. 4, and will be open week days from 5 to 10 P. M., Saturdays and Sundays, from 12 noon to 11 P. M. This year's exhibition is to be an "Art Fair," thereby giving the public an opportunity to bid on the exhibited art works. The artists are not bound to offer their works at one stated price.</p>
   <p>The offers will be registered by the attending secretary at the sales desk. If at the end of the exhibition the offered bids are acceptable to the artist, the sales are considered closed. Artists have perhaps felt the depression more than many others. There is good reason to believe that the public at this exhibition will be able to find great <pb facs="5423969_2_1327.jpg" n="2"/>Eleventh Annual Norwegian-American Art Exhibit and Art Fair, Saturday, Nov. 26, to Sunday, Dec. 4, 1932.</p>
   <p>bargains. This is indeed a fortunate circumstance because so many are looking forward to selecting their Christmas presents as well as birthday and wedding gifts. We hope that you and your friends will take advantage of this opportunity and look this most interesting exhibit over. There will be ninety seven paintings by thirty-eight artists and ten different pieces of sculpture by two sculptors.</p>
