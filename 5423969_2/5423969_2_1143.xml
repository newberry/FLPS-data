   <p>Captain Soren Peter Lawrence was born at Krageor, Norway, September 28, 1821. He settled in Chicago in October, 1849. He tried his fortune as a sailor and his success as a lake captain was most decided. It did not take him long to sail his own vessel and as time went on he added more vessels to his flotilla. As a commander he was well known among shippers and lake navigators. His vessels generally carried grain from Chicago to Buffalo, or lumber on the upper lakes. His first vessel was "Industry", and he finally owned seven vessels. Captain Lawrence did not continue his activities to the great lakes, but invested his profits in Chicago real estate and also had property in Michigan City. He departed this life on April 25, 1891.</p>
   <p>Captain Lawrence left, among other valuable real estate holdings, a large tract of land in Maywood. Mrs. Lawrence who is a business women far more than ordinary ability sold this land and invested the money in improved property in Sheridan Park near the Wilson Avenue Station.</p>
