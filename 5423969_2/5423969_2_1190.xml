   <p>p.3...............The well-known Norwegian-American violin maker, Knut Rheindal, is back from a visit to Norway. Mr. Rheindal is known as Chicago's Norwegian Stradivarius, due to the wonderful tonal quality of his handmade violins. The purpose of his trip to Norway was not only to visit the home of his childhood,but to obtain materials for violin making. Doorposts, thresholds, planks; all hundreds of years old stripped from age old buildings and shipped here.</p>
   <p>Those who thoroughly understand wood textures say that thousands of old buildings in Norway are built of woods that now are the finest in the world for violin tops, backs and sides and many a poor farmer in Norway has been able to retire and live on what was paid for his old corn crib or other small, age old buildings.</p>
   <p>We understand Mr. Rheindal's present shipment is the largest and best to be received here for many years.</p>
