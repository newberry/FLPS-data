   <p>In the issue of July 28, there appears an article, under the heading "Expansion". As this question is of great importance and one in which I am much interested, I shall try to discuss the question a little further. We have, in several of our clubs, discussed this particular issue, pro and con, and the unanimous opinion seems to be "for expansion".</p>
   <p>Let us compare America and the Philippines with her Anglo-Saxon kindred, Great Britain and her Indian empires; for India and the Philippines are tolerably near neighbors and the experiences of the white man in the two countries may correspond in some respects, notwithstanding the differences in their circumstances.</p>
   <p>America comes into possession of the Philippines as a whole; Great Britain acquired India gradually. Close commercial relations had been established for many years before there was any thought of conquest. Just three hundred years ago the East India Company began to trade in Indian ports. As years went by the company <pb facs="5423969_2_0552.jpg" n="2"/>came into collision. with the trading interest of other nations; the battles of Europe were fought on Indian soil, with the aid of native troops on both sides. One after another, great tracts of country came under British control.</p>
   <p>The responsibility of America for the Philippines falls to her in another fashion. Her commercial relations with the Islands have been insignificant. She seems to seize them by force, yet they are thrust upon her by the inexorable logic of circumstances. America is, as Professor Judson of the University of Chicago said some time ago, "like the man who caught the bear by the tail--he could not safely let go".</p>
   <p>To restore the Islands to Spain would be an inexplicable wrong to civilization; for Spain as a colonizing power is a failure. It would be a crime to force Mexico back under Spanish authority; it would likewise be a crime to restore to Spain any land which has once gone from under her flag. To transfer the Islands to some other nation would involve endless difficulties. Neither can we let the natives govern themselves before they become more civilized. We cannot permit the Philippines to become the prey of lawlessness; we can permit no injustice, or internal revolutions <pb facs="5423969_2_0553.jpg" n="3"/>after the order of South America.</p>
   <p>So for the present at least, we are bound to keep the Philippines, and I have no doubt that they will continue to belong to the United States as they are only a natural growth of territory and besides the Islands are of the utmost importance as a coaling station, without which no country can be a great naval power.</p>
