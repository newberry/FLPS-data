   <p>Whether the administration's assault upon the public schools of Chicago shall succeed or fail will probably be determined at Wednesday's meeting of the Board of Education. If the members of the Board are true to their trust; if they place the welfare of the children of Chicago above the desires of spiteful spoilsmen; if they have any regard whatever for the will and wishes of the people, whose servants they are supposed to be, there can be but one result: an emphatic rejection of the audacious and dangerous schemes of the City Hall. If, on the other hand, a majority of the Board are ready to betray their trust and to have the schools managed not for the benefit of our children but in the interest of selfish politicians; if they are utterly heedless of public sentiment and their sworn duties, they will gratify Mr. Harrison and Mr. Thornton, his man Friday, by deposing Lane and Parker.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0272.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The bold recklessness and unscrupulous audacity of this attack upon our splendid school system are almost beyond comprehension. It is a wanton outrage alike upon the generation that has made our schools what they are and the coming generations that are waiting to be taught and trained in the duties of good citizenship.</p>
   <p>Superintendent Lane has been connected with the public schools of Chicago for some forty years. His life has been devoted to the upbuilding of our educational system and its general excellence is in a large measure the result of his zeal, ability, and tireless efforts. His work has been done with a single-minded devotion to the welfare of the schools; considerations of a political character have always been carefully excluded from their management. He knows every detail of this great structure of popular education, its wants and needs in all departments; he is acquainted with the work of every teacher; in short, he has the public school system of this vast city at his finger tips. His excellent work and high standing as an educator are also known and appreciated not only by the people of Chicago but by educators everywhere in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0273.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And now this faithful official and valuable public servant is to be deposed for no other reason than that he will not permit spoils politics to taint and corrupt the management of the schools, and he is to be succeeded by an Eastern gentleman who knows nothing about our schools, who has little or no experience gathered in the field of popular education, and whose main qualification for the position is that he is an advocate of free silver coinage at sixteen to one!</p>
   <p>The scheme is so utterly absurd and immoral as to constitute a rank insult to an intelligent community. Yet Mr. Thornton may succeed if the Mayor and the Board of Education will shoulder the responsibility. But no gentleman possessed of a high sense of humor will accept a position tendered for such reasons and in such a manner.</p>
   <p>The attempt to remove Colonel Parker is on a level with the attack upon Superintendent Lane. The Normal School of Chicago is recognized in America, and in Europe as well, as a model institution of its kind and as a center of the best educational thought; its superintendent is regarded as one of the foremost educators of our day. It has been a great factor in the development of <pb facs="5423969_2_0274.jpg" n="4"/>popular education in Chicago, while its inspiring and helpful influence has extended far beyond the limits of the State. Colonel Parker has devoted sixteen years of energetic work to the moulding of the ideal institution. But Mr. Thornton cares nothing for this. If he can gratify a personal grudge, he is ready to remove a public servant who cannot be replaced and to destroy a most admirable and useful public institution.</p>
   <p>It remains for the Board of Education to say whether this carefully planned outrage upon our schools shall be permitted, whether such an unspeakable vandalism shall be committed in the name of Chicago. Indications are that Mr. Harrison is so completely dominated by Thornton that he is ready to put the brand of infamy upon his administration and sacrifice his not unpromising future in order to gratify his mentor and master. He now has a splendid opportunity to break his chains of tutelage and prove that he is not merely the figurehead of his own administration. But the probabilities are that Mr. Thornton has already forestalled any move in this direction and that he will make His Honor toe the mark even if he thereby seals his political death warrant.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0275.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The only hope, then, is in the Board of Education.</p>
