   <p>p.6...................Members of "Den Norsk Glee Klub" (the Norwegian Glee Club) were agreeably surprised on Tuesday evening when, after their rehearsal, they were invited into the dining-room by A. N. Nokleby, one of the oldest members. Speechless for the moment, they beheld a long table with two rows of glistening glasses while in the center stood a large beautiful punch bowl steaming with the goodness of its contents. Mr. Nokleby bade the singers be seated and requested that they all sample the punch. The sampling brought forth the highest praise for Mr. Nokleby and the excellence of his punch and when he at last was given an opportunity, to do other than serve, he presented the club with the bowl and glasses. The gift was accepted for the club by the club's president who also thanked Mr. Nokleby for his long and faithful service as a singer in the club.</p>
