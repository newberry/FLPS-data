   <p>In his reply article, Alfred O. Erickson is good enough to entertain us with a sample of forensic eloquence that comes dangerously near being fustian and claptrap. A couple of "Irish bulls" are notably amusing.</p>
   <p>In accusing those wicked Olson sisters of various grave trangressions, he speaks of "the serenity of family ties". One has heard of the sanctity of such ties. In the next line he styles their imitations "sheer mimicry of our language," and hence, condemns them. Why, it is just because they are "sheer mimicry" that they are good, while Mr. Alfred Erickson's sheer nonsense is less good. The word he was hunting for and missed, was probably "travesty".</p>
   <p>Striking a heroic attitude, he remindsus of the classical Captain Thraso, or the more recent Jacob von Tyboe. Mr. Erickson assures us of his ability to stand alone. Casting about for an apt quotation to give glamour to his knight-errantry, a misty recollection of something he has heard or read crosses his busy brain.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1369.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Eureka! Unfortunately, the same looseness that marks his style here plays him another trick. The saying he attributes to Bjornson happens to be a dictum of Dr. Stockmann in Ibsen's "En Folkefjende" [An Enemy of the People].</p>
   <p>Such are Alfred O. Erickson's literary qualifications.</p>
   <p>He informs us that he has been "deluged" with expressions of praise and approval. He is perhaps in no immediate danger of drowning. But even so, one cannot help regretting that there is so much foolishness among us.</p>
