   <p>The revelations made by the Merriam Commission and the Chicago Inter Ocean unfold a tale of sloth, waste, incompetency, and corruption that is all but incredible. Mr. Busse was put in the mayor's chair by the people because they wanted a business administration. They got it, and they have to pay for it, too. There has always been more or less of waste and corruption in the management of the municipal affairs of Chicago; but never before have the taxpayers been robbed in such a "businesslike" manner as under the present administration.</p>
   <p>Concerns have been organized for the express purpose of public stealing and no other, and have done a rushing and most profitable business. It is doubtful whether all the dark chapters of civic misgovernment will reveal anything that compares with the unblushing brazenness of Chicago Fire Appliance Company in its successful robbing of the taxpayers. Yes, we got a "business administration" with a vengeance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0124.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What are the voters of Chicago going to do about it? They have a state's attorney who has shown that he proposes to take a hand in the matter; but the real remedy is in the hands of the voters. Even this administration will come to an end. What sort of men are to replace those now in power? It is for the voters to answer this question; but if they permit the politicians to answer for them, as they have done now for many years, we know what the result will be. Every mayor elected in recent years has been entrusted with power on the promise that he would give the city a good business administration. But every mayor so elected has been a creature and tool of politicians and rings of public robbers, and hence has run the city for their and his own benefit at the expense of the people. The present administration is no exception, barring the businesslike and incomparable excellency of its methods of fleecing the taxpayers.</p>
   <p>What are the voters going to do about it? They are--that is to say, the great bulk of them--honest, hard-working people who want an honest and efficient city government--a true business administration. But they are confused and disorganized and only too easily run by the comparatively small squads of hangers-on and healers <pb facs="5423969_2_0125.jpg" n="3"/>who live on the remnants or crumbs thrown to them by the big public thieves.</p>
   <p>We have a number of organizations that make it a specialty to preach public virtue from the housetops and stake out lines of ideal citizenship. But, somehow, they appear to be indifferent to audacious public crimes stalking bodily before their very eyes. We have great and strong organizations of businessmen--good, active, vigorous men--who dream beautiful dreams about the "City Beautiful". That is all right in its time and place and something all good citizens should support within lines of practical action. But these good and strong men should not forget that the first condition and very foundation of a "City Beautiful" is honest city government. With a government rotten at the core we cannot get the ideal city that has been pictured before our eyes, nor would it be fit to live in if we could get it.</p>
   <p>It is plain to all that the first and indispensable need of Chicago is a real business administration headed, not by a politician, but by a businessman whose <pb facs="5423969_2_0126.jpg" n="4"/>sole aim will be to clean the Augean stables of the City Hall and manage our municipal affairs honestly and well. And our businessmen and their organizations can do more than any other agency to give us such an administration. If they will take up this task in dead earnest they will see the great body of the great people fall into line behind them, and success will be assured.</p>
   <p>Will they do it? Now is the time to act.</p>
