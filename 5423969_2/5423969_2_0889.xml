   <p>Recently a reader asked if the coming generation of women shall cast a vote or if they shall continue obeying the rules made by man. The women have now for nearly nineteen hundred years obeyed the rules made by man, and what wonderful progress has not the world made! Would woman suffrage have abolished slavery in the United States any sooner than it was done? Would it have destroyed Spanish tyranny in Cuba any sooner than it was done? Remember what wonderful progress has been made in the United States during these last two hundred years. Could it have been possible for the American people to have prospered any more than they have done if the women had had the right to vote? We think not.</p>
   <p>We now live in a wonderful age of prosperity, and when you have a good thing keep it. A woman should not interfere with a man's business because "too many cooks spoil the broth".</p>
