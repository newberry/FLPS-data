   <p>In his speech of acceptance in Indianapolis, Mr. W. J. Bryan said, among other things: "If I am elected I shall immediately convene the Congress in extra session as soon as I have been inaugurated, and shall then recommend that it is the intention of the nation:</p>
   <p>"To inaugurate a permanent government in the Philippines just as we are now establishing a permanent government in Cuba.</p>
   <p>"To grant the Philippines independence just as we have promised to grant independence to Cuba.</p>
   <p>"To protect the Philippines from outside intervention while the people are busy there arranging for government and development, just as we have protected <pb facs="5423969_2_0531.jpg" n="2"/>the republics of Central and South America, and under the Monroe Doctrine are obligated to protect Cuba."</p>
   <p>This is the first clear statement we have had from Bryan as to what steps he would take if he were given leadership. Every earlier statement is simply criticism of his opponents, or generalities without any definite meaning. On this occasion, however, he gave a binding declaration regarding his politics. It looks, to be sure, as if he were already regretting the statement made; in his speech to the Populists in Kansas he returned to vague and indefinite generalities. He is, however, bound by his definite declaration in Indianapolis. Skandinaven, on an earlier occasion, has discussed the platform outlined in Indianapolis; we shall, however, take it under scrutiny once more.</p>
   <p>Our first task in the Philippines, according to Mr. Bryan, is to found a <pb facs="5423969_2_0532.jpg" n="3"/>lasting government there. Thus Mr. Bryan acknowledges our right to exercise authority over the Islands. This authority is based on the peace treaty by which Spain relinguished the Philippines. If, however, we have the right to exercise authority in the Islands, then Aguinaldo and his followers had no right to oppose this authority. According to Mr. Bryan's statement they are rebels, and it was the duty as well as the right of the government to quell this rebellion. This task of the government is now nearly finished.</p>
   <p>It is, then, evident that Mr. Bryan is in agreement with the attempt of the government to quell Aguinaldo's revolt. However, he wants to make people believe that such is not the case. The first part of his platform in this respect gives conclusive proof, however, of his real opinion. The desired declaration for a permanent government in the Philippines has already been made. It was first presented in the proclamation from the President to the Filipinos published about a year ago by General Otis, and since then it has been repeated by both the appointed commissioners. The Congress has tacitly <pb facs="5423969_2_0533.jpg" n="4"/>sanctioned the declaration by placing the matter in the hands of the President.</p>
   <p>The first condition, however, for a permanent government in the Philippines is the crushing of the revolt. As such has been done in locality after locality, government has been organized in a number of cities in the Islands.</p>
   <p>The first plank on Mr. Bryan's platform is, then, coincident with the politics of the present government. The difference is simply this: that the government has done what Mr. Bryan declares that he intends to do, or what he would have to do in order to put his plan into action.</p>
   <p>Next, Mr. Bryan wants the Congress to promise the Filipinos independence. To this is to be said, first of all, that under the Constitution the Congress does not have the authority to do so. The Philippines are now a part of the United States, and the Constitution does not give to Congress the authority to relinquish any part of the country. Before the Philippines can <pb facs="5423969_2_0534.jpg" n="5"/>be relinquished the United States Constitution must be changed; only when and if that has been done could the Congress legally adopt a resolution such as Mr. Bryan desires. In addition, under the treaty of peace the United States is under obligation to govern the Philippines for at least ten years.</p>
   <p>A Democratic congress would, however, probably follow Mr. Bryan on this point. Aguinaldo would greet such a resolution as an invitation to start a new revolution; of this there cannot be a shadow of doubt. As president, Mr. Bryan would then be compelled to start a new war in order to enable him to realize the first plank on his platform, or else he would be compelled to declare the country unable to accomplish the task to which it had set itself. In the latter case he would of course withdraw the troops, lower the flag, and make the country ridiculous before the whole world.</p>
   <p>The comparison with Cuba does not fit into the picture at all; it is merely <pb facs="5423969_2_0535.jpg" n="6"/>one of the tricks which Mr. Bryan uses to deceive the people. The Congress definitely declared that the intention in starting the war was to set Cuba free and to found a stable government on the island. Nobody was thinking of the Philippines at the time, and no promise or declaration was given in regard to the latter. They became part of our country as a result of the war, and Mr. Bryan himself acknowledges the fact that they are rightly ours. From this it follows that the first task of our government was to maintain our authority and our laws on the Islands. Our government has exerted the same authority and the same duty in Cuba, and of course would have had to use force also there if required.</p>
   <p>The last plank on Mr. Bryan's platform is the most remarkable. According to this plank, the Congress is to bind the United States to protect the Philippines against attacks by other powers. In other words, Mr. Bryan wants to extend the Monroe Doctrine to Asia!</p>
   <p>It is as certain as night follows day that intervention in the affairs of the <pb facs="5423969_2_0536.jpg" n="7"/>Philippines would start the very day when the Star-Spangled Banner had been lowered on the Islands. Battleships from England, France, Germany, and Japan would compete in their speed for control of the Islands. Our country would then, according to Bryan, be under obligation to keep a navy on hand strong enough to keep all these powers from gaining control of the Islands. Or does Mr. Bryan believe that these countries would bow down before a resolution extending the Monroe Doctrine to Asia? Not till one year ago did the powers acknowledge the validity of the Doctrine as far as America is concerned; and is it then probable that they would acknowledge the same Doctrine for Asia without a murmur. It must not be forgotten, in this connection, that Europe and Asia are extensions, one of the other, while America has no land connected with either.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bryan's program is sheer madness from beginning to end. It would lead the country into endless dangers and difficulties and end up in shame and dishonor. Yet, if Mr. Bryan is elected president, this program will be the program of our country. If Mr. Bryan is elected one may assume that the <pb facs="5423969_2_0537.jpg" n="8"/>Congress too will become Democratic, and then, in seven months the Congress will be convened to put his program to work. The country will be thrown into a state of agitation which would create doubt and uncertainty in all conditions here at home and lead to dangerous developments abroad. The silver agitation would gain new life; capital would be frightened; industry would be paralyzed; factories would close; and soup kitchens would once more become the only refuge for the workers.</p>
   <p>There would not, however, pass any seven month's time before the consequences would appear. The overturn would begin even the day after the results of the election had been announced. But the power is with the voters. If the voters wish conditions as here indicated, they need merely vote for Mr. Bryan to have their wishes fulfilled.</p>
