   <p>The structural iron workers will be represented by their own attorney at the Coliseum inquest. This is as it should be and will aid materially in fixing the responsibility for the appalling disaster.</p>
   <p>Indications are that the frightful calamity would not have occurred if a competent inspector had been in charge of the work--that the loss of the twelve men who were crushed to death amid the falling beams is due to a criminal abuse of political power. Colonel Hersey, whose qualifications will not be called in question, states in an expert opinion:</p>
   <p>"The inspector for the building department for the city for that district is Mr. Barnes. He is the chief of inspectors, a place made for him a year or so ago. He gets a salary of $1,800 a year, while the inspectors get $100 <pb facs="5423969_2_0259.jpg" n="2"/>a month. Now, Barnes knows absolutely nothing about structural work. He is a gravel roofer by trade, and not a very good one at that. He is totally incompetent to fill the position of an inspector, and why such a man should be given the place he holds is more than I can understand, except when politics are taken into consideration."</p>
   <p>The appointing power cannot plead ignorance of the unfitness of the inspector. Upon this point the testimony of the president of the civil service commission is conclusive. Mr. [Robert] Lindblom [Swede] says:</p>
   <p>"It was a political appointment sent in by the building inspection department. It was made some time last summer, to the best of my recollection. His name came in as an appointment of the City Council, and the civil service commission was asked to confirm the election. We declined to do so. Then the department of building inspection--I suppose Mr. McAndrews was at the head of the movement--came to us with the contention that, so long as Barnes had been named by the City Council, he was exempt from civil service rules. After some <pb facs="5423969_2_0260.jpg" n="3"/>consideration the board passed upon the point, declaring that the source of the appointment did not make any difference, and that Barnes must pass the examination before the board and be duly qualified. The building inspection department pleaded the necessity of his services and we agreed to make him a sixty-day appointee."</p>
   <p>In view of these facts, no sane man can doubt the disaster was due to culpable negligence on the part of the city authorities concerned. The wonder is that there have not been more calamities of a similar kind in the same district. It is to be hoped that the matter will be probed to the bottom, and that the responsibility will be placed where it belongs, even if the list of offenders should include the Mayor, the head of the building inspection department, every member of the City Council, and the complaisant civil service commission as well.</p>
   <p>The irresistible conclusion is that a shocking crime has been committed. Let full justice be meted out to the criminals, whoever they may be.</p>
