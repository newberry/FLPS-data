   <p>In accordance with our report of yesterday, we take the liberty of correcting a few misstatements of the Herald of yesterday. The facts are these: Anna Jansen and Selma Berge of 38 Chatham Court were patients in the 8th ward of the County Hospital three and four and one-half weeks, respectively. The former, according to a telephone report from the Hospital to Dr. Mitchell at Klaner's Morgue, 186 Milwaukee Avenue, died on account of "suspected typhoid fever," and the latter died from a well defined case of typhoid fever. The strict dieting, usual in such cases, had been practised, and in all probability, was considerably intensified. The patients received little or no milk, but were requested to drink water. After having been out of bed for several days, the parties in question were discharged. Not as the Herald reported "at their own requests," but were dismissed in spite of their requests to be permitted to remain. Anna Jansen died two hours after leaving the hospital, and her last words were that she was very hungry. Selma Berge was given shelter by merciful strangers, Nels Johnson and family 108 Elizabeth Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0731.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Selma Berge is a Swede and the Johnson family are Norwegians. Dr. Urheim, a graduate of the Bennet Medical College, examined Miss Berge about sixty hours after she had left the hospital, and said that in her condition she should have remained at the hospital at least a week longer. He says that it was quite unreasonable to deny the patients milk, and that it was a criminal offense to substitute water, which, as far as Chicago is concerned, in all probability is the main cause of the typhoid fever epidemic. Anna Jansen's body was taken to Klaner's Morgue on Monday, and on the following day, Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Dorum were summoned to attend the inquest, but no inquest was held. Dr. Mitchell became violently enraged at Mr. Johnson for his account of the real facts in the case. After Dr. Mitchell performed a post-mortem examination, as far as we can learn, without jury or witnesses, he issued a death certificate, stating that death was caused from typhoid fever, but said nothing about the post-mortem, or Miss Jansen's sudden death. On Wednesday, there was no record to be found of her case in the coroner's office. When yesterday's Herald reported that the death certificate stated "that heart failure and exhaustion had caused the young woman's death," the Reporter for the Herald could not have seen the certificate, but must have obtained the information from Dr. Mitchell himself, which was not the true facts.</p>
