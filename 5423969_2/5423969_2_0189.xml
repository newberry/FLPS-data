   <p>Judge Hanecy is making a great campaign. The outlook, which was somewhat discouraging at the start, is improving every day. His straightforward and convincing arguments, his deep earnestness and sincerity, and his frank and manly personality have made a strong impression upon the people. The apathetic and indifferent voters are quickened into action; the stalwarts are inspired with fresh zeal; and thousands of honest Democrats are flocking to his standard. No candidate for mayor in Chicago ever conducted a more vigorous, a more dignified, or a more telling campaign. He goes straight to the core of every question and speaks the plain unvarnished truth. Voters cannot attend his meetings without being thoroughly convinced that he means just what he says and has the ability, strength, and courage to do what he thinks is right and prevent what he thinks is wrong. "That's the man for mayor" is the silent verdict even of people who received his nomination with indifference.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0190.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There is no objection to Judge Hanecy on personal grounds. His eminent fitness is admitted on every hand. No one doubts that if elected he would give the city a clean, honest, and efficient business administration. But the "independent" press and a group of "independent" Republicans profess to dislike him because he has the support of the "machine". How honest people can oppose Judge Hanecy on such grounds and yet support Carter Harrison is one of those puzzles that no man can solve. They cannot but know that Harrison is the creation and tool of Burke, Kenna, Coughlin, and their ilk, and that the Burke machine is the most corrupt, the filthiest, and the most dangerous organization that ever sucked the lifeblood of this great city. And yet Judge Hanecy is objectionable because Lorimer is one of his supporters!</p>
   <p>This despicable hypocrisy is the real cause of the present terrible plight of Chicago. The Burke-Harrison machine has been enabled to fasten its grip upon the city because the people have been hoodwinked and misled. Large <pb facs="5423969_2_0191.jpg" n="3"/>numbers of voters have no real conception of the fearful squandering of public funds that has been going on, because the facts have been suppressed or glossed over by the newspapers they have been reading. And the campaign of deception is still kept up with unabated vigor.</p>
   <p>It will not succeed if the honest voters, Republicans and Democrats alike, do their duty. Judge Hanecy's aggressive and fearless campaign has turned the tide in favor of the Republican ticket, and the prospects for his election are now good. The more the voters see of him the more they like him. They have come to understand that he is no man's man--that he and no one else will be mayor if he is elected--and that, with Judge Hanecy in the mayor's chair, Chicago would have a man and no longer a puppet for chief magistrate. But untiring and vigorous work is necessary in order to insure victory for decency and clean government. Chicago expects every honest voter to do his duty.</p>
