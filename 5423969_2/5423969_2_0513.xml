   <p>The relationship between the United States and Japan has of late become a primary topic for consideration, both in this country and in Europe. The resolve on the part of our government to dispatch a fleet to the Pacific Ocean, consisting of our largest and best battleships would, of course, arouse attention, all the more,because in Japan there has of late been in evidence attitude of bitterness towards America. It is a matter, of course, that the issues involving the Pacific,will have to be settled before long. If the United States keep a sufficiently strong navy in the Pacific with up-to-date fortresses, mines, and ship yards on the Western Coast, in Alaska, in Hawaii, in the Philippines, the question will solve itself, without war.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0514.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But if the naval and coastal defenses be neglected, then a war with Japan will be as inevitable as the coming of night after day.</p>
   <p>Two things this country must do without delay if war is to be avoided; the Panama canal must be dug, and our navy must be doubled in strength. That done, the cocky Japanese will cease turning up their noses at us, and peace will be secured.</p>
   <p>Our farsighted President is wiser also in regard to this matter than many of the older politicians in our country.</p>
