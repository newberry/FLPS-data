   <p>President McKinley's speech in reply to the message of the notification committee adds strength to the only weak point in the Republican platform, the expansion plank.</p>
   <p>The declaration of the national platform on expansion was a distinct disappointment to the great majority of Republicans. It was weak, vague, and indefinite, and altogether out of harmony with the policy of the administration. The country has since learned that the unsatisfactory plank was the outcome of "Quigging". A member of the resolution committee, Mr. Quigg of New York, who was charged with editing the platform utterance agreed upon by the committee, undertook to revise the original draft of the declaration on expansion, which had been approved by the administration and the leading men of the convention. This unauthorized change was not discovered by the <pb facs="5423969_2_0544.jpg" n="2"/>convention until the program had been adopted, and several days passed before the history of the "Quigging" of the platform became public property.</p>
   <p>The chagrin of those mainly responsible for the action of the convention may well be imagined, but there was nothing to do except to leave it to the candidate to correct the unfortunate mistake. This the President has done in his speech of acceptance at Canton, the first opportunity offered him for an official declaration on behalf of the party. And he spoke in no uncertain terms. His language is clear and vigorous, concise and definite:</p>
   <p>"The Philippines are ours, and American authority must be supreme throughout the archipelago. There will be amnesty, broad and liberal, but no abandonment of our duty. There must be no scuttle policy. We will fulfill in the Philippines the obligations imposed by the triumphs of our arms, and by the treaty of peace, by international law, by the nation's sense of honor, and, more than all, by the rights, interests, and conditions of the Philippine people themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0545.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"No outside interference blocks the way to peace and a stable government. Obstructionists are here, not elsewhere. They may postpone, but they cannot defeat the realization of the high purpose of this nation to restore order to the Islands and establish a just and generous government in which the inhabitants shall have the largest participation for which they are capable."</p>
   <p>There is no evasion, no subterfuge, no trickery in this ringing declaration. "No abandonment of our rights, no abandonment of our duty, no scuttle policy"--this is the true creed, conviction, and purpose of the Republican party. And that is as it has always been, the true American policy. Cowards and trimmers have no place in American history. The American people have turned down every party that pursued a scuttle policy, as they have upheld every party that met new responsibilities with a stout heart and unfaltering courage. The President knows and trusts the people, and they know and trust him. They have confidence in his wisdom and his courage, they love him for his sincerity and frank manliness, and they will respond generously to his appeal to their patriotism in the following eloquent words:</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0546.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"I cannot conclude without congratulating my countrymen upon the strong national sentiment which finds expression in every part of our common country, and the increased respect with which the American name is greeted throughout the world. We have been moving in untried paths, but our steps have been guided by honor and duty. There will be no turning aside, no wavering, no retreat. Not a blow has been struck except for liberty and humanity, and none will be. We will perform without fear every national and international obligation. The Republican party was dedicated to freedom forty-four years ago. It has been the party of liberty and emancipation from that hour, not of profession, but of performance. It broke the shackles of four million slaves and made them free, and to the party of Lincoln has come another supreme opportunity, which it has bravely met in the liberation of ten million members of the human family from the yoke of imperialism."</p>
