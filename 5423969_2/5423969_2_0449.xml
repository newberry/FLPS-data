   <p>The total value of production of animals for slaughter amounts to $4,000,000,000. Our production of corn is ten times as great as that of any other country. Our wheat production is greater than in any competing country. Our cotton forms more than one half of the whole world's supply. We produce twice as much coal as England, our nearest competitor. Our oil production is twice as large as that of Russia, our nearest competitor in this field. So, also, in the line iron and steel; here we produce twice as much as Germany which comes next to the U.S. - Of copper we produce more than all the other countries in the world together. Last year we produced factory goods for more than thirty-six billion dollars, and the value of our exports exceeded that of our imports by more than three billion dollars. The United States' gold reserve is over one third of the world's supply of gold, and our national wealth averages more than $2,000., for every man, woman and child in the country.</p>
