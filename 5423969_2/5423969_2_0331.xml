   <p>Senator Mason's public statements since his election have made a good impression upon the community. His "speech of acceptance" was in good taste, well balanced and admirably tempered. What he said about trusts and trust legislation stamps him as a mature thinker who has the courage of his convictions. And his challenge to the Cook County bosses proves that his victory was not due to any questionable bargain of any sort.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven was the only newspaper in Chicago that supported Mason for the senatorship, first, last and all the time until he was elected, and naturally Skandinaven felt gratified when its position was so emphatically endorsed by the General Assembly.</p>
