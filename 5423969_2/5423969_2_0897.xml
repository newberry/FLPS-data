   <p>Sometimes I have asked myself, "why do we have these "lags" (societies), such as Stavanger "Amt 'lags' (Agricultural Societies), and all the others, and why should we continue having them?"</p>
   <p>Are we thereby trying to perpetuate in our adopted land something foreign, something, perhaps, which may prevent us from becoming thorough and good Americans?</p>
   <p>My answer to this query is, no, we do not. In fact, I believe we are better and more useful citizens of our adopted country because of the fact that <pb facs="5423969_2_0898.jpg" n="2"/>we have good traditions behind us, because we have good and great examples in the history of our ancestors which we may emulate, and because the possession of such ideals, by ourselves and by our descendants, is a boon to our adopted land. In other words, people who come here in possession of good traditions of honor, of justice, of frugality, of enlightenment, of spiritual and material achievements, as do the Norwegian people, are in a position to enrich their adopted country, not only with their muscle and brawn, which they undeniably have done to the fullest extent, but they will also enrich the culture and ideals of the communities in which they live.</p>
   <p>Now, these "Lags" and our annual meetings only serve to refresh our memories and give us an opportunity to renew old friendships, relationships, and comradeships.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0899.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There is nothing clannish or foreign about them. If they are clannish, then we are equally so in having our Indiana societies, our Ohio societies, New England societies, and so forth. There is nothing foreign about these "Lags" (Societies) ,because we are, all of us, Americans. We yield to none in our allegiance to this country, and we harbor none other. We have parted forever from our motherland, we have sworn to become citizens of the United States in order to be able to enjoy the full benefits of such citizenship in times of peace and plenty, but also with a will to share fully our country's struggles, her sorrows and sufferings in case of war.</p>
   <p>We yield to none as American citizens of the best type. If you live in a neighborhood where ignorant people speak of you as foreigners because you perhaps speak English with a Norwegian accent, take him by the hand and <pb facs="5423969_2_0900.jpg" n="4"/>tell him that deeds speak louder than words. Show him the farm you have wrested from the wilderness by your good American hands, the home you have built, your family, your bank book, show him your business, your store or your factory which you built up with your good American hands and brains and tell him, these and not the accent of my speech are my proofs of good American citizenship.</p>
   <p>NOTE: The above is part of a speech delivered by Mr. Osland at the Stavanger "Amts Lags" (Agricultural Society) convention at Ottawa, Ill., Sept. 12, 1917. More than two hundred Chicagoans participated in the convention. Extra trains carried the delegations. Mr. Osland, I understand, is a Chicagoan.</p>
