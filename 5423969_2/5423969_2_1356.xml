   <p>Emil Bjorn, singer, musician, director, artist, composer, journalist and ever-present in our Norwegian colony, has recently finished what may well be acclaimed his masterpiece in art. The painting, which is six feet by eight, shows the god of old Norwegian mythology, Odin, and Odrerir (the goddess of poetry) guaffing the mead of the gods. The inscription at the bottom of the picture reads, "When Odrerir gave Odin a drink of the priceless mead, he was made cognizant of the wisdom of the Naiads."</p>
   <p>The painting was ordered by Dr. Max Henius for the twenty-five-year jubilee of the Brewing Institute, which is to be celebrated this week. On Monday the picture was given a permanent place on the spacious wall of the lobby of the Wahl and Henius Brewing Institute, where hundreds of delegates and visitors to the Brewers' Exhibit have seen and greatly admired it. The picture is an allegorical work and exceptionally well and beautifully done.</p>
