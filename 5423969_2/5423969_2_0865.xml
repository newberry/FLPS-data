   <p>Scandinavian women, the move is on! The first step has been taken. A committee has been appointed in Minnesota to start agitation for the right of women to vote. At a meeting, Sept. 19, in the home of Mrs. Marie Melgard the preliminary steps were taken.</p>
   <p>The task of the women selected will be to awaken public sentiment in behalf of women suffrage.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all women to help support this important social reform. Remember, the time is ripe for women to concentrate their interest vigorously on this objective, so as to aid in the work of saving home and country. Not lust for honor or power but our duty to help man spiritually <pb facs="5423969_2_0866.jpg" n="2"/>compels us to take this step. We must step into the arena to help the men with our feminine, spiritual capital. Our feeling of responsibility for the coming generation, our hatred of war-breeding politics and our desire for a lasting peace constitute the reason for our move.</p>
   <p>We are fully aware of the responsibility involved, but we are willing to assume it in the conviction that a higher power is sustaining us, giving us strength and courage.</p>
   <p>The attainment of woman suffrage will be possible if women rally to the banner. So, now, women, let us get rid of our attitude of indifference and prepare for action!</p>
   <p>The first lecture on "Women's Right to Vote," given by Gina Krage, in <pb facs="5423969_2_0867.jpg" n="3"/>Christana, Norway, in 1885, may be had from the committee for ten cents to cover postage. All questions concerning women's right to vote should be sent to Miss Anna Ursin, 2439 13th Avenue, S., Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
