   <p>Let one fact be solidly established, once and for all! The Scandinavian Art Exhibit is an outstanding event. It is the most impressive expression to the spirit of Scandinavia ever brought to this country, portraying as it does the highest ideals of a people and their incessant striving for advancement and beauty. Even a person with no knowledge of painting or sculpture cannot visit this exhibit without being impressed by its subtle influence for the better.</p>
   <p>The well-known Chicago artist, Henrik Lund, supervises the exhibit; he has been fortunate in obtaining the most advantageous facilities for displaying the various groups of paintings. Many of these require distance as well as proper lighting effects to bring out their real beauty and detail; for example, the painting of the Danish artist, Willumsen, entitled, "Ungdom og Solskin" (Youth and Sunshine), which is a"little" picture measuring 18 feet in width and 12 <pb facs="5423969_2_1347.jpg" n="2"/>feet in height. This picture was first hung on the largest wall of one of the small rooms allotted the exhibit, but upon viewing the painting in such cramped quarters the superintendent of the institute immediately made other arrangements and placed the largest exhibit hall and several other rooms at the disposal of Mr. Lund.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lund spoke enthusiastically of the reception accorded the exhibit at Buffalo and Toledo, and predicted an even greater success for the Chicago show.</p>
   <p>We were especially impressed with Det Syge Barn (The Sick Child) by Munch. The flaming hair repelled us, but the wax-like transparency of the child's face and the big expressive eyes drew us back to the picture again and again, and we were lost in the beauteous rapture of the picture. Space does not permit recording our impressions of the other pictures; we will only say that it will be well worth-while for all Scandinavians to spend a day or more with them.</p>
