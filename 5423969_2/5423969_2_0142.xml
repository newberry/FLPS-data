   <p>The senatorial contest now being fought out in Illinois may more properly be described as the senatorial disgrace. The election of a senator of the United States, as provided for by the Constitution, was to be a solemn act of political wisdom and dignity. However, in these latter days, wisdom and dignity are very conspicuous by their absence; what counts now are schemes, plots, counterplots, and wire pulling. Instead of the high honor being conferred unsought by the representatives of the people upon the ablest and worthiest son of the state, we behold a fierce scramble among a lot of politicians endowed with ordinary abilities and extraordinary craving for public office.</p>
   <p>It is such a spectacle that has disgraced the good name of Illinois for the last two or three weeks; and the end is not yet in sight. Public servants <pb facs="5423969_2_0143.jpg" n="2"/>in Chicago and other parts of the state have deserted their posts of duty and left the work they are paid to do, and swarmed to Springfield to "plug" for this or that candidate for the toga. A United States senator and several congressmen have spent weeks in Springfield while Congress is in session in Washington where they ought to be. Nearly every federal office holder in Chicago and the state at large has hied himself to Springfield to pull wires for Hopkins. Ever and anon Washington has been wont to forbid "pernicious political activity" on the part of federal officeholders; but such activity is evidently all right when the purpose is to cajole or threaten the representatives of the people to support the re-election of a United States senator who is short of votes. In such emergencies the deserted offices of Uncle Sam will have to take care of themselves. The same is true of the servants of the state, the officers of Cook County, and the more prominent officers in Chicago, from the mayor down. All have been absent from the work they are supposed to do, and all have spent their time on matters that are none of their concern at all.</p>
   <p>The members of the legislature, who are, or are supposed to be, responsible <pb facs="5423969_2_0144.jpg" n="3"/>to their constituents and to them only, and to vote according to the will of their constituents and their own best judgement--they do not figure in the game at all except as pawns. Evidently all are wearing somebody's collar. The question is not how this senator or that representative proposes to vote; the point is how he will be told to vote by somebody who "controls" him. The governor "controls" a large following, we are told, Congressman Lorimer another, and other leaders are credited with lawmakers who are ready to do their bidding. Even obscure committeemen, whose names nobody ever heard of, "control" some senator or representative. All these bosses, big and little, are striving to corral those whom they "control", like so many sheep, and to group them and vote them for their own special benefit; and upon the outcome of all this scrambling and scheming and plugging and browbeating depends the election of a senator of the United States.</p>
   <p>What about the people? Bah! Who put the silly question? The people have nothing to say in the matter. Nobody cares what they want or think. When <pb facs="5423969_2_0145.jpg" n="4"/>it comes to paying taxes or voting for office hunters the people are all right, of course; not merely all right, they are great, positively great. But they ought to know that those whom they elect are not apt to consider what the people think or want--after election.</p>
   <p>The senatorial contest in Illinois, and other states too, for that matter, is a caricature upon popular and representative government and a scandalous farce. Honor and true manhood have been thrown to the winds by everybody. Apparently it does not occur to any candidate that an office that has to be won by threats or tricks or begging is no honor at all to him who gets it by such means.</p>
   <p>The deadlock that is blocking legislation from week to week can be broken quickly and easily if those concerned will act upon the advice of the Skandinaven. And the road out of the muddle is straight and plain:</p>
   <p>"Let Senator Hopkins and the congressmen return to their work in Washington.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0146.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let all other officeholders attend to their respective duties and cease bothering the lawmakers. Let the lawmakers vote, each free and untrammeled, for the man of his choice. Then there would be a quick election; the best man would win; and the toga would be an honor to the victor. The contest as now carried on is an honor to nobody, but disgrace to all.</p>
