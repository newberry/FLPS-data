<title level="a">THE CASE OF BANKER PAULSEN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The case against the former banker William A. Paulsen, who is accused of having accepted deposits in his bank after the latter was insolvent, came before Judge Brentano on Tuesday. State's Attorney Deneen and Assistant State's Attorney Barnes are conducting the case against Mr. Paulsen. Both Mr. Paulsen and Mr. Jacob Rice, the accusing witness, were on the witness stand. Mr. Rice declared that on March 2, 1896, he deposited $209 with Mr. Paulsen, in the latter's bank. This took place just before noon, Mr. Rice says, and in the afternoon, Mr. Paulsen prepared a balance sheet of his business, showing the bank to be insolvent, and this balance sheet was deposited in the County Court the following day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paulsen was formerly president of the Central Trust and Savings Bank, which became insolvent on March 3, 1896. Mr. Paulsen testified that the assets of the bank one week before the date of bankruptcy amounted to $30,362.24, or about seventy-five per cent of the debt.</p>
