  <body>
   <p>During the terrible crisis in China our government has acted in a manner altogether above criticism. The dignified and prudent policy pursued has won general acclaim, not only in this country but in foreign countries as well.</p>
   <p>When it appeared that large military forces were required to bring about peace and safeguard the foreigners in China, the old question of a division of the country once more moved up to the forefront. It became evident that several of the European powers intended to use the occasion for a division of China. The United States does not desire any part of China, neither will our government permit the cutting up of that country among other powers. Secretary of State Hay found occasion to call attention to this attitude on the part of America in a note to the powers, of July 3, <pb facs="5423969_2_0539.jpg" n="2"/>in which note he presented in a tactful manner, America's attitude in the China question. Mr. Hay's note has previously been presented to the readers of Skandinaven and is therefore known to them. The reports of the massacre in Pekin and of the battles at Tientsin caused the government to take up the Chinese situation for renewed consideration. The President, who had been staying at Canton recently, went to Washington where he discussed the matter with the cabinet. The result was that the government decided to maintain the policies indicated in the circular letter of July 3. This policy includes the following:</p>
   <p>1. The United States will under no circumstances participate in a division of China among the powers.</p>
   <p>2. The United States will use all its influence with the European powers to prevent a division of China; on the other hand, our country will not engage in war against any power for the sake of this matter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0540.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>3. The United States proposes to participate in the solution of the Chinese question. Our country will use its influence to prevent unjust treatment of China and for the purpose of preserving the unity of that country and its government, as presented in Mr. Hay's note to the powers, of July 3.</p>
   <p>4. The United States will not declare war against China under present conditions, no matter what steps the other powers may take.</p>
   <p>5. The United States will act independently of the other powers, while at the same time in consultation with these, for the purpose of restoring order in China; of punishing all officials, high or low, who have been guilty of murder; and of instituting a stable government in the country, able and willing to protect life and property as well as freedom of commerce.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0541.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This policy is prudent and dignified. It insures to our country a special position which will enable us to remain completely independent of European powers, while at the same time co-operating with the latter for the furtherance of objectives which we desire to promote. The policy rejects definitely any policy intended to rob China, and announces that the United States will exert all its influence to prevent the dissection of the former. There can be no question but that the government is supported by our whole country in the policy it has thus announced.</p>
   <p>There is reason to believe that the attitude of our government may influence the final solution of the problem. If the crisis in China had occurred prior to our war against Spain, no European power would have bothered to inquire about the attitude of our government. London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Yokohama would have decided the question without reference to the attitude of others. The war against Spain gave to our country a new position among the nations; it proved our country to be a power to be reckoned with. From Manila we have been able to send soldiers <pb facs="5423969_2_0542.jpg" n="5"/>who have taken prominent part in the operations at Tientsin. It is also due to our new position as a power that our government could obtain the promise of "open door" from the other powers, and the assurances thus obtained give to our country new right to protest against a dissection of China.</p>
   <p>We have large interests in China now, and they are increasing every year. The policy of our government is to guard these interests, and that is all. Whether this policy will win, the future alone can tell. But this is certain: Except for our strategically strong position in the Philippines our country would have been powerless and without influence in the present crisis. The fact that the words of our government now carry weight in the council of the powers of the world is due to our expansion policy.</p>
