   <p>On Wednesday, September 27, the Olson sisters, Eleonora and Ethel, gave a delightful program of music and readings at the Humboldt Park Parish House. The numbers were well chosen and well delivered, and a capacity audience received the offerings of the two young ladies with unstinted applause. This is the Olson sisters' first appearance in three years, and in that time they have made wonderful advancement in their respective arts. Throughout the program one could feel that the listeners had taken the young artists into their hearts to stay.</p>
   <p>Miss Esther Pedersen was at the piano in solo and accompaniment, and she, too, won hearty acclaim from the full house. Her rendition of Leschetizky's "Valse Chromatigue," and Chopin's "Etude on Black Keys" displayed wonderful talent; the interpretation and tone control of these difficult numbers in so young a person was a revelation even to those who were acquainted with her ability. Eleonora Olson sang Tschaikovsky's "Farewell Ye Hills," from "Jeanne d' Arc," with real dramatic intensity and pleasing tonal effect, <pb facs="5423969_2_1652.jpg" n="2"/>except in the very high registers where her voice inclined toward a very slight thinness, although this slight shortcoming was excusable, as these high notes are difficult even for finished opera stars to carry with fullness and power. This number was followed by remarkable renditions of Gronland's "Mod Kveld" (at Twilight), Ronald's "Summer," Bond's "His Lullaby," and Jessen's "Elsk" (Love). In the softer nuances of these selections her voice came into its proper realm. With these numbers, especially, she won the hearts of her listeners and their applause left no doubt as to their appreciation.</p>
   <p>Miss Ethel Olson's contributions carried the audience from the sublime to the ridiculous to such an extent that throughout her humorous readings her listeners were holding their sides and shouting with unrestrained laughter. Her recitations in dialect (Norwegian-American) had the perfect mixture of Norwegian and English that has made Ole Olsen, the comedian, so popular. A thorough knowledge of both languages and the newcomer's use of English words with a Norse pronunciation enabled her to convulse her audience with laughter from start to finish. The unanimous opinion was that no professional actor had ever handled the "Ole Olsen" comedy more perfectly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1653.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The violinist, George Bass, furnished a pleasing variation, winning many new friends by his rendition of "Meditation" from "Thais," by Massenet, and Dvorak's "Humoresque" was also a rare musical treat that brought several encores and a repetition of "Humoresque". Mr. Bass is a real musician in every sense of the word; his tone control and technique transport his listeners on waves of exquisite melody. Concerts like this should be heard more often.</p>
