   <p>The Norwegian colony has two representatives at the Art Institute this year, and it should be of great interest for us to know what our countrymen are contributing in the field of art.</p>
   <p>Emil Bjorn has just completed the "Illinois Landscape". The motif is excellent, and would have been of much greater value if the picture had been larger. One gets the impression that Bjorn started a small picture as a pastime, but as he painted his interest grew until he had worked a lot of pictures into a very small space. But, notwithstanding this, the picture is really fine.</p>
   <p>Miss Marie Lokke's pictures are exquisite; they have caused a great deal of comment. We who remember her pictures of Norway's coast also remember how <pb facs="5423969_2_1351.jpg" n="2"/>realistic they were. The pictures that are exhibited today are American--the coast of Maine. They are superb. One can smell the salty ocean as it breaks on the rugged shore of the Maine coast. One can feel the fresh breeze, and hear the thunder of the surf as it breaks on the outer reef. She is, no doubt, an outstanding artist.</p>
