   <p>Less than one-fifth of the voters went to the polls at the recent primary election in Chicago. The rest stayed at home; some voters probably were not aware that an election was being held. The result was that the list of the leaders or bosses won within both the parties, with but few exceptions.</p>
   <p>As our readers know, the voters have been complaining for years about boss rule in political conventions. It has been said that it was impossible for the voters to get their will realized; in every case the bosses would rule the conventions; their handymen would be elected no matter what might be the real desire of the majority at the conventions.</p>
   <p>The primary was instituted for the purpose of correcting this evil; at the primary the candidates are being nominated directly by the voters, <pb facs="5423969_2_0134.jpg" n="2"/>without delegates and conventions intervening. The new law had its first trial at the purely local election in Chicago last Tuesday. On this occasion, then, the voters had matters completely in their own hands; now it would be possible to do away with boss rule.</p>
   <p>The result was that the political machines won more completely than at any time before in Chicago. The primary law has increased their power. One is compelled to conclude that the earlier complaints about machine rule and boss rule were mere empty words. The voters have shown that they want machine rule. Now they have nobody to blame but themselves if things go wrong in the City Council; the voters have made their bed; they have to lie on it.</p>
   <p>The saddest feature in the situation is, however, that many who wish to improve the public administration will lose courage. There is much that is wrong and lopsided in our political life. But what is the use of working for improvements and for the abolishment of evil practices in our government when the people show at the primaries that they simply are not interested.</p>
