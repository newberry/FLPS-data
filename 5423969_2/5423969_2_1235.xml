   <p>On the 30th of this month we will be offered another rich musical treat, the concert to be given at Wicker Park Hall by the Old People's Home Society.</p>
   <p>The committee has worked hard and the artists they have secured are a very able group. The committee has a double objective in giving this concert; they wish to honor their retiring president, Dr. N. T. Quales, and to replenish the treasury of the society. That both objects will be thoroughly and pleasingly accomplished, is a foregone conclusion.</p>
   <p>Among the artists that will appear are: C. Thorvald Woll, the Norwegian tenor, highly praised by French critics for his rendition of <pb facs="5423969_2_1236.jpg" n="2"/>"Den Store Hvide Flok" (The Great White Host), at the 1000th anniversary festivities in Roven, France, in 1911; Miss Lilly Meyer who will accompany Mr. Woll; and Mrs. Ella Ingraham, of the beautiful soprano voice, who will sing accompanied by her sister, Mrs. Anna Ring Clausen of the Chicago Musical College.</p>
   <p>A really pleasing group of songbirds who will also take part, are the ever popular and jolly Trier Sisters, two sets of twins who thoroughly understand the art of pleasing an audience.</p>
   <p>Scandia predicts that this will be one of the most enjoyable concerts of the season and wishes the Home Society every success in the undertaking.</p>
