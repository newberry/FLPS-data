   <p>Joseph Kipley has received his walking papers and retires from the police department. According to Mayor Harrison, Joseph Kipley was the best chief Chicago has ever had. Corporation Counsel Walker, one of the strongest members of Mayor Harrison's cabinet, is equally generous in his praise of the retired chief.</p>
   <p>"I consider," says Walker, "Joseph Kipley a great policeman and a man who invariably carried out the orders of his superiors to the letter. My duties as a city official brought me in contact with him frequently and I have been able to judge his ability. There is no question about his value as an active, energetic policeman. In justice to Kipley I cannot refrain from saying that I consider much of the criticism that has been heaped on him unjust and undeserved."</p>
   <p>In the face of such testimony, the sincerity of which should not be doubted, <pb facs="5423969_2_0186.jpg" n="2"/>it is difficult to understand why the best chief Chicago ever had should be dismissed. The city needs all the active, energetic policemen it can get. And it would seem that summary dismissal is not exactly the proper reward for "a man who invariably carried out the orders of his superiors to the letter". However, Kipley is not the first faithful servant who has reaped ingratitude as a reward of loyalty. "The moor has done his duty; the moor may go."</p>
   <p>One way to account for the retirement of Kipley is that the administration was in need of a scapegoat. The old chief is a rather refractory critter and has dropped hints that indicate that the office of a scapegoat is not to his liking, and that he may have something to say himself when he returns from the coast.</p>
   <p>The proof is in the pudding. The efficiency and morale of the police department from now on will answer the question whether Kipley was dropped for the good of the service or for the benefit of Mayor Harrison.</p>
