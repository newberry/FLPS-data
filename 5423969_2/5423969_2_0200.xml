   <p>The Republican primaries will soon be upon the voters of Chicago, but the situation as regards the mayoralty nomination is as full of uncertainties as ever. There is no dearth of candidates, but thus far the people have expressed no decided preference for any of the gentlemen who have been suggested by themselves or their respective friends. Candidates, party leaders, and Republican rank and file are, apparently, all at sea.</p>
   <p>On the Democratic side everything is cut and dried. An effort to unhorse Carter Harrison is likely to be made, but is as likely to fail; his renomination is a practical certainty. His re-election would mean not only two more years of Harrison--the Harrison of the last four years--but two years of still more disgraceful wide-openness, of unlimited license for crime and vice. There is no room for doubt as to the mayor's position in this respect. The law-abiding <pb facs="5423969_2_0201.jpg" n="2"/>people demanded as with one voice that he enforce the law, close the saloons at midnight, and wipe out all-night dives. His answer was an ordinance wiping out the law and legalizing the all-night dives! The attempt failed, but his campaign for re-election will be made upon this "issue". "Harrison and all-day-and-night saloons" will be the slogan that will call "Bobby" Burke's braves to battle. Fired by this inspiring war cry, every divekeeper, every robber, thug, and thief, every soiled dove, every favored contractor working on the "divvy plan," and every member of the vast horde of fundlooters and taxeaters who have prospered and expect to wax still fatter by the grace of Burke and Harrison--all these elements will fight with desperation for the re-election of Carter Harrison.</p>
   <p>Another victory for lawlessness and public plunder would be a calamity to the city, resulting in hopeless financial disaster, decay of enterprise, loss of business, and general ruin, demoralization, and disgrace. The honest voters are strong enough to redeem the city, and with leadership of the right kind victory is assured. If the Republicans nominate a man of unimpeachable record <pb facs="5423969_2_0202.jpg" n="3"/>and who is strong enough and broad enough to command the confidence and good will of all honest voters in this cosmopolitan city, his election is a fore-gone conclusion. But if they place the wrong man at the head of their ticket the election is likely to go wrong. The plain lesson taught by the election of last fall and other recent contests in Chicago is that the Republicans can elect good men, but not bad or narrow-gauge candidates. The people are quicker to rebuke an unfit Republican nomination than to punish similar sins on the part of the Democratic party. If the Republicans heed this lesson and select a man of such broad views and acknowledged ability as William Boldenweck, or some other man of equal strength with the whole people, the honest voters of the city, Democrats as well as Republicans, will take care of his election.</p>
   <p>It has been suggested that the candidates be requested to outline their views before a huge mass meeting to be called for that purpose. The idea is not a bad one. It is a recognition of the principle too often set at naught, that the choice of a candidate should be dictated by public opinion, not by a clique of silk stockings or a ring of bosses. It is also a recognition of the fact that the people have lost faith in party promises and look to the man <pb facs="5423969_2_0203.jpg" n="4"/>rather than to a ready-made party platform furnished him by a convention. It will place the candidate in more direct relations with the people and create a livelier interest among the voters in the nomination and election. Just now this is the great and pressing need of the hour. The voters must be aroused to a sense of their duties at the primaries, and a direct appeal in the form of a mass meeting is probably the best way to do it. No possible harm can come of a mass meeting as suggested, while it may be productive of much good.</p>
