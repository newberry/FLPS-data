   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>I am writing to you in regard to Skandinaven. I as well as others protest against the unreliable, lying, yellow journalism that one finds in "the largest Norwegian daily newspaper". Every one realizes that Skandinaven's journalism is only a caricature,and that its statements concerning literature, singing, music, and politics are not only confused but childish. Yes, it would be a red-letter day if Skandinaven every printed one line that was fair or correct.</p>
   <p>But when the staff of "the greatest Norwegian newspaper in America" insults and belittles innocent people then it is time to take issue with it.</p>
   <p>Let us take as an example the affair at the Auditorium, in reporting which Skandinaven tries to blame the accompanist, Miss Sarah Larsen, for the scandal <pb facs="5423969_2_1292.jpg" n="2"/>caused by Oscar Nelson. Miss Larsen is well known, and her father is one of the pillars of the Synod; she herself is a teacher of piano at the Chicago Musical College. This in itself should be sufficient guarantee that she is capable of accompanying a violinist in a couple of minor songs.</p>
   <p>On the other side of the picture we have the great violinist, "a second Ole Bull," who played four numbers, the first being "Napoleon's March over the Alps". (Why the committee permitted a number that belongs in the nursery to appear on a program given at the Auditorium requires an explanation, and an apology is due to the Norwegian audience; moreover, why did "Saeterjentens Sondag" appear on the program as "Ole Bull Memorial" and as composed by Christina Nilsson?)</p>
   <p>Skandinaven's remarks about Miss Larsen are an insult to her and to the audience, but it is all that could be expected of "the voice of the Norwegian people".</p>
   <p>Ole Olesen</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1293.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The editor wishes to add to the above, since a few more facts are necessary. Skandinaven states that "the program committee insisted that Oscar Nelson play four selections". We want to state that this is not true. Gus Martin was the only member of the Committee who knew the Swede Nelson. Martin insisted that Nelson was an excellent violinist and should appear on the program. We simply wish to point out that it is an error to hold the [entire] program committee responsible.</p>
