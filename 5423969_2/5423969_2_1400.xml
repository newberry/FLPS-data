   <p>For many years, very little has been done to keep Norwegian dramatic art alive. Only a few people have worked--and worked hard--to this end. We should preserve the art because Norway has produced many internationally famous dramatists, and Norwegians in Chicago should take pride in performing this duty.</p>
   <p>When the Norwegian professional dramatist, Mrs. Borgny Hammer, came to Chicago from Norway, she immediately established the Norwegian Theater of Chicago. Every season, for the past several years, she has produced a number of successful plays, including the works of Ibsen, Bjornson, Krag, Egge, Edgren-Leffler, and others. We remember her excellent presentations of "Gjengagere" (Ghosts), "A Doll's House," and "Hedda Gabler"; she gave such excellent performances in the title roles of these plays that Bjornson called her Norway's Sarah Bernhardt.</p>
   <p>This season she will present a new production, Amalie Skram's "Agnete".</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1401.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Hammer played the title role in this beautiful drama at the National Theater in Norway.</p>
   <p>We know Mrs. Borgny Hammer as an artist, as a mother, and as a housewife, and we admire her versatility. She is the mother of six children, and cares for her home, her children, and her husband between rehearsals. She does not say, "My art is my life," but, "My home and my children are my life".</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hammer does not need to rehearse her roles; she plays her parts as though she had played them all her life. She feels all the sorrows and joys of her characters. Yet, she is a child. Nature's child, and that is why she is an outstanding actress.</p>
