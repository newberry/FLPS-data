   <p>Speaking as the head of all silk-stockings and as adviser-in-chief to the Democratic campaign committee, Murray F. Tuley delivered the "keynote speech" of the campaign the other night.</p>
   <p>Those who have read it wonder what is the matter with Tuley. The vital issue of the campaign, says the Judge, is this: "Shall the people of Chicago continue to own their streets, or shall they be given over to the traction companies?" In other words, the Harrison issue in three campaigns for the mayoralty is to serve as a Democratic life buoy in the impending fall campaign. If it had not been known that the Mayor was busy with rod and gun in Michigan, most people would have believed that he was masquerading in the garb of the venerable Judge. As it is they prefer to forget this effort on the part of Judge Tuley to inject an irrelevant issue into the campaign.</p>

   <p>His defense of the building commissioner, Peter Kiolbassa, was even more surprising. The horror of the St. Luke Sanitarium is fresh in the minds of the people; it is an established fact that the loss of a dozen lives in that death-trap was due to gross negligence in the building commissioner's office. Other violations of the law in all parts of the city have been disclosed every day. Yet Judge Tuley, who has devoted his life to the service of the law, has no censure for the building commissioner. "Whatever the City Council may prove Kiolbassa's shortcomings to be as a building commissioner, it will never prove him dishonest," says Tuley. There is a standard of public service for you! Why not fill all offices with inmates from an idiot asylum? Then we would be sure of getting public officials who are "personally honest".</p>
   <p>As a judge, a citizen, and a man, Murray F. Tuley is honored and beloved by the people of Chicago. Hence they regret his performances as the leader of the silk-stockings and as Democratic generalissimo, for they certainly have not added to his reputation.</p>
