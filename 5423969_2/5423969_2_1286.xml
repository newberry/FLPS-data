   <p>Crowded house in spite of the heat. Enthusiasm from beginning to end. Assisted by the Norwegian Singing Society,Rolf Hammer gave a very successful concert last Sunday evening at Bjorgvin Hall. The heat was oppressive, but the hall was crowded, and nobody seemed to worry much about the temperature.</p>
   <p>The program was magnificent.</p>
   <p>Rolf Hammer's singing is not merely that of a well schooled voice, but there is a flood of poety in his melodies persisting long after the singing is ended. His singing appeals to the noblest in man. Considered from the point of view of aft, the transitions from fortissimo to pianissimo is something very remarkable. The singer performs this transition as well as that from pianissimo to fortissimo in an absolutely perfect manner.</p>

   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated with American and Norwegian flags.</p>
