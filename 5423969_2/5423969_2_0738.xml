   <p>The Democratic members of both Houses of Congress recently held a joint meeting to discuss the policies to be followed during the current session. The men had no trouble coming to an agreement. Evidently these former defenders of the Rebels are nearly out of their wits with joy over having gained control of both Houses. They have adopted a revolutionary program with the characteristic boldness with which the Charlestonians once trained their guns on Fort Sumter.</p>
   <p>The nature of their policy may be summed up in a nutshell, as follows: Abolition of all protection against election fraud. This is the gist of the program, and the ultimate purpose of the following five paragraphs:</p>
   <p>1) Abolition of the jurymen's oath.</p>
   <p>2) Annulment of the law providing for military assistance in case of election violence.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0739.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3) Annulment of the clause in the election law authorizing deputy marshals to do police duty at the polls.</p>
   <p>4) Abolition of the office of supervising marshal.</p>
   <p>5) Changing of all the present rules governing the supervision of elections, so that supervising and deputy marshals are reduced to the role of onlookers at the polls without any authority to uphold law and order.</p>
   <p>This program embodies the present Democratic ideals and the issue on which the fight centers in Congress.</p>
   <p>It is almost a certainty that the Democrats will not appropriate sufficient funds for the normal functions of the Government, unless the President can be persuaded to sign the bills necessary for the execution of their own special program.</p>
   <p>Since this is highly improbable, we may see the present Congress adjourn <pb facs="5423969_2_0740.jpg" n="3"/>leaving important legislation unattended. In that case the President will again have to call an extra session.</p>
   <p>It is rumored that the "green-back" [Republican] members of the House are annoyed by the unwise tactics of their Democratic colleagues, and that they may prevail upon the latter to change their plans. It is hardly probable that the Revolutionists can maintain their obstinacy throughout the summer, but whatever happens, it is the simple duty of the Republicans to do everything in their power to protect the sanctity of the ballot box.</p>
