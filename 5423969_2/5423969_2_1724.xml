   <p>The Scandinavian Festival Association, mentioned on an earlier occasion, has now been organized. The purpose of the Association is to hold annual musical festivals in Chicago on a larger scale than has hitherto been attempted.</p>
   <p>At these musical festivals the Scandinavian population in Chicago will cooperate to bring before the public Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish music and song. It is expected that this propaganda will strengthen the friendship among Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes here in Chicago and all over the country as well, since this movement will probably give impetus to the starting of similar movements in other parts of the country.</p>
   <p>The best musical forces among the three national groups will be invited to aid the movement. It is intended that the festival in 1909 will be held at the Thomas Orchestra Hall, Chicago, on May 26, 27, and 28. Prominent Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish artists, male and female, will assist, and several festal choruses are to be organized. It is hoped that the Danish, Norwegian, <pb facs="5423969_2_1725.jpg" n="2"/>and Swedish ambassadors to the United States will be present on the occasion as the guests of the Association. The temporary organization has been formed under the leadership of the Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish consuls in Chicago. This organization is subject to changes as required.</p>
   <p>A guarantee fund of $2,600 has already been subscribed to cover possible deficits. The board of directors of the Association is as follows: John Lindgren, president; F. Herman Gade and George Bech, vice-presidents; C. Chindblom [Swede], secretary; T. Freeman, treasurer, and John Anderson, Henry L. Hertz, C. H. Hanson, Emil Bjorn, Nels Johnson.</p>
