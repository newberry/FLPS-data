   <p>Sculptor Sigvald Asbjornsen has just finished his statue of Colonel William R. Moore, ex-Congressman from Tennessee. Mr. Asbjornsen obtained the contract for this work after competition with a number of other sculptors from various sections of the country. The sketch presented by him was found to be the most satisfactory from every point of view.</p>
   <p>Colonel Moore has stayed in Chicago during the modeling, and has expressed his full satisfaction with the work. Mr. Moore is an ex-Congressman from his state, and from the papers in Tennessee it is seen that he has declined the Republican nomination for governor of the state. The nomination was offered to him from all sides in the state.</p>
   <p>The statue is considerably larger than natural size, and excels in pure and characteristic lines. The likeness is, according to those who know Mr. Moore personally, as near perfection as possible. The ex-Congressman is presented <pb facs="5423969_2_1364.jpg" n="2"/>standing in the position which he used to assume when delivering a public address, and the observer is given a clear impression of the man's personality; everything characteristic of Mr. Moore has been brought out in the statue. The statue was molded in clay Saturday and will be cast in bronze.</p>
