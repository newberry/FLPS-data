   <p>Why would it not be proper and entirely fitting if the presidential electors of Minnesota selected our worthy friend, the Hon. Mons Grinager, as their representative to convey the "sacred urn" of their ballots to the national capitol? This is merely a suggestion on our part. The Skandinaven has no intention of dictating to the electors of Minnesota, or anyone else, what they should do, but we have been accustomed to associate the name of Captain Grinager with what is honorable and patriotic and of good repute in Minnesota politics. We believe that the people of the state generally agree with us in that view. If we are not misinformed as to his character since the time he fought gallantly in the defense of the Union to the present time, he has proved himself such a citizen as we are endeavoring to make of all our Scandinavian countrymen. A merited compliment to him would be a compliment to the nationality, and a distinct approval of honest efforts for becoming true American citizens. There probably was no nationality in Minnesota that unanimously supported the Republican ticket more than the Scandinavian. It would certainly not be unfitting, therefore, if one of that race should convey the decision of the state to the country at large.</p>
