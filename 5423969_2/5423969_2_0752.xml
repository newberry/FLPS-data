   <p>The grand prize for legal idiocy goes, unquestionably, to a Washington judge, Judge Hanford, who took it upon his worthy self to cancel the citizenship of a Swede because he (the Swede) is a socialist.</p>
   <p>The judge based his action on the assumption that the man belonged to a political party the ideals of which are contrary to the Constitution. This assumption is surely the top notch of idiotic constitutional interpretation.</p>
   <p>Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, expressed the opinion that views and conditions were ever changing and that a country's laws should be changed to meet changing conditions, and suggested that the laws should be reviewed and revised at intervals of approximately twenty years. Jefferson took a firm stand against the idea that a constitution should serve as a straight-jacket of fearful conformity and respect and he worked incessantly to bring about easier methods of changing laws to conform with the times.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0753.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Constitution of the United States specifically describes the method in which changes may be made, but, according to the "learned" Washington judge, one can not become an American citizen if he thinks the Constitution should be modernized. The decision at one stroke deprives a man of his citizenship and declares constitutional amendments unconstitutional.</p>
