   <p>Mme. Martha Sandal's evening of songs, given under the auspices of the Ladies Aid Society of the Bethlehem congregation, must certainly have impressed those who were present as something very beautiful, bringing them closer to heaven and awakening resolutions to lead a better and worthier life in the future. Such songs, indeed, must be pleasing to God!</p>
   <p>The concert began with Grundtvig's beautiful hymn, "Kirken den er et gammelt hus" (The Church is Ancient), melody by Lindeman. While Mme. Sandal sang, it seemed as though one could hear the church bells calling, calling. After this came Handel's "Largo", sung in Italian. Once this magnificent melody has been heard, it can never be forgotten, in spite of the fact that the words were in a language not familiar to most of the listeners.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1283.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Then came songs by Norwegian and Danish poets with melodies by Norwegian composers. "Du Mor" (To My Mother), by Mortensen, melody by Sinding; "Saa du ham min lille dreng" (Did You See My Little Boy), by Christian Winther, melody by Selmer; "Sovnen" (Asleep) and "Synoves Song" (Song of Synnove), by Bjornstjerne Bjornson, melodies by Kierulf--all these were so beautifully sung that many had difficulty in restraining their tears, while others wept freely.</p>
   <p>To provide variety, there now followed "Vittoria" from "Carrisimi", with Italian text, and "Dreams", by Wagner, with German text. Then the singer gladdened her audience with the following songs from her homeland: "Solvejgs Song", by Ibsen, melody by Grieg; "Der var sig en liden gut" (Once There Was a Little Boy), by Wilhelm Krag, melody by Sigurd Lie; "Endnu et streif Kun" (Yet Just a Ray) and "Barnesang" (Cradle Song), by Agathe Grondahl; and "O, Herre, jeg er meget trat" (Lord, I Am So Very Tired), by Wilhelm Krag, melody by Melartin. This last song, which has not been rendered before in <pb facs="5423969_2_1284.jpg" n="3"/>America, appeared to find a strong response in many of the listeners, and was frequently mentioned afterwards.</p>
   <p>Concluding this festive concert Mme. Sandal sang "Vor Gud han er saa fast en borg" (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God). As a rule this powerful hymn is sung by male voices, but it gained rather than lost in effectiveness as sung by Mme. Sandal.</p>
   <p>Miss Amanda Bjertnes accompanied the singer.</p>
