   <p>The program offered by the Norumbega Ladies' Aid Society of St. Paul's Lutheran Church, last Wednesday, was most select and varied. Those participating in the concert were capable and well known among the music loving public of the Northwest Side. The only cause for complaint was that the building was not filled to capacity. Nevertheless a large audience enjoyed the concert in the big attractive church building on North Avenue.</p>
   <p>The following appeared on the program: Miss Anna Christensen, soprano; Mr. Gustaf Holmquist, basso; Dr. Louis Falk, organist; Mr. Hans Hess, violoncellist; Miss Ora Johnson, organist. All of these are able performers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Louis Falk opened the program. The organ selections, as well as the numbers on the rest of the program, were largely taken from German and other foreign composers. Grieg's "At Morning" seemed to be the only composition by a <pb facs="5423969_2_1723.jpg" n="2"/>Norwegian composer. The playing of Mr. Hess and the well-selected songs of Gustaf Holmquist touched the heart and were well received. Anna Christensen, too, has become practically indispensable at our church concerts. She was accompanied on the piano by Miss Ora Johnson....</p>
   <p>The Norumbega ladies have honored themselves through the concert they gave us.</p>
