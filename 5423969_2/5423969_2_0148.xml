   <p>Governor Yates, appearing in a justice court as a witness in the suit brought against himself and others by Harry C. Clausen (Dane) to recover twelve dollars paid for political purposes, would be anything but an edifying spectacle to the people of the state. Yet they may have to witness this very sight one of these days.</p>
   <p>Of course, everybody understands that the animus of the suit is to disgrace and humiliate the Governor and his administration--a purpose that cannot but disgust fair-minded people of all parties. But if this petty plot, malicious and contemptible as it is, should result in doing away with the odios political assessments, a prolific source of corruption will be removed, and the public service purified; and thus the humiliation of the commonwealth in the person of its <pb facs="5423969_2_0149.jpg" n="2"/>Governor will in the end rebound to the benefit of the people.</p>
   <p>The personal discomfiture of Mr. Yates will arouse no excessive amount of sympathy. His unblushing spoils practices have offended thousands of good Republicans who will not weep to see him fried in his own fat. But in common with other citizens they will keenly feel the disgrace brought upon the state and its people. There is one consolation, however: Mr. Yates will be the last, as he is the first, Governor to appear in such a role; occurrences of this kind prevent their own repetition.</p>
