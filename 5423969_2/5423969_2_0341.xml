   <p>The Loop compromise patched up by Mayor Swift is eminently satisfactory to its author. He assures the people of Chicago that their mayor has driven a very close bargain and that future generations will call him blessed.</p>
   <p>Even if he were right in thus showering praise upon himself his honor must know that in effecting the compromise he compromised the dignity of the city. Why did he veto the ordinance granted by the gang of the City Council instead of bargaining with the loop "El" company for concessions? He knew that his veto would have been sustained. In other words, he knew that he could have put the company into a position where it would be compelled to pay for the privileges obtained, instead of dictating terms to the city. Why did he not use the power entrusted to his keeping? Why did he surrender an impregnable position and appear before the company begging for crumbs of bread from its table?</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0342.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>People are growing skeptical. It may be that future generations will call him blessed, but the present generation cannot see just why, nor can it be coaxed into taking Mr. Swift's word for it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Swift should explain. Was it a sellout?</p>
