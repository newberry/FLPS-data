   <p>If there is anything in our public life that is more demoralizing than actual "boodling" it is the general disposition to lavish praise upon public officials for doing their duty.</p>
   <p>The attitude of the press of Chicago and some of our best men in regard to Mayor Harrison's veto of the general electric trolley ordinance furnishes a case in point. The Mayor took the only course open to an honest man and faithful official. He could not have approved the ordinance except by descending to the level of the Powers and Coughlins of the City Council. He did his duty as he was sworn and expected to do, and by so doing, blocked the scheme of boodlers--at least for the time being.</p>
   <p>There was nothing in his official conduct in this instance that was particularly <pb facs="5423969_2_0310.jpg" n="2"/>praiseworthy, yet our contemporaries were transported with joy at the sight of this plain performance of a self-evident duty. They joined in a ringing "glory hallelujah" in praise of His Honor and for the edification of the community at large. They pictured the young man as the very embodiment of civic purity and virtues, and the president of the Municipal Voters League took his pen in hand and issued a manifesto congratulating His Honor upon his heroism.</p>
   <p>Such frothings are of course not only ridiculous and absurd but demoralizing in the extreme. The Council gang was attacked vigorously, and justly so, by the same papers and the same men for its support of the ordinance. It was assumed, as a matter of course, that its support was bought, and the Mayor said as much in his veto message. Now, if that was true--and this paper is convinced that the charges were founded in fact--in what respect is the Mayor deserving of an extra measure of credit for opposing a measure that according to his own official statement was vicious and criminal? Could he, as an honest man, have done anything less than he did? If not, these shouts of glory were misplaced, ridiculous, and foolish. "Ye are unprofitable servants because ye have done <pb facs="5423969_2_0311.jpg" n="3"/>only what ye were commanded to do."</p>
   <p>It is as plain as anything can be that such senseless conduct must needs bewilder and corrupt public opinion. If our public men are paraded as paragons of virtue for doing their sworn duty, the people will learn to believe that "public office is not a public trust" and that no particular blame attaches to boodling or other forms of misconduct on the part of public servants.</p>
   <p>Such crude conceptions of public duty can only exist in communities where a low moral standard prevails. It is to be regretted that the powerful daily press of Chicago and our citizen reformers, who certainly are sincere in their efforts to improve our local government, should, unwittingly, do their very best to keep the standard of public honor on the low level where it is. When the exponents of our best public thought are so easily satisfied, what can be expected of the rest of us?</p>
