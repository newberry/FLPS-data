   <p>A correspondent of the daily press, who is generally well informed, is authority for the statement that Hay, Root, and Wilson are to remain in the cabinet. That is good news. Colonel Hay is probably the most accomplished diplomat in America today and his conduct of the State Department has been attended with brilliant success.</p>
   <p>During the early stages of the Boer War he was exposed to considerable criticism, but time has demonstrated that it had no justification whatever. On the contrary, the government in Washington went to the very limit of permissible interference in behalf of the Boer republics. Had its example been followed by the great powers of Europe the unfortunate and unjustifiable war in South Africa would probably have been ended long ago on conditions acceptable to the heroic Boers.</p>
   <p>Secretary Hay's management of the complicated Chinese question is the brightest and the most honorable chapter in the history of modern diplomacy, while the Hay-Pauncefote <pb facs="5423969_2_0777.jpg" n="2"/>Treaty, as finally formulated and ratified, removes the only dishonorable blotch upon the diplomatic records of the nation, and opens the way for America to carry out the great undertaking that is destined to assure her position as the mistress of two oceans.</p>
   <p>Colonel Hay's ability, signal success, and broad-gauged patriotism have won for him the implicit confidence of the American people. The announcement that he is to remain at the head of the State Department during President Roosevelt's administration has been hailed with general satisfaction by voters of all parties throughout the country.</p>
   <p>Mr. Root is the most successful and popular of all secretaries of the War Department in recent years. His firm grasp of the various problems connected with our island possessions and our relations to Cuba renders his services well nigh indispensable.</p>
   <p>As for Mr. Wilson, it is sufficient to say that the farmers of the country would like to have him appointed Secretary of Agriculture in perpetuity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0778.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With Hay, Root and Wilson remaining, and an acceptable successor to Gage in the Treasury Department, President Roosevelt will have a strong cabinet even if all of the other portfolios were to be regarded as lesser lights.</p>
