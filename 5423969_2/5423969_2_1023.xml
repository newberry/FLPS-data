   <p>p.5. Much attention has been directed towards a building at the corner of Le Moyne and California Avenues. This is the Humboldt Parish House, erected by the Church of the New Jerusalem (Jewish), as a recreation center for its young people. Their idea was to provide for their youth ample facilities for social gatherings, dramatics, athletics, gymnastics, etc. In planning the construction of the building, the question of renting it out to other organizations was considered; and for financial reasons provisions were made for such service. It is estimated that the income will pay for the building in six years.</p>
   <p>This building is of interest to Chicago Norwegians, because it has been planned and erected under the supervision of the Norwegian architect, Ole W. Aga. This is only one of the many buildings he has designed. He is considered as one of Chicago's exceptional architects.</p>
   <p>In considering the proposed Norwegian Club and building, the first architect thought of was, naturally enough, Ole W. Aga, though the club and the building have not as yet passed beyond the dream stage.</p>
