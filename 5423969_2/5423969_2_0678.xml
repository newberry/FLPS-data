   <p>Skandinaven recently brought report of a speech by Congressman A. J. Gronna about the banking situation. The real theme of Mr. Gronna's speech was the question of how to safeguard the depositors in savings banks against loss if the bank in which they had deposited their money went bankrupt. Mr. Gronna believes that this can most easily be done by creating a guarantee fund for the purpose and, as previously reported in this paper, has made motion in Congress to that effect.</p>
   <p>Many of those who have read Mr. Gronna's clear and convincing speech will have wondered why the thought contained in it has not been executed a long time ago. There is no denying that an arrangement as proposed by him would be beneficial.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0679.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It would prevent those sad misfortunes occurring when the small investor who has deposited his savings in a bank loses his all, because the bank fails. Mr.Gronna's proposal would create confidence in banks where such confidence is lacking now; it would remove uneasiness and fear of loss in critical times, and it would bring into circulation a great deal of money which now lie hidden and dead because the owners do not have faith in the banks. And these great advantages could be had merely through the payment by the banks of small premiums which would not be felt as a heavy burden anywhere. Practically everything is insured in our days. Why not insure the savings of the people? The large banks in the East are opposed to the idea. But an arrangements as proposed would be advantageous to the people as a whole, and Mr. Gronna's proposal ought to be adopted without unnecessary delay. It is easy for the people to subdue Wall Street in matters like this if the people are determined. If the people demand it, the next Congress will adopt a law as indicated by Congressman Gronna, but the people must make the demand with sufficient force.</p>
