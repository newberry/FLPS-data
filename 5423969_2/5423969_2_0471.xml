   <p>So far, in America, the Scandinavians have been ranked among the best of citizens. Loyal, hard working people, obedient to law; they have been highly considered and strongly lauded by their fellow citizens, and they have, with justified pride, been able to point to their willing patriotism for our country and our flag. The "Monitor" is the pride of the Swedes and one of the most brilliant chapters in our country's history. The Fifteenth Wisconsin and Chickamauga have woven lasting glory about the Norwegian name. When the war started against Spain, the Scandinavians were among the first to seed the call to the colors.</p>
   <p>We of Nordic blood are proud of our splendid record as good American citizens, obedient to law, and loyal to our country.</p>
   <p>But of late our name has been shadowed by a dark cloud. Doubt has been cast as to our compliance to law, and our loyality. The opinion that is becoming more current <pb facs="5423969_2_0472.jpg" n="2"/>lately is to the effect that in the great war of today, the Scandinavians are among those who stand back, that in our ranks there are even those who favor the enemy and oppose our own country; who are, in other words, traitors at heart if not in action.</p>
   <p>This is a serious accusation; but the writer believes it to be unfounded. The Scandinavian people are good citizens now as ever. Exceptions there are, unfortunately, within our nationality as within other groups, but taken as a whole, the Scandinavians are surely as loyal citizens as are to be found in the country.</p>
   <p>It is not enough, however, that we, ourselves, know this to be true. We must see to it that those of our fellow citizens who are of a different opinion will learn the true facts. Duty and honor demands that we remove the blemish our otherwise spotless escutcheon. We must convince others as we are convinced, that the true blood of our fathers is our life-blood, too.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0473.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We do not accomplish this, however, by silence and inactivity: We must speak up, and we must act; our speech must be loud enough and clear enough to be heard and understood; and our action must be united and definite and vigorous. The suspicion against the Scandinavians is spreading more widely and rapidly than our people imagine, and it is imperative that we act as swiftly and eagerly as possible in order that this suspicion may not be believed by our fellow-citizens.</p>
   <p>Our people will readily understand what is required of us. We must show, each in his circle, by word and by act that the Scandinavian people do stand by our government to the last ditch in the present emergency; that, loyal citizens as they are they will comply with all the laws which it has been necessary to enact; that they are standing staunchly and united against cleverly traiterous plans or schemes; that they are ready for any sacrifice to bring to an honorable conclusion the just war our nation is waging.</p>
   <p>The press, our strong, common advocate has done much, already. Some papers here and there might be able to do more than they have done. It is imperative that they <pb facs="5423969_2_0474.jpg" n="4"/>come out as vigorously as possible. The matter involves our common welfare in the future. Any thoughtful individual should be able to see that if the Scandinavians be placed under a cloud of suspicion in time of stress like the present, the fact may react against them during an interminate future. But the first blow, in such case, will be directed against the Scandinavian press.</p>
   <p>The ministers can do a great deal, many of them, far more, than they have done so far.</p>
   <p>The fact is not to be evaded that the Lutheran Church is also the object of suspicion these days. Even though this suspicion is unfounded, yet it is a matter of grave importance for the church to free itself from the cloud. The Scandinavian Lutheran organizations chould see to it, at least, that no cause for just complaint is to be found with them. If the churches have not already taken the necessary steps to keep free from suspicion, they should take effective steps and take them quickly. It is the duty of the church to advocate loyalty and obedience to law.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0475.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It is doubly so under the present circumstances, for the suspicion in evidence against the Lutheran Church has been occasioned largely through the resistance which certain ministers have exerted against this war which was forced upon our country.</p>
   <p>The matter under discussion is one of very grave importance. It is the more serious matter before the Scandinavians today. Let us not try to evade the issue! The charge of disloyalty has been thrown at us. Let us make it evident to our fellow citizens at once that the charge is unjust; that the Scandinavians are as loyal citizens as the best; that their escutcheon remains as clear and unblemished as it always has been.</p>
