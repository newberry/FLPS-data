   <p>Dr. Ralph Ludwig Larsen, is a native of Chicago, born in this city of Norwegian parents on March 4, 1877. Dr. Larsen is a graduate of Rush Medical College and at the time of his graduation carried off the highest honors in anatomic surgery, the Arthur Dean Bevan prize (a valuable library set of books.) He entered a series of competitive contests along scientific and literary lines and received the degree of doctor of philosophy and an appointment of honorary alumnus of the University of Alabama. He was hospital surgeon with the Illinois Steel Company of Chicago for one year. He was one year at the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital in Chicago. He had fostered for years the idea of a emergency hospital for rendering first aid to the injured and accordingly set up such an institution at the corner of Chicago and Milton Avenues in a factory district where accidents are of daily occurence. He has been acting alone <pb facs="5423969_2_1032.jpg" n="2"/>in this matter and has refused several offers from philanthropic sources. In the present capacity he is local surgeon for eight or ten liability assurance corporations and some fifty or more manufacturing concerns.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Chicago Medical Society, the Illinois State Medical Society and the American Medical Association. He is a frequent contributer of practical articles to medical journals, more especially to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New York and Philadelphia medical journals.</p>
