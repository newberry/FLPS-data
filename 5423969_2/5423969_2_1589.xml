   <p>Our Norwegian singing societies are all active putting on their fall concerts. The Socialist Society started the season,with Lerken (The Lark) Singing Society following on Saturday, November 23. Like the song of the lark in its flight, is the song of Lerken and increasing applause rewarded each number as one followed another. The closing number, "Aften Roster" (Evening Voices), by Oscar Borg, with Einind Borsum as baritone soloist, was given such applause that it had to be repeated completely.</p>
   <p>Lerken does not make itself noticeable by great volume, but it more than makes up for this by its perfect harmony and clear enunciation, and it is because of this that it is more pleasant to listen to. Guest artists were Miss Betgy Michelsen, mezzo-soprano, who was rewarded with storms of applause and a profusion of flowers; Miss Ebba Meisgner, a young pianist, was also well received; and Dr. John Dybdahl and his violin pleased very much, as always. Humorous songs, by Mr. Sarmes, closed the perfect evening.</p>
