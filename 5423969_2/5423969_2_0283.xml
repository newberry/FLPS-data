   <p>A bundle of shreds and tatters is all that is left of the civil service law, of which so much was expected by the people of Chicago. The system is practically dead for the time being, and this result has been brought about by a most singular co-operation between some of the professed friends of civil service reform and the organized Spoils-Democracy as represented by the administration of Mr. Harrison.</p>
   <p>The make-up of the commission appointed by the present mayor, clearly indicated that the act henceforth was to be interpreted in a "liberal," not to say "wide-open," spirit. A scandalous juggling with the law soon manifested itself as the most prominent feature of the "policy" of the new commission, and the great reform became a roaring farce. The investigation decided upon by the Senate was, of course, very unwelcome to the minions of the administration, Mr. Kraus, and his Colleagues; but it was fully justified by the gross abuses in the police department and the flagrant violation of the <pb facs="5423969_2_0284.jpg" n="2"/>civil service law. And yet some contemporaries, who are particularly loud in their protestations of reform, greeted the investigating with vehement abuse. These papers were not ignorant of the existing condition of things. In their own columns, they had uncovered some of the prevailing rottenness, although they, for some inscrutable reason, had concealed more than they had disclosed. They knew that a thorough investigation was imperatively demanded as a matter of public decency and public safety, and as the only means of saving the system itself from complete putrefaction. Yet they joined in the chorus of the spoilsmen in their disgraceful howls against the proposed step!</p>
   <p>The facts brought to light by Berry's committee reveal abuses more scandalous and serious than most people had anticipated. It has been shown that the police department, for instance, is more rotten than ever before and that the great reform has been subverted for the purpose of shielding abominations of every kind.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0285.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But the law should not be repealed, however. It is barely possible that the people of Chicago are not as yet ripe for a reform of this sweeping character, but the law should be given a fair trial. If the people really want civil service reform, they can have it by electing a mayor who believes in reform and will enforce the law in good faith. If they do not want it, they will retain the Democratic party in power. Meanwhile, the law should remain on the statute books. It is time enough to repeal it when the people shall have demonstrated in an unmistakable manner that they do not want the merit system. It is true that for the present the law is worse than a dead letter and that the clownish capers cut by Kraus and his colleagues and a part of the press, have made the reform an object of contempt and ridicule. But the law may be revived at the command of the people, and hence should not be repealed.</p>
