   <p>Frilanse (Free Lance), Scandia's staunch supporter and contributor, and who refuses to be known by any other name, has left Chicago for his native land, Norway. Greater inducements than were offered in America are taking him from our Norwegian colony in Chicago to greater and better things in the old country.</p>
   <p>However, we are pleased to advise our readers, that he is not entirely lost to us, as arrangements have been made to insure that we will receive regular articles from his elequent pen. They will be sent via telegraph.</p>
   <p>On several occasions, during vacations and other forced absences, Frilanse substituted for the editor, and Scandia did not suffer in anyway from this substitution. Frilanse is a very able writer; he is a keen observer, broad-minded and always tactful in handling the most difficult situations.</p>
   <p>Frilanse is quiet, unassuming character who is always ready to step in and do most or all of the work, connected with a worthy cause; he <pb facs="5423969_2_1002.jpg" n="2"/>lets others have the glory, for he is not a seeker after publicity and adoration. In Norwegian dramatic circles he has been a real booster, both by performing in various plays and by building up the publicity that has put the Norwegian Theatre's box office on the map.</p>
   <p>Scandia hereby expresses heartfelt appreciation for the many articles submitted by Frilanse, and for his faithful and willing aid at all times. We wish him every success in his new field of endeavor, and we shall look forward to hearing from him often; to this, we know, all our readers will respond with a hearty "Amen."</p>
