   <p>Dr. Steele says: "When reading or working, the light should be at the reader's left side or at the rear, but never in front. The constant increase of defective eyesight among the pupils in our schools is an alarming fact. Dr. Agnew considers that our schoolrooms are making us a "spectacle-using" people. Nearsightedness seems to increase from class to class, until in the upper grades, there are sometimes as high as fifty per cent of the pupils thus afflicted. The causes are:</p>
   <p>"1. Desks so placed as to make the light from the windows shine directly into the eyes of the scholars.</p>
   <p>2. Cross lights from opposite windows.</p>
   <p>3. Insufficient light.</p>
   <p>4. Small type that strains the eyes.</p>
   <p>5. The position of the pupil as he bends over his desk or slate, causing the blood to settle in his eyes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0963.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"All these causes can be remedied; the position of the desks can be changed; windows can be shaded, or new ones made; books and newspapers that strain the eyes can be rejected; and every pupil can be taught how to sit and study."</p>
   <p>This is sound common sense. The Commissioner of Education seems to agree, but he does nothing about it. Here is his report:</p>
   <p>"Light is better from both sides than from one side, but there should be no windows that face the pupil. Light from one side should be from the left, so as not to throw the shadow of the pupil's hand upon his work.</p>
   <p>"The windows should be provided with green shades: yellow is not good for the eyes. The blackboards should not have a glossy surface and the teacher's desk should be in the opposite end of the room from the entrance. The end of the room opposite the entrance should have no windows. The blackboard should extend across the end of the room back of the teacher's desk, and down each side to the windows."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0964.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But the opposite is the case in most of our classrooms. So what is the good of agreeing with Dr. Steele? Some classrooms are worse than others. We know of rooms where the desks are so placed that the sun can shine into the pupils' eyes, and little effort is made to shade the room. Yet nothing is being done.</p>
   <p>It is high time that this matter be taken up, and conditions changed. We shall do what we can, and as soon as possible.</p>
