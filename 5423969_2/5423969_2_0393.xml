   <p>The fourth Liberty Loan campaign is approaching. Prompt organization is essential. The officers of the Norwegian Branch of the Third Liberty Loan Committee, as well as the entire Norwegian Committee organization, as in the case of all other nationalities, have been requested by the director of the Foreign Language Division and by the resolution of the Central Committee to maintain the present organization and continue to act in the fourth campaign. While it is possibly their duty to respond to this call without further action, and while they are at all times prepared cheerfully to render such service in this great cause as may be requested of them, they prefer to submit the matter of the selection of officers and managers for the coming campaign to the judgment and the decision of their fellow Norwegian-Americans; and to this end all Norwegian-Americans are cordially invited to attend a general meeting on Monday next, August 19, 1918, at the Chicago Norwegian Club, 2350 North Kedzie Boulevard, at 8 P.M.</p>

   <p>At the request of the Director of the Foreign Language Division there will also be submitted to this meeting the matter of arranging for the sale of the quota of the tickets allotted to the Norwegian-Americans for the great War Exhibition to be held in Grant Park from September 2 to September 15.</p>
