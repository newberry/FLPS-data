He came to Chicago in 1885 and his first position was as a groom of a horse for a piano manufacturer. in 1888 he returned to Chicago from Kalamazoo, Michigan, and entered the service of the Chicago Cottage Organ Company, known as the Cable Company, where he rose to be one of the managers. Mr. Gerner managed to establish an enormous business for the concern, not only among Americans, but among all other nationalities. He was known to have the largest Scandinavian following in his line of business in the west. He made a special effort to employ salesmen of all nationalities, which resulted in an immense business. Mr.Gerner has also started several agencies for American Organs in Scandinavia, and he made several trips abroad. In 1904 he severed his connections <pb facs="5423969_2_1125.jpg" n="2"/>with the Cable Piano Company and purchased stock in a big modern piano factory and organized the William Gerner Piano Company. Besides being directly interested in the manufacture of modern high-class pianos, his company is also factory distributors for player-pianos, organs and upright pianos made in Boston and New York.</p>
