   <p>The Norwegian Theater of the Norwegian Club will produce dramas in English. Having presented plays in Norwegian for many seasons, the Norwegian Club is following the example of the National Theater in Christiania in inviting noted guest players. The first on the list will be the Henderson Players, the organization of young student players founded and directed since their formation last November by Alfred Henderson. These players returned from Norway last July, fresh from a year's study of our theater methods in Christiania and Bergen. It will be the first time any Scandinavian club in America has had dramatic performances given by Americans in the language of the country, and it speaks volumes for the enterprise and co-operation of the Norwegian Club that it should lead the way in this matter.</p>
   <p>Every Norwegian should make a special point of attending on Sunday evening, March 25, at 8 P. M., to see the presentation of "America Passes By," a <pb facs="5423969_2_1380.jpg" n="2"/>one-act comedy of Chicago life as it is today; "Fancy Free," a one-act satire on modern matrimonial methods; and "The Dear Departed," a domestic comedy of unusual cleverness and human interest. In the last two Mr. Henderson will appear.</p>
   <p>The performance will begin at 8 P. M., and will continue until 10:30 P. M., after which there will be dancing. Hans [L. H. Lund] will be present from Scandia and will record his impressions. If the experiment is successful the Henderson Players will appear next month with a new repertoire, and they will close the season with a production of Henrik Ibsen's "Love's Comedy".</p>
