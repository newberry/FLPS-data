   <p>This year's concert by the Norwegian Singers' League had been looked forward to with greater interest than ever before, and the audience was in no way disappointed. Though to a great extent the interest centered in the name of Inga Orner, her name was not the drawing card it was expected to be, and Orchestra Hall displayed several distressingly bare sections.</p>
   <p>The really talented Inga Orner gave evidence of great artistic ability, a finished voice, and a pleasing personality. She appeared as cool and collected on the stage as if she were welcoming a good friend in her own home. The audience applauded her offerings both enthusiastically and at length. Prof. Alfred Paulsen's organ solos were masterfully played and given their just acclaim by an appreciative audience. Miss Esther Alfhild Erhart, pianist, played selections from Liszt, Chopin, and Schumann, and as always carried her audience through a beautiful array of melodies that endeared her more than ever in the hearts of our people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1569.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Individual chorus numbers by Bjorgvin, Nordmendenes, and the Glee Club, together with the offerings of the massed chorus, were sung very well, giving ample evidence that our singers do not know the meaning of inactivity and lack of improvement. We could gladly hear these men every week.</p>
