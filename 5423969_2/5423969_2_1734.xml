   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society has taken the initiative in a new movement, the purpose of which being to make it possible for the Norwegian-American societies to honor Old Norway in a suitable manner on the centennial of her constitution. At the meeting of the singers last Wednesday, it was decided to send as large a chorus as possible to the festivities in Norway in 1914.</p>
   <p>The question was first discussed at the meeting of the board of directors last Friday. The sentiment was overwhelming in favor of the undertaking, but it was also realized that the matter was of much importance and a question that most decidedly concerned the singers. For these reasons it was resolved to leave the final decision to the singers themselves. The active singers were strongly in favor of the plan, and at once agreed to the proposition when it was presented to them by the president, Hans L. Oftedahl.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1735.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It seems most suitable that the first step in this direction thus was taken by the oldest Norwegian singing society in America. No doubt other singing societies will follow in the footsteps of the Norwegian Singing Society in this matter.</p>
