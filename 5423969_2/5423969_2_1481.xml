   <p>The Norwegian Singers' Association gave its great concert Wednesday evening at Logan Square Theatre. The audience filled the theatre fairly well - it was raining, and this fact probably kept many people away; the rain also seemed to blanket the enthusiasm; a less demonstrative audience than Wednesday's would be difficult to find. The applause came as if it cost the audience great exertion to show its appreciation of the program. Anything in this line of 'thunderous applause' was only received by the Norwegian Glee Club, singing "Vortland" (Our Country) by Alfred Paulsen, the composer directing.</p>
   <p>The program was very good, and the execution on the whole excellent.</p>
   <p>The various choruses participating did so under the leadership of their <pb facs="5423969_2_1482.jpg" n="2"/>own directors. As to the united chorus of one hundred and fifty voices, one might have expected a more vigorous and robust performance than was effected. The soloists, Mme Bergljot Aalvud Tillisch, Chr. Mathiesen and Henry Andersen each received their full share of what little applause the public chose to accord the performers.</p>
   <p>Ole Bull's original piano had been placed at the disposal by the singing society Bjorgvin. Mrs. Lilly Meyer Johnson rendered the piano accompaniment for most of the songs.</p>
