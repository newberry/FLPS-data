   <p>Bjorgvin's Hall was filled to capacity on Saturday, Oct. 26, on the occasion of the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society's ("4 S 's") concert. Rotzers Orchestra played during the time the Hall was filling and for the dancing that followed the program. The "4 S's" are a well-balanced and well-trained male chorus under the direction of the able and popular Rolf Hammer, and its offerings on this occasion were all very well sung. This chorus is a power in Scandinavian Socialistic circles and is always ready (true to its principles) to help out in any good cause. At this year's concert they had as guest artists the German Socialist Chorus of sixty voices, under Mr. Memisheim's leadership. The cream of the concert was the solos by Rolf Hammer. Other soloists were William Ratza, pianist and Theo Botzer, cellist; the latter being encored several times.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the concert, a request was made that no one should <pb facs="5423969_2_1591.jpg" n="2"/>smoke during the concert, but no one seemed to pay any attention, not even the singers themselves (on behalf of whose throats the request was made), and certainly they should be the first to set a good example. Smoking may be "at home" in tawdry variety show houses or burlesque theatres, but it has no place in the concert hall.</p>
