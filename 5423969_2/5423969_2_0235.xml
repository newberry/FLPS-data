   <p>The ticket put in the field by the Republicans of Cook County is a singular combination of strength and weakness. The candidates for the offices of state's attorney, recorder, clerks of the Superior and the Circuit courts, coroner, board of review, and board of assessors are strong men who command the confidence of the community, and the judicial nominations are excellent. It is generally admitted that all of these nominations are uniformly strong and good.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the same is not true of many of the other candidates selected by the convention. The nominations for drainage trustees and for county commissioners were a distinct disappointment to all true Republicans and other good citizens. And the more some of these nominations have been scrutinized the stronger has grown the impression of their unfitness upon the people. How they could have been made is incomprehensible to all who would fain believe that representatives of a great party always try to be faithful to their trust.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0236.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A leaderless convention is often a rather capricious body and hence apt to place a black sheep upon its list of candidates. Such mistakes may easily occur in a large body of men who act each upon his own judgment and impulses. But there was no possibility for mistakes of this kind in the Cook County convention. The machine was in full and perfect control. All nominations had been carefully considered in all their bearings. Men were rejected, not by chance or miscalculations, but because they were not wanted; and every name that appears upon the ticket was placed there after due deliberation. Hence the convention, or the machine, is entitled to full credit for all good nominations that were made, as it must accept the full responsibility for all bad selections.</p>
   <p>There was no dearth of candidates for the drainage board or the county board. Most of the present incumbents desired a renomination. Some of them have served the people well, others indifferently or worse. The list of men now aspiring to these offices contained good men and unfit men. Now, with all this material to select from, what did the convention do? It rejected those men whose faithful and efficient service entitled them to renomination, and renominated the very men who <pb facs="5423969_2_0237.jpg" n="3"/>are condemned by their own records. And in selecting candidates from among new aspirants it rejected well-known men of undoubted honesty and ability, while it accepted men who would be absolutely unknown and obscure except for their shady records. It is true that all nominations for sanitary trustees and county commissioners were not bad. There are one or two good names on each of these tickets. But the controlling principle seems to have been that good men must be rejected and unfit men nominated. This is especially true of the county board. The majority of the nominees for commissioners are men in whose ability and honesty the people have no confidence whatever.</p>
