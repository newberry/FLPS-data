   <p>James Reddick's enforced resignation as a candidate for county clerk on the Republican ticket has caused general regret among Republicans in Chicago and Cook County. He is one of our cleanest and best balanced politicians; his record is without blemish, and his ability is freely admitted even by his political opponents. His friends are a host; his enemies a handful, if he has any at all. By unfailing tact, urbanity, and good judgment he has won a position of great influence which has been used for the best interests of the party and the people at large.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, Mr. Reddick's successor on the ticket is a gentleman whose fitness for the responsible position is generally recognized. Mr. Peter B. Olsen is perhaps not so well known in Cook County as Mr. Reddick, but he is a man of the same stamp. He is a capable and thoroughly honest man, <pb facs="5423969_2_0081.jpg" n="2"/>combining modesty with force, and tact and good judgment with tenacity and courage when something is to be done. He was one of the best and most useful representatives from Cook County in the last legislature, and returned with the small parks law for which he is blessed, especially by the plain people of the congested districts of Chicago.</p>
   <p>He is a man of the people, and the people like him. As the campaign progresses, Peter B. Olson will grow upon the voters, and long before it is over it will be generally understood that his is one of the very strongest names upon the ticket.</p>
