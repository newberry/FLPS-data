   <p>Anderson's Pressed Brick Company went bankrupt and was bought by Albert C. Barnes. The firm was organized in 1881 with a capital of $500,000. Its yearly business was about one million dollars, and it was the largest company in its line of business. Its factory on Elston Ave. near Clybourne Place had cost $500,000 to build. This building is the company's only asset. There are the following debts on the company: $200,000 in mortgage and $150,000 in loans. The factory will soon open again. It will be bought by the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The sudden shortage of cash is due to the fact that a laborer, whose hand was smashed and later amputated, sued the firm for $20,000 and the jury gave him $15,000. When this sum was not paid in due time the factory was closed for contempt of court. James Anderson is president and Atler B. Coale, secretary and treasurer.</p>
