   <p>The concert of the Bjorgvin Singing Society which was held last Sunday at Schoenhofen Hall, was most successful. Mr. M. Pedersen's orchestra opened the program with an overture, after which the Bjorgvin singers sang Grieg's "Sangerhilsen" (Greeting from the Singers). Both this and the subsequent numbers by the Singing Society were vigorously applauded, and encores were demanded. All the singers responded to the roll call, and several extra numbers were rendered. A number of the members of Mr. Pedersen's orchestra gave instrumental solos and received applause that was well deserved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oscar Gundersen made a speech reminding the audience that the day marked the anniversary of the birth of the great Norwegian author, Bjornstjerne Bjornson. The speech was well appreciated.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening the floor was cleared for dancing, and Mrs. M. Pedersen <pb facs="5423969_2_1767.jpg" n="2"/>served luncheon in the dining hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Julius Jager, chairman of the committee on arrangements, stated to a reporter for the Skandinaven that the financial returns from the concert were satisfactory, and that the public had proved by the frequent and lively applause that the program had been well up to expectations.</p>
