   <p>Governor John R. Tanner has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. From whatever point of view his action on the gas bills and the Allen bill is considered, his approval of these vicious measures was a fatal error, utterly inexcusable and clearly in contravention of public policy. The issue was squarely joined between insolent and rapacious corporate wealth on one side and the people, betrayed by their own representatives, on the other. The people, astounded and shocked at the shameless conduct of their "servants," had a right to expect, and did expect, that the executive veto, their only remaining hope, the only rampart not captured by their enemies, would be interposed for their protection. But deaf to their plea and heedless of the precedents set by his predecessors, Governor Tanner made haste to comply with the wishes of the corporations.</p>
   <p>The Governor's disregard of the interests and will of the people in this <pb facs="5423969_2_0316.jpg" n="2"/>instance is so ruthless as to baffle any attempt at a reasonable explanation. Assuming that he did not know what everybody else knew, viz., that the passage of the bills in question was secured by the most barefaced corruption that ever stalked through any halls of legislation, he certainly knew they were framed wholly in the interest of corporations and introduced at their request and railroaded through the legislature at their bidding, while at every stage they were strenuously opposed by the people. He knew that the aim of the gas bills was to saddle an oppressive monopoly upon the people of Chicago and many other cities in the State; he knew that the Allen bill may be used to rob the city of Chicago of millions of dollars every year for the benefit of a small coterie of men who have fed upon the public franchises, and that it will subject the people of Chicago to the necessity of paying an exorbitant streetcar fare for a quarter of a century. This he knew, and yet he signed the bills, apparently with a light heart.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven has a high regard for the dignity of the office of Governor and is not disposed to do Governor Tanner an injustice or cast undue <pb facs="5423969_2_0317.jpg" n="3"/>suspicion upon his conduct or motives. But it is unable to discover a single valid excuse for his approval of the gas bills and the Allen bill. His action in this instance was an undisguised subserviency to corporate wealth, a flagrant sacrifice of the welfare of the people, a gross abuse of the trust vested in him, and a menace to our institutions and the stability of our government.</p>
   <p>The effects of Governor Tanner's blunder, or worse, will be most unfortunate. The public faith in the party he has misrepresented has received a severe shock, and the supremacy of the Republican party in Illinois has been placed in jeopardy. The salvation of the party now rests with the rank and file. It becomes the duty of every true Republican to do his utmost to crush the machine represented by Governor Tanner. If these efforts shall succeed and the party be purified it may take on a new lease of life in this State; otherwise, it deserves to go down, and to remain down, until it shall have experienced a new birth.</p>
   <p>But what is still more deplorable is that the confidence of the masses of the <pb facs="5423969_2_0318.jpg" n="4"/>people in our government and institutions has been most rudely shaken. This cannot but swell the ranks of those who look upon our present system of government as a mighty engine of oppression of the common people. It is exactly this kind of distrust that breeds revolution. John R. Tanner's immediate predecessor in the Governor's chair was frequently branded an "anarchist". But John R. Tanner's name affixed to the gas bills and the Allen bill will do more to spread anarchy than the sayings and writings and doings of John P. Altgeld have done or could ever do.</p>
