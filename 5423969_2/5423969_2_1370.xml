   <p>Dear Sir: Have all spoken who wish to speak? I intended that my discussion should have sufficient teeth to make impressions, and be incapable of two constructions, though the rebuke be ever so harsh. At the same time, it may seem bold for me to claim that I possess as much chivalry and respect for ladies as my opponents, but not at the cost of the stability and elevation of my race, the sanctity of the home, the sublimity of motherhood, the chastity and purity of our language, the serenity of family ties. Ridicule and sheer mimicry of our language are not pleasing to my ears, and I do not seem to be alone in sharing such opinion.</p>
   <p>I have been deluged with letters and telephone calls giving praise and approval <pb facs="5423969_2_1371.jpg" n="2"/>of my attitude. Much as I appreciate these testimonials, may I say that Alfred O. Erickson needs no assistance; he will finish what he starts unaided. Didn't one Bjornson say: "The biggest man is he who can stand alone"?</p>
   <p>Let the sisters employ their talents to something more laudable than poking fun at our race and ridiculing our mode of speech.</p>
   <p>Bless us, if this shrill shrieking of the "yack and yenny" harangue is "art," pray slip me "Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here," instead.</p>
   <p>Alfred O. Erickson</p>
  </body>
