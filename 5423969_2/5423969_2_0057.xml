   </div>

   <p>A banquet was [recently] given by the Dovre Club in honor of Mr. M. A. Michaelsen, the newly elected Congressman, who defeated the Dane Niels Juul.</p>
   <p>A great many people were present; many of them were people seldom seen at any kind of affair, but they had turned out for Michaelsen in great numbers. The audience all seemed to be "well-to-do" citizens in formal dress with studs in their shirts and diamond rings on their fingers, a typical Republican gathering, we should say. Present were Nicolai Grevstad, United States minister, editor, journalist, writer, etc., Attorney Olaf Ray, Judge Oscar Torrison, Alfred Ericson [Swede], and others.</p>
   <p>Attorney Stoltenberg presided. The master of ceremonies was Birger Osland. The principal speaker was Alderman Oscar H. Olsen. The other speakers on the <pb facs="5423969_2_0058.jpg" n="2"/>program were Mr. Hitzmann, and Mr. Severinghaus.</p>
   <p>When everybody had had his say, the new Congressman took the floor. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"I am deeply sensible of the great responsibility as well as the great honor that the 500,000 citizens of the Seventh District of Illinois have bestowed upon me. Public office to me means only one thing, service--service in promoting the welfare of those who have trusted me to act for them, service in the protection of their lives and property, and service in maintaining for them all the right and privileges to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States.</p>
   <p>The world has just passed through a terrible period of terrific destruction. In Europe governments have fallen, and thrones are tottering. In our country a tremendous burden has been placed upon our people for all time to come.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0059.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Everywhere there are discontent, tumult, and unrest. The people are anixously waiting, with hopeful hearts, for the Republican party to take up the reins of government. Grave questions await action by the new President and the new Congress. The strain and the soreness of the conflict still weigh heavily upon most of our people.</p>
   <p>On top of the grief and the distress of our people over the shedding of American blood have come their resentment and their anger toward the rich and powerful interests that in the nation's most sorrowful hours exacted merciless toll for their profit on the commodities necessary and essential for the sustenance of human life. These interests that oppress the people are not partisan. They operate with equal facility in either the Democratic or the Republican party. They are not American, though extremely patriotic in all their outward manifestations.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of Congress to the people to investigate closely the interests <pb facs="5423969_2_0060.jpg" n="4"/>behind every measure that comes up for consideration, thereby to prevent the forces of organized wealth and greed from continuing to rob the masses. It is the duty of Congress immediately to return to the policy laid down by George Washington and under no circumstances to forsake it, and to refrain from involving this nation in any foreign entanglements or alliances by entering any league or association of nations without first submitting the question to a vote of the American people. It is the duty of Congress immediately to adopt a resolution declaring out country at peace with the world, so that the new President may proclaim the repeal of obnoxious war-time legislation, and American soldiers now in Europe and Asia may be returned to our shores forthwith. It is the duty of Congress to grant a liberal bonus to our soldiers, sailors, and marines, in order that those who have supplied their country's military and naval needs, jeopardizing and sacrificing their lives, relinquishing their home ties, and forgoing their income-earning opportunities, may have at least this much honor and consideration shown them. It is the duty of Congress to see to it <pb facs="5423969_2_0061.jpg" n="5"/>that the ancient instrument of kings and princes for tyranny and despotism be not invoked against us, a free people, and that no law for compulsory military service be enacted in this land.</p>
   <p>The American people are now burdened with an amount and a variety of taxes due to the war which is without precedent in the nation's history largely the consequence of unparalleled waste and extravagance practiced by those intrusted with the administration expenditures during the period of the war and the time subsequent thereto. It is therefore the duty of Congress to reduce this oppression and to lighten the burden placed upon our people of small means by exempting from Federal taxation all incomes less than $5,000 per annum.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the people of the Seventh District of Illinois have <pb facs="5423969_2_0062.jpg" n="6"/>endorsed these policies and principles so overwhelmingly, I feel that nothing that I could do would be of greater service to them than to ask permission of Congress that the people of the Seventh District of Illinois be heard upon these questions of human welfare, which affect the lives, the property, and the happiness of all."</p>
