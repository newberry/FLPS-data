   <p>Upon the statute books of Illinois is found an act for the better regulation of the civil service of Chicago. Although many people will be inclined to doubt its existence the law is there and is supposed to be in force.</p>
   <p>During his canvass for the mayoralty Carter W. Harrison made no effort to conceal his dislike of the civil service law; and when he found himself elected with this obnoxious law upon his hands he was puzzled to know what to do with it.</p>
   <p>To abolish it outright was not within his power, nor did he think it would look well to trample it under foot in the sight of everybody.</p>
   <p>But young Carter was no slouch his friends assert, and his manipulation of <pb facs="5423969_2_0313.jpg" n="2"/>the civil service law certainly seems to justify their boast. He has set a really epoch-making precedent for the executives who find their hands tied by troublesome laws. The simplicity of his invention is the best proof of his ability in this line of work. It is the story of Columbus and the egg all over again, and the wonder of it all is that no one should have hit upon this expedient until young Carter came to tackle the civil service law.</p>
   <p>All he did was to turn the act upside down, to stand it upon its head, as it were. The general provisions of the law he has left severely alone, while he has been working the exceptions with might and main. This applies more particularly to an exception known as the "sixty day rule." In Harrison's hands this exception has become law, while the law itself has become an exception for which no use has been found as yet. Hundreds of appointments have been ground out under the sixty days rule, and the mill is still grinding. Could anything be simpler than this? To strangle a law under the guise of obeying it is certainly as neat a game as ever was played.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0314.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This, however, exhausts the merits of Mr. Harrison's new invention. His fellow patriots among the unterrified detest civil service reform even more cordially than does His Honor himself, and are moving heaven and earth to break it down. The Trudes, the Thorntons, the Gahans, the Powers, and the Star Club statesmen are all furious, because they find their access to the public crib obstructed. But His Honor only shrugs his shoulders and points to the law. This serves the purpose of making some gullible people believe that he is something of a civil service reformer after all, while the sixty days rule enables him to retrench himself as the Democratic poohbah of Chicago.</p>
   <p>There is one esteemed fellow citizen who is liable to turn green with envy at the success of Mr. Harrison. His predecessor in the office tried to construct a personal machine by a somewhat similar use of the civil service law. But George B. Swift failed miserably, while everything seems to be coming Mr. Harrison's way. His friends are right. Young Carter is no slouch.</p>
   <p>Well, the Skandinaven has another battle upon its hands.</p>
