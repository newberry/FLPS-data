   <p>For some time, Selz and Swab have had an agreement with the Warden at Joliet permitting their firm to operate a factory in the prison for the manufacture of shoes.</p>
   <p>After this had gone on for some time, the workers in the Chicago shoe factory, 15 Washington Street, went on strike. At once, the Knights of Labor began to organize the shop.</p>
   <p>Then a few days later a strike was called in the prison at Joliet, but the Warden ordered the striking inmates to be "strung," that is, tied by their hands to the cell doors, where they stayed part of the day and the entire night. This form of punishment is a new way to compete with the workers. Of course, the wages paid in the prison is in the form of tobacco and cigarettes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0373.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And what about the graft paid to the prison officials? No doubt, it is much cheaper than paying the workers.</p>
   <p>This sort of practice is going to be the beginning of many protests, and we will be first in demanding that the State authorities stop the corrupt exploitation.</p>
