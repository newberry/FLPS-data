   <p>Senator Johan Waage, did some really effective work in behalf of the striking garment-workers on the floor of the [Illinois] senate last Wednesday.</p>
   <p>A resolution authorizing the president of the senate to appoint a committee of five to go to Chicago, investigate the strike, and fix responsibility was introduced by Senator Hanson. An effort was made to sidetrack the resolution and cause it to be killed in committee. Senator Waage took the floor and insisted upon immediate action, since the strikers were suffering, and the struggle ought to be terminated as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>This was the Norwegian senator's maiden speech, and his argument carried the day, with the result that the strike question was made a special order in the <pb facs="5423969_2_0074.jpg" n="2"/>senate for next Tuesday. In insisting upon immediate action he did the entire State a service, and this, his first official act as a legislator, commends itself to all progressive citizens.</p>
