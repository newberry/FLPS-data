<title level="a">THE CASE OF WILLIAM A. PAULSEN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The trial of the former banker [William A.] Paulsen in the court of Judge Brentano continued Wednesday, and the case will probably go to the jury on Thursday. Mr. Paulsen was in the witness stand during the forenoon. Assistant State's Attorney Barnes's cross-examination attempted to show that Mr. Paulsen's bank actually had been insolvent for a long time before he went into voluntary bankruptcy. The books of the bank were placed in evidence. They showed that several times the bank had bought back its own stock from dissatisfied shareholders in order to keep its status a secret.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paulsen insisted that the bank was solvent until the day when he entered the plea of bankruptcy, and that everything would have been well with it had not the Atlas National Bank impounded shares and bonds of the Central Trust and Savings Bank to the amount of $100,000, which the <pb facs="5423969_2_1161.jpg" n="2"/>former bank never returned.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The Central Trust and Savings Bank was a Scandinavian bank.]</p>
