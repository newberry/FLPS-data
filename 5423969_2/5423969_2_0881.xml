   <p>From time to time I have read with great interest the discussions of different questions in these columns. I believe these columns are important, because various opinions are brought forth here. Now that I have read the opinions of different persons--young and old, professional people, etc.--on the question of woman suffrage, I feel inclined to express a few of my ideas on the subject. The topics in these columns are discussed in our organizations and among private groups, and for that reason they should be continued.....</p>
   <p>People still seem to be bound by that old barbarous idea that woman is an inferior being and must be kept in the background. This old teaching seems to be so firmly rooted in their lives that they do not realize the injustice and absurdity of its existence among an enlightened people. There was an excuse for our forefathers believing thus, for in their day the great career for man was war. With him it was the real business of life; but not so now.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0882.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Before proceeding, I wish to call attention to Hans Arvik's article in issue No. 33, where he wishes to know if we have ever heard of a woman that has ruled better than a man. I desire to refer him to Queen Victoria of England, whose reign is already the most peaceful and prosperous in the history of Great Britain. And thousands of others in the smaller vocations of life have succeeded where men have failed. To my mind, it is not the ambition of women to procure a voice in the government by filling offices that belong to men only (although it would be far better if some men would give up their positions to intelligent women who would be better fit), but because she would vote right and dare to do right. Consequently the politics of today would be purified.</p>
   <p>Woman is not open to bribery when her family is in danger. Her love conquers ambition, and she stands a superior being in the sight of God and man. The reasons for depriving women of their rights as citizens are very evident. Man does not want to be disturbed in his career of selfishness. He desires to have no one dictate to him in the great field of drink. The liquor sellers are opposed to woman suffrage. They see the handwriting on the wall, "Thus far <pb facs="5423969_2_0883.jpg" n="3"/>shalt thou go and no farther". They know the vote of women is a protection to home, family, and friends. They know that the hand of woman will dash aside the cup of poison and prevent the downfall of her loved ones. They know that when women vote, they will drive out the saloonkeeper as Christ drove the money-changers from the Temple. They know that the wife and mother will no longer remain idle and see their loved ones go down in shame and ruin. This is why woman is not granted equality with man. It is crime that stands in the way; it is Satan who uses man's low propensities to fight his battles.</p>
