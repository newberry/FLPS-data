   <p>p.8...Knut Mostue of Christiania, Norway, has sailed for home, after one year of study in this country. Mr. Mostue formerly studied at the Sem Agricultural College in Norway, Upon advice of Mr. John Sundby, American agriculturist and soil expert, he spent the last year studying farming and dairying in the United States, especially in Wisconsin and Iowa. John Sundby did not consider other states, except those mentioned, as worthy of consideration. When questioned as to his impressions, his replies were characteristically short and to the point.</p>
   <p>"What of America?" "Wonderful!" Chicago?" "Oh Lord, what a dirty city, but it has its very beautiful sections."</p>
   <p>How do different sections of the United States compare as to farming?"The East, intensive, rich owners driving hired help; West, vast areas, impoverished, through ignorance and carelessness; Mid-west real farming, sensible and scientific to the greatest degree." "Some of Norways best agricultural <pb facs="5423969_2_0902.jpg" n="2"/>teachers are from the Middle West. They are trained in the United States. "</p>
   <p>"What of dairying? Sundby is absolutely right! Wisconsin and Iowa are the worlds best and I am coming back some day. "</p>
   <p>All this from a twenty year old boy speaks well for Nordic brains, ambition and honesty in opinion.</p>
