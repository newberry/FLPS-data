   <p>Who is to be the Republican candidate for mayor of Chicago at the next election? Nobody knows, and nobody seems to care. In less than two weeks the delegates to the Republican city convention are to be elected; but the interest in the primaries appears to be confined to the aldermanic candidates. The voters would seem to have forgotten the fact that a candidate for mayor is to head the ticket.</p>
   <p>In former years there were loud and angry complaints because the machine chose candidates and ran things in general. This year the leaders have taken to the woods and the machine is doing nothing. The bosses have kept their hands off and left the matter entirely in the hands of the people. This is as it should be. But what have the people done? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The election of the chief magistrate of the city is apparently none of their business. Even <pb facs="5423969_2_0198.jpg" n="2"/>our "best people"--those among us who are wiser and better than the common herd--even they are silent. They seldom fail to find fault when it is too late. Why do they not step to the front now to arouse the people and help them with their advice? And the bold crusaders against vice who recently displayed their virtuous indignation with such noisy zeal, where are they now? They know that the conditions are as bad as ever, or worse, and that now is the time to act. Why do they not speak out? Are the doughty preachers gone to sleep, or have they left this wicked city?</p>
   <p>Whether the Republican rank and file are apathetic or simply are at sea, the fact remains that public opinion has not as yet fixed upon any candidate as pre-eminently the choice of the people. The convention, having no well-defined public sentiment to guide it, must rely upon its own judgment. Hence the importance of electing good men for delegates. If the convention is controlled by a majority of good sensible men all will yet be well. The people are slow to take matters into their own hands, which they should have done; yet, if the right man is nominated they will scarcely fail to give him generous support at the polls. Some well-known businessman, who has strong roots in Chicago and combines backbone with rugged honesty, can be elected because he would <pb facs="5423969_2_0199.jpg" n="3"/>command the confidence of the plain people of all nationalities. But in order to get such a candidate we must have a convention made up of the best men to be found in the precincts, and that is the people's business.</p>
