   <p>If the attack upon the life of President William McKinley shall result in his death, the crime at Buffalo will dwarf in its tragic horror even the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's death was the closing tragedy of a civil war: he fell a victim to the passions born of the fratricidal struggle, though his heart was full of good will toward the erring brothers of the South.</p>
   <p>William McKinley was shot down in the midst of profound peace. Surrounded by a magnificent display of the fruits of work, industry, and skill, greeted by throngs of happy fellow citizens, he had just delivered a cheering message of peace to his countrymen and the world at large when the bullets of a cowardly Judas carried their fateful message of death to him.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0787.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The sorrow and horror of the American people are too great for adequate expression. No president has possessed the regard and love of his countrymen in a fuller measure than William McKinley. No president has had so few personal enemies, for he has none. No president has loved his country with greater love or has been inspired with a higher sense of duty. And this great chief magistrate, this typical, true American, this good and noble man should receive an assassin's bullet in response to his friendly greeting!</p>
   <p>The President is a strong man of strong faith. He will make a brave struggle for life. And the nation will listen with bated breath to the throbbings of his wounded heart, and fervently pray that his life may be spared.</p>
