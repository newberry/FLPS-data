   <p>Chief Kipley has reinstated sixty-eight of the policemen discharged by "general order thirty-two." In explaining his new order, Mr. Kipley said in part:</p>
   <p>"The order speaks for itself, and I have nothing to say. Errors were made in issuing the general order of discharges, and they have been rectified. A number of good men were discharged, and they have been reinstated. My intention was to rid the department of all men not deserving to remain on it, and not to harm anyone. Errors were found, and they have been corrected."</p>
   <p>This explanation differs radically from the one given a few days ago by the Honorable Joseph Kipley. On that occasion he informed the people of Chicago that the reason why so many worthy men were discharged was that "we were compelled to make changes," and that "we were compelled" to do so because the "Irish pressed their claims" so hard that the pressure could not be resisted.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0299.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now Mr. Kipley advances the plea that his purpose in issuing general order thirty-two merely was "to rid the department of all men not deserving to remain on it." He made some errors, but "they have now been rectified."</p>
   <p>In other words, the Honorable Joseph has, in the course of a few days, been transformed from an avowed and extreme spoilsman to a civil service reformer. Of course, he does not expect the people to take him seriously, but the discharged men who have not been reinstated will probably not relish the joke of his remarks. They are all branded as unworthy of remaining on the force. Most of them have served the city for many years, and their record will compare favorably with that of any other member of the police department, the Honorable Joseph Kipley not excepted. But that did not avail anything in the eyes of the present chief.</p>
   <p>Chief Kipley's last explanation is a worse outrage upon decency than the outrageous order itself. But it will not hurt any of these men who have deserved well at the hands of the people of Chicago. As for the Honorable Joe himself, his explanation explains nothing. The people of Chicago know the man and his methods.</p>
