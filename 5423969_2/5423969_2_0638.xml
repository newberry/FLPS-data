   <p>p.4...........The Castberg's Child Laws of April 10, 1915, were the subject of a lively discussion the other day at the Woman's City Club of Chicago, where four-hundred women gathered there. Miss Catherine Anthony of Chicago University, who has made a study of women's and children's living-conditions in different countries, particularly in Norway and Germany, gave a thorough description of Castberg's Laws, as they affected the rights of children born out of wedlock. Many of the club's members took part in the discussion. The consensus of opinion was overwhelmingly for the adoption of these laws of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The club has drawn up a resolution, which will be presented to the State Legislature.</p>
   <p>The Castberg Laws particularly stress the point: (1) That children born out of wedlock have the same rights with respect to parenthood - with certain exceptions as specified in the laws. (2) They have right to both the father's as well as the <pb facs="5423969_2_0639.jpg" n="2"/>mother's family-name. (3) Their expenditures and education shall be governed by the parent best financially situated. (4) The parent who has the care of the child shall give to it all the advantages of a legitimate child. (5) While the other makes monetary contributions towards the support of the child, usually up to the age of sixteen years.</p>
   <p>(6) The amount of support shall be proportionate to the economic status of both parents; with respect to the father certain minimum amounts are prescribed.</p>
   <p>(7) Furthermore, children born out of wedlock shall have the same inheritance rights to their father's estate as the legitimate children, provided the parenthood has been established in the manner stipulated by the laws. (8) Right to the (Homestead) will an illegitimate child has only if the father has so declared in a written statement.</p>
   <p>(9) The laws further provide that either spouse can have their property divided, in case either one, at the time of their marriage, had an illegitimate child with inheritance rights.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0640.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>(10) The spouse in question can demand that the estate shall be divided, so that each receives what he or she brought into the estate at time of marriage or through inheritance during its life.</p>
   <p>In the law of August 20, 1909, regarding dissolution of marriages, p.3, it is provided that either spouse can have the marriage dissolved, if one of the contracting parties without the other's knowledge was the parent of an illegitimate child; or through relation with a third party whereby, a child was born later. The provisions set forth in p.13, regarding the division of the estate are also applicable, where a marriage is dissolved on account of infidelity, when through such action a child with inheritance rights is born.</p>
   <p>The Castberg Laws met with bitter opposition from many quarters in Norway, before they were finally adopted by the Parliament (Storting.)</p>
