   <p>In the really old days, here in Chicago, the Norwegians were quite well represented in Chicago politics. One of the first to gain real political prestige was Iver Lawson from Voss, in Norway: he was Victor F. Lawson's father. Iver Lawson filled the offices of city marshal, alderman, and member of the Illinois legislature; in the legislature he was the leader of the group of men that began to build Chicago's beautiful parks and boulevards. This was in the sixties.</p>
   <p>In the eighties we had Canute B. Matson, who was very active in politics. Then for some years no great Norwegian politician came to the front.</p>
   <p>But now the Danes come forward with Henry L. Hertz and Niels Juul. Hertz became State treasurer of Illinois and Juul congressman.</p>
   <p>Then came the Swedes with Fred Lundin, who made himself a name in the <pb facs="5423969_2_0056.jpg" n="2"/>politics of Chicago. No Irishman could ever compete with Lundin.</p>
   <p>Another Norwegian worthy of mention, Carl Chindblom, also became a congressman.</p>
   <p>Today we have Charles S. Peterson, the Swede, president of the County Board.</p>
   <p>Peterson was born in Filipstad, Sweden, in 1873. He came to Chicago, a poor printer's boy. He was for many years president of the Swedish Club, member of the school board, and member of the Scandinavian-American Foundation. Last year he organized a large Swedish male chorus.</p>
   <p>A Norwegian who today is running for County Commissioner must also be mentioned, Borger O. Borgerson. Borgerson was born in Telemarnen, Norway, in 1872. He came to Chicago when he was ten years old.</p>
