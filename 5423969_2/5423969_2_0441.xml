   <p>It is now about five months since the United States decided to enter the war on the side of the Entente. This step was taken by the United States, according to President Wilson, in order to fight for human rights. And such is the case. In the colossal account being taken with the forces of the past, an account of which we ourselves hardly can imagine the end yet, the American nation represents an upward move, the significance of which can hardly be grasped.</p>
   <p>The United States is in the war because the American people have become convinced that the purpose of the war is part of the purpose of America as a <pb facs="5423969_2_0442.jpg" n="2"/>nation; that the future of democracy is at stake and that for this reason America does not have the right to stand aloof.</p>
   <p>Here the Russian Revolution enters as a deciding factor, and only when the American declaration of war is seen in connection with this event,can its true significance be grasped. The reason for America's staying out of the war for nearly three years, is not to be sought in lack of provocations of various kinds on the part of the Central Powers, nor in a love of peace. Economic or other reasons, persuaded America to bow to any abuse. The reason for the delay is to be sought first hand in the American people's instinctive dislike against any alliance at all with czaristic Russia. The Entente powers of Western Europe had been compelled by conditions touching on their very existence to overlook this side of the <pb facs="5423969_2_0443.jpg" n="3"/>question; they were under a very different type of compulsion than the United States. Since America, half a century ago, bought from Russia the Alaska peninsula, thereby eliminating from the New World the darkest representative of European reaction, the two powers have stood far apart officially. Otherwise the bond of sympathy was strong. The excesses of reactionary Russia have never been more unmercifully revealed than in Kennan's well-known book on Siberia, and during the years of these excesses the United States have become increasingly a place of refuge for Russian emigres. When democracy gained the upper hand in Russia, the situation was changed overnight. Now the war took on the characteristic of a war of the people against the despots.</p>
   <p>The American people became convinced that the issue at stake was the future of democracy and not merely some accidental fly-by-the-night questions of <pb facs="5423969_2_0444.jpg" n="4"/>political expediency, of importance merely for Europe. At the same time, the Monroe Doctrine was given a different and broader significance, the correctness of which, to be true, is denied by the Germans, but holds true nevertheless. The purpose of the Monroe-Doctrine was to keep reaction away from the New World when the Holy Alliance one hundred years ago sought to maintain the Spanish rule in America. In return, the United States declared that they themselves intended to keep away from the quarrels of Europe.</p>
   <p>Since 1823 America has maintained this policy, but at the moment, when Germany through its unrestricted submarine warfare denied the right of American shipping to an open ocean, the United States quite naturally had to act for the protection of its interests. The consequence was the rupture of diplomatic relations with Germany, while the declaration of war itself did not come till after the revolution in Russia. Through this event, the Monroe Doctrine became broadened so as to cover the fight against reaction not <pb facs="5423969_2_0445.jpg" n="5"/>merely when appearing in America but in Europe as well, because now the arms of reaction had become extended through modern inventions and methods.</p>
   <p>The alliance of the Central Powers is not one whit less inimical to liberty than was in its time the Holy Alliance, and the United States are therefore resting on historic ground both morally and politically in joining with the democratic nations in their great war for world peace.</p>
