   <p>A resolution passed by the City Council invites the three park boards to co-operate with the special park commission in selecting sites to be purchased for small parks and playgrounds.</p>
   <p>It is to be assumed that this courteous invitation will be accepted in the same spirit of cordial co-operation in which it has been extended, and that the work of establishing a system of small parks will soon be well under way. The task is one of great importance and some difficulty. But the chief aim of this splendid improvement is not in doubt. These small parks are to be established mainly for the benefit of those of our children who, for various reasons, are denied the privilege of visiting the existing parks except on infrequent occasions. They should be located, as far as possible, in districts that are thickly settled by workers who are compelled to live in more or less unsanitary tenements, in crowded <pb facs="5423969_2_0956.jpg" n="2"/>rooms where a draught of fresh air or a ray of sunlight is a strange visitor. The children who swarm about the narrow streets and unspeakable alleys in such districts are entitled to the first consideration. Even if all the money to be expended for this purpose is invested especially for the benefit of the poor children of the city, it will be well spent.</p>
