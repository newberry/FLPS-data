   <p>The concert Friday evening for the benefit of Tabitha Hospital was a very successful affair. The attendance was very good in spite of the bad weather, and it is probable that the financial returns from the concert will be considerable.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Quartet Club opened the program with Reissigers "How Beautiful Is This Evening", which was sung attractively. The last number rendered by the Club, "Sangen" (The Song), was even more pleasing to the audience. In this number Mr. C. F. Martens sang the solo parts. It was one of the best presentations on the program and had to be repeated to satisfy the audience.</p>
   <p>The violinist, Mr. Max Fischel, won much applause. He gave very able presentations of "Intermezzo" by Mascaguis; the "Obertass" by Wieniawski; the "Madrigale" by Simonetti; and the "Hungarian Poem" by Hubay. Mrs. Ella Dahl Rich played the "Fruhlingsrauschen" by Christian Sinding and "Gondoliera" by Moszkowski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_1765.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Christina Nielsen Dreier sang three n White's "The spring Has Come", Benza's "Orchard Cradle Song", and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> (The Ditty of the Bird); as usual won well-deserved applause.</p>
   <p>On the whole, as we have said, the concert was very successful from a musical point of view. It is to be hoped that the financial returns may be as good as is deserved by the objective for which the concert was given.</p>
