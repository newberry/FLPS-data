   <p>Editor Scandia:</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: In your January 2 issue there appeared an article signed by Alfed O. Erickson which I am not able to ignore. In medical parlance it may be called "a purulent exudate". I felt surprise that it should have found space in your excellent paper. However, I am not going to reply in such terms and spirit as the attack on the Olson sisters. They do not need me for their champion. But to the point: Can it be considered an insult to give, as a part of an entertainment, a sketch or satire in which oddities of speech, dress, or manners of people form a part? If so, how much unpunished insult has been done against many people--the Irish, Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Negro--who is it that has been immune?</p>
   <p>If the lecture platform, the concert stage, the drama--yes, even the pulpit-must be denied all semblance of imitation and mimicry along these lines, the <pb facs="5423969_2_1373.jpg" n="2"/>world will grow sadder and more lugubrious. I doubt very much that Mr. Alfed O. Erickson has ever heard much grumbling about the Olson sisters' funny stories. I have heard them several times, in old Norwegian settlements in the Middle West, where nearly every listener had the brogue, and I have heard elderly Norwegian women at the next meeting of the sewing club repeat what they could remember of the high light, and try to reproduce it, saying they wished they could remember more and get it off as the Olson sisters did.</p>
   <p>But, allowing that there might be an occasional grouch who felt sore, that gives no one the right to use epithets like "freak sisters," "flippancy," "eager to show off their shapes," etc. The Olson sisters are straight, honest girls of considerable ability, and have many friends.</p>
   <p>Here I rest my case. Vituperation and slinging filth is not along my line, and the article has too little merit to entitle it to more than the briefest <pb facs="5423969_2_1374.jpg" n="3"/>notice.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Dr. J. S. Johnson.</p>
