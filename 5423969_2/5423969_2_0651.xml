   <p>The Congressional Conference Committee is now busy with the tariff. The representatives of the House insist on the proposal adopted by the House, the Payne bill, the rates of which are somewhat lower, on the whole, than are the rates of the present tariff, the Dingley law. The representatives of the Senate are standing pat on the Senate proposal, the Aldrich bill, which revises the present tariff upward.</p>
   <p>President Taft is most careful not to mix in the affairs of Congress; yet he is using his influence to obtain a revision downward. The Republican party promised a downward revision, and the President holds that the party should keep faith with the voters. If the Senate members of the Conference Committee are made to yield, it will largely be due to the firm and prudent stand taken by the President.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_2_0652.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Unfortunately, the Conference Committee does not represent the attitude of the Republican party in the whole United States. The "standpatters" hold sway both in the House and in the Senate, and they have been using their power in such an arbitrary manner that the adherents of a genuine revision do not have a single important representative on the Conference Committee.</p>
   <p>So much the greater honor do those Republicans merit, who have fearlessly gone to bat against the "brutal majority," and with tireless persistence have kept up the fight. These men have sacrificed personal advantages and other benefits because they did not want to betray the people and their party. The voters will not forget their staunch stand when the day of accounting arrives.</p>
   <p>This the people's guard of honor consists of the following men: In the Senate: Nelson and Clapp, Minnesota; Dolliven and Cummins, Iowa; La Follette, Wisconsin; Crawford, South Dakota; Brown and Burkett, Nebraska; Bristow, Kansas; Beveridge, Indiana. In the House: Haugen, Good, Hubbard, Kendall, Morris, Pickett, and Woods, all of Iowa; Nelson and Morse, Wisconsin; Davis, Lindbergh, and Miller, Minnesota; Gronna, North Dakota; Hinshaw and Kinkaid, Nebraska; Madison and Murdock, Kansas; Poindexter, Washington.</p>
