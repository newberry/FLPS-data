   <p>We read in the report of the meeting of Branch 30 of the Albanian Federation, Vatra, Chicago, the criticism of Lasko Maleshova and Simo Kume Peshtani. As for Mr. Lesko, we are well acquainted with him and do not wish to make any comment in this paper. But I regret the affair exceedingly for my fellow citizen, Mr. Simo Kume, who criticizes the uniform of the President of the Albanian Republic. His Excellency, Ahmet Zogu. As I arrived recently from the old country, I have a thorough knowledge of the affairs of our country and know that Ahmet Zogu is one of the best Executives that Albania has ever had. As for the uniform of His Excellency, which does not appear to be liked by Mr. Simo Kume, I may state the following:</p>
   <p>Mr. Kume should not forget that His Excellency is a Colonel in the Albanian Army, and whenever he goes on a tour of inspection, he wears the uniform; at other times he wears civilian clothes, just like any other president of a civilized Republic. Mr. Simo Kume's attention is called to the Albanian stamps, which show His Excellency in civilian clothes and not as a monarch.</p>
