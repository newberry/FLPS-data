  <body>
   <p>The talent and intellectual achievement of the Albanian race are always to be praised, because they not only honor the talented person and his parents; they honor all Albanians.</p>
   <p>Young Miss Kristina Nikolla, daughter of Pando and Urani Nikolla of Pogradeci, who has been taking violin lessons for a short time from the famous German professor, Nicholas Frazen, revealed extraordinary talent and ability in a program in which she participated at Professor Frazen's studio. She played Beethoven's "Minuet in G," and made a good impression for one of her age. In addition, Kristina took part in a concert and dramatic program presented by the Voisava Society, an organization of Chicago Albanian women, in which she played a violin solo before a large gathering of Albanians. She was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>The parents of this girl are to be praised, because the duty of bringing up and <pb facs="5418477_0045.jpg" n="2"/>educating the children falls on the parents, who should do everything in their power to encourage the children in their studies and in anything else that contributes to the welfare of the child. In addition, the parents should urge their children to learn the Albanian language, if they wish to preserve the traditions of their forefathers.</p>
