   <p>In the report of the meeting of Branch 30, Chicago, of the Albanian federation Vatra, we have just read certain criticisms made by Lasko Maleshova and Simo Kume Peshtani. As for Mr. Lasko, we are well acquainted with him and do not wish to make any comment in this paper. But we regret the matter exceedingly for the sake of our fellow citizen, Simo Kume, who criticizes the uniform of the President of the Albanian Republic, His Excellency, Ahmet Zogu. Since we have but recently arrived from the old country, we have a thorough knowledge of the affairs of our country and know that Ahmet Zogu is one of the best executives that Albania has ever had. As for His Excellency's uniform, which Simo Kume apparently does not like, I may state the following: Simo Kume should not forget that His Excellency is a colonel in the Albanian Army, and whenever he goes on a tour of inspection, he wears his uniform. At all other times, he wears civilian clothes, just like any other President of a civilized republic. We call attention to the Albanian stamps, which show His Excellency in civilian clothes, not in royal dress.</p>
