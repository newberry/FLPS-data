   <p>On May 1st, a meeting was held by the Lithuanian Independent Club at 634 South Canal Street. The Meeting was called to make arrangements to protest against the agreement between United States and Russia. The meeting was called to order by president G. Szimkiewicze. The motion was carried to ask the right Rev. Kolasinski to announce in church on 7th and 14th day of May, of our coming meeting in church hall on the 14th day of May, for making a protest.</p>
   <p>A committee of three was elected to prepare in writing the protest. The club secretary must advertise in all Lithuanian papers about this coming meeting. All Chicago Lithuanians must come on this important meeting.</p>
   <p>S. Dorgiewicz, Sec.</p>
