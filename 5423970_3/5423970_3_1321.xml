<title level="a">CONVENTION OF THE SECOND DISTRICT OF THE LITHUANIAN ALLIANCE OF AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday at Aurora Hall, 3149 South Halsted Street, the Second District of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held its convention. Present at this convention were forty delegates, not only from the Chicago area but also from twenty-two branches of the Lithuanian Alliance of America in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana. The convention program was divided into two parts: a discussion of the general affairs of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, and one of the affairs of this particular district. This district, as stated previously in this newspaper, has determined to secure one thousand new members before the meeting of the Lithuanian Alliance of America convention which will be held next June in Waterbury, Connecticut. When we consider the enthusiasm with which the delegates discussed the Alliance's affairs, we have not the least doubt that they will accomplish their aim. After electing suitable members to necessary committees, the convention <pb facs="5423970_3_1322.jpg" n="2"/>expressed satisfaction with the present condition and rapid growth of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. For the success of this organization, the convention gave credit to the central secretary of the Alliance, Mr. A. Strimaitis, and to the editor, Mr. V. K. Rackauskas. It also decided upon several good projects for the benefit of this district and for the whole organization.</p>
   <p>The chairman of this convention was Dr. A. Zimontas, and the secretary was Mr. P. Kibartas. The officers for the next year were elected: Mr. M. Sarka, president; Mr. M. Damijonaitis, vice-president; Mr. P. Kibartas, secretary; Mr. A. Bierzinski, treasurer; and Mr. K. Jurgelionis, general organizer for the district.</p>
