   <p>The treasurer of the central committee of the Aurora Society gives the account every month, so there is no necessity of repeating the accounting details. I will give in a general way the yearly standing of the budget.</p>
   <p>The income for the year of 1905 is $898.56; paid out, $746.37; balance $152.19; balance from previous year, $562.48. Total in the treasury as of Feb. 1, 1906, $714.67.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society consists of four branches with 57 members. During the last year the Aurora Society, with the support of the public, helped the following students (omitting their names, giving initials):</p>

   <p>In last year's statement was given all the details of the three years income and expense of the Aurora Society and explanation about Grazis, V. D., V. M., F. M., A. V., and now we are introducing to the public the new students A. L., J. K., and P. R.</p>
   <p>A. L. is well known to the American Lithuanian public on account of his work in the national field. One of his last publications is the Lithuanian-English and English- Lithuanian Dictionary. At present he <pb facs="5423970_3_0939.jpg" n="3"/>is attending university in Switzerland and is studying economical and philosophical subjects. He is receiving $150, a yearly stipend.</p>
   <p>J. K. is a graduate of the Chicago Art Institute. He has great ability in art. He wants to go further with his studies; so he appealed to the Aurora Society for more help. He gave to the Aurora Society his reproduction of the picture "Return from the Market." At present he wants $150 to go on with his studies. The picture, given for raffle, would bring the money back to the Aurora Society. The Aurora Society has accepted this proposition.</p>
   <p>P. R.is a student of art at the Cracow Art Institute. He has great ability as an art student, and the future is bright. His painting will be a benefit not only to the Aurora Society, but to the Lithuanian nation as well. The majority of the Aurora Society members voted to give $50.25 to that student.</p>

   <p>If the statement of this society is not clear to anyone, for further explanation write to K. Gugis, secretary of Aurora Society, 3157 S. Halsted St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
