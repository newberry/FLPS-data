<title level="a">SOCIALISTS HOLD MEETING TO MAKE PLANS FOR LITHUANIAN DAY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>As it is already known, the Socialists refused to enter into a united front with the other Chicago Lithuanian factions for the coming Lithuanian Day (Tag Day) on November 1, 1916, and have decided to make separate arrangements for that day.</p>
   <p>These Chicago "rebels" are led and dominated by the newspaper Naujienos (News). The Naujienos called a mass meeting last Sunday morning at Meldazis Hall for the purpose of making plans for the Lithuanian Day. The meeting was called in the name of the League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, which went out of existence two years ago. Why were the Chicago Socialists ashamed to call the meeting in their own name, and instead hid behind the name of a corpse?</p>
   <p>About eleven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Anthony Lalis and others, with paper and pencils in their hands, passed through the hall and registered the names <pb facs="5423970_3_0211.jpg" n="2"/>of all those who were at the meeting.</p>
   <p>Everyone was asked, "What organization do you represent?" Invariably, the answer received was, "I do not represent any organization, because I am not authorized to represent any organization."</p>
   <p>"But anyway you are a member of some kind of organization?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, I am, but I came here only as an individual observer; I cannot represent any organization because I have no authority to do so."</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, they were registered as "delegates" of the organizations to which they belonged. Some protested against this procedure, but their protests were not heeded. One individual said, "If you want to write it that way, then go ahead; what do I care."</p>
   <p>Some time later, Mr. Galskis called the meeting to order. The first thing he <pb facs="5423970_3_0212.jpg" n="3"/>did was to ask, "Should we discuss arrangement plans today for the Lithuanian Day?"</p>
   <p>Everyone was quiet. No one answered the question. Then Mr. Pius Grigaitis asked, "Should we hold this meeting?"</p>
   <p>Some answered that the meeting should be held.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. Jurgelionis was elected chairman of the meeting. He invited Mr. A. Lalis to act as secretary, and Mr. Galskis to act as vice-chairman. No motions were made, but a previously prepared agenda was read and accepted by a majority vote.</p>
   <p>Then the following question was raised: "Since this meeting was called in the name of a group of organizations, how can we proceed without knowing what organizations and how many organizations are being represented here, and without <pb facs="5423970_3_0213.jpg" n="4"/>knowing who are delegates and who are merely observers?"</p>
   <p>It was requested that the meeting be informed as to what organizations were represented at the meeting, because before the meeting started clerks had passed through the hall and gathered this information.</p>
   <p>Instead of giving a direct answer to the question, the meeting was informed that this meeting is that of the League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, that forty societies belong to that League, that everything in regard to this matter was all right, and that more detailed information was not necessary.</p>
   <p>Then one individual remarked, "The League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies has died a long time ago; it is already two years since the League held its last meeting; it is ridiculous to speak in the name of a dead organization." His remarks, however, were ignored.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0214.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Casimir Gugis, president of the Lithuanian Assistance Fund [a Lithuanian war relief fund set up by Lithuanian-American Socialists], delivered an address. He heaped a large amount of unfavorable criticism against the Nationalists and Catholics. Among other things, he blamed those two factions for discriminating against, and for trying to lead by the nose, the "progressive Lithuanian public". According to him, the "progressive Lithuanian public" that is patented by the Naujienos must, therefore, make separate arrangements for the Lithuanian Day.</p>
   <p>Later Mr. Grigaitis, editor of the Naujienos, delivered an address, and spoke twice as long as Mr. Gugis. He repeated everything that had been published on the subject in Laisve (Liberty) and Kelevis (The Traveler), but especially in the Naujienos. His remarks were applauded by his followers.</p>
   <p>Both speakers invariably employed the term "progressive Lithuanian public", apparently fearing to antagonize the audience with the term "Socialist".</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0215.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It was decided at the meeting to elect a committee, and call it the "Lithuanian Day Committee".</p>
   <p>The proprietor of the hall requested, at this time, that the meeting come to a close as soon as possible, because the hall had been rented out for another meeting on that afternoon. As a result everything was rushed in order to bring the meeting to a quick close. Here, Mr. Jurgelionis submitted a long string of previously prepared resolutions and asked that they be accepted in a "wholesale" fashion. The resolutions were accepted accordingly.</p>
   <p>A Lithuanian Day Committee of seven members was hurriedly elected by open ballot. Those elected to the Committee were: Messrs. Grigaitis, Galskis, Ambrozevicius, and others. Since the time was limited, the Committee was authorized to elect its own officers. The same ruling was made in regard to the election of neighborhood committees--their election was left to the organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0216.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Thus, the hodgepodge "progressive Lithuanian public", consisting of Messrs. Grigaitis, Gugis, Jurgelionis, and Lalis, brought the meeting to a close. Later, the Naujienos published the false statement that forty-eight Chicago Lithuanian organizations participated in the meeting. Funmakers! Funmakers!</p>
   <p>By the way, during the meeting one man arose and remarked that "if the Socialists in Pittsburgh are able to work in unity and in harmony with other factions then why are Chicago Socialists unable to do likewise, why are they engaged in splitting tactics here?" This remark was met with complete silence, without a single word, as if some one spilled the beans.</p>
