   <p>The Rev. Zebrys in No. 20 of Lietuva wrote a long article and denies what was written about him in Lietuva previously. The priest says that the church is supported through free donations from the good will of the parishioners. The priest further states that he does not choose the parish trustees but he only appoints, and that the parishioners have full right to accept or reject. This is not so. The priest appointed the trustees without the consent or the approval of the parishioners. The priest's elected trustees are attacking those people who are not donating money to the priest.</p>
   <p>The priest says that he makes no obstructions, and yet the same priest tells the people to quit a society which refuses to support the priest. The priest through confession asks the people to quit societies which refuse to be under his control. The priest also says that he will give no absolution to those who do not obey his orders. The priest in the pulpit uses dirty language in denouncing the people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1636.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The priest also denies that he called the police during the riot in the church. Who then called the police? Certainly the police did not come of their own accord.</p>

   <p>Secretary, V. Sabaliauskas</p>
