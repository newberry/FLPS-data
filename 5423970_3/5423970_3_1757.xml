   <p>A few godless people, under the leadership of the editor of Lietuva and traitor, called a special meeting to make a protest against the Lithuanian parish rector. How comical it is on their part to call such a meeting. Everyone can see the purpose of such a meeting. The article which was published in Lietuva accused the archbishop of Chicago of being a thief and now they seek peace. Saying that the Pope is wearing shoes with a golden cross and the people should fall on their knees before him and kiss his shoes. This sort of fun-making shows lack of intelligence.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, which was held at the Pulaski Hall, May 13, 1899, there were about fifty people, who made this famous protest; but at the end they learned the truth. We believe that this meeting was planned and announcements printed by Lietuva during the night or Sunday morning.</p>
