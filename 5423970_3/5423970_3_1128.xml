<title level="a">CHICAGO'S LITHUANIANS PREPARE FOR GIGANTIC CELEBRATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Lithuanians of Chicago are preparing for the greatest celebration they have ever had. The "Loyalty Day" Celebration will take place on July 4 and it promises to be even greater than the recent Liberty bond demonstration, which attracted about ten thousand people. One can judge this from the reports of the committees.</p>
   <p>All of the Lithuanian colonies of Chicago will participate in this demonstration. The clubs and societies will parade in a body. Each colony will make up a separate division and, led by its own band, will meet the others, coming from all directions, at the McKinley Park fieldhouse, which is at Archer Avenue and Western Boulevard. In this hall there will be a program with speakers, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1129.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Lithuanians of Roseland, West Pullman and that vicinity, for whom it is too far to come to McKinley Park, will have their own demonstration in the All Saints Parish Hall, 108th Street and Wabash Avenue.</p>
   <p>Soldiers Also Promise to Be Present</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Central Committee, which is headed by Joseph Elijosius [Elias] and John I. Bagdziunas, is striving to obtain furloughs for that day for all the Lithuanian soldiers who are in Camp Grant, at Rockford, so that they can come to Chicago and participate in the Lithuanian demonstration. The Committee has sent an appeal to General Martin, who is in charge of the Camp, asking that he grant the furloughs.</p>
   <p>Also, the Government has promised to send three military planes to Chicago that day. One plane will be designated to fly over each of the sections: the North, the South and the West Side.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians will have their own bands and, in addition, there will be the Marine Band.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1130.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Parade Route</p>
   <p>On July 4, all the societies, clubs, and individuals who wish to parade with the bands will meet at one of the following places, from which they will proceed to McKinley Park:</p>
   <p>(1) The North Side division will meet at two o'clock at Western Boulevard and the Drainage Canal. The line will be formed here and will parade on Western Boulevard to McKinley Park.</p>
   <p>At all of the other designated places the societies will meet at one in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>(2) The Bridgeport division will meet at 33rd Street and Auburn Avenue, and will parade on Auburn Avenue to 35th Street, then to Archer Avenue, and on Archer Avenue to McKinley Park. It will be led by two bands.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1131.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>(3) The Town of Lake division will be made up of fourteen societies and will be led by three bands. The women of this section would not permit themselves to be outdone by the men so they hired their own band. This division will meet at 46th and Wood Streets. It will parade on 47th Street to Western Boulevard and on Western Boulevard to McKinley Park.</p>
   <p>(4) The Brighton Park division will meet at 45th Street and Fairfield Avenue. It will parade on Fairfield Avenue to 39th Street, on 39th Street to Western Boulevard, on Western Boulevard to McKinley Park. It will have one band.</p>
   <p>(5) The West Side division will meet at 23rd Street and Oakley Avenue. It will parade on Western Avenue and Western Boulevard to McKinley Park. It will be led by two bands.</p>
   <p>(6) We have had no reports from the South Chicago, the Englewood, the Atlantic, and the Cicero colonies at the time of writing this.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1132.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The societies are preparing beautifully decorated floats and other decorations. All of the Lithuanians, especially those with automobiles, are invited to participate in the parade. There will be no charge to enter the Park. Those marching with the societies will be given preference and will get the better seats in the hall.</p>
   <p>Socialists Withdraw</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists of Chicago have apparently decided to separate from the other Lithuanians of Chicago. They will not participate in this demonstration, but will have their own mass meeting in the West Side Auditorium. They do not mention the name of their party, but have rented the Auditorium in the name of the Lithuanian Workers' Council and are inviting the "progressive" Lithuanian societies and individuals.</p>
   <p>It is bad that our Socialists separate themselves from other Lithuanians even on this day. We have not heard of the Socialists of any other nation doing so.</p>
