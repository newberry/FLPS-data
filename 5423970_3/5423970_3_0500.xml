<title level="a">A CONFERENCE OF LITHUANIANS AND AMERICANS</title></bibl>

   <p>The Lithuanians, and how Americans can become better acquainted with them, were discussed at a conference held at the Chicago School of Civics on December 11. Several speeches were made, and we shall give a few excerpts from them.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. L. Graiciunas spoke on Lithuanian immigration during the twenty-five-year period prior to 1914. "The majority of Lithuanian immigrants," said Dr. Graiciunas, "were common laborers, unschooled but ambitious men and women who did not thirst for great riches but who were willing to start at the bottom in order to reach the top through their own efforts.</p>
   <p>"They came to America with the hope of establishing their homes here, determined to accept the responsibilities of citizenship. That they participated in American public life is proved by their industrial history, the enlistment of their young men in the army, and their purchase of Liberty bonds. After <pb facs="5423970_3_0501.jpg" n="2"/>the President's proclamation that small nations would no longer be ignored, the Lithuanians wholeheartedly offered their bodies and souls to America.</p>
   <p>"The Lithuanians have not been satisfied with their existence in America. They have not been admitted to the better occupations, but have been offered only the most common unskilled jobs, at which it was difficult to earn a living. They have been forced to live in such areas as the Stockyards district, where the houses are not even fit for dogs. They have been exploited. Because of their ignorance of the English language, the higher standard of living of the Americans has been unknown to them. Because they have been unable to accustom themselves to the new conditions, they have suffered greatly. The children's bureau of Waterbury has revealed that seventy-five per cent of the Lithuanian infants die during their first year. That is not the case in Lithuania. This proves that the conditions under which Lithuanians live here are horrible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0502.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Hitherto, the people who offered to instruct and guide the Lithuanians have known very little about the lives and traditions of the Lithuanians. It was first demanded of the immigrants that they learn the [English] language. There are many other things which the immigrants ought to learn before they learn the language, in order to become fit members of this nation."</p>
   <p>Attorney F. P. Bradchulis spoke on the education of adult immigrants, and turned his attention to the public schools. These schools have given special consideration to the immigrants for a long time, but, from a practical point of view, the immigrants have derived little benefit from them. "We must devise better methods," said Bradchulis, "to interest the immigrants in these schools." According to the speaker, posters advertising these schools in the languages of the immigrants should be distributed at the beginning of each school year, and at intervals of a few months.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Satkauskas spoke on the activities of the Lithuanian Women's Enlightenment Society, which does much in the way of educating the immigrants. This <pb facs="5423970_3_0503.jpg" n="4"/>group sponsors classes for women which are better attended than the public school classes, since the women feel more at home in the former. The Society has about one hundred members.</p>
   <p>The greatest barrier to the continuation of the work begun by the women is lack of funds. They have no money to pay teachers. However, this year they are planning to hire a teacher who speaks both English and Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Jurgelionis pointed out the danger of attempting to force an immigrant to learn the English language and become a citizen. Basing their interpretations on what happened in Europe, Mrs. Jurgelionis said, they are afraid that Americanization is the same kind of process as Russification or Germanization was over there. They are not yet able to distinguish government regulations from the actions of individual politicians.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0504.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Unfortunately, those who are supposed to represent the government have made a practice of threatening the immigrants: "You must learn English and become a citizen, and if you do not, you will be deported." According to Mrs. Jurgelionis, such threats achieve nothing in the task of making good citizens of the immigrants.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Kiras sketched the history of the Lithuanian Day Nursery. The nursery was needed because, in the Stockyards district, Mrs. Kiras had found many mothers who were forced to leave their children at home alone when they went to work. The nursery [she said] should be supervised by Lithuanian women. The nursery is closed at this time because of lack of funds.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zimontas spoke of the need for an institution in which homeless Lithuanian girls could live. Having lived in the Stockyards district for many years, Mrs. Zimontas said she had seen many unpleasant incidents involving girls who had come from Europe. Having nobody to turn to, such girls are sometimes <pb facs="5423970_3_0505.jpg" n="6"/>forced to marry undesirable men. There have been many cases where the man "orders" a girl from Europe, and sends her a steamship ticket, with the understanding that she must marry him. Such marriages often prove unfortunate, Mrs. Zimontas said. There should be some regulation which would make it possible for a girl to avoid such a marriage.</p>
   <p>Dr. Susannah Slakis urged the Americans to acquaint themselves with the immigrants' way of living in Europe, their customs, traditions, and hygienic practice. The transition from country life to city life has adversely affected their health in this country. They arrive here strong and robust, and immediately begin to decline in health. The effects [of this transition] would be considerably mitigated if it were not demanded of the immigrants that they change their habits, and if they were allowed merely to improve on these habits.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0506.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Mr. Davis asked whether there were any nurses among the Lithuanians in Chicago. Dr. Slakis and Dr. Graicunas replied that ten Lithuanian girls have either already completed their studies or will complete them shortly.</p>
   <p>This was a conference of Americans and Lithuanians. The Lithuanians spoke, and the Americans listened in order to become better acquainted with the Lithuanians and their way of living.</p>
