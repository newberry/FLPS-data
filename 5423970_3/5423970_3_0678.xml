   <p>Here is a verbatim extract from a letter received recently by Direct Echoes:</p>
   <p>"Interest and enthusiasm in the club has been lagging. The club still exists, but who knows whether or not interest in it may be revived at a later date. For the present kindly forget that we exist."</p>
   <p>Such statements have been heard from other club leaders too. Why? Learn the reasons at our get-together to be held Friday evening, October 3, at 8 o'clock. Just write to Direct Echoes for further particulars, and we shall be very happy to receive representatives from your club as our guests at this get-together.</p>

   <p>It sounds incredible that once active clubs can become "dull" and "lifeless," but it is a reality and a more and more frequent occurrence. We know this will be an interesting and a worthwhile topic for discussion at this get-together. We are confident that some constructive suggestions will be made and important decisions reached because we are expecting representatives from the leading Lithuanian young people's clubs in Chicago, and also some well-known club leaders who have had experience with clubs in a similar situation.</p>
   <p>Let us hear from other clubs, composed of young folks, so that the meeting may be of mutual benefit to all.</p>
