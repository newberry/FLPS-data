   <p>John Liutkauskas made his last appearance as a speaker in Chicago at a mass meeting held in Meldazis Hall last Monday night, December 16. Mr. Liutkauskas left for Pittsburgh that same evening.</p>
   <p>According to the program prepared by the West-Siders, Mr. Liutkauskas was the first speaker. He devoted much time to explaining the declaration written by Lithuanian-Americans, and signed by members of both Lithuanian councils in New York. This declaration defines the foundations upon which an independent Lithuanian state must be built.</p>
   <p>The declaration, according to the speaker, will soon be sent to Vilna in order that the ideas of the Lithuanians of Europe and the Lithuanians of America may be reconciled. The declaration, it can be said, is the foundation for the constitution of Lithuania.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Liutkauskas then spoke about the "fruits of Polish culture," the feudal system. Here the speaker painted very realistically the horrors suffered by the Lithuanians in their services to the Poles under the feudal system. "Our old men," he said, "remember even today how the Poles hunted them instead of partridges in the fields of Lithuania."</p>
   <p>Then the speaker related how the Poles are today carrying on intrigues among the powerful governments of the world in order that Lithuania would one more fall into their hands, so that they could again plow and harrow with Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Mr. Liutkauskas then revealed how the Lithuanian-American Council in Washington and New York is fighting the Polish intrigues, which are designed to deny independence to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>He sketched the Lithuanians' difficult political predicament, and related how much had been accomplished in a short time, and what yet remains to be done in <pb facs="5423970_3_0133.jpg" n="3"/>order that Lithuania may gain her independence.</p>
   <p>I have heard Mr. Liutkauskas' speeches in other states, but this was really a fiery address. Those who heard the speech will undoubtedly remember it for a long time.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Liutkauskas concluded, Mr. John Bagdziunas urged those present to donate liberally to Lithuania's cause. Mr. Brusokas, the finest Lithuanian comedian of Chicago, also participated in the program. As he concluded his remarks, Mr. Bagdziunas announced that Brusokas said that he would be too ashamed to continue living on the West Side if the West-Siders refused to donate now. He threatened to move, Bagdziunas added. The audience chuckled.</p>
   <p>Dr. K. Drangelis urged the West-Siders not to allow themselves to be outdone by the Bridgeporters. He reminded the audience the Poles had already taken Brest Litovsk and were approaching Minsk and Vilna. Therefore, he said, we must make donations in order that the danger which threatens Lithuania may be averted.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0134.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Variety was added to the program by the Zauris Sisters, who sang a duet and the Lithuanian anthem. Miss G. Bagdziunas played the Lithuanian and American anthems on the piano.</p>
   <p>Vincas Brusokas, the comedian, and Miss Virbickas presented an original skit, "The Kaiser Reaches for the Bacon", written by Brusokas. It was well acted. They then sang a duet which depicted the present plight of the farmers in Lithuania. In truth, it would be sad for the West-Siders if Brusokas did move out of their colony, for he is a natural comedian who can make any audience laugh.</p>
   <p>To get the collection of donations off to a flying start, Brusokas donated ten dollars. Stanley Paurazas, an American soldier who has recently returned from the army, added five dollars to a thirty-five-dollar donation he had made before. Mrs. Petronella Petruskevicius, the wife of an army officer who is now in France, donated ten dollars. She said she would increase her donation when she has more money.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0135.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Bucas, Mr. Kizas, Mr. Saunoras, and Mrs. Bagdziunas donated a hundred dollars each. William Duoba and Joseph Juzenas each donated fifty dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds. Attorney Kucinskas and Mr. Krumas donated twenty dollars each.</p>
   <p>Then donations of ten dollars, five dollars, and smaller amounts began to pour in so fast that all the names could not be written down. The names of all donors will of course, be announced by the committee. About one thousand dollars was collected.</p>
   <p>There were between three and four hundred people present at this meeting.</p>
   <p>Besides the sum collected that night, the West-Siders also have about two thousand dollars which they collected earlier. It seems, therefore, that the West-Siders are not lagging behind in this holy work of freeing Lithuania.</p>
