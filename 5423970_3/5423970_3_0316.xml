<title level="a">CHICAGO WOMEN COLLECT CLOTHES FOR WAR VICTIMS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Mrs. Sliupas (wife of Dr. John Sliupas) recently suggested that Lithuanian-Americans collect clothing for their suffering brothers and sisters in Lithuania. This suggestion was approved by the women's lodge (Branch 208) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The women have already started collecting clothing. Two storage stations for the clothing have been established: one at 3252 South Halsted Street, with Mrs. Zimontas in charge; and the other at 4605 South Hermitage Avenue, with Mrs. Judeikis in charge. From these stations the clothing will be sent to a central station for ultimate shipment to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The two storage stations mentioned above serve only the Bridgeport and Town of Lake districts. The women stated that they would like to see similar stations set up in other Chicago Lithuanian districts. Those who desire information or assistance in establishing such stations are advised to get in touch with Mrs. Zimontas.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0317.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is believed that Chicago, the leading Lithuanian-American colony, will also lead in the quantity of clothing collected. An effort will be made to interest other Chicago Lithuanian women's organizations in this work.</p>
