   <p>The Pioneer Fire Insurance Company of America is being organized by Lithuanians and other immigrant groups. It has an authorized capital of two hundred thousand dollars and reserves of two hundred thousand dollars. Its original shares of stock are valued at forty dollars each.</p>
   <p>Among its organizers we find the names of these Lithuanians: Joseph C. Wolon, John B. Brenza, John M. Tananevicz, Anthony Brozis, Dr. C. Z. Vezel, Julius C. Brenza and others.</p>
   <p>This state is one of the wealthiest, and all kinds of insurance companies are realizing a good profit here.</p>
   <p>During 1914 the total income of insurance companies in Illinois was $105,669,891, of which $14,784,339--almost fourteen per cent--was profit.</p>
   <p>In 1914 several insurance companies paid as much as forty per cent to their <pb facs="5423970_3_0052.jpg" n="2"/>stockholders. Among these were Fire Association of Philadelphia, Hartford of Hartford, Home of New York, and Globe and Rutgers of New York.</p>
   <p>This new company is being incorporated in the State of Illinois and is under the supervision of the State. It has an opportunity to do a wonderful business among the many immigrants in Chicago.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, capital invested in this company can bring a good profit. It would be worth their while for immigrants to participate in this business venture.</p>
