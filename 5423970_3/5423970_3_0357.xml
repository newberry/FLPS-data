   <p>p.4... The 137th chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League presented a theatrical play and program for the benefit of war refugees in Lithuania, Jan. 10, at 158 E. 107th Street, Roseland, Ill. The affair was a great success and gave a fairly good profit.</p>
   <p>A large audience was entertained with a one act comedy entitled "One of Us Must Get Married:" Although the actors were amateurs, nevertheless, they gave an excellent performance.</p>
   <p>After the play an address on the war situation in Lithuania was delivered by Dr. K. Drangelis. Another speaker explained the various mutual-aid features of the Lithuanian Alliance of America and urged people to join that organization.</p>
   <p>One of the speakers suggested that a collection be made among the audience for relief of war refugees in Lithuania. Miss E. Baranauskas, Miss A.Kavoliunas <pb facs="5423970_3_0358.jpg" n="2"/>Miss F. Bruskas and Mrs. Z.Klibas passed through the audience and collected a total of $17.65.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with songs by the Ruta Choir, lead by J. Lankelis, and by the Aidas Choir of the Lithuanian Woman's Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Bacevicius, head of the program committee, wishes to thank all those who participated in the program and those who attended the entertainment.</p>
