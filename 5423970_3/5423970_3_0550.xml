  <body>
   <p>The Lithuanian colony in the western section of Chicago, known as the Grant Works (Cicero, Illinois) colony has one society, one club, and nineteen Lithuanian business establishments. The following four Lithuanians of this colony hold municipal offices: John Bielauskis, judge; Mr. Endziulis, policeman; Mr. Griusius, constable; Louis Mikutis, fireman.</p>
   <p>The names of the Lithuanian organizations are: Lovers of Lithuania Society, a non-Catholic mutual aid society; and the Republican Club.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian business establishments include: three food stores, two drug stores, one bakery shop, one photographic studio, one blacksmith shop, one dairy store, and ten saloons. [Editor's note: The names of the owners appear in the article.]</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians in this colony live mostly around 14th Street, between 48th and 52nd Avenues. The colony can be reached from Chicago by the 12th Street streetcars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0551.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Most of the Lithuanian workers are employed in the local foundry, in the Western Electric Company, and in the American Spiral Pipe Works.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians in this colony are a firmly established group, and appear to be rather wealthy. Most of them are property owners. The vicinity is a pleasant place to live in, because the air is pure and healthful. The entire locality is very clean and beautiful.</p>
