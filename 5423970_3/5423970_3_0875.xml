<title level="a">AUSRA SOCIETY TO GIVE FOUR LECTURES</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Ausra Society has completed plans and arrangements to give four lectures this fall for the Lithuanians of Chicago. The purpose of these lectures, as we all know, is to promote the intellectual development of our people.</p>
   <p>The Ausra Society, a student's aid and general educational society, has been giving lectures to the Lithuanians of Chicago during the past two years. An effort is always being made to secure the most educated Lithuanians to deliver the lectures. There can be no doubt that our people have received much benefit from these lectures, because they have dealt with the most important matters pertaining to the daily life of Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>It is not true that the Ausra Society is interested in promoting partisan ideals, as had been stated by a member in an article published in the Katalikas (The Catholic, a weekly Lithuanian newspaper published in Chicago). The society is interested only in the welfare and intellectual development of our people and is working only in that direction. All Lithuanians, regardless of political or religious affiliations <pb facs="5423970_3_0876.jpg" n="2"/>, are accepted into the membership of the society. A priest, a lawyer, a socialist, or even an anarchist can become a member of the society providing he or she pledge to adhere to the principles of the society: to promote the welfare and intellectual uplift of our people, and to refrain from all efforts to divide our people into partisan and religious factions.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the aims of the Ausra Society, arrangements have been made to give the following four lectures this fall:</p>
   <p>1) "The Value of Education," to be delivered by J. J. Gertmanavicius, Nov. 15, at the University Settlement Hall, 4630 Gross Ave. He will review in a general manner all the branches of learning.</p>
   <p>2) "Is Society Necessary to Mankind?", to be delivered by A. Zagaras, Nov. 29, at the University Settlement Hall, 4630 Gross Ave.</p>
   <p>3) "The Moral Code of Anarchism," according to the writings of Kropotkin, to <pb facs="5423970_3_0877.jpg" n="3"/>be delivered by J. Laukis, Dec. 13, at the Ridikas Hall, on Illinois St., in the rear of the Lietuva building (3252 So. Halsted St.)</p>
   <p>4) "Ethical Culture," to be delivered by J. Sernas (Joseph Adomaitis), Dec. 27, also at the Ridikas Hall, on Illinois St.</p>
