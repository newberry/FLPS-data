   <p>Our weakness comes from our unwillingness to organize all the Lithuanian energy for one national cause. Partisan views and lack of confidence do not permit us to work all together, and for this reason we are separated into various small groups working against each other's interests. When one organization is organized for a certain cause, others are immediately organized for a different cause in order to harm the existing organization, even though its purpose is similar to theirs. Such separate organizations cannot accomplish much. Why cannot we organize one organization of the various small clusters? Organized we could accomplish larger deeds than separated as we are at present.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society, in its by-laws, states that its purpose is to help the Lithuanian young students who are attending <pb facs="5423970_3_0997.jpg" n="2"/>school, but up to the present time the society has accomplished nothing in that matter. There is a society, Motinele (Little Mother), but its leaders made this society one for clericals only. They do not want to make it one for the general public.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there was organized the Aurora Society, having as its purpose to help the Lithuanian students who are studying secular courses. The Svaigzde (Star) announced without any reason that the Aurora Society is against the Catholic faith. Since theology does not teach civil science, theology students are excluded from (receiving aid) from the society. The organizer of the Aurora Society did not have in mind to go against religion. The Aurora Society was organized because there was no organization to help students of secular subjects. At present the Lovers of the Fatherland Society says that it will also help secular students. Therefore, there will be two secular organizations having the same purpose. Both <pb facs="5423970_3_0998.jpg" n="3"/>organizations are weak and cannot accomplish much. Is there not a way to make arrangements between these two societies so that they will not act against each other? There is a way if the Aurora Society would join the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, or vice versa. We are asking the Lithuanian public to decide this problem.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society has $40 in its budget, and its membership is not increasing as it was expected. By having two societies with the same purpose, each will have too small a budget, and for this reason it will not be able to accomplish the desired results. There will be no results unless the Lithuanians understand the benefit of secular science to the public.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that in Europe there exists a similar society, Ziburelis(Little Light). It would be much better if these three societies organize into one society. They could accomplish much more in America <pb facs="5423970_3_0999.jpg" n="4"/>and in Europe for the benefit of the Lithuanian students taking civil and natural science.</p>
