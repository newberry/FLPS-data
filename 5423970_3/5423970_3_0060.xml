   <p>The Children's Day Nursery, 829 West 33rd Place, which was organized several years ago by a group of prominent Chicago Lithuanian women, is enjoying very good success, and is rendering a very important service to the community. This is evident from the following report of the activities of the Nursery for the past nine months.</p>
   <p>In that period, the Nursery had a total income of $1,067.49 from the following sources: various benefit programs $473.79; dues from members, $144.20; donations, $413.40; all other sources, $36.40.</p>
   <p>Expenses for the period amounted to $1,067.49, spent for the following purposes: rent, $200; salaries of employees, $502; heat and light, $61.14; milk, $67.50; food for the children, $233.81.</p>
   <p>A total of 2,692 children were cared for by the Nursery during the period.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0061.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>About one hundred of these were non-Lithuanians; the rest were children of poor Lithuanians. The Nursery was established by the women's lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The members who now maintain and support this institution consist of fifty-one Lithuanians and forty non-Lithuanians. Lithuanians should take a greater interest in this institution, as it is rendering a very useful and important service to our people.</p>
   <p>The newly elected officers of the Nursery are as follows: Dr. A. J. Zimontas, president; Michael Kiras, vice-president; Mrs. Frank Jerome, treasurer; Mrs. Damijonaitis, secretary; Mrs. Belle Yeadon, financial secretary.</p>
   <p>So far, the largest donors to the institution have been the Lithuanian Alliance of America and Julius Rosenwald; they have contributed one hundred dollars each. The institution is maintained solely by donations; therefore, good-hearted Lithuanians are asked to assist in maintaining this very useful institution by making donations.</p>
