  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian Council and the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies wish to thank everyone who participated in the mass meetings sponsored by these two groups on Washington's Birthday. We wish to express our gratitude to the large audiences, the speakers, singers, musicians, sponsors, and to all who, in one way or another, aided in the promotion of these meetings. We cannot forego this opportunity to express our gratitude to the enthusiastic throng which made such a wonderful showing at Milda Hall. These people made it very apparent that they are fighting for freedom of speech and assembly. Men, be even braver!</p>
   <p>It must be pointed out here that the speeches were heard by more than two thousand people. [Translator's note: Seven mass meetings were sponsored, <pb facs="5423970_3_1139.jpg" n="2"/>each one in a different Chicago Lithuanian community.] They became better acquainted with the friend and champion of liberty, George Washington, who later became the first president of the world's greatest republic, which he himself created.</p>
   <p>With the help of these two thousand people the Lithuanians of Chicago will soon know of Washington and his deeds. This will undoubtedly be the Lithuanians' best weapon in their fight for Lithuania's freedom, Lithuania's republic.</p>
   <p>Therefore, men, be brave!</p>
