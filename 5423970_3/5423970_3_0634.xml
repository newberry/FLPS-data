   <p>Lithuanians in Chicago: According to our statistics there are close to 4,000 Lithuanians in Chicago. Lithuanians began to reside in Chicago about thirty years ago. In the beginning there were very few of them, just in the last few years the number of Lithuanians increased. Today there are seven societies:</p>
   <p>1. The oldest society is Sw. Kazimieraus Karalaiczio (St. Casimir, the Prince) established in the year of 1885.</p>
   <p>2. Kunigaikszio Gedemino (Duke Gedemin) established in 1891</p>
   <p>3. Apveizdos Dievo (Province of God) established in 1892</p>
   <p>4. Szwento Jurgio (Saint George) 1892</p>
   <p>5. Cluster of Lithuanians Science Society in 1892.</p>
   <p>6. Theatrical Society in 1892.</p>
   <p>Also in this year Lithuanians organized a political club which will be a great benefit to Lithuanians. It seems that the Lithuanians of Chicago will not yield to other cities where Lithuanians are more numerous.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0635.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In a short time there will be a Lithuanian Church in Chicago. The lot for the church is bought, also a frame church is bought already soon to be moved on the lot. The church for the Chicago Lithuanians will be an inexpressible benefit, not only for spiritual need, but for national as well, many will be converted back to Lithuanians. We know that there are many Lithuanians in Chicago that do not want to call themselves Lithuanians. The church, by proclaiming the word of God in our native language, will bring many to the right road, that is, it will make good Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>All wanton persons, strayers, none will find the road to come back to their own homes.</p>
   <p>The news is coming from the members of societies, that all Lithuanians - all societies are willing to make union, in order that solidarity and love would reign among Lithuanians, that among all Lithuanians, the ideal of Lithuanianism would prevail.</p>
   <p>We hope, that the spiritual leader of our parish will not reject this plan, will come to help us by urging and awakening our brothers.</p>
