   <p>J. J. Paurenas, escaped revolutionist from Russia, was freed on March 30, by United States Commissioner Hitchkock on the grounds that his offense against the Russian government was political and not criminal.</p>
   <p>Paurenas, a Latvian, was arrested and imprisoned in New York on January 8, 1908, at the request of the Russian government. The latter demanded his surrender as a bandit and a murderer, in accordance with the terms of a treaty which had been concluded several years ago between Russia and the United States.</p>
   <p>A Chicago Lithuanian committee acted as part of a nation-wide campaign <pb facs="5423970_3_0117.jpg" n="2"/>to free Paurenas by holding mass meetings, gathering signatures to petitions, and collecting funds for his legal defense. The committee consisted of the following: Anthony Kvedaras, chairman; J. Keturakis, treasurer; S. Darguzis, secretary. Before liquidating, the committee transferred $3.16, which still remained in the treasury, to J. O. Sirvydas, treasurer of the Revolutionary Aid Committee of the Lithuanian Socialist League.</p>
