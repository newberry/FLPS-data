   <p>Several times articles have been written about the "Aurora" Society's lectures which were given last winter. To all these lectures the admission was ten cents. The net profit was $29.70 for the "Aurora" students' fund. The first lecture was given by Dr. J. Kulis. To make the lecture clearer, Dr. Kulis showed illustrated pictures. These pictures cost $8.00, but Dr. Kulis paid for them from his own pocket. The financial condition of the "Aurora" Society is still weak; it will be too bad for the Lithuanian students if the "Aurora" Society does not get help from the Lithuanian public.</p>
   <p>American Lithuanians! Do we have enough educated men? We see that we do not have them. It is known that where we see more educated men the workers there have better living conditions. We have neglected to help our poor students because our attention was turned to the revolution in Russia. At present the revolution has slowed down; the revolutionary intelligensia have a little freedom to go to the people; and step by step, the people in Russia will gain complete freedom.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0915.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, our attention again must be brought to the poor Lithuanian students cause. We must help them in order to have the Lithuanian intelligensia strong. These students after their graduation, will deliver lectures, write articles and books for our benefit.</p>
