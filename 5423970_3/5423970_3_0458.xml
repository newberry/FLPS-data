   <p>After long delays the execution of Hans Schmidt, a Roman Catholic priest who in 1913 killed his paramour, Anna Aumueler, took place yesterday. According to the laws of New York, the execution of the priest is entirely legal, since the law demands the death penalty for murder. Father Schmidt undoubtedly was guilty, and the law could make no exception of his case. But has the priest's death righted the wrong which he committed? Does it give the public any assurance that the number of such crimes will be reduced in the future?</p>
   <p>It would be possible to justify the execution of Schmidt in the electric chair only if we had positive answers to these questions. Unless these answers are provided, his execution has no meaning. It has merely added a second, albeit legal, murder to the first. It has added a second wrong to the first.</p>
   <p>It is clear that the punishment meted out to Father Schmidt will not rectify <pb facs="5423970_3_0459.jpg" n="2"/>the evil wrought by his hand. A person who has given the matter some thought will hardly agree that this penalty of death will, at the very least, contribute to diminishing the number of such crimes. The execution of criminals does not remove the conditions which breed them, and as long as those conditions remain, so long will they continue to bear their evil fruit.</p>
   <p>Of course, environment is not the sole factor in the creation of criminals; the will of the person is also a contributing factor. Therefore, punishment, when regarded as a thing which affects a person's will (by invoking fear to prevent him from committing a forbidden deed), may seem to be an important means for lessening the number of crimes.</p>
   <p>But punishment exerts yet another influence. It not only instills people with fear, but also makes them more cruel. This is especially true in the case of a punishment which recurs often or is extraordinarily harsh. It has been proved long ago that the sight of an execution arouses the lowest instinct of the people. For that reason, criminals are today seldom executed publicly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0460.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>However, even today the demoralizing influence of death penalties reach the masses, for detailed descriptions of them are published in newspapers read by millions of people.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that the people of the twentieth century cannot find a different, more certain, and more humane manner of fighting crime?</p>
