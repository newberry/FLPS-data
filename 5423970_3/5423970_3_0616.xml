   <p>On August 25th the Lithuanian Independent Club held its meeting. After the meeting some of the members made a collection. They collected $1.05 for the revolutionary movement in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Even though this club has existed only three years and its activity is not known much, it has contributed more than any other club of Chicago to the national cause and the revolutionary movement.</p>
   <p>The most important aim of this club is to help a new member become a citizen if he is not one. The second aim is to enlighten its members.</p>
   <p>The club holds two meetings per month. One meeting is for the club's affairs, the other for education. At the second meetings lectures are given on science, instructions in the English language, <pb facs="5423970_3_0617.jpg" n="2"/>arithmetic, etc. The club's aim is to enlighten its members, no other club or society does such educational work.</p>
   <p>This club during the three winter months, for three evenings a week, has classes and gave instruction on various political and scientific problems without any charge to its members. All the Lithuanians are invited to join this club.</p>
