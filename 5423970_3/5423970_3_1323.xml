   <p>July 7, at Lemont's summer resort, Sodus, Michigan, the Chicago Lithuanian Organists' Association had their convention. At the convention the following members were elected as officers for the coming year: President, Mr. V. Dauksa; vice-president, V. Nickus; secretary, B. Janusauskas; treasurer, V. Dauksa; director of music, A. Pocius; librarian, B. Janususkas; examination committee: A. Pocius, V. Dauksa and L. Vasauskas; advisory committee: A. Lemontas, K. Mikalauskas, S. Sukodolskis, and S. Simanavicia.</p>
   <p>They decided first to hold meetings twice a month in order to explain the theory of music and singing; and second, to collect, systematize and publish a book of Lithuanian folk songs, and for that purpose, every organist at this convention donated $5.00 per member; third to require every new member, who wants to join the organization, to pass an examination; fourth to refuse to play popular music during the divine service in the church.</p>

   <p>Lectures were delivered on these subjects: (1) Palestine and its contribution to the field of music; and (2) the proper way to direct the choir.</p>
   <p>During the convention, the organists gave two concerts. The stars of these two concerts were: Miss Anna Klimaviciute, Mrs. M. Janusauskiene, and Mr. and Mrs. Brumlik. Many people were present at both concerts.</p>
