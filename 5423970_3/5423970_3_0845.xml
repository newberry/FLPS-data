   <p>Members of the Truth Lovers Society celebrated the twelfth anniversary of their organization on Sunday afternoon, September 26, at Freiheit Turner hall, 3417 South Halsted Street. The program consisted of orations, music, and dancing.</p>
   <p>The main speakers were: Attorney F. P. Bradchulis, K. B. Balutis, J. Chmielauskas, and Attorney L. S. Haigler.</p>
   <p>Mr. Balutis explained in detail about the great value and importance of truth. Mr. Chmielauskas related the complete history of the organization. Attorney Bradchulis described the demoralizing effect upon the Lithuanian people which results from holding our organization meetings in saloon halls. He urged our people to hold their organization meetings in the hall of the Lithuanian <pb facs="5423970_3_0846.jpg" n="2"/>Community Center, which will be opened to the Lithuanian public on October 2, at 3149 South Halsted Street. Attorney Haigler, who is not a Lithuanian, spoke in English. Among other things, he advised Lithuanian parents to converse with their children in Lithuanian, and to preserve Lithuanian traditions in America.</p>
   <p>An interesting musical program entertained the audience during intermission. The Vytautas Orchestra played several numbers. The two church choirs of St. George's parish, led by B. Janusauskas, sang beautiful Lithuanian songs, including the Lithuanian national anthem. The most popular song numbers were: "Pasakyk, Lietuva" (Speak, Lithuania); "Sudiev Kvietkeli" (Farewell Little Flower); "Sveiki Broliai Dainininkai" (Hail Brother Singers); and "Tu Esi Kaip Kvietkele" (You are like a Flower).</p>
   <p>A mixed chorus, composed of the two above mentioned choirs, ended the program of the day with the following songs: "Lietuva, Tu Brangi Zeme" (The Dear Land of Lithuania); "Saulele Raudona, Vakaras Netoli" (The Sun is Crimson, Evening <pb facs="5423970_3_0847.jpg" n="3"/>is Approaching); and "Noriu Miego" (I Want to Sleep). The program ended at 7 P. M.</p>
