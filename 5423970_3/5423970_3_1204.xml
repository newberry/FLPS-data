   <p>Chicago, November 24, 1892, eight o'clock in the evening the local L. M. D. celebrated the anniversary of the death of S. Daukantas, the philologist and magister of the University of Vilno. The meeting was held at Mr. Szimkiewicia's Hall, 811 South Halsted St. J. Szimkiewiczia was elected chairman of the meeting. The speakers of the evening were Mr. Bradczulis and Masionis.</p>
   <p>P. Masionis spoke about the life of S. Daukantas, and why we must respect our great men. P. Kazlauskas spoke about Polanized Lithuanians and the beauty of our own language. P. Szimkiewicze and Pacewicze spoke about the great men of Lithuania. The most important speaker was Mr. Bradczulis.</p>
   <p>He spoke that our ancestors, more than 1,000 years B. C. came to Europe from Asia. He said, according to philologists, archeologists and historians, that in Central Asia, in the province of Hindustan, they discover a Sanscrit nation which is recognized as the oldest nation, that the Lithuanian language has the closest resemblance to the Sanscrit language. That our ancestors moved north, to improve their economical conditions.</p>
   <p>We find relics of Lithuanians in Greece. There are many names of people and places showing a close resemblance to Lithuanian names. We also find many Lithuanian names in Bulgaria. There are many cuts on stones of the Lithuanian emblem of the knight. There are many places and rivers with Lithuanian names. At that time Lithuanians used the Ruthenian alphabet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1205.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The history of Lithuanians was written for us by the great historian and writer S. Daukantas.</p>
   <p>That many Lithuanian writers wrote in other languages, especially in Polish. Lithuanian writers made Polish literature world famous.</p>
   <p>In this assembly tonight we are proud to remember our great benefactor in history and literature, Simonas Daukantas.</p>
