  <body>
   <p>On October 24th, in the evening, the Aurora Society called a meeting at Azukas Hall, 3301 Auburn Avenue, of the eighteen Chicago Lithuanian societies. The delegates came from a few of the Chicago Lithuanian societies to talk over how to make better arrangements for the help of the young Lithuanian students who are striving for a higher education.</p>
   <p>The invitations were sent to eighteen societies, but delegates came from only eight, namely, from the Simonas Daukantas Society, the delegates K. Jokubaitis and Bijanskas; The Enlightenment of Brothers Society, Jonas Globis, K. Lamasauskas and A. Braliauskas; The Sons of Lithuania, J. Sterbis and Vabalinskas; The Young American Lithuanian Pleasure Club, J. Bagdziunas and A. Zachareviczia; The Liberty Society, Norvaisa; The Lithuanian Alliance Branch, M. Damijonaitis and J. Jonaitis; The Zigmontas Society, A. Zemaitis and A. Petravicia; The Truth Lovers Society, K. Jarnauskas.</p>

   <p>At this meeting nothing concrete was decided, because the delegates had no instructions from their societies. It was discussed in what way to help the Aurora Society. All the delegates acknowledged the benefit of the Aurora Society, whose purpose is to help the young Lithuanian students complete their education in order to have the Lithuanian intelligentsia to work for the national cause.</p>
   <p>It was proposed either to charge the society members 25 cents per year or to have collections at every meeting of the societies, and to give the money to the Aurora society. These propositions will be submitted by the delegates to their societies. They will announce their decision.</p>
   <p>At this meeting for the benefit of the Aurora Society, $2.75 was collected.</p>
