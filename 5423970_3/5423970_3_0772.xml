   <p>Last Sunday, The Glorious Name of Lithuanians Society held its fifth annual celebration, at Slavie Hall, Town of Lake. The celebration was grand and beautiful. The following societies participated in a body: Guards of the Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania (1st division of cavalrymen); Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania Choir, No. 1; St. Vincent, St. Stanislovas, St. Joseph, and Holy Cross Societies; Daumantas Society, Sons of Lithuania Society, No. 1; the Union of Brother-Lithuanians Society, No. 1, and Dr. V. Kudirka Theatrical and Mutual Benefit Club.</p>
   <p>The line of march started from Davis Square Park; then all of the marching societies went to the Slavie Hall where speeches, declamations and songs were presented. The speaker was Theodore Kucinskas. The lecture was splendid. He spoke of historical events in Lithuania. Then Miss Lukamskaite read a few good poems; the Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania Choir, directed by Mr. A. Sarpalius, sang several songs beautifully, and for such melodious singing, <pb facs="5423970_3_0773.jpg" n="2"/>was presented with an exquisite bouquet of flowers. Everything was fine except the disorderly conduct of the audience, especially during the lecture, which was a really excellent speech. As a rule, the people of the Town of Lake are always disorderly at lectures, concerts or theatrical performances. In other Lithuanian communities in this city, Lithuanians do not act as disorderly as do the Lithuanians of the Town of Lake. It is time that the Lithuanians of this Community began to behave like cultured people.</p>
