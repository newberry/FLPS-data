   <p>The Aurora Gates parish began to organize in 1904. While it was being organized, Lithuanian priests came to the St.Pious Irish Church, delivered sermons and preached in Lithuanian. The church was built in 1906. The first priest was K. Ambrozaitis, from Kenosha, Wis., who had organized a Polish parish there. Rev. K. Ambrozaitis was the priest in this parish from 1906 to 1915.</p>
   <p>Rev. F. Sarafinas from 1915 to 1918.</p>
   <p>Rev. F. Meskauskas from 1918 to 1919.</p>
