   <p>p.5..........Miss M. Darzinskas bid farewell to the old year and greeted the new one at her home with a banquet to which she had invited many friends and acquaintances.</p>
   <p>While the guests were having a good time at the table, comrade Kazys Schultz asked the hostess for permission to speak to the guests. Among other things he said the following:</p>
   <p>"Comrades! We are all enjoying ourselves at this bountiful banquet, and are happily awaiting the New Year. However, some of our comrades are not so fortunate. Many of them are at this very moment suffering and awaiting the New Year locked in jail cells, because they had dared to fight for our welfare and for our rights in this "democratic" America. We can lessen their sad predicament to a certain degree by donating a few cents to the International Labor Defense, which assists political prisoners."</p>

   <p>After comrade Schultz finished his talk a motion was made and carried to take up a collection among the guests. The collection netted $7.00, which was later turned over to the International Labor Defense.</p>
