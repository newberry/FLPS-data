   <p>Last Sunday, Chicago festively commemorated the tenth anniversary of the liberation of the Lithuanian press in Russia. With the aid of other societies, the local chapters of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, which had been preparing for this occasion for a long time, arranged an affair at the Mark White Square Hall in Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>It has been a long time since Chicagoans had such a beautiful affair. About 8 o'clock the roomy hall was already filled with people. Even the aisles along the walls were crowded. It should also be mentioned here that such a select crowd as this seldom assembles at an affair. It was with happiness that one looked at such a good-looking, serious crowd waiting impatiently, but calmly for the speeches to begin.</p>
   <p>Immediately after 8 o'clock Dr. K. Drangelis opened the program with the request that the Lithuanian national anthem be sung. Led by the Birute Chorus, the audience rose and sang it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1158.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program, consisting of speeches, songs, and music, followed. There were three speeches. The first was by Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas who pointed out the worth and importance of the press to general world culture and, especially, to our nation. He thus explained what the Lithuanians had to do without for a long time, and why they were so determined to regain that important cultural weapon. In that manner he also prepared the field for the next speaker, who was the Reverend F. Kemesis, the editor of the Draugas. The title of his speech was "The Lithuanian Press and Its Liberation." Briefly, but concisely, the speaker reviewed the history of the Lithuanian press, from the publication of the first book in 1533 to the year, 1864, when the Lithuanian press was suppressed within Russia's boundaries. He spoke of the Russian plans, the reasons behind them, and of the failure of those plans. He dwelt longer on his recollections of the days when an invisible but courageous battle for the liberation of the press was in progress everywhere: in the towns, the villages, the rectories, and the spiritual seminaries. He did not forget to remind the audience that the spark that kindled the flame was made by Dr. J. Basanavicius in the newspaper, Ausra (Aurora), which he founded. He also gave deserved praise to our Lithuanian women who knew how <pb facs="5423970_3_1159.jpg" n="3"/>to preserve the language of their parents themselves and who knew how to acquaint their children, even secretly, with the Lithuanian elementary schooling.</p>
   <p>The speakers' portion of the program was concluded by B. K. Balutis, the editor of the Lietuva. By means of many and various examples, he emphasized the idea that it is such a foolish thing to forbid anyone to use his inborn language since it is the most important and dearest gift of a nation. He also reminded the audience that having regained that gift we must evaluate it and use it only for good.</p>
   <p>It is noteworthy that all of the speakers avoided all points that might have offended people of different convictions. Contrarily, they all emphasized, with examples, the intelligent unity of the Lithuanians armed with which they regained the right of the press.....</p>
   <p>Between speeches there were songs and music for variety. First of all a few beautiful songs were sung by Mr. Jakutis, a tenor. Mr. Jakutis won the hearts <pb facs="5423970_3_1160.jpg" n="4"/>of the public. He was not willingly allowed off the stage and the public made him sing a few more songs as encores.</p>
   <p>The same happened with the duets of Misses Rudauskas.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Janusauskas, well known and loved no less by Chicagoans, also participated in the program.....</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Pocius also performed a few musical bits and, finally, the Birute Chorus sang three songs.</p>
   <p>Words of gratitude for the arrangement of this beautiful affair must be expressed to the Arrangement Committee which included the following men: Dr. K. Drangelis, Paul B. Baltutis, P. Mulevicia, P. Kurkulis, B. Jakaitis, Miss P. Valskas, B. Lenkauskas, and S. Tananevicia.</p>
