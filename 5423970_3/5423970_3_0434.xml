   <p>Chicago's notorious Bishop, who with the aid of his agents has defrauded many of the Lithuanian people in Chicago, was seized in California.</p>
   <p>This Bishop and his agents have defrauded stock yard working people of four or fire millions dollars. He was arrested before and was released on bonds of $10,000, which he forfeited. For a few years he disappeared. Now he is held at Los Angeles, California. With the Bishop were also arrested a few of his agents, of whom the Bishop's brother-in-law was the chief agent. This brother-in-law of the Bishop was sentenced to fire years in prison and to pay a fine of $2,000. Fire Lithuanians were sentenced as follows: F. Dalkus, from 1 to 5 years in prison; F. Shaputis, Trusocvskis, Kamatas, Venkus (or Venckus), and Charles Stankus, $500 fine each.</p>
   <p>As it is known by many some of the Menshevics were arrested as Bishop's <pb facs="5423970_3_0435.jpg" n="2"/>agents and a certain Vilis was sentenced, but later appealed to a higher court.</p>
   <p>No doubt this Bishop's case will put more light on the action of these swindlers and their whereabouts.</p>
   <p>It looks as if that historic scandal of swindlers will open up again.</p>
