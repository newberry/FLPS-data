   <p>St. Cecilia Society was organized in November 14, 1905, under the name of the Lithuanian Music and Drama Society. They selected this name because it fitted their aim perfectly. The first organizers of this society decided to work only in the music and drama field. The initiation fee was twenty five cents. The monthly fee was ten cents. Music was taught by the St. Michael Parish's organist. Drama was taught by any one of the students who was most talented. The income, which was collected from initiation and monthly fees and dances or concerts given was raised to buy theatrical books, music and other books for their small library. In this way their library grew.</p>
   <p>Thus, the society successfully worked until 1911. Rev. Lukosius perceived that the society didn't have a steadfast Catholic constitution. In 1910, Rev. Lukosius made a motion to make the society a mutual aid society by raising the monthly fees to twenty five cents from which $6 a week would be paid in time of sickness. A constitution was made in accordance with the Roman Catholic Church rules, leaving the same name, "Lithuanian Music and Drama Society," but adding: Under the guardianship of St. "Cecilia."</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1430.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This motion was unanimously adopted on January 3, 1911. Rev. Lukosius, I. Navickas, A. Gerdkiunas and P. Kriksciunes made the constitution and registered it in the State of Illinois as a Mutual Aid Society. The society worked as before, not forgetting her music or drama. They gave two theatricals each year. The chorus also participated in them. They continued this until 1920. From 1920, the society stopped teaching dramatics, as the Lithuanian Knights of Columbus, Branch 5, took up acting. The library which they had from the very beginning they gave to the Federation Society in their vicinity. The books were worth about $200.</p>
   <p>From then on the society looked after the benefits for its members and took part in all tasks for the nation and the church. The society dosen't forget its dead members. Each year they pay holy masses to pray for their souls.</p>
   <p>The society gave to the church about $600.00, to St. Casimir Sisters' Convent $100.00, to Fathers Monks' College $100.00, to Charity about $450.00. The society always <pb facs="5423970_3_1431.jpg" n="3"/>participated in church and public affairs, on which it spent about $150. It bought Lithuanian Liberty Bonds to the amount of $350.00 and donated for Lithuania about $950.</p>
   <p>The society didn't forget her members either. Every year an honorary supper was held for those who hadn't taken any benefit for ten years. At the supper the members were given a gold ring - an honorary symbol.</p>
   <p>They have about 100 members.</p>
