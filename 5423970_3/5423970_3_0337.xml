   <p>The popular Lithuanian Women's Educational Society is active in various fields of endeavor. The Society never fails to assist in every possible way those of its members who are in dire need. Members who are in a critical financial predicament, especially unemployed or sick members with children, are constantly appealing to the Society for assistance. The Society does not have enough funds. Available funds in the treasury are not sufficient to support several families for an indefinite period of time. Nevertheless, the Society utilizes as much money as possible from its treasury for relief purposes. Assistance to individuals usually averages about twenty dollars per person. The Society has already expended a fairly large sum of money for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Collections for relief purposes are made at the meetings of the Society. There is an elected committee to look after such matters. Relief work <pb facs="5423970_3_0338.jpg" n="2"/>is not a small part of the activities of the Society.</p>
   <p>The Society has decided to hold a bazaar for the benefit of its indigent members. The bazaar will be held on March 27 and 28 at Milda Hall, 3138-42 South Halsted Street. Those who sympathize with this humanitarian cause have already donated a large number of valuable articles, which will be raffled off at the bazaar. In addition, a varied and well-prepared program will be presented for the enlightenment and entertainment of those attending.</p>
