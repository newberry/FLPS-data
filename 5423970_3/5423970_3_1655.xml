   <p>The century is ending but it has brought nothing good to us. In the past centuries many nations have been enslaved, but the oppressors have not dared to suppress the language of the common people. Only Russia dared shamelessly to suppress the native language of the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Of course the oppressors are brave when the oppressed have no unity among themselves to demand justice. At the ending of this century we have no unity among us, just fights and discrimination. If we will stop the fights amongst us, and work together for the cause of culture, even the oppressor will stop persecuting us.</p>
   <p>Let us find out who stops the national activity and culture among the Lithuanian people in America. We have built many churches, but nothing <pb facs="5423970_3_1656.jpg" n="2"/>better. Up to the present we are still building the churches. Other civilized nations besides churches have schools, theaters, libraries, museums and concert halls. The nation that has such institutions stands on a higher degree of civilization and lives better. This proves that such institutions are more important than the churches. The Lithuanians have many churches, but we cannot call them national institutions because they bring no benefit to Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>In the last century we were very anxious only about the churches and the priests' affairs. Indeed, we put them on a high basis, as our priests should have a good material background, but unfortunately they do not uplift the masses of Lithuanians culturally or materially. The clergy planted hypocrisy, hate and fighting among us; otherwise we could have lived in peace like cultured people.</p>
   <p>In the coming century, besides the churches, let us take into consideration cultural activity. Let us have more schools. We have seen <pb facs="5423970_3_1657.jpg" n="3"/>the clergy rule for the last several hundred years. They have brought nothing good to the human race, merely misery, exploitation and oppression. The clergy cared only to accumulate wealth for themselves while the masses lived on the edge of starvation and always in fear.</p>
