   <p>The Lithuanian Independent Club of Chicago held its semi-annual meeting Dec. 17, 1904. Mr. Zemaitis, the chairman of the evening, made a motion to take up a collection at the meeting for the relief of Lithuanian exiles in Siberia, and another for aid to our young students. The motion was carried, and ten dollars was collected. This sum was divided into two parts, five dollars being assigned to the exiles in Siberia and five dollars being sent to the Aurora Society fund for poor students. The club decided to make contributions at every meeting in the future for every worthy cause, such as helping poor students who are in need of funds, Lithuanians in exile, and others who are in need of assistance.</p>
   <p>We cannot bear to see our people suffer Russian persecution and injustice. Our people have been carrying heavy burdens on their shoulders for many generations, burdens placed upon them by tyrannical Russian governments. It is up to us to share their burden. We can do so by helping them financially as much as possible. Those who can afford it are asked to contribute <pb facs="5423970_3_0418.jpg" n="2"/>to this relief fund. It is our moral duty to help our brothers and sisters across the sea. We must make every effort to extend a helping hand to our needy countrymen. They depend upon us for help, and we must not forget them.</p>
   <p>All future meetings will be held at the Azuka's Hall, which is located at 33rd Street and Auburn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. These meetings will be held twice a month, every second and third Saturday of the month. We invite all those who are interested to join our club. This club pays benefits to its members when they are sick and cannot work. It costs only one dollar to join.</p>
