   <p>p.3.... A series of balls, to raise funds for "charity" are being planned in the Auditorium hall on Feb.9, 10, 11, by 20,000 employees of the Chicago Telephone Co., Commonwealth Edison Co., and the Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co.</p>
   <p>The employees of these companies had been informed that each employee was expected to purchase one ticket to one of these balls. Believing that the price of a ticket would be about 25 cents, the employees agreed with the plan.</p>
   <p>The selling of tickets has now started. The bosses of the various companies approach each employee personally and ask: "How many tickets will you take?"</p>
   <p>When the employee answers "I will take one", then the boss answers angrily: "No, you must take two."</p>
   <p>Fearing the loss of his job the employee answers: "All right". The employee then receives two tickets, and the price of each ticket is one dollar.</p>
   <p>To the worker, who very often lacks even five cents to go to a moving picture <pb facs="5423970_3_0356.jpg" n="2"/>show, such "charity" appears to be a great burden and positively unbearable. However, he takes the tickets; otherwise he might lose his job and fall into the ranks of the unemployed, who are being beaten with clubs by the police for walking in the streets.</p>
   <p>The profit from these balls will go to the United Charities, a "philanthropic organization," which succeeds often enough in exploiting or jailing relief clients, but not in dispensing relief.</p>
   <p>The money received by the United Charities is spent as follows: 30 cents from each dollar goes for direct relief, while the remaining 70 cents is spent for salaries of highly paid inspectors, investigators, and other officials. These people, of course, are being well paid by charity; but to the workers it is merely a fraud.</p>
