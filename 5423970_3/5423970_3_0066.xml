   <p>Last summer a group of Chicago Lithuanian women began to make plans for the establishment of a society to care for the children of widows and working mothers. When these plans were being formulated it was learned that none of the various organizations in Chicago gave satisfactory attention to this important problem. It is true that we have a large and prominent mutual aid organization and several smaller societies of similar purpose, but their assistance ends with the death of the beneficiary. Thus far, for some unexplained reason, our people have been unwilling to understand that mere death and sick benefits are insufficient. Apparently it is clear to everyone that a widowed mother cannot exist upon the grace of God. She must seek employment in order to support herself and her children.</p>
   <p>But who takes care of a working widow's children when she is at work? A good-hearted neighbor, or probably the eldest son or daughter? That happens only <pb facs="5423970_3_0067.jpg" n="2"/>in rare cases. More often those children are left at home without any kind of supervision. It is understood that in spite of these hardships and unfavorable circumstances such children do grow up (if they are not killed in an accident). But how do they grow up, and what kind of people do they turn out to be after being reared without proper supervision? How much suffering do such children endure and how many crises do they pass through? Probably only they themselves can fully answer this question. Therefore, as mentioned above, after learning of this situation, the group of Chicago women began to make plans to establish an organization that would be concerned entirely with caring for children of Lithuanian widows and working mothers. However, while making those plans, they realized that they were assuming a great responsibility. There is no doubt that a considerable sum of money is required to maintain such an organization, and in order to raise the necessary funds and operate such an organization long and untiring efforts are required.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, the women dared to go through with that hard work. They worked unceasingly during all of last year in soliciting members and raising <pb facs="5423970_3_0068.jpg" n="3"/>funds by sponsoring various benefit affairs. Every means was employed to increase the treasury of the new organization. We must admit that their efforts were very successful. A sufficient amount of money was raised to enable the opening of the Children's Day Nursery at 829 West 33rd Place, in the Bridgeport district, the largest Lithuanian colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Working Lithuanian mothers are invited to take advantage of the service that is afforded by the nursery. We also wish to interest the entire Chicago Lithuanian public in this plan so as to enlist all possible aid in performing this work. Other nationalities have established similar institutions a long time ago. For example, the city of New York alone has more than one hundred such institutions. One of them is so developed that it now occupies an entire building of seven floors. In Chicago, such institutions are also growing fast. The children's day nurseries of Poles, Jews, and Czechs in Chicago are over-crowded.</p>
   <p>However, it is different among the Lithuanians. Thus far only those Lithuanians <pb facs="5423970_3_0069.jpg" n="4"/>living in the neighborhood and some prominent Lithuanian leaders knew of and supported this institution. They all assisted either with work or donations or both to help establish this institution. However, we must expect that in the future this work of ours will receive greater support from Chicago Lithuanians. The institution is now being supported not only by Lithuanians, but also by Americans of other nationalities. Mrs. Jerome and Mrs. Davis, both of the Fellowship House [a settlement house in the Bridgeport district], are among the most active members of this organization. Other famous American social workers who are assisting our organization with work and donations are Mrs. Sophronisba, Mrs. Breckenridge, Grace Abbott, Julius Rosenwald [Jewish], and many others.</p>
   <p>We can say with pride that much has already been accomplished. A professional (Lithuanian) nurse has been hired to supervise the children in the nursery. Beginning May 20, the nursery, located at 829 West 33rd Street, will begin to accept children of working mothers. Therefore, all working Lithuanian mothers who are in need of the service that is provided by the nursery are <pb facs="5423970_3_0070.jpg" n="5"/>invited to come to the nursery and make the necessary arrangements for the care of their children. You will not only be able to leave your children during the day while you are at work for the small fee of only ten cents per day, but your children will receive meals without additional charge. We are confident that our mothers will fully appreciate and understand the great importance of this nursery; we await their co-operation.</p>
   <p>We would like to have all who are interested in this nursery to pay us a visit and see for yourselves how everything is arranged and conducted. We feel that after seeing the nursery and our work that you will join us in the work which we have started. This is especially true since your co-operation will cost very little. Every additional dollar received will do much for every child that is cared for in this institution. The dues of supporting members of the organization are only one dollar per year.</p>
   <p>When sending money or when requesting further information about the nursery, address your mail to one of the following officers of the Children's Day <pb facs="5423970_3_0071.jpg" n="6"/>Nursery Society: Mrs. A. Zymontas, president, 3252 South Halsted Street; Mrs. M. Damijonaitis, secretary, 901 West 33rd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
