   <p>The parade started at 2 P. M., from St. George Parish Hall, where the participants had assembled. After parading, with music, through a large section of Bridgeport, the paraders assembled in Liberty Hall, 30th Street and Union Avenue, where speeches were delivered.</p>
   <p>There were three speakers: P. Mazeika, S. Tananevicia, and Mr. Pocius, the General of the Guards. Mr. Mazeika spoke about the unity of the Lithuanians, about the necessity of gatherings arranged by women, and about societies generally. Tananevicius' subject was the regaining of the freedom of the press in Lithuania. Pocius' subject, befitting the General of the Guards, was the need of soldiers for the defense of the mother country.</p>
   <p>After the speeches the Young Lithuanian-American National Clubs' Chorus, under the direction of Mr. Girnius, rendered a group of songs very successfully. After the program there was dancing until midnight. The celebration was well organized.</p>
