   <p>Dear and beloved patriots! In 1897, when I came back from Siberia's exile, I fell again into the hands of gendarmes for activity in the organization "Sietynas." (The Pleiades - it was a revolutionary organization in Lithuania against the tsar's regime). I was in jail for almost two years, then they exiled me for the term of three years to the Province of Viatka, under the supervision of the well known blood sucker Klingerberg and under the police. While I was in jail, my wife disappeared. I don't know where. Being freed from jail I have spent my last penny trying to keep myself from starvation. Klingerberg designated me to the county seat, Nolinsk, where up to the present time I have been unable to get a job. In that city there are two tobacco factories, the workers are getting from 2.50 to 4 rubles per month. When I arrived to Viatka I found that the political exiles cannot get jobs there. I was permitted to live in the town of Larapol in the province of Viatka. And Klingerberg told me that he got an order from Goremikin that the political exiles must not make their <pb facs="5423970_3_0430.jpg" n="2"/>abode in the state capital and in the industrial cities. Many other political exiles escaped to other countries. Under these hard living conditions my health is failing. There are many exiles of the intelligent class of people. They, too, are in the same trouble like myself. The students are giving private lessons to the children of well-to-do people, but even such chances are rare. The exiled doctors and the veterinarians are prohibited from practising. We are helping each other as much as we can. There are some good people who are helping us, but this is only a drop into the sea. Why does the Lithuanian public not help us? It is a disgrace, brothers, that up to the present time you did not help us. Brothers, help us! I wonder what my jail friends are doing now that they are free in other countries. What my school friends the priests in America are doing? What are the leaders of the working people doing?</p>
   <p>Yours,</p>
   <p>Meszkutis</p>
   <p>Editor's note: We are publishing this letter of one martyr, but there <pb facs="5423970_3_0431.jpg" n="3"/>are many of them who are suffering as this man does! The money collected for the martyrs is laying in the newspaper offices. We are doing nothing to distribute the money.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians in America do not know the real truth about the life of the exiles; of course with many of the exiles we have no acquaintances. Therefore, the mediator ought to be the European intelligentsia, but unfortunately no such a committee exists to help the exiles. They must take this into consideration, make arrangements, and notify the Lithuanian newspapers in America, where to send the money.</p>
   <p>The donator Mr. K. Rutkauskas agrees on the Brooklyn, N. Y., committee for contribution of money to the exiles in Siberia.</p>
