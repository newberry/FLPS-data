   <p>Lithuanian Day in Chicago was observed on Thursday, March 4. During that day money was solicited on the streets of Chicago, except in the Loop district, for the "Tautos Fondas" (National Fund). Altogether, there were 380 solicitors, women and girls. The seventy-three solicitors in the Bridgeport district collected a total of $833.90. In the district around 18th and Halsted Streets about $600 was collected; the Town of Lake district contributed about $400. About one hundred dollars were collected in each of the other Chicago Lithuanian colonies. All the solicitors collected a total of $2,810.</p>
   <p>During the evening, mass meetings with entertainments were held in all the Chicago Lithuanian colonies. The money which was collected at these affairs boosted the grand total of the day to more than three thousand dollars.</p>

   <p>The solicitors worked from 6:00 A. M. to 6:00 P. M. The largest sums were collected by Miss H. Tananevicius, who collected $121.68, and by Mrs. Mazeikis, who collected $37.41. The smallest sum, eighty-five cents, was collected by a young schoolgirl who worked one or two hours after school. The solicitors operating in the French neighborhood reported that the French people were very sympathetic.</p>
   <p>The soliciting of funds that day was in charge of the following committee: Mr. P. Mazeika, chairman; Mr. S. P. Tananevicius, treasurer; Mr. Julius Kaupas, secretary; Mr. Paul Baltutis, and others.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The "Tautos Fondas" (National Fund) was created by the Catholic Lithuanian element in America for purposes of war relief work in Lithuania, and to advance the claims of Lithuania for autonomy].</p>
