   <p>Up to the present time, between 31st and 33rd on Halsted Street, all the business was in the hands of the Jews; there were rag shops, shanties, etc. The buildings were cheap and neglected, dirty--in other words, it was a slum district, not a business district. But when the Lithuanians began to live in this district, they at once started to buy the ruined buildings, remodel them, and in a few years, have made great improvements.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Olszewski has started to build a large and beautiful theater between 31st and 32nd on Halsted Street. It will be one of the largest theaters in the South Side district. The lots on Halsted Street used to be valued at $1,000. Now the prices are from $2,000 to $4,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olszewski made great improvements when he built his bank building at 33rd and Halsted Streets. Since then, many new Lithuanian businesses have sprung <pb facs="5423970_3_0468.jpg" n="2"/>up, such as the South Halsted Furniture House, and many others.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Olszewski's statement, Halsted Street is the center vein of the city. He claims that the area between 31st and 33rd on Halsted Street, will become as great a business center as 63rd and Halsted Streets where the business lots are priced as high as $50,000. He says further that in a few years, all the business in Bridgeport will be in the hands of Lithuanians, and that it will be the center of Chicago Lithuanians.</p>
