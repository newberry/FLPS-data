<title level="a">STATISTICAL SURVEY OF THE SOUTH CHICAGO LITHUANIAN COLONY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Lithuanians in the South Chicago Lithuanian colony have four organizations; two of these are branches of national Lithuanian organizations, and the other two are mutual aid societies (one Catholic and the other mixed).</p>
   <p>There are fifteen Lithuanian business establishments here, including the agents. Eleven Lithuanians here are home owners.</p>
   <p>The boundaries of this Lithuanian colony are as follows: From 87th Street to 89th Street, between Houston and Commercial Avenues.</p>
   <p>Nearly all Lithuanian workers who live here are employed in the local steel mill and car works. Their jobs are very hard and dangerous. The bosses treat the workers in a very cruel and barbaric manner. Many workers are injured here <pb facs="5423970_3_0555.jpg" n="2"/>daily. The wages in the steel mill are very low: For a ten-hour day the workers receive from $1.60 to $2.20.</p>
   <p>The air in this locality is unhealthy; it is polluted with smoke and dust from the factories. The local steel mill occupies a long stretch of land, extending from the lake to the entire southeastern boundary of South Chicago. When the wind blows from the direction of the steel mill the people almost choke from the smoke.</p>
   <p>It takes more than a half hour to ride from Bridgeport to South Chicago; the fare is ten cents. The following street cars run to South Chicago from 64th Street and Jackson Park Avenue: So. Deering, Whiting, Windsor Park, and Hammond.</p>
   <p>Living conditions in South Chicago do not appear to differ in any way from <pb facs="5423970_3_0556.jpg" n="3"/>that of other Chicago Lithuanian colonies. The wealthiest Lithuanian in South Chicago is Ad. Kegavicia, whose fortune totals $30,000. Other prominent Lithuanians who live here are: Dr. A. Rutkauskas, Mrs. M. Banis, mid-wife, and Mr. Pietelis, building contractor. One of the most active Lithuanian leaders of this colony, B. Jasiulis, who operates a barber shop at 8845 Commercial Avenue, plans to move out next month to Indiana Harbor, Ind.; his address there will be 3604 Deodor Street. He will be missed a great deal by the Lithuanians of South Chicago.</p>
   <p>There are a number of very active and industrious Lithuanian leaders in this colony; in some respects they surpass the Lithuanians of other colonies. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Lithuanian organizations of this colony have decided to select two or three paid workers to make a complete statistical survey of their South Chicago colony. More about this matter is written <pb facs="5423970_3_0557.jpg" n="4"/>in another section of this issue of the Lietuva (Lithuania).</p>
   <p>This colony has a small Lithuanian Roman Catholic parish, and a small frame church, but with a large rectory, in which Rev. J. Petraitis, the pastor, lives. He has not distinguished himself as a good priest, nor as a good patriot. However, he is famous for the fact that he possesses the second largest astronomical telescope and observatory in the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>According to the more progressive Lithuanians of the colony, Rev. Petraitis associates with the Poles and belittles the Lithuanians. It is said that he intended to give astronomical instructions to his parishioners, but so far he has not shown his telescope nor given astronomical instructions to a single Lithuanian. He opposes all progressive suggestions, does not get along well with his parishioners, and for that reason the membership of the parish has <pb facs="5423970_3_0558.jpg" n="5"/>greatly decreased. The church is attended mostly by Poles, and to please them he delivers the sermons in Polish as well as in Lithuanian. In American and Polish newspapers he is famous as an astronomer, and a good astronomer at that, but apparently he is little interested in the priesthood.</p>
   <p>Rev. Petraitis purchased the telescope and built the observatory only this year. It is said that the telescope is worth $12,300.</p>
   <p>Rev. Petraitis came to this country from Erzvilkis parish, Lithuania. He attended the seminary at Siauliai, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian church is located at 87th Street and Marquette Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian business establishments in the So. Chicago colony are as follows: Five saloons; four food shops by Ad. Kegowicz, Ant. Kegowicz, Ant. Valciukas, and M. Cheswood &amp; A. Maniokas; one barber shop, by B. Jasiulis; <pb facs="5423970_3_0559.jpg" n="6"/>one photo studio, by Urbanowicz; one bakery shop, by Ant. Almonavicia; one real estate, steamship and insurance agency, by St. Simkus; two insurance agents, P. Simavicius, and J. Samanauskas.</p>
   <p>The total membership of the Lithuanian organizations of this colony is 290. The names of the organizations are as follows: St. Isidore the Plowman Society (non-sectarian), St. Joseph's Society (Catholic), the 74th lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, and a branch of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society.</p>
