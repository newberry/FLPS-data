   <p>Interesting, fascinating, and worthy of intensive study!</p>
   <p>That is what others say of our Lithuanian customs, country and language. Universities offer Lithuanian courses now. Philology instructors make frequent mention of this important ancient tongue. Linguists delight in the beauty and melody of the charming Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>Professor Alfred Senn, of Switzerland, was so impressed by our Lithuanian tongue that he made a serious study of it, and today he is one of the foremost authorities on this language. His interest was so great and sincere that he spent eight years as a member of the faculty of the University of Lithuania, in further study and in getting better acquainted with Lithuania and her people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0490.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The French poet Monsieur de L. Milash, has recently published, according to Elta, a representative collection of popular Lithuanian tales and fables, Countes et fabliaux de la Vielle Lithuanie. He has also published a French version of many Lithuanian "Dainos" (popular songs) which met with a highly favorable reception in French literary circles.</p>
   <p>Yet, there are some of us of Lithuanian ancestry who do not know this famed Lithuanian tongue. Some of us do not even know the glories of Lithuania's thrilling history, and have no idea of Lithuania's charming, simple homelife. Though we hear our people speak the language, we turn deaf ears.</p>
   <p>Will the time ever come when we will look at our rich heritage and picturesque background and understand and appreciate these things as others are doing?</p>
