   <p>Westville, Ill. - On the 16th day of April, 1900, a banquet was held by the Lovers of Fatherland Society, local. There were many people at this banquet; the public was in a very pleasant mood; there were no disputes or fights. What is most important, at this banquet there was no beer or whiskey and for this reason the banquet remained orderly. There were no speeches because the speakers from other cities did not arrive. The clear profit was $38.70. The profit, as it was previously announced, was divided into four parts: $10 was sent to the central office of the Lovers of Fatherland Society; $10 to the martyrs in Siberia; and the balance of $8.70 was left to the local branch of the Lovers of Fatherland Society.</p>
   <p>It ought to be a duty of the Lithuanians of other cities to take our example and have festivals for the cultural benefit of all. By doing that we will uplift ourselves morally and culturally.</p>
   <p>W. S. Kreiwenas.</p>
