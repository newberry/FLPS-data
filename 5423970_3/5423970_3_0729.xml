   <p>The Childrens Day Nursery Society and the women's lodge (Branch 208) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America have decided to hold their meetings jointly. This step is being taken because the membership of both groups is more or less the same, and in order to reduce the number of meetings. Thus far, each group has been holding three meetings every month and many members could not find time to attend all of them. Henceforth, meetings will be held jointly twice each month.</p>
   <p>The Children's Day Nursery Society was recently organized for the purpose of establishing a day nursery in the Bridgeport district in a home east of the Fellowship House, 831 West 33rd Place.</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. J. Zimont [Zimontas], prominent Chicago Lithuanian-American feminine leader, is president of the Children's Day Nursery Society and the women's lodge (Branch 208) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
