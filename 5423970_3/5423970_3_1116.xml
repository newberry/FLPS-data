  <body>
   <p>President Wilson has announced that October 12 will be Liberty Day. During this day gigantic celebrations will be held in every part of America.</p>
   <p>All nationalities will participate in these demonstrations. Therefore, Lithuanians are asked to do their part on that day.</p>
   <p>Every nationality will have a float at the head of its division, which will introduce that particular nationality.</p>
   <p>It is desired that as large a number of individuals and societies (nationalistic and religious) as possible will participate in the parade.</p>
   <p>We will thus be able to make a good showing. We are especially anxious to have as many Lithuanian women in Lithuanian costumes in the parade as we can.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1117.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every society should decide at once to participate in this gigantic demonstration. The chairman of the Liberty bond commission in your district will furnish detailed information, and will help you to organize matters in connection with this parade. The chairmen of the various societies ought to meet with the chairmen of their Liberty bond commissions as soon as possible, for little time remains for organization. Any information concerning the parade may be had at 3252 South Halsted Street, from the Lithuanian representatives of the Liberty Bond Branch of the Seventh Federal Reserve District.</p>
