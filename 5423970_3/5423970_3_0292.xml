   <p>Though there are twenty-two Lithuanian societies in Cicero, all with large memberships, they have not accomplished anything idealistic to date. Their most important activity has consisted in taking care of their sick members and in burying their dead. But now that the awful spectre of war has placed an unbearable burden of woe upon our compatriots, Lithuanians have begun seeking ways and means to aid their brothers in their misfortune.</p>
   <p>Hitherto, only the local Lithuanian Relief Fund committees have been active here. But now the clubs, lodges, and societies have awakened. Much time is devoted at meetings to discussions of the plight of the war sufferers. The Lithuanian Red Rose Club is the most active organization working for this cause. Through its efforts, an alliance of eight organizations was formed for the purpose of providing aid to those Lithuanians who are suffering because of the war. The following societies sent delegates to the Alliance: The Lithuanian Soldiers' Society, The Evening Star Benefit Club, Lodge 138 of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, The Home Owners' Improvement Club, The Lovers of Lithuania <pb facs="5423970_3_0293.jpg" n="2"/>Society, The Men's and Women's Enlightenment Society, and a committee of the Lithuanian Relief Fund.</p>
   <p>A public meeting of the delegates will be held on Wednesday, February 9, at 8 P. M., at Joe Neffas Hall, 1500 West 15th Street. Every delegate is urged to be present.</p>
