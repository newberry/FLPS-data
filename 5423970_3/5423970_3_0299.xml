<title level="a">TWENTY DOLLARS DONATED TO THE WAR SUFFERERS IN LITHUANIA</title></bibl>

   <p>January 8, the board of the Birute Society held its meeting to finish up the affairs of the concert held on December 26. Although this concert was a great success, the Birute had only a fair profit. As we have learned, during the past year, Birute has had a deficit of some eighty dollars. Now, from the proceeds of this concert, twenty dollars has been donated to the war sufferers in Lithuania. From this we can judge that Birute has paid its debts, and has enough money left so that they can donate such a large sum to the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>This coming Friday, Birute will repeat its concert at Mark White Square Park Hall; admission is free for those who get tickets from the members of Birute, or from Miss Harris, supervisor of the hall. With this step, Birute brings something new into the life of the Chicago Lithuanians. In truth, not one of the Chicago Lithuanian choirs has been able to accomplish <pb facs="5423970_3_0300.jpg" n="2"/>what the Birute Choir has done. In the future, Birute has promised to accomplish even more.</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the play, "The Bewitched Duke," Birute will give one concert during Lent.</p>
