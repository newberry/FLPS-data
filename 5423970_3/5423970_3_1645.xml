<title level="a">ARE THE CLERGY THE PROTECTORS OF LITHUANIA?</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Our clerical newspapers very often state that the clergy of Lithuania and in general, the Catholic Church, is the strongest pillar of Lithuanianism. Is it true that the Catholic clergy and the Catholic Church were the protectors and upholders of Lithuanianism? It looks to us that it was just the opposite. The Catholic Church was the first to spread Polanization in Lithuania and, at the same time, it was the destroyer of Lithuanianisim.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians obtained the Catholic faith from the Poles. The Polish priests were the first to teach Lithuanians the Catholic faith. The churches in Lithuania never have been Lithuanian churches, but were tools of spreading Polanization. The Lithuanians were able to become priests after the churches in Lithuania had become Polanized already, and only the Polanized Lithuanians were able to become Catholic priests.</p>

   <p>True, there were a few Lithuanian Catholic priests who participated in uplifting Lithuanian literature. But to work in the Lithuanian literary field, the clergy did not follow their own will or wish. As in America, the radicals forced the clergy to work for Lithuanianism, so in Lithuania, the Protestants, the enemies of Catholicism, forced the Catholic clergy to take up the work for Lithuanianism.</p>
   <p>The first book in Lithuania was published in the Lithuanian language by the Protestants. When the Protestants began to spread their faith in the Lithuanian language, then the Catholic clergy, in order to stop the wave of Protestantism in Lithuania, began to publish Catholic prayer books in the Lithuanian language. Only then did the Lithuanian clergy begin to separate Lithuanian affairs from Polish.</p>
   <p>In Lithuania and in part of America the Catholic churches are the nests of Polanization. Only the degenerates are willing to become Catholic priests.</p>
   <p>We must not forget that all the schools in Lithuania were under the strict <pb facs="5423970_3_1647.jpg" n="3"/>control of the priests. To use the Lithuanian language in schools was strictly forbidden. If any student spoke Lithuanian in school, the clergy scolded and punished him severely for using it in his conversation.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Catholic clergy were the destroyers of Lithuanianism and were the great upholders of Polanization.</p>
   <p>The Roman-Catholic clergy are against the Russian government as much as Russia is against the Roman-Catholics, although the Catholic clergy are the great supporters of the despotism of the tsar.</p>
