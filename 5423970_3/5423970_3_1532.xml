<title level="a">THE PROTEST OF THE LITHUANIAN EVANGELICAL LUTHERANS OF CHICAGO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In a recent issue of Lietuva, a certain person using the pseudonym "The First Lightning" wrote a slanderous article about Lithuanian Evangelical Lutherans of Chicago. He said that they are drunken, uncultured, inactive, lazy, good for nothing Prussian Lithuanians, who are submerged in a sleep of lethargy and therefore, do not oven have a strong organization among themselves.</p>
   <p>We know our "critic". He is a very "cultured" person. He is always urging us to study political economy, to read socialist newspapers and books. We also know this much, that our "honorable critic" knows nothing about political economy. When he approaches any one of us, he begins to explain socialism by denouncing the Czar, the Kaiser, and the Bible. This proves how ignorant he is himself. We don't want to associate with such a man who denounces the Bible and government.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1533.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As to the societies: We Chicago Lithuanians have enough societies in this city. There are about two hundred various societies, religious, political, national and scientific, and those who want to belong to one can join any of them. For this reason, we do not care to organize several new ones among the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutherans of Chicago. They can join any one of the existing societies and help them to grow in membership and financially. A person who has no education cannot lead others. When blind leads the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</p>
   <p>In the name of all Lithuanian Evangelical Lutherans of Chicago, we approve this resolution of protest, and sign our names to it:</p>
   <p>I. The Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran Zion Parish Board:</p>
   <p>G. Yurkshat, president</p>
   <p>M. Matsaitis, secretary.</p>
   <p>The Parish Committee:</p>

   <p>D. Streikis</p>
   <p>John Oswald</p>
   <p>Charles Lemkis.</p>
   <p>II. The Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran Mutual Benefit Society:</p>
   <p>A. Kalvaitis, president</p>
   <p>John Sadauskis, secretary</p>
   <p>Alternates:</p>
   <p>A. Szulmistraitis</p>
   <p>J. Sprainis.</p>
   <p>III. The Progressive Society:</p>
   <p>M. Jonuskaitis, financial secretary.</p>
   <p>Alternates:</p>
