   <p>Much has already been written in the Lietuva about the efforts of a group of Lithuanian and some non-Lithuanian women to establish a children's day nursery in the Bridgeport section of Chicago. The purpose of the proposed day nursery, as had been explained before, is to take care of the children of working mothers while they are at work. All plans in regard to this matter are now about to be realized.</p>
   <p>This humanitarian project has received much sympathy and support from the inhabitants of Bridgeport. For example, the Chicago Lithuanian Women's Educational Society donated ten dollars toward the nursery fund; the women's lodge 208 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America donated $7.50; the social workers of the Fellowship House donated twenty dollars. A large number of individual donations have also been received. Now there is close to two <pb facs="5423970_3_0073.jpg" n="2"/>hundred dollars in the nursery fund.</p>
   <p>However, the cost of maintaining such an institution is about one thousand dollars per year. One-third of this sum will be paid by the mothers who will utilize the services of the nursery. The balance must be raised by contributions, benefit affairs, etc.</p>
   <p>It was originally planned to open the nursery much sooner. However, there were a number of unexpected obstacles in the way; on the one hand there was a shortage of funds, on the other hand great difficulty has been experienced in locating a suitable home for the nursery.</p>
   <p>In an effort to increase the nursery fund, the nursery committee has decided to give a benefit social on Friday evening, November 19, in the Fellowship House, 831 West 33rd Place. Everyone is invited to attend the social and in this manner contribute to the nursery fund.</p>
