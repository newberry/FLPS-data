   <p>After a radio talk by Reverend F. Kemesis, a professor of Kaunas, the local press made the following comment on the younger generation of Lithuanians in the United States:</p>
   <p>"It is equally important to the younger generation itself to retain its Lithuanian spirit. By conserving the language of their fathers, their customs and traditions, it will not come into the life of another nation with empty hands, but with cultural riches which enrich the life of its new Fatherland. By knowing two languages and taking notice of the cultural life of two nations (Lithuania and United States) this younger generation will be better equipped spiritually and intellectually than those of its members who will be familiar only with the language of their adopted country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0488.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The 'stormy petrel' of many a Lithuanian movement, Dr. John Slinpas, celebrated his 75th birthday last year by a flying visit to the United States where he lived from 1884 to 1921; and this is what he told the newspaper reporters in Kaunas about the danger of us becoming denationalized.</p>
   <p>"The Lithuanians in the United States will become denationalized in the same way as the Irish. Perhaps the majority of young American-Lithuanians will not be able to speak Lithuanian, but an attachment to the land of their forefathers will remain. A spiritual intercourse will remain even if the language tie is broken."</p>
