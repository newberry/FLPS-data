  <body>
   <p>The compatriots in the last two conventions accepted the suggestion that instead of helping the telegraph monopolists, they should help their own patriots with $29.77 at the 19th convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. At the 21st convention no one should send a telegram; they should write letters instead. For every word enclose a two-cent stamp in the letter. In this manner money will be raised for national affairs instead of serving to enrich the telegraph monopolists. It would be very good if with letters of congratulation money would be sent for the help of the revolutionary movement in Lithuania. Many of the revolutionists are in jail, fed with food that even pigs would not eat. The despotic Russian government wants to starve political prisoners so that after their term of imprisonment they become good for nothing. Helping our imprisoned revolutionists is our most essential duty.</p>
   <p>Letters of congratulation to the convention should be mailed to: Lithuanian Convention, South Side Turner Hall, 3143 S. State St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
