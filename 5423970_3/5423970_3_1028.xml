   <p>In Chicago there are many Lithuanians who want to have a society where the money they earn would bring profit and benefit for themselves. As it is now their money goes to others. This is not all - we must enlighten our Lithuanians, to lift them morally and intellectually that they will not be looked on by others as the lowest class of people.</p>
   <p>We must uplift the Lithuanian name. When we are dead let our children look back on us as cultured people, and not as the soum of society.</p>
   <p>Such a society must have nothing to do with religion or against religion, must have a clear scientific foundation. Full freedom to every member, except that such a member must not trespass the rights of others, no matter who he would be.</p>
   <p>For this reason I appeal to the intelligent Lithuanians who stand for humanism and wishes best for Lithuanianism to apply and join. Help to prepare the constitution.</p>
   <p>He who wishes to join such organization, please submit your plan of the constitution, and also give a name for such a society. I think the best name <pb facs="5423970_3_1029.jpg" n="2"/>would be Lithuanian Workingmen of America.</p>
   <p>For the adoption of our constitution we must take a time, we ought to hold at least five meetings, and during those meetings we must discuss every point and detail of the constitution. After the disoussions, the constitution can be adopted by secret ballot. If some points of such a constitution cannot be adopted unanimously, then such a point ought to be published in the newspapers, let the editors and the readers discuss, and then any good suggestion can be adopted by the majority votes of the members.</p>
