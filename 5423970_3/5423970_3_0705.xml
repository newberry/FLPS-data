   <p>A group of West Side Lithuanians held a meeting last Friday in Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and Oakley Avenue, for the purpose of organizing in that community a branch of the Lithuanian-American Nationalist League. All those who attended the meeting enthusiastically endorsed the proposal to form the new branch. It was argued at the meeting that the present is an opportune time to form such a branch because the current world situation offers an excellent opportunity for Lithuania to regain her independence. All members of the League are strong supporters of the Lithuanian independence movement.</p>
   <p>The League is a political party whose chief aim is to assist Lithuania to regain her independence. After hundreds of years of suffering under foreign oppression, there is great hope at present that after the war Lithuania will once more become a free and independent nation.</p>
   <p>After the vote for the establishment of the branch was taken, officers of the <pb facs="5423970_3_0706.jpg" n="2"/>new branch were elected. The following members were chosen by open ballot: J. S. Vitkus, president; J. Pauksnis, secretary; A. Zalatorius, treasurer; B. Lenkauskas, correspondent. The branch will meet on the evening of the last Monday of each month at Meldazis Hall....</p>
