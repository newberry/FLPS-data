   <p>Who could have thought when our nation awakened that there would appear among us people who would darken our minds with various lies? In the 19th and 20th centuries, men of science began to spread natural science, showing how the people can gain benefit by claiming their natural rights. But the clergy from their pulpits and in their writings preach to the ignorant people that science is the work of infidels. The clergy want to control the people's mind, so they should not see the light of truth. Do the clergy themselves believe what they preach to the people? During the Russo-Japanese war, at the Yalu River, the Russian priest, Sczerbakovski, with the cross in his hands, led the Russian army to battle, believing that the cross would protect him from the Japanese bullets. The priest was killed at once; the cross did not help him. Priest Gapon, on January 22, 1905, in St. Petersburg, with a cross, led the people to the tsar, but when the soldiers began to shoot, he, with his cross, hid in order to protect himself from the bullets; the cross did not protect the priest, Gapon.</p>

   <p>Let us look now at the Lithuanian Catholic riots in their own churches. We all remember when in Philadelphia, in the Lithuanian church, the priest's police, with their clubs, smashed the heads of parishioners, just because they demanded justice in the financial affairs of the parish. The cross did not help the priest. He had to call the police to beat the innocent and honest people. All the crosses in the church kept quiet; they did not move to help the priest.</p>
   <p>On February 11, 1906, at the Providence of God church, 18th and Union Avenue, Chicago, when the people prayed in their church and refused to give money to the priest, the latter instead of asking help from the cross, asked the police to beat the people. The priest Steponavicia did not ask the cross to beat the people, for he knew that would be a futile appeal, so he appealed to the police and the Catholic police <pb facs="5423970_3_1592.jpg" n="3"/>belabored with their clubs the ignorant, innocent people, and protected the priest, who was lusting for money.</p>
   <p>The priest Steponavicia spent $5,000 for lawyers in order to win his case against his beaten parishioners. Why did the priest not come to court with a cross to win his case? He hired the best lawyers and paid them plenty.</p>
   <p>Six priests in Chicago distributed a circular, warning the people not to participate in the Lithuanian Alliance of America parade and the convention which will be held in Chicago. Why do the six priests not stop the people with a cross from going to the parade, instead of warning them with circulars?</p>
   <p>Now when the brutality and the despotism of the clergy are kicked out of the Lithuanian Alliance of America; now when this organization is <pb facs="5423970_3_1593.jpg" n="4"/>growing fast in membership and assets (the assets are now over $20,000), while the Catholic Alliance organization is decaying now, the clergy, trying to obstruct the convention of the Lithuanian Alliance in Chicago, do not try to harm the convention with the cross, but with lies. The people know the wolves in sheep-skins and do not listen to them. Progress is going forward, while the clergy with the cross and God are going backward.</p>
