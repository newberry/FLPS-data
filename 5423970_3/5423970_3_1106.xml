<title level="a">THE CELEBRATION AT THE NATIONAL CEMETERY</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Lithuanians held for a second time their celebration at the Chicago Lithuanian National Cemetery. Thousands of Lithuanians came from all over the state to the Chicago Lithuanian National Cemetery to celebrate the memorial day, May 30. All the Lithuanians who came to this celebration were progressive people, who did not want to belong and could not belong to St. Casimer Cemetery, which is a branch of the Roman trust, and did not want to serve as slaves for Rome, which had discriminated against them on account of religious belief.</p>
   <p>Those people (were mistaken) who made the remark that the people will not visit, that only dogs will pay visits to a Godless infidel cemetery. Those people who made that statement made a bad mistake by saying that the people will not visit the Lithuanian National Cemetery, which proved to be just the opposite from what they said about the Godless, infidel cemetery. As a matter of curiosity, I <pb facs="5423970_3_1107.jpg" n="2"/>personally made a comparison by visiting both cemeteries, St. Casimer's and the Lithuanian National Cemetery, during decoration day, May 30. The comparison is as follows: The number of people at St. Casimer's Cemetery during decoration day was about one thousand, and the number of people at the Lithuanian National Cemetery was over two thousand; as compared we have a ratio of two to one. This fact shows that those people were contradicting themselves by making such a false statement about our National Cemetery. The greater number of the people proved not only that they admire our new cemetery, but it also proved that the Lithuanian National Cemetery is closer to their hearts in the spirit of democracy, when there is no discrimination among our people. Regardless of sect or creed, anybody of our people can bury (their dead) in the Lithuanian National Cemetery without discrimination; because we are all equal after death parts us from our life. This cemetery is not for a picked group of people, they are all accepted here regardless of whether they are sinners or not, cursed or saved. After all, the <pb facs="5423970_3_1108.jpg" n="3"/>earth is the mother to all of us, she accepts us as equals without any social distinction.</p>
   <p>Why have the people taken a liking to the Lithuanian National Cemetery and to Decoration Day, which comes once a year at the end of May? There is a good reason for celebrating Decoration Day in May at the Lithuanian National Cemetery; because the people are not discriminated against there if they do not belong to Catholic Church or Roman trust. Many people left St. Casimer's Cemetery and came to the Lithuanian National Cemetery to celebrate Decoration Day.</p>
   <p>This year special arrangements were made for accommodating more people and for making a more elaborate program at the cemetery to celebrate Decoration Day. The program was very diverse and rich at the Lithuanian National Cemetery. This program consisted of two choirs, a string orchestra, and three speakers and many other <pb facs="5423970_3_1109.jpg" n="4"/>entertainments for the general public. Each choir sang three songs which were selected and adapted for that occasion. Second on the program was the string orchestra which played many beautiful songs and was received by public with a great ovation for their excellent performance.</p>
   <p>Third on the program was the first speaker V. Andrulis, the editor of Vilnis, who gave a short talk on man's life and his deeds while he lives in the world of struggle. He stressed his point by stating that a man is soon forgotten after his death, but his principles and his good deeds will live forever; and future generations will remember that this man lived not without the purpose and aim to improve our present civilization. While we are still living we must work not only for ourselves but for humanity and our future generations. Our problem today is to eliminate all the evils and wrongs from the present society and make this world free from persecution and tyranny; to make this world in which we live a place of justice and freedom for the future generations to come.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1110.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>This world will be beautiful and kind only then, when it will be ruled by those who produce everything for the present-day society and who haven't anything today for themselves.</p>
   <p>The second speaker on the program was Dr. Margeris, who gave a brief talk on the history of the Lithuanian nation and the life of the people in the past and present. He ended his speech by saying that we, as Lithuanians and patriots of that nation, should stop to love our fatherland where we were born and raised, and keep our patriotic spirit alive.</p>
   <p>During the intermission between the second and third speakers, the progressive choir sang a few songs and also the children choir sang a few songs to entertain the public.</p>
   <p>The third speaker, Dr. Montvidas, who was called to speak, made objection and refused to speak because the Vilnis' editor, A. Andriulis, <pb facs="5423970_3_1111.jpg" n="6"/>was placed on the program as a speaker. He would have spoken if A. Andrulis had not been put on the program as speaker for that day. We have information that Dr. Montvidas urged the committee of the Lithuanian National Cemetery to withdraw its invitation to the editor of Vilnis, A. Andrulis, just a few days before Decoration Day. It is strange why Dr. Montvidas objected to A. Andrulis, the editor of Vilnis, who was invited to speak at the Lithuanian National Cemetery on Decoration Day. The only reason we see for Dr. Montvidas' objection is that he was afraid of Mr. A. Andrulis for some unknown reason. We believe that the Socialists soon will be afraid of all the world. Dr. Montvidas had no reason to make objections to members of the Communist Party. He did not accomplish anything worth-while by his unreasonable objections. He only brought upon himself discredit in the eyes of the people. He has discredited himself enough before, and there is no need for him to discredit himself any more. He should know that Socialism, which he so ardently defended, <pb facs="5423970_3_1112.jpg" n="7"/>has cast him out as an undesirable member of the organization. Mr. Grigaitis, the editor of Naujienos, who is also a leader of the Socialist party, has become famous in his activities, and he was not invited to speak; moreover, people are afraid to invite him because the public booed him on the previous occasion. Dr. Montvidas would like to receive the same laurels from the public.</p>
