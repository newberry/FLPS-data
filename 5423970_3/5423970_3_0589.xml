<title level="a">STATISTICAL SURVEY OF CHICAGO LITHUANIANS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A suggestion has been made to make a complete statistical survey of the Lithuanians of Chicago and the suburbs. Every Chicago Lithuanian should be interested in this survey; it should be easy for everyone to understand the value of such a survey. All other nationalities make surveys to learn all about their people. The Lithuanians in Chicago, and other parts of the United States, have very little statistical information about themselves....For that reason a suggestion has been made to gather as much statistical information as possible about the Lithuanians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are in great need of statistical information about our people in order to know our standing and possibilities. This information is necessary not for the personal profit of some individual, but to promote our unity, uplifting and general welfare.</p>
   <p>In order to make this survey, a suggestion has been made to publish questionnaires and distribute them among the Lithuanians in Chicago.....</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0590.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, Lithuanians, let us all co-operate in making this survey a success. We will learn how many Lithuanians there are in Chicago and also their possibilities.</p>
   <p>If anyone has any good suggestion to make in regard to this matter, he or she is cordially invited to publish it in our newspapers for the benefit of all, instead of keeping it a secret.</p>
   <p>More details about this matter may be learned from an article entitled--"Let Us Learn Our Possibilities and Become Acquainted with Ourselves," which is published in this issue of Lietuva (Lithuania). The author of this article suggests seventeen questions for a questionnaire and outlines ways and means how the questionnaires can be distributed and collected. The questions which he suggests are as follows: (1) Name of the head of the family; (2) number of men in each home; (3) number of women in each home; (4) number of persons under 21 years of age; (5) number of married persons; (6) number of persons above 50 years of age; (7) number of those who can read; (8) number of those who can <pb facs="5423970_3_0591.jpg" n="3"/>write; (9) number of naturalized persons; (10) number of American-born, and number of those who were reared here; (11) occupations of the men; (12) occupations of the women; (13) number of men and women who belong to Lithuanian organizations; (14) number of those who own property; (15) value of the property; (16) how many are engaged in business; (17) how much is the business worth.</p>
