   <p>The question of the future of Lithuanianism in America is one of the utmost importance to us today. That future cannot be insured by any single one of our American-Lithuanian groups. It must be, if at all through the combined and united effots of every one of our nationality who believes, or can be made to believe, in the principle that every person owes a duty of reverence and honor to his ancestral stock, tongue and country.</p>
   <p>Setting aside all consideration of the varying amounts of good which our several groups and their newspapers have done up to now for the cause of Lithuanianism, we must admit that a study of these groups and particularly of their publications as they are today, does not announce a very bright future for our nationality in this country. Newspapers that are so violently partisan as these simply cannot work together in the solution of a problem as all-important as the preservation of Lithuanianism. It cannot survive in America under the present <pb facs="5423970_3_0478.jpg" n="2"/>arrangement of strongly entrenched differences of opinion, because these disagreements bring forth the most extreme dissension and intolerance between individuals as well as groups. Any agency that promotes discord and hatred and bigotry among the Lithuanian people is not furthering the cause of Lithuanianism very much, no matter, how patriotic it may claim to be.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, our Lithuanian newspapers have,in more ways then one, been promoters of discord and misunderstanding. In being the organs of their own particular groups they oppose, obstruct and ridicule every movement and activity begun by their opponents; even though the particular activity in itself may be harmless to the cause. They discredit any group activity except their own. However, if the slightest weakness or mistake is evidenced column of space and feverishly gleeful attention is given to it. Nowhere else can one find so many personal attacks, so much demagoguery , and lack of respect for names, reputations and offices as in some of our Lithuanian newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0479.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We fully realize that there are differences of philosophicaloutlook that cannot be reconciled. We are not so sanguine as to expect radicalism and conservatism meet on terms of any great tolerance toward each other. Unfortunately, there always has been and always will be such differences of opinion. But the existence of differences of opinion should not be an excuse for ignorance of the fundamental rules of good breeding, good taste, and tolerance, Countless instances of such coarseness, intolerance, envy and gloating over one another's failure, as well as slander and hatred are to be found in our newspapers.</p>
   <p>Religious intolerance has particularly been a shameful feature of some of our publications. Those responsible for this, clamor the loudest for the right of religious freedom of thought. But so often they will not allow others this privilege. They never go to church and seem to be suffering from some sort of "phobia of the Roman collar."</p>
   <p>Regardless of their non-attendance, however, their interest in the internal affairs of the church, in the religious, financial and social affairs of each parish is <pb facs="5423970_3_0480.jpg" n="4"/>all-consuming. They scrutinize with microscopic eye the public and private lives of clergy for imaginary or actual flaws in their manner of living, yet they completely overlook and ignore a lifetime of good works and public service on the part of the same clergy.</p>
   <p>A glance at the past few years brings to mind a number of instances where dissension and personal disagreements between members of mixed committees in charge of various Lithuanian movements retarded and obstructed their work, and in the final analysis, harmed the prestige of our entire nationality. In every one of these cases, our newspapers were extremely partisan.</p>
   <p>Is our youth to be condemned because it is fed up with these half-century old hatreds and refusals to tolerate one another that are foreign to every healthy concept of Americanism, Lithuanianism and Christianity?</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we believe in this dissertation, which is part of a lecture given recently before a Lithuanian society.</p>
