<title level="a">CELEBRATE FIRST MASS IN NEW LITHUANIAN CHURCH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday, March 28, mass was celebrated for the first time, in the newly built Holy Cross (Lithuanian Roman Catholic) Church at 46th Street and Hermitage Avenue in the Town of Lake district of Chicago. About four thousand people witnessed the opening of the new church.</p>
   <p>The dedication of the new church will take place some time in summer, during the month of June or July. However, all masses will henceforth be celebrated in the new church and not in the old one located at 46th and Wood Streets.</p>
   <p>The new church was built at a cost of about $180,000. The seating capacity is sufficient to accommodate twelve hundred people. The church also has a balcony with several benches to seat worshippers.</p>
   <p>The new church is probably the most beautiful of all Lithuanian churches in Chicago. Reverend A. Skripka is the pastor.</p>
