   <p>The Red Cross is an emblem of mercy. Even during the most furious battles, when the slaughter on the fields of war seems to say that man has become a beast, the white flag with a Red Cross in the center waves high, even in those places where the conflict is at its height, and proves that mercy and humanity are not altogether destroyed.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross, by aiding the fallen, ally and enemy alike, is proof that even in moments of madness a human being is still a human being; and that mercy, sympathy, and friendly aid to the unfortunate are stronger than the hatred and intolerance bred by war.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross is a government [sic] institution which shelters and aids wounded and ailing soldiers. It is supported by the government money donated by the <pb facs="5423970_3_0128.jpg" n="2"/>people. But that is not enough. The people cannot permit such a heavy burden to rest on the shoulders of the government alone. The government cannot do more than it has money for; and it needs money not only for the Red Cross, but also for hundreds of other matters as well.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the task of mercy that the Red Cross is performing can never have too much money. The more money it has the better it can ease the plight of the wounded and ailing soldiers--those soldiers, our young men, who willingly and devotedly went to suffer cold and hunger in order that we would be warm and well fed. They offered their health and their lives in order that we who remained here at home might have peace and security. Therefore, when they fell under fire, their sacrifice was for our sake. It is our duty to help them according to our means.</p>
   <p>How can we do so? Through the Red Cross. Let us be members of that organization. There should not be one person in America who is not a member. Only one dollar a year makes you a member of the Red Cross.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0129.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A campaign for the Red Cross is in progress throughout the United States at this time. The slogan is, "Have a heart and a dollar". That is all that is needed to join the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>"Have a heart and a dollar." We would say, "Keep the heart and give the dollar to the Red Cross". You can become members in your own vicinity, for the Red Cross has branches in every town and hamlet.</p>
