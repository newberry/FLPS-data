   <p>Dr. J. Sliupas visited in Chicago for three days. He came here as a delegate to the American Freethinkers Conference at which, November 26, he spoke about Lithuanians and Lithuanian freethinking.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sliupas addressed Lithuanians November 25, 26, and 27. At the Freiheit Turner Hall, November 25, he spoke about the Lithuanians of a hundred years ago and today, explaining how far the Lithuanians had progressed during this time and what further tasks they must face. The people were especially pleased when Dr. V. Sliupas spoke about the role of the priesthood in our lives. The hall roared with applause at the very mention of priests.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, Mr. Jancevskis spoke about the tailors' strike and urged donations to aid the strikers. Donations collected for the strikers totaled fifteen dollars.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sliupas spoke in Cicero, Illinois, November 26, at the Juknius Hall. The <pb facs="5423970_3_1560.jpg" n="2"/>theme was practically the same. Mr. Kvedaras spoke about the strike. A total of $7.01 was collected in donations for the strikers. November 27, Dr. Sliupas spoke in Town of Lake, at the Columbia Hall. He spoke on evolution and showed many stereoscopic pictures. Many people were assembled. They listened very attentively and were satisfied. Donations were collected for the strikers and they totaled $25.20.</p>
   <p>The visit of Dr. Sliupas excited the Chicago Lithuanians and it will long be remembered.</p>
