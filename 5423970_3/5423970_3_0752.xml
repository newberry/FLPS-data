<title level="a">MEETING OF THE CHICAGO LITHUANIAN SOCIETIES ASSOCIATION BOARD</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Pranas Butkus</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association Board was held on November 25 at Elias Hall, Town of Lake. Only five members of the board and two guests came to this meeting, which was the second meeting of the entire year. The first meeting was held right after the convention, and at this meeting various committees were organized including those on finance, emigration, citizenship, an employment bureau, and information bureau, the purchase of a hall, etc. During the entire year, however, neither the board nor these committees have shown any activity, hor have they held any meetings. In general the committees have shown no activity, as if they were elected just for show.</p>
   <p>To the second meeting came only those members of the board, who want to go forward with the society's activity, to give a stimulus to action. At once, <pb facs="5423970_3_0753.jpg" n="2"/>they began to discuss what should be done in order to revive the association's activity. It was decided to call a meeting of the delegates of all the societies to make plans for reviving the Association, and at that meeting, also, to lay before the delegates such plans which from the point of view of the Board would be most beneficial and practical for the Association. It was also decided by all that during the coming year one or two projects must be finished, rather than many projects attempted as has been the case in the past.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the delegates, attempts were made to get explanations from the board why it had shown no activity, and of the way to bring more action. There were various suggestions for activity, and excuses for not acting--that the bylaws are too broad and contain too many rules, and that for this reason the board was unable to act; that the Association has two presidents, and the people, for that reason, did not know to which one to go for information, and that therefore the Association was unable to grow. Finally, however, they arrived at definitely conclusive reasons as to why this Assocation <pb facs="5423970_3_0754.jpg" n="3"/>almost suffocated right at its inception.</p>
   <p>The first is that the Chicago Lithuanian intelligentsia, and with them the local Lithuanian newspaper did not join. It is impossible for a person who has no support from the intelligentsia and the newspapers to explain the benefit of such an organization to 60,000 Lithuanians in Chicago. Yet the board of directors of this organization was composed of just such persons, with no proper conception of the business of such an organization. Our intelligentsia did not join the Association and take over the leadership of it, and for this reason it has made no progress during this year.</p>
   <p>They discovered the reason why the intelligentsia and the newspapers did not take the leadership in this Association: the Association has a political tinge, for one of the leaders of the board was running for political office. This is the reason why prominent members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia did not join this unclean Association. (If neither the intelligentsia, nor the newspapers nor the public supported it, it seems that this organization <pb facs="5423970_3_0755.jpg" n="4"/>did not conform to the proposed standards. We cannot condemn them, nor demand that they excuse themselves. Everyone has the right to join whatever society he wants to, without being forced to join any particular one.- Editor.)</p>
   <p>These are the two reasons. The third one is that the bylaws are too broad. They have reached for too much, but have grasped very little.</p>
