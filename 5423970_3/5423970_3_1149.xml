<title level="a">AN AFFAIR COMMEMORATING THE DEATH OF VINCAS KUDIRKA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Chapter 22 of the Lovers of the Motherland Society held an affair at the Mark White Square Hall last Monday, commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of Vincas Kudirka's death. [Translator's note: Vincas Kudirka was a Lithuanian writer, one of the leaders in the fight for the liberation of the Lithuanian press.]</p>
   <p>Participating in the long and varied program were, among others, A. Pocius, Mrs. Pocius, Mr. and Mrs. J. Janusauskas, and the Misses Rudauskas. Of the declaimers, Miss Urba, was outstanding. Her recitations were beautiful. She recited Kudirka's "Ne Tas Yra Didis" (Not He Is Great). She displayed ability of expression which might be envied even by Chicago's better-known declaimers. The singers, Mrs. Janusauskas and Mrs. Pocius, because of their appearance at this affair, deserve another flower in the bouquets of their success. It was unfortunate that Mrs. Pocius had a slight cold. The Misses Rudauskas, according to the program, were supposed to sing a trio. Unfortunately, one of the girls became ill the night before, so that <pb facs="5423970_3_1150.jpg" n="2"/>the other two sisters sang a duet instead.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pocius played a Chopin composition on the piano. Another number, by Beethoven, was rendered by the popular Chicago Lithuanian Concert Club, which also played a few encores. Mr. Rimka read a paper entitled "Vincas Kudirka: What He Meant to the Lithuanians." Mr. Rimka's voice is too weak; the concluding words were not audible at all. L. Sernas and A. Petraitis gave the audience some of their recollections from their personal acquaintance with Kudirka. Closing the meeting, J. A. Chmieliauskas delivered a short speech entitled "The Connection between Kudirka and the Lovers of the Motherland Society."</p>
   <p>Despite the cold weather and the fact that it was a Monday night, a large audience assembled. The affair made a pleasant impression.</p>
