   <p>The convention of the Lithuanian National Alliance is near. There are various opinions as to how the National Alliance must take a view towards the clergy. Some say that the clergy can belong to the National Alliance, while others are against the clergy. They say that it if the clergy is accepted by this organization it will usurp all power, as they did before the split of the Lithuanian Alliance.</p>
   <p>It seems to me that there is no danger in accepting the clergy in the National Alliance. There are 15 or 20 priests in America, what then can they do to the 1,000 members of the Alliance? The priests in this organization must have no special privilege; they must be like any other members. The members of the National Alliance should not obey as if they are slaves of the priests, but must <pb facs="5423970_3_1384.jpg" n="2"/>use their own thinking. Then the priests will not enslave the national organization.</p>
   <p>The National Alliance should have no division among its members; there must be no privileged and unprivileged members.</p>
   <p>The organization should not be a class organization. The affairs of the organization must be under the control of its members, but not by the privileged few. The organization should have nothing to do with the religion of the people. Believers and unbelievers can belong without discrimination.</p>
