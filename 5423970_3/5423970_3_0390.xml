   <p>The purpose of the visit of Dr. J. Basanavicius and Mr. Martynas Ycas, the delegates of the Lithuanian Science and Art Society of Vilnus, is very well known to all of us. The Lithuanian nation has no citizens, active in national affairs, who are more honorable, or who could take their place. For this reason, the Lithuanian Science Society has sent these honorable delegates to this country, and entrusted to them the responsibility of presenting to us their aims and explaining what they want to accomplish by their visit in this country. Therefore, the board of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association, has decided to have a banquet for our honorable guests at the Sherman Hotel, August 30, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>In order to have a more successful banquet, the board of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association is calling a meeting on August 15, 8 P. M. at Elias Hall, 46th and Wood Streets. We are inviting not only the members of this association, but all the societies of Chicago to take part in this affair.....</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0391.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Basanavicius and M. Yeas have promised to be at this meeting.</p>
   <p>The revival of our national spirit belongs to all of us. The center of this revival is in Vilnus. The people of other nations, who have been in positions similar to ours, have given not only their wealth for the national cause, but have shed their blood and laid down their lives. Now, the time has come for us to take action for the benefit of our nation. Therefore, those to whom the fatherland of Lithuania is dear, extend your arms to these men who are working for the good of our nation.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, we will have a friendly conversation, together with our guests, on the importance of our national affairs. One and all, come without fail.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanavicius,</p>
   <p>General Secretary of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association.</p>
