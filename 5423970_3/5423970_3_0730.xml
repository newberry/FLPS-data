   <p>The first post-annual meeting of the Lithuanian Women's Educational Society was held on February 7. New officers, who were elected at the annual meeting, took over their posts. The new officers of the Society are as follows: Mrs. R. Slikas, president; Mrs. M. Olsevskis, vice-president; Mrs. M. Katkevicius, recording secretary; Mrs. Z. Pumskis, financial secretary; Mrs. L. Satkauskas, treasurer.</p>
   <p>A decision was made at the meeting to conduct four or five lectures during the Lenten season. The subject matter of the lectures are to be related to the question of suffrage for women. One lecture will be given for both men and women; all the other lectures will be for women and girls only.</p>
   <p>A decision was also made to establish a library. The library will be open for use not only to members of the Society but also to all other Lithuanian women and girls. Miss M. Radzis was elected as the librarian.</p>
