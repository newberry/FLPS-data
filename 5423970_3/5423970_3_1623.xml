   <p>On December 31, 1905, a meeting was held by the Providence of God parish. The meeting was called to order by president Macijauskis. The secretary read the minutes and the income and the expenses during the last year. The committee of Rev. Steponavicius approved the report, but the parishioners were not satisfied. Then Frank Macedonskis read the statement from the time of establishment of this parish in April, 1900, to July, 1905. The income was $91,482.60, the expenses $67,438.24, and the balance $25,054.36. The priest's committee did not state what they had done with the balance. The priest's friends tried to quiet Mr. Macedonskis, but did not succeed, because what he stated can be found in the parish books. He said, "Go and look in the parish books and you will convince yourselves." This statement was given to him by the parish secretary, Peciukaitis. Then he took the books and started to prove the statements he made. The parish president tried to stop him, but failed. Then the parishioners decided to elect five persons to investigate the parish books. They nominated the following persons: Joseph Gedvila and John Punga, but the <pb facs="5423970_3_1624.jpg" n="2"/>priest was against these people and recommended his own. At last they elected Stasys Mikolaitis, John Reckauskas, Petraitis, Felix Lauraitis, and F. Macedoniskis, and offered $2 per day for the examination of the parish books. Macedoniskis resigned because for $2 per day he cannot work. Others started to examine the books but did not complete their work because the priest refused to give them up.</p>
