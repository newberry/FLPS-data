   <p>4. If the Society of St. Petronele is dissolved or if in it there are less than seven members all the society's assets will be turned over to the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>5. Once a year some paragraphs or clauses of the by-laws of the society can be amended if the majority of members so desire. But this society cannot be transformed by any means into a national society.</p>
