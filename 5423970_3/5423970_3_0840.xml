   <p>(Translator's note: Mr. Vaicaitis was a great Lithuanian poet. His parents wanted him to be a priest but he refused. He became tubercular and died at the age of 25. Born Feb. 10, 1876; died Aug. 21, 1901, in Lithuania. The Lithuanian intellectuals of Chicago are holding an anniversary in memory of this great poet.)</p>
   <p>On January 1,Tevynes Myletoju Draugija (The Lovers of the Fatherland) held its third annual celebration at McCormick Hall in memory of the tenth anniversary of the death of the poet, Vaicaitis.</p>
   <p>The Birutes Choir sang the Lithuanian national anthem. Mr. J. Laukis read <pb facs="5423970_3_0841.jpg" n="2"/>an essay on the life of the poet. Dr. Graiciunas stated that the poet was a genius--that his work was comparable to that of any of the world's great poets. Dr. Graiciunas said, "In reading his poetry, I am inspired to dare anything--even so far as to jump into a fire...." Further the doctor stated, "We are guilty ourselves when we do not help the poor student poet."</p>
   <p>Miss M. Horodockaite sang Schubert's "Serenade." Mr. V. Bigelis played "Traumerei" and "Kujawiak." Miss B. Bernotaviciute read "The Wolf and the Tom Cat." Mr. V. Vitkevicia sang "The Day is Darkening."</p>
   <p>The second speaker was Mr. B. K. Balutis. He spoke of what a man could achieve when he used his energy towards the right goal. He mentioned for example such geniuses as Archimedes, Michelangelo, Beethoven and others, who accomplished great deeds by their own effort despite the laughter and derision of the Philistines. The speaker said, "Such was the genius and <pb facs="5423970_3_0842.jpg" n="3"/>art of Vaicaitis, V. Kudirka, Jaunis, Schiller, Shakespeare, Beethoven."</p>
   <p>Miss M. Jaskeviciute sang "Warm Us, Thou Bright Sun," composed by Mikas Petrauskas. V. Brusokas delivered a monologue entitled, "The Corpse." Then stereopticon pictures of the great battle between the Lithuanians and the Crusaders at Grunwald in 1415 were shown. The Birutes Choir under the direction of M. Petrauskas then sang five songs.</p>
   <p>The picture of Vaicaitis was placed on the stage. It was a beautiful portrait painted by the artist Sileikis. Around the picture were placed beautiful flowers.</p>
