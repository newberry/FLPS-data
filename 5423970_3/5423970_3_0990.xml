  <body>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Aurora Society certain changes were made in its by-laws. Since it was difficult for many people to understand why the Aurora Society should have two sections, they refused to join the society. At the last meeting it was decided to annul the two sections and make the society a single body. From now on payments to the fund will be $1 initiation and 25 cents monthly dues. The fund is for the benefit of students who are seeking to study natural and civil science.</p>
   <p>In the office of Lietuva there was $20.17 of the Aurora's assets. For this purpose Mr. Sabonis, Lawrence, Mass., has collected $7.20; Mr. Rutkauskas donated 40 cents; at the Rev. Dilionis' speech in Philadelphia there was collected $1; Mr. Single donated 25 cents; the Lelewel Society of Scranton, Pa., $5 (Mr. Lelewel was a Prussian-Lithuanian and a well known historian. The Poles considered him to be a Pole, but he was not of Polish descent, but Lithuanian); Mr. J. Kazakevicze, $1; Rev. Deniski, $1.82; Mr. Vakrina, 50 cents; Mr. Mack,$2.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0991.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In replying to the donators we are asking to whom we should turn over the donated money. To donate to some other cause there is no money.</p>
   <p>It looks as though the money should be given to the Aurora Society, whose purpose is to help poor Lithuanian students. We are waiting for consent. Do you donate the money for the students?</p>
