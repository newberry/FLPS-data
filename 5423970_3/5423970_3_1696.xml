   <p>The Lithuanians, by organizing their parishes, put lots of work and expenses before the parish is put on its feet. The skillful workers are devoting much of their time to traveling and they spend their own money. What reward do they get for their work for the establishment of the parish?</p>
   <p>If the priest has any moral feelings, he may give them something, but often the priests are so greedy and dissolute that they give nothing but sneers to the initiators of the parish. At the beginning the priests are acting with the parish committee, but when everything in the parish is organized, the priest starts to boss the parish committee, expels the best members, and leaves in the committee only the fanatics and ignorant members. The priests attack and denounce the enlightened parishioners, induce misunderstandings and fights among the parishioners. We have seen this in <pb facs="5423970_3_1697.jpg" n="2"/>every Lithuanian parish, so we do not need to go into further details.</p>
   <p>As long as the people were organizing the parish without the help of the priest everything went smoothly and peacefully, but as soon as the priest came, then the commotion and fight among the parishioners started.</p>
   <p>Please excuse me, Chicago Lithuanians who are organizing a new parish, for my interference in your work. The organizers of the second parish in Chicago should consider carefully that this should not happen as with the Rev. Krawczunas. If it is to happen like that, then brothers, better do not start to build the new church. If you have a lot, it would be better to build hell instead of a church. By building hell there will be no place to make God mad.</p>
   <p>In organizing the parish make the constitution and control it, but do not give power to the priest. Watch that the priest does not sink <pb facs="5423970_3_1698.jpg" n="3"/>the church into debt. The treasurer ought to be under double bond. Do not give the budget under the priest's control. See to it that the priest, or the committee, shall not make over $200 expenses without knowledge and consent of the parishioners. If some important project should be made for the parish, it ought to be done with the knowledge and consent of the parishioners. The parish's property should be deeded in the parish's corporation name. Therefore, beware, brothers, that you may not need to organize a third parish, that your donated money for the church should not go for nothing.</p>
