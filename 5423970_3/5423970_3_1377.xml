<title level="a">MASS MEETING OF THE CHICAGO LITHUANIANS</title></bibl>

   <p>A Lithuanian mass meeting was held on February 18, 1906, at the Dore Hall. Mr. J. Jancauskas called the meeting to order. He explained why this meeting was called and asked the secretary to read the letter which was sent to the Chicago Lithuanians, asking them to send a delegate to the convention in Philadelphia. This convention is held by all the Lithuanians of America in order to make plans on how to help our brothers in Lithuania fight against the Russian despotism. The elected delegate was Mr. Szernas, editor of Lietuva. The following program was adopted at this meeting:</p>
   <p>The chief aim is to fight against the tsar's regime through the united power of the two main Lithuanian political parties, the Social-Democrat and the Democrat.</p>
   <p>(1) To demand the creation of a federative Lithuania with a congress <pb facs="5423970_3_1378.jpg" n="2"/>at Vilnius.</p>
   <p>(2) To collect money for the revolutionary movement.</p>
   <p>(3) The elected committee in America must use its power and influence in order to unite all the factions into one large party in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>(4) To organize a similar committee in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>(5) The delegates have full authority to make decisions concerning all the questions put before the convention.</p>
   <p>(6) That the clergy must not condemn the revolution; if any priest goes against the revolution he must be forced to pay a fine at the convention.</p>
   <p>(7) To improve the Lithuanian schools in America, to elect a committee <pb facs="5423970_3_1379.jpg" n="3"/>in order to work out a program for such schools.</p>
   <p>(8) To elect a committee which would take care of immigration.</p>
   <p>(9) That such conventions should be held every two or three years.</p>
   <p>Then the speaker, Mr. G., was called to deliver a speech. He explained the value of science, the importance of the convention in Philadelphia, and the revolution. The speaker said that one German professor stated that in 1905 there will be a revolution in Russia. The people will gain freedom and Russia will be transformed into a federation of autonomous states.</p>
   <p>At present it looks as if the prophecy is coming true. Therefore we must help as much as we can in the struggle for freedom.</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Mr. K., also spoke about the revolution. The speaker <pb facs="5423970_3_1380.jpg" n="4"/>stated that it is not the tsar alone who is our enemy, but religion also, because every religion says that all governments are given by God. Religion keeps the people in ignorance; the more the people are ignorant, the easier it is to exploit them. But the people began to see the light, to see the wolves in sheep skins and started to fight against exploitation.</p>
   <p>The third speaker, Mr. K., spoke on the value of education. He took for example the Lithuanian schools in America. What will people get from such schools that teach nothing but prayer? In such schools the brains of the youth are poisoned with religious falsehoods, and when the pupils leave the schools they remain ignorant to the end of their lives.</p>
   <p>The last speaker, Mr. G., mentioned the massacre at the Providence of God church in Chicago. It was not enough for the priest to skin the people of their last penny, he also demanded their blood. Perhaps the priest is satisfied now, but the blood of the innocent people calls for revenge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1381.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Then a collection was made; we have collected $36.87. This proves that the people are supporting the convention because they give money freely.</p>
   <p>We have many people who are serving humanity, but we have ten times more people who are still worshiping Mammon. The time is not far distant when the people will recognize what is good and what is bad. They will get rid of harmful superstitions and will go along the road of morality to fortune and freedom.</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Mass Meeting.</p>
