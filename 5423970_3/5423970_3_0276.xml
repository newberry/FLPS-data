   <p>We wish to call the special attention of our readers to the activities of the West Side Chicago Lithuanian societies in behalf of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. About fourteen Lithuanian organizations in the West Side district have united for the purpose of raising funds for Lithuanian war relief. These organizations are of various partisan shades; nevertheless, they knew how to get together and work in unity. The results of their labor are astonishing.</p>
   <p>These organizations have appointed a number of solicitors for donations, and have arranged a benefit bazaar and a benefit social. We do not know how much money has thus far been collected by the solicitors, but the bazaar and social <pb facs="5423970_3_0277.jpg" n="2"/>netted a profit of $1,050! This large sum was raised within four days, thanks to the efforts of the organizations of only one district. Other Chicago Lithuanian districts, as well as other Lithuanian colonies in America, can benefit by emulating the united West Side Chicago Lithuanian organizations.</p>
   <p>The achievement of the West Side societies in this charitable purpose shows that even mountains can be moved with united efforts.</p>
