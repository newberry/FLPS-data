   <p>The Dr. V. Kudirka Theatrical Club organized two months ago by Lithuanians in the Town of Lake colony of Chicago. The club does not have any by-laws yet, but it is known that it will be a progressive organization and will work for the uplift of our brothers in America. The activities of the club will be in the field of art; it will organize and present theatrical and musical programs.</p>
   <p>Although the club was just recently organized, preparations are already being made to stage "Amerika Pirtyj" (America in the Bath), a comedy-drama. The club is growing unusually fast; it already has about thirty members. It is to be regretted, however, that so far not even one girl has joined <pb facs="5423970_3_0853.jpg" n="2"/>the club; but we believe that in time our girls will also learn to understand the important role of art in life.</p>
   <p>In order to raise more funds for the operating expenses of the club a dance was given on February 20, at St. V. Radzevicius Hall, on the corner of 46th Street and Marshfield Avenue. Although on that day there were dance entertainments in every saloon in the community, nevertheless, a fairly large crowd attended the dance of the club. The club is very grateful for the wonderful support it received.</p>
   <p>Regular meetings of the club, during which new members are accepted, are <pb facs="5423970_3_0854.jpg" n="3"/>held on the first Sunday of every month at the St. V. Radzevicius Hall. The initiation fee is now only fifty cents; later it will be increased. Any moral Lithuanian is eligible for membership.</p>
