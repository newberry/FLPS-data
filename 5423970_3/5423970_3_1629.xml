<title level="a">APPEAL TO THE PARISHIONERS OF THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD PARISH IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>

   <p>On March 26, 1905, a meeting was held in which the rector explained that a debt of $41,719.88 was owing on the parish property. When the parishioners heard of this debt there was an uproar and commotion.</p>
   <p>The parish committee said that the upkeep of the rector's relatives was too high. It also stated that the debt was made without the knowledge and consent of the parish committee. At the meeting it was decided to elect a special committee which should go to the archbishop to ask him what the parish should do about the rector's making a debt without the knowledge of the parishioners, and to find out the truth of the priest's assertion that the archbishop does not permit the parishioners to control the parish affairs and assets. The priest says that it is a sin for the parishioners to look into the affairs and the budget of the parish. It was decided that the committee should call a parish meeting after getting the necessary information from the archbishop. The committee had been elected from the parish members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1630.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The priest's committee promised on March 22nd to elect its delegates to go to the archbishop to find out on what day he would receive the committee. The archbishop said that he would receive the committee on April 11th. When the priest's committee heard of this, no doubt instructed by the priest, they began to spread a false alarm. They put out the report that the archbishop would fasten the committee in a room and give a hundred lashes to every one. Nevertheless, we, the committee, elected by the parish, did not get scared, but went to the archbishop. The archbishop explained to us many points that we never knew before. He explained what were the duties of the parish and the duties of the priest. About the lashes he said nothing. We found out that the instructions of the archbishop are entirely different from those of the priest.</p>
   <p>When we came back from the archbishop, the priest's committee, which was afraid to go to the archbishop, inquired of us what the archbishop said. We answered to them that we would explain at the general parish meeting, and asked them to call the meeting. But the priest's committee up to the present time has not called the meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1631.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>They said that the priest and his supporters are not permitted to call a parish meeting.</p>
   <p>The parishioners must not forget that they elected us to go to the archbishop and decided at the meeting to announce what the archbishop said. We fulfilled our mission and we are willing to tell the parishioners what we found out, what the priest is concealing from them, and what the archbishop said to us. It is important not only to us but to all the parishes in Chicago, because in all the parishes the priests are concealing the archbishop's directions to the churches.</p>
   <p>I announce to the Providence of God parishioners who want to know what the archbishop said, come to me and I will tell you what I heard. I am at my home after 6 P. M. You can apply by letter.</p>
   <p>Joseph Gedvill, 163 W. 18th St.</p>
   <p>Editor's note: Seems to us that you can call the parish meeting by advertising with leaflets. Such a meeting cannot be stopped by the priest nor by his committee.</p>
