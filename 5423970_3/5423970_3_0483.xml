   <p>I have just acquired a pamphlet of the works of H. N. Bialik, a wellknown writer who died recently, and I have studied his opinion on the necessity of knowing the language of one's fathers. It is admirable. American-Lithuanians should appreciate this opinion. Through the present lack of knowledge of our language and through intermarriage the American-Lithuanians seem doomed to disappear as a nationalistic group.</p>
   <p>Let me quote a few of the author's opinions on the language:</p>
   <p>"A people without a language is not a nation, but a band of gypsies.</p>
   <p>"Only language preserves the characteristic modes of expression of a people.</p>
   <p>"He who knows his own nation's culture from translation may be likened to a <pb facs="5423970_3_0484.jpg" n="2"/>person who kisses his mother through a handkerchief.</p>
   <p>"The recognition of the dominance of the national tongue is likewise a declaration of the existence of a nation as a single entity united by one national desire. He who denies the truthfulness of this assertion denies the very unity of the people."</p>
   <p>Every statement is strikingly true.</p>
   <p>We must forget the idea that in America only English should be spoken. This idea, if carried through, would greatly impoverish the American culture. To know more than one language means to be more erudite, more versatile and to enjoy wider and greater associations and opportunities.</p>
   <p>Every person should acquire the knowledge of at least two languages; the English and his mother-tongue.</p>
   <p>We Lithuanians should especially do all we can to know our own Lithuanian <pb facs="5423970_3_0485.jpg" n="3"/>better than we do. We must never forget that our parents suffered persecutions under the despotic Polish and Russian rule, many of them have been exiled to Siberia or ruthlessly killed because they were unwilling to give up their ancient and beautiful Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>The language used by Lithuanian people is recognized by philologists as the Letto-Lithuanian group of the Aryan speech. Philologists recognize three distinct dialects of the Lithuanian, namely; I., Lithuanian; II., Old Prussian; and III., The Lettish. The Old Prussian became extinct in the 14th century.</p>
   <p>The Linguistic Evidences, which by philologists are regarded as a"fossil history," occupy the most important place in the hypothetical speculations as to the origin and the original location of Lithuanians. Isaac Taylor, in his book, The Origin of Aryans, leads the scholars in his observation to the importance the Lithuanians occupy in the family of the Aryan people. He contends, that the Lithuanian language is the original Aryan speech; and secondly, that the Lithuanians have the best claim to represent the original Aryans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0486.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Benjamin W. Dwight, in his book, Modern Philology seconds Isaac Taylor with the assertion, that, the Lithuanian language is the oldest language in the world. Most striking is, of course, the likeness of the Lithuanian language with the Sanskrit, which became a dead language some fourteen centuries before Christ, or before Hellenic civilization came into being. And yet, Isaac Taylor contends that the cradle of the Aryan race must have been in the Lithuanian regions.</p>
   <p>Now that we have all the freedom to use our ancient language it would be a crime to let it pass into oblivion.</p>
