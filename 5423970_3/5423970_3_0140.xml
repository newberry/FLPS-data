   <p>All that is required of you to join the Red Cross is a sincere heart and a dollar a year. Join and augment the hopes of that "greatest mother of the world" in order that she will be able to continue her charitable work in the future. Join at once, so that, when the membership rolls are put in order before Christmas, you, too, will be able to say, "My name is there!"</p>
   <p>We have all been affected by the war; therefore, we should all belong to the Red Cross. The dollar you pay for membership will be a Christmas gift to our soldiers, sailors, and aviators, and to those others who have felt the brutality of the war which we were so fortunate as to miss.</p>
   <p>The aim of the Red Cross is to bestow a Christmas gift upon our soldiers <pb facs="5423970_3_0141.jpg" n="2"/>in France, and to give some cheer to the sufferers: the aged, the widows, and the little children. We have heard much about their suffering. Let us visit them in spirit with at least a small donation, and thus soothe their hearts.</p>
   <p>It would be wonderful news to our soldiers overseas, and to the Allies, if they were to hear that every American, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, regardless of race or nationality, was joining this great organization and adding his bit for a Christmas gift.</p>
   <p>And that is not difficult to do. Last year twenty-two million adults and eight million children belonged to the Red Cross. If they will again join and each bring a friend, the aim will be achieved.</p>
   <p>Remember, all that is asked of you is a sincere heart and a dollar.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva will willingly act as an agent for donors, and those wishing <pb facs="5423970_3_0142.jpg" n="3"/>to join the Red Cross. The money will be turned over to the officers of the Red Cross, and the names of donors of a dollar or more will be published in this newspaper.</p>
   <p>You can also join at any of the Red Cross booths.</p>
