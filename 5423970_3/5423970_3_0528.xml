   <p>We find a very interesting letter in No. 26 of the Tevyne. That newspaper, in writing about the recent conventions in Waterbury, had praised the Lithuanian girls who, it said, are good Lithuanians though they have been born here. The newspaper belittled the American-born Lithuanian boys for their Americanization and because they only "dance the jig on corners."</p>
   <p>A certain Frank Giegznas (a 16-year-old boy, born and raised here) could not stand that and wrote a letter to the Tevyne, pointing out that he takes music lessons from M. Petrauskas, that he participated in a concert arranged by the students, that he also participated in the presentation of the opera "Birute," and that, though he was born here, he associates more with Lithuanians than <pb facs="5423970_3_0529.jpg" n="2"/>with "Yankees." He was therefore hurt when he was, willingly or unwillingly, included with those who "dance the jig on corners." He states further that the "Yankees" like him very much: he belongs to the Y. M. C. A., to baseball and basketball clubs and has won a trophy for swimming. He states that everything that the American-born Lithuanian youth does with the American youth is well publicized in the English newspapers, which praise them and even publish their photos, thus enticing the youth to activity.</p>
   <p>All this is lacking in the Lithuanian newspapers. Even after the Waterbury conventions, which were well attended by the youth, the youth could not find anything written about themselves in the Lithuanian newspapers. Therefore they even became angry. In part, Mr. Giegznas probably states the truth when he says: "It is bad that our newspapers do not know how to arouse our youth."</p>
   <p>Every youth, everyone who has been a youth, must admit that Mr. Giegznas' complaint is in place. We cannot complain that our youth is being denationalized if we do not provide that toward which the youth is inclined: the <pb facs="5423970_3_0530.jpg" n="3"/>entertainments, games, and all the sports which appeal to the nature of youth. Since we do not provide them, they find them by the Americans, who gladly and bountifully give them to the youth and, unconsciously, draw the youth to themselves.</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that Mikas Petrauskas, up to now, has been probably the only individual among us who knew how to succeed in satisfying our youth. He has thus done much good. Giegznas' letter testifies to that: he says that, if not for Petrauskas, he probably would be "associating only with Yankees today." However, the gigantic task of holding American-born youth to Lithuanianism cannot be borne on the shoulders of one man. The youth demands not only serious advice and criticism and other strong medicines; it also demands, besides intelligent leadership, various kinds of tinsel and toys which satisfy youthful ambition, lighten the work and supply the willingness to continue in that path. Mention of youth's activities in our newspapers belongs to that category of tinsel and toys.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0531.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>All of this shows that we have a vast field to work and that we either do not want to work it or that we are lacking in special tools. It cannot be said that our newspapers do not want to work. It would be truer to say that we do not yet have the proper tools. Our newspapers (even though it seems we do have many of them) are ailing with a chronic shortage of space for short, local items, because even those several pages are filled with empty, often entirely idiotic, polemics between correspondents and even between the editors themselves. While tormenting ourselves with all kinds of "gods," all kinds of "religions," all kinds of "isms," and other kinds of "spirits," we do not even realize that we are speeding by the true, realistic, vital work. Then, when we are through arguing, condemning, and scolding, we look around for the rabbit we were supposed to be hunting and find that even his footprints have cooled long ago.</p>
   <p>We would be able to turn more attention to our youth and devote more space to news of youth, if only we had one or two dailies. However, while we do not have them, we must admit that.... the American-Lithuanian newspapers must necessarily have special sections for youth--even though we already <pb facs="5423970_3_0532.jpg" n="5"/>have so many sections in our comparatively small newspapers that, in some newspapers, there are more "sections" than columns.</p>
