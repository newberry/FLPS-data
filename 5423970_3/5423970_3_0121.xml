   <p>The bloody claws of the Russian Czarist government are reaching into the United States. The "kings" of this republic are extending the hand of "brotherly love" to the Czarist government. They are starting to surrender escaped revolutionaries from Russia. In an effort to stop this vicious practice, a resolution has been introduced in Washington in the Senate and House of Representatives. If this resolution is passed, then the spirit of "Brotherly love" between these two governments will be greatly moderated.</p>
   <p>The resolution, which is known as "Concurrent Resolution No. 28," was introduced in the Senate by Hon. A. Hopkins of Illinois, and in the House of Representatives by Hon. William S. Bennet of New York. A copy of the resolution may be had on request by writing to Washington.</p>
   <p>In order to insure the approval of the above resolution, it is necessary to obtain about half a million signatures of American citizens. At the present time Jonas Purenas, a Latvian, is imprisoned in New York, awaiting deportation to Russia. He is an escaped revolutionist from Russia. If we hurry and collect enough signatures, then he and many others will be assured that they are living <pb facs="5423970_3_0122.jpg" n="2"/>in a free country where the bloody claws of the Russian Czarist government will be unable to reach them. Immigrants of all nationalities from the Russian Empire are now busily engaged in collecting signatures to support the resolution. We Lithuanians must get busy at once and perform our full share of the work so as to insure the collection of a sufficient number of signatures.</p>
