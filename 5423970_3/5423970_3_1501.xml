   <p>Lithuanians have a new national church in the Town of Lake. This church is established by the people, who don't want to belong to the Roman Catholic Church and pay heavy dues to Rome. Rev. Jankauskas of the Lithuanian National Church worked ardently for many years before he organized and established the Lithuanian National church in Chicago. Today, the parish is in good standing financially and well managed by Rev. Jankauskas. The value of the church property is $24,000. Most of its debts are paid now, and only $10,000 remains unpaid. But in a few years the remainder of the debt will be paid out and the parish property will be cleared of all debts. At the present time the total number of members is 400. and the number is growing rapidly. In one year we expect to have about 600 new members in our parish. The people began to like the Independent Lithuanian National Church. There is a good reason why the people admire the Lithuanian National Church more than the Roman Catholic Church. The reason is this: that at the Lithuanian National Church there is a real spirit of democracy and friendship between Rev. Jankauskas and the members of the parish. This parish we can call a big happy family, where there is no disputes between Rev. Jankauskas and the members of his church. Roman Catholic priests are at war constantly with the members of their parish. Catholic priests are charging their parish members too heavy fees for weddings.</p>

   <p>christenings, etc. In addition, the members of the parish must throw into the collection basket fifteen cents every Sunday, and if he cannot come to church on Sunday he must put in fifteen cents in the envelop and give it to his children to put in the collection basket. It is imperative that every member put in fifteen cents in the collection basket on Sunday morning and their children must put in not less than a nickel. If one of the parishioners' dies he must be buried according to the customs of the catholic church, and funeral service must be in the catholic church, which costs at least $25.00. If he does not have at least $25.00, he cannot have funeral services in the catholic church and he is buried in a certain section of the catholic cemetary away from the rest of the members of the church. If a man cannot afford to pay a fee of at least $25.00, he is not looked upon as a good catholic, and he cannot have the same privileges as other members of the catholic church. In other words, if you are poor, you are a poor catholic and you don't deserve a funeral service. That is the policy of the catholic priests. Those people who were poor, as a rule, were called by the catholic priests, paupers, and they cannot be called good members of the catholic church. The catholic priests are very independent and have nothing in common with the members of the parish. These priests don't want to cooperate with the people of the parish, they prefer to be left alone and manage the affairs and finances of the church as they see fit and to their advantage. The people in these parishes have no voice, the priest is sole judge <pb facs="5423970_3_1503.jpg" n="3"/>of everything and he does things his own way, whether people like it or not, his decision is final and nobody has any right to dispute his statement. He dictates the policies of the church to the people of his parish. To oppose the Divine Father, is committing a sacrilege and sin. He must agree with everything the catholic priest does; even, if he is wrong a man has no right to show a contrary opinion to his (the priest's) statement. Moreover, the priest, is the guardian of his soul; his spiritual leader and a teacher of the catholic faith, and in that event he cannot criticize, make a comment or make the slightest remark against him, even though he is in the wrong. He must look upon the priest as a Divine Father, who is guarding his soul from perishing in hell. After all, we see that these people who belong to catholic churches are not treated like human beings, but like animals. They pay high prices for everything the priest does and the latter gets any favors from them. And, if he dies poor, the priest won't give a funeral service at the catholic church. This is the real reason, why so many people are quitting catholic churches and coming to the Lithuanian National Church, which is located now in the Town of Lake. There are other reasons for coming to the Lithuanian National Church and these reasons are as follows: first, the church itself belongs to the people of the parish and not to Irish Bishops; second, there is no compulsory dues to be paid to the Lithuanian National Church; third, the members are not threatened with hell if they don't put anything in the collection basket on Sunday morning; fourth, the people, without any discrimination, are all welcome at the Lithuanian National <pb facs="5423970_3_1504.jpg" n="4"/>Church, and all are treated equally. At the Lithuanian National Church, there exists a real spirit of democracy and a spirit of brotherhood between the members of the parish and Rev. Jankauskas. Last week, at the Lithuanian National Church, a funeral service was held, where 2,000 people participated. The funeral procession passed the "Holy Cross" catholic church which is located in the Town of Lake. The catholic priests, who saw this large funeral procession, were astonished and their blood was boiling as they were looking through the windows of the "Holy Cross" rectory. This procession, we believe spoiled their blood as they watched the procession go by the "Holy Cross" catholic church. The catholic priests, expecially Lithuanian catholic priests, condemned the Lithuanian National Church, and told their parishioners during pospel, not to go to the Lithuanian National Church, that it is a sin to go to that church.</p>
