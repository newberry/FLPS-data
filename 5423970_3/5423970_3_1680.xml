   <p>Lithuanians in South Chicago are establishing a new Lithuanian Catholic congregation. At the first meeting which was held, an excellent address was delivered by priest Peza. In his address he explained how it is everybody's duty to be good spiritually at the same time as we ought to be patriots of our fatherland Lithuania. Quite a good number of people met and they were very much satisfied with priest Peza's speech. After priest Peza's speech, congregational committee was elected: Mr. Iz. Petrartis and a few saloon keepers were among those elected. Everybody agreed on matters discussed at the meeting with the exception of a few who gave questions about new church, who would own it, the congregation or the bishop? Priest Peza answered that the church would be managed in the same manner as all Catholic churches. People left the meeting satisfied.</p>
   <p>Priest Peza immediately rented on November 18 the Polish hall, which he got for nothing, to the new congregation for its first mass. The people were happy even though they did not trust the two saloon keepers who had forced themselves on the committee. Because of these two, the people refused to <pb facs="5423970_3_1681.jpg" n="2"/>trust the committee with money to be collected for the building of the church. It is hard to say how it will turn out.</p>

   <p>Editor's note:-</p>
   <p>We received from South Chicago Lithuanians several letters in which they make complaints about two saloon keepers who were elected in the newly established congregational committee and whom the members of the congregation did not wish to have. The committee was elected not very long ago; if you do not trust then why did you elect them? In other words, if you knew how to elect them, why can't you now expel them if you don't like them?</p>
