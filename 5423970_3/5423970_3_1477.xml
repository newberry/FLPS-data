   <p>The Lithuanian Roman Catholic Federation held its fourth annual congress at the St. George Parish Hall on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of last week. One hundred and four delegates attended. Six sessions were held.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. B. Serafinas was the chairman. Dr. A. L. Graiciunas was first vice-chairman; the second vice-chairman was Mrs. J. F. Kasetis. The Reverend Augustaitis (Girardville, Pennsylvania) was the secretary.</p>
   <p>The greater part of the time was devoted to the reading of papers. Reverend Jakaitis spoke extemporaneously on parish organization. Reverend Misius talked on Lithuanian colleges. The following read papers: Reverend Visniauskas, "Why the Lithuanian-Americans Need a Bishop of Their Own"; Dr. A. L. Graiciunas, "Our Parish Schools"; Reverend A. Staniukynas, "The Tasks of St. Casimer's Convent"; Reverend Lapelis, "Our Press"; Reverend Kemesis, "The Task of Temperance"; "The <pb facs="5423970_3_1478.jpg" n="2"/>Tasks of Our Charity Groups," The Revision of the Federation's Constitution," and "The Organization of the National Fund"; Reverend Serafinas, "Children's Organizations," etc. Several papers were not read because of the shortage of time.</p>
   <p>The following were elected officers of the Federation for the next year: Reverend J. Misius, president; Kadzievskis, vice-president; J. Kaupas, secretary; J. J. Elias, treasurer. It was decided to hold the next congress in Brooklyn next fall.</p>
   <p>Entertainment programs were arranged in the evenings at St. George Hall. The most important one took place on Thursday night when the united Lithuanian parish choirs presented "Brothers" (words by M. Gustaitis, music by C. Sosnauskas). A. Pocius directed, The author of the cantata, Mr. Gustaitis, was present and appeared on the stage for a bow. A flashlight photo of the choirs and Mr. Gustaitis was taken.</p>
