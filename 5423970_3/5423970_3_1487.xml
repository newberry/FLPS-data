   <p>The Chicago Catholic bishop is the owner of all the Catholic churches in Chicago. As the owner of the property, he has all the legal rights to handle his property as he sees fit. The bishop is owner of the Lithuanian St. George's Church, which is located in Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>The bishop is worried now about Lithuanian churches, because this church has not yet paid out its debts to him. The church at present is in debt and, in addition, the bishop made the mortgage of $88,000 on St. George's church. The Lithuanian people will have to pay out this sum and 51/2% interest on the sum within five years. The amount of the annual payment on the principal in cash, as the bishop has arranged it, is $17,600, and the interest is $4,920. The burden of the mortgage fell on the members of St. George's parish, who are the victims of the priests and bishops.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1488.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is a little too much for the Bridgeport Lithuanian Catholics to pay that sum of money in such a short period of time. The members of the parish will have to pawn their last pair of pants in order to pay out that sum of money in five years. This is a very good contribution for the fools who don't know any better. If they are fools, let them pay and pay, we cannot feel sorry for people who want to be exploited by the priests and the bishops of the Catholic Church. They are nothing but lambs and will remain lambs the rest of their lives and nobody in the whole world can teach them and make them see that they are exploited unjustly. The Lithuanians must pay money to the Union Trust Company and keep quiet, and the Union Trust Company will be the boss. This company will keep this church until the Lithuanians pay out the debt of $88,000 to the Union Trust Company.</p>
   <p>Hurrah! Lithuanian Catholics are helping the Irish bishops and the Catholic priests; help them more and you may get a front row seat in heaven when you die. Those people who pay more money usually <pb facs="5423970_3_1489.jpg" n="3"/>get better seats in heaven, and those who pay less only get back seats. In order to make these people pay, it is best to keep them in ignorance, because the more ignorant they are the more they pay to them, and in addition, they remain contented even though they are exploited.</p>
   <p>So that is that, and the ignorant people are happy.</p>
