   <p>The South Englewood branch of the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund has been unceasingly active in its efforts to raise as much money for the Fund as possible. This small Lithuanian colony has already raised about five hundred dollars toward this end.</p>
   <p>The directors of the local branch of the Fund held a meeting during the latter part of June. The secretary in his financial report stated that the income of the branch from December, 1915 to June 15, 1916 was as follows:</p>

     <cell>Total</cell>
     <cell>$150.47 (sic)</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>After hearing the report made by Secretary B. Janulis, the directors decided to send $125 to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund, $25 of which was designated for the autonomy section of the Fund. Thus, the balance which still remains in the treasury of the branch is $25.47 (sic).</p>
