   <p>The Lithuanians of Chicago commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Dr. V. Kudirka (1858-1899), Lithuanian patriot and author of the Lithuanian national anthem, on January 1, at the hall of the McCormick Worker's Club, on Blue Island Avenue, between Leavitt Street and Oakley Avenue. It was the largest and most impressive celebration ever held by the Lithuanians of Chicago. Preparations for the event were being made for several months by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, the Farmers of Lithuania Society, and other Chicago Lithuanian societies.</p>
   <p>B. K. Balutis (famous Chicago Lithuanian attorney who became editor of the Lietuva in 1918. After the World War he moved to Lithuania and <pb facs="5423970_3_0856.jpg" n="2"/>became the Lithuanian ambassador to the United States), who acted as master of ceremonies, called the meeting to order and explained the purpose of the gathering - to honor Kudirka. After his talk he called upon the choral group of the Birute Music and Dramatic Society to open the program by singing the American and Lithuanian national anthems.</p>
   <p>The hall was packed to capacity with Lithuanians of all religions and political beliefs. A large artistic photograph of Kudirka, decorated with a green wreath, stood on the stage. Smaller copies of this photograph were distributed to all those who attended the commemoration.</p>
   <p>P. L. Sernas (editor of the Lietuva), who was a close friend and associate of Kudirka, delivered the first oration of the evening. He spoke on the importance of Kudirka's literary contributions to the Lithuanian nation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0857.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>His address was very interesting and well-received by the audience. However, he precipitated some ill feeling among the audience, which contained many Catholics, by stating that the years which Kudirka had spent in a Catholic seminary in preparation for the priesthood were a waste of time.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Sernas' address, Anthony Pocius, youthful but talented and very promising Lithuanian musician, entertained the audience with a few numbers of the piano. His best numbers were "Varpelis" (Little Bell) and "Sudiev" (Adieu). Mr. Pocius is a former pupil of Mikas Petrauskas, famous Lithuanian musician and composer.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas was the second speaker. He explained the social and economic conditions under which Kudirka conducted his literary activities. Like the first speaker, he also introduced a religious note <pb facs="5423970_3_0858.jpg" n="4"/>in his talk. He stated that the cultural uplift of the Lithuanian nation is impossible without the aid of our Catholics; anyone who attempts to carry on any cultural activities outside the sphere of our Catholics can only do harm to our nation.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was A. Zmuidinavicius (Zemaitis), famous Lithuanian sculptor and artist who is in Chicago on a visit from Lithuania. He spoke on Kudirka's place in the history of Lithuanian art. Mr. Zmuidinavicius (Zemaitis), who is president of the Art Society of Lithuania, was honored by being the conductor of the first Lithuanian art exhibit, which took place in Vilna, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was B. K. Balutis, who lauded Kudirka in a long and impressive talk. He asked the Lithuanians to support the efforts of <pb facs="5423970_3_0859.jpg" n="5"/>the Lovers of the Fatherland Society to publish the literary works of Kudirka. Mr. Balutis displayed exceptional ability as an orator. He is one of the few really great orators among Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
