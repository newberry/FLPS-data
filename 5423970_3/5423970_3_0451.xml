   <p>Once more we appeal to our Lithuanian brothers in order to understand our national ideas, to have love towards our fellowman and God, we ought to come and help our innocent brother Blauzda, who requires from his countrymen spiritual and material help. Brothers we must sign an affidavit to prove that our brother Blauzda is a man of good character, this is necessary to defend him in his case and for his freedom.</p>
   <p>On the 18th day of December, 1892,our countrymen helped him as much as they could, we are thanking them very much.</p>
   <p>We have hope that the honorable members of Saint Casimir's Society will not forget their brother and will help him in his distress.</p>
   <p>Do not forget countrymen that this cause ought to show brotherhood among us, and also, this will make us worthy among other nations.</p>
