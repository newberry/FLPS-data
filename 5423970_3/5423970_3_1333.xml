   <p>The second national convention of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society took place on June 2-4, 1909, at Worcester, Mass.</p>
   <p>There were twenty-nine delegates from seventeen branches of the society at the convention. The following delegates represented two branches of the society in Chicago: M. J. Damijonaitis, Dr. A. J. Zimontas, F. P. Bradchulis, Dr. J. Kulis, and A. J. Bierzinskas.</p>
   <p>The Society has fifty branches in the United States and Canada. There are four branches in Chicago, and one in South Chicago, Ill. The total membership of the society is 1,069. The four Chicago branches have a total of one hundred fifty-four members; the South Chicago branch has twenty-six <pb facs="5423970_3_1334.jpg" n="2"/>members.</p>
   <p>The financial standing of the society is as follows: On May 27, 1908 the treasury contained $347.07. Receipts from membership dues from May 27, 1908 to June 1, 1909 amounted to $732.86; total donations to the fund for the publication of the literary works of Dr. V. Kudirka amounted to $1558.37 on June 1, 1909. Expenditures amounted to $293.12. Therefore a total of $2345.18 remains in the treasury at present.</p>
   <p>The society was established in 1896. However, it was legalized only in 1909, when a charter was taken out in the state of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The librarian reported that the Society has 20,726 copies of nineteen different books.</p>
   <p>B. K. Balutis, of 819 W. 32nd Street, Chicago, Ill., was elected president <pb facs="5423970_3_1335.jpg" n="3"/>of the society. Joseph Laukis, of 3252 S. Halsted Street, was elected a member of the literary committee. M. J. Damijonaitis, of Chicago, was elected to a committee for the revision of the constitution of the society.</p>
