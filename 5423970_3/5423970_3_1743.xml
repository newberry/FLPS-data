   <p>My dear Editor of Katalikas:</p>
   <p>Will you be so kind as to put in your paper a few lines of my article. I had an occasion to be at one of the meetings which are being called by the troublemakers who are trying to break up the St. George's Parish. Being a good member of our parish, I was compelled to go to that meeting and find out what those people wanted, who is disturbing the peace in our parish. I had an occasion to be at both meetings, but I failed to find out their aim and purpose. At the first meeting which was held at the Turner Hall and Halsted Street, I only found that their speakers were abusing and making fun of our rector, bishop and pope, calling them thieves and drunkards. One of the speakers went a little too far by making a statement that even God is a drunkard. I could not tolerate such expression any longer.Many other people were in the same predicament and felt insulted, and finally revolted. Ladies, especially, became enraged and called the speakers crooks, disturbers of peace and threatened to call the police and arrest the speakers. After everything had <pb facs="5423970_3_1744.jpg" n="2"/>quieted down in the hall, I asked for permission to speak in behalf of our parish. When I was granted the permission to speak, I explained to them clearly that their argument was based on the question of who is going to be selected for the parish committee.</p>
   <p>This argument started because everyone of the speakers wanted to be on the committee board to handle church affairs. Those speakers especially opposed to the committee which was selected by Rev. Kraucunas and tried to prove that this committee was not competent enough to cope with the affairs of our parish. The opposing party was determined to change our policies and the system that took five years to build under the leadership of Rev. Kraucunas.</p>
   <p>Now they are trying to destroy everything that we have built. After I had finished my speech, there was one more from the opposing party who wished to speak, but there was nothing more to say and the people started to go home.</p>
   <p>The next meeting was held at the Pulaski Hall. The very same people held the meeting at the Pulaski Hall, the people that opposed at the first meeting Rev. Kraucunas and called the priests and bishops thieves and drunkards.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1745.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And at the second meeting they elected a committee from among themselves and decided to send it to the bishop and request the bishop to remove Rev. Kraucunas from St. George's parish, and to send another priest to that parish. This would be agreeable to them.</p>
   <p>At the second meeting there were no speeches because there were not so many people at this gathering. Having seen me at their meetings, and knowing that I am holding Rev. Kraucunas' side, the opposing party sent to me a member of their committee, by the name of Graicunas, who asked me to take him to Rev. Kraucuans in order to find a compromise for the two parties.</p>
   <p>I, being a good citizen, accepted Dr. Graicunas' proposition after a short consideration, and requested him to set his conditions for a compromise. "Our conditions are common," answered Dr. Graicunas. "First, Rev. Kraucunas will have to remove the organist, the vestryman, and the editor, and put in their place people from our side. Second, we will have to buy out the printing establishment and the building from Mr. Olszewski. Thirdly, Graicuans is to receive a fee of $200 from Rev. Kraucunas for his work as committeeman in the Lithuanian congress. Fourthly, we all should be recognized <pb facs="5423970_3_1746.jpg" n="4"/>as a church committee, consisting of the following members:</p>
   <p>(1) Graicunas</p>
   <p>(2) Olszewskis</p>
   <p>(3) Jonaitis</p>
   <p>(4) Kunca</p>
   <p>(5) Pocevicia</p>
   <p>(6) Bijanskis</p>
   <p>(7) Skinder</p>
   <p>Fifthly, this contract will be signed and the request recognized as long as Rev. Kraucunas is rector of our parish. However, if he does not recognize our committee's request, the war will start again.</p>
   <p>Such was the request made by Mr. Graicunas and the above mentioned committee.</p>
   <p>Stanley Rokos.</p>
