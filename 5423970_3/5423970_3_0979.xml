   <p>To have the Lithuanian intelligentsia educated in various branches of science and to uplift the Lithuanian nation, two years ago in Chicago there was organized the Society Aurora, which took as its purpose the helping of poor Lithuanian students who are seeking higher education. The Aurora gets the money from the monthly dues of its members and from the donations of the people of good will. By organizing this society the sponsors have hopes that this organization will bring great benefit to our fatherland; that our nation which has been oppressed in the past, belongs to the enlightened and cultured generations of the future; that the younger generation will go forward with our aims already begun, and that it will accomplish more than we have done.</p>
   <p>Our youth is the hope of the future. Bravely and energetically it will <pb facs="5423970_3_0980.jpg" n="2"/>seek for higher ideals. With our help and instruction the younger generation will strive not only to improve living conditions but they will strive to uplift culturally their fatherland.</p>
   <p>The resurrection of the fatherland is not based on grabbing large territories, neither is it the material condition of one person, but the mental uplifting of all the nation, to bring into light the development of talents and of genius which today are dying in the hard struggle for existence.</p>
   <p>We want to live, to stand in the rolls of the existing nations, we are anxious to be equal with them in education and culture. Only then will come from our midst the poets, the artists, the scientists, and the men of literature, who will strive for the betterment of our fatherland and for the good of all humanity. Therefore, the Aurora <pb facs="5423970_3_0981.jpg" n="3"/>Society appeals to the public for support of this great cause - to help the poor Lithuanian students. You can make collections, or you can organize branches of this society in every Lithuanian colony. You can raise money through monthly dues, the donations, profits from concerts, banquets, etc. At present we have two branches of the Aurora Society: one in Chicago, the other in Scranton, Pa. The organizing of such branches of this society all depends on the degree of intelligence of the local Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of our compatriots to join us in this organization, to help us prepare the younger Lithuanian generation for the cultural road. The donations you can send to Lietuva, 924 33rd St., Chicago, Ill., and to Vienybe, 224 E. Main St., Plymouth, Pa. The names of the donators will be published in the Lithuanian newspapers. You can also send the money to Dr. A. L. Graiciunas, 167 W. 18th St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society.</p>
