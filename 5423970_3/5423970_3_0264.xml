<title level="a">HOLD MASS MEETING IN ENGLEWOOD TO RAISE FUNDS FOR WAR RELIEF</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Summary)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A mass meeting for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of Lithuanian war refugees in Russia was held on July 12 in the South Englewood Lithuanian colony. The principal speakers were Attorney A. Bulota, a Lithuanian member of the Russian Duma, who recently arrived in America to raise funds for the relief of Lithuanian war refugees, and Zemaite, famous Lithuanian woman writer who came to America with Attorney Bulota for the same purpose.</p>
   <p>The mass meeting was sponsored by Branch No. 170 of the Lithuanian Socialist League and by Branch No. 18 of the Lithuanian Workers' Literary Society.</p>
   <p>Although there were more than two hundred people at the meeting, only twelve dollars were collected. The failure to collect a larger sum is due largely <pb facs="5423970_3_0265.jpg" n="2"/>to Attorney Bulota's unpopularity among Lithuanian-Americans on account of his socialistic leanings and the alleged unfair criticism he is making against the Lithuanian war relief society in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>In the past, the South Englewood Lithuanians have been unusually generous with donations for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania, Although there are only three hundred Lithuanians living in South Englewood, they have thus far raised about $550 for Lithuanian war relief.</p>
