   <p>The West Side Lithuanian Societies' Organization for Lithuanian War Relief sponsored a benefit social yesterday in Meldazis Hall, 2242 West 23rd Place. The varied and interesting program began at 8 P. M. The entertainment consisted of music by a mandolin orchestra, declamations, piano solos, two speeches, and the presentation of a drama entitled "Aukso Dievaiciai" (Gods of Gold). The speeches were delivered by P. Grigaitis, editor of the Naujienos, and by Attorney Kucinskas.</p>
   <p>The Hall was filled to capacity; many were turned away because of lack of room. The West Side Clericalists [Catholics] attempted to make the affair a failure by holding a mass meeting of their own at the same time, but the people apparently did not pay any attention to them. During an intermission, a collection was made for Lithuanian war relief, but it is not known at this time how much money was collected. Admission to the affair was free.</p>

   <p>It should also be noted that the aforesaid group of organizations (fourteen in all) conducted a bazaar for Lithuanian war relief. The bazaar continued for four days, April 6,7,8, and 9, in Meldazis Hall, and was a great success. The amount realized from each affair will be published in a future issue of the Naujienos.</p>
