   <p>The buying of twenty-one acres of land for the National Cemetery was concluded last Friday. The full price for the land has been paid and deeds in the name of "The Lithuanian National Cemetery" have been recorded.</p>
   <p>Chicagoans never before effected a project as swiftly as the purchase of the National Cemetery. A sum of $6,600., which was paid for the land, was collected in three months.....</p>
   <p>May 30, Decoration Day, which Americans observe in honoring the soldiers killed in the war of 1861-1865, was selected as the date for the formal opening.</p>
   <p>Since people do not work that day, the founders of the Cemetery expect <pb facs="5423970_3_1553.jpg" n="2"/>between fifty and seventy-five thousand people to participate in the opening day ceremonies. Many Lithuanian organizations outside of Chicago--from Illinois and neighboring states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana--have promised to participate.</p>
