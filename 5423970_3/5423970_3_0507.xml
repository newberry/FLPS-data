   <p>A war census will soon be taken in the United States. (Details of this census appear in a separate article on page five of this issue of the Lietuva.) The government is asking for volunteers to work as census enumerators without pay.</p>
   <p>It is very important that as many Lithuanians as possible who can speak English and can do clerical work should volunteer as enumerators. By so doing, we will not only render a great service to our adopted country, but, at the same time, we will have an opportunity to render a service to our old fatherland, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>One of the questions asked in the registration blanks concerns the nationality <pb facs="5423970_3_0508.jpg" n="2"/>of the individual. It is important that all Lithuanians should be registered as Lithuanians. A Lithuanian enumerator would undoubtedly see to that, but a non-Lithuanian, especially a Polish enumerator, would probably register a Lithuanian as a Russian or a Pole.</p>
   <p>We consider this matter to be of utmost importance, especially in these historic times. We have read in the newspaper Ateitis (The Future) that the census in Boston, Massachusetts shows that there are only twenty-six hundred Lithuanians in Boston. Everyone knows that this figure does not represent even one half of the actual number of Lithuanians living in Boston. Who is to blame for this? The Lithuanians themselves are largely to blame, because many of them are not sufficiently race conscious. However, the enumerators are also to blame; they register the nationality of an individual to suit their own whims and fancies unless the individual insists upon an honest registration. Lithuanians must insist that they be honestly registered as Lithuanians; we must also see to it that as many Lithuanians as possible become <pb facs="5423970_3_0509.jpg" n="3"/>enumerators.</p>
   <p>The danger is not that the official figures will show a small number of Lithuanians. The danger lies in the fact that the non-Lithuanians know very well that in such a city as Boston (South Boston), for example, there are more than twenty-six hundred Lithuanians; therefore, this figure reveals to them that only twenty-six hundred Lithuanians in Boston desire to be classed as Lithuanians, and that the rest want to be classed as Poles, Russians, or as members of some other nationality.</p>
   <p>It is not hard to imagine the consequences if such an opinion about Lithuanians becomes widespread. It is not hard to understand what effect that would have upon the proposed independence of Lithuania. It is a very easy matter to deny liberty to a nation whose members are not race conscious.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let every Lithuanian who can qualify as an enumerator apply <pb facs="5423970_3_0510.jpg" n="4"/>immediately to the mayor of his city or town, to the county sheriff, or to the county clerk, and offer his services as enumerator during the war census.</p>
   <p>We wish to repeat that it is the duty of every Lithuanian to insist and see to it that he or she is registered honestly as a Lithuanian. Let us urge our neighbors and friends to do likewise. Also, give your names to the census enumerators in their true Lithuanian form and spelling. Eliminate all Polish or Russian characteristics from your names. For example, those who spell their names Szymkiewicz, Rimkiewicz, Berzinski, Zuronski, Petrowski should change them back to their true Lithuanian spelling, such as Simkevicius or Simkus, Rimkevicius or Rimkus, Berzinskas or Berzas, Zuronskis or Zuronas, Petrauskas or Petrulis. If you spell your name in true Lithuanian style, it will be very easy to recognize that you are a Lithuanian wherever your name appears, and should the need arise we may well be able to help you.</p>
