   <p>The board of directors of the National Lithuanian Cemetery issued a financial statement for the year 1916. The report shows that a total of sixty-three Lithuanians were buried in the Cemetery during that year. The total income for the year was $3,400, most of which was realized from the sale of burial plots, which amounted to $1,923. A picnic, which was held for the benefit of the Cemetery, and the proceeds from Memorial Day netted a total profit of $560.</p>
   <p>Expenses during that year amounted to $2,720.55, which includes a payment of $1,277 on the debt. The balance in the treasury now is $679.75, compared with only $244.95 last year.</p>
   <p>The officers of the board of ten directors are: B. Lubinas, chairman; J. Skutas, vice-president; S. Smardakis, treasurer; S. Danta, secretary. The janitor and caretaker of the cemetery is Mr. Ed. Cepulis.</p>
