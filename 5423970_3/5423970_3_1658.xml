  <body>
   <p>Our parish fights are like a cloud moving from one place to another and spreading disease in every parish. After the parish fights in Chicago and the priest's trial against Lietuva, the priest became dirtier than ever before. Rev. Masziotas and Rev. Peza were forced to leave their parishes in Pennsylvania; Rev. Abroskaviczius got scared and surrendered himself to the parishioners' rule; the priest of Waterbury, Conn., was unable to give an account of (the parish affairs) to the parishioners. Right now a hot fight is raging in the Lithuanian parish of Philadelphia. The parishioners there even locked the priest out of the church. The priest had to break in with the help of police. The parishioners sued the priest in civil court, and regardless of how the trial comes out, it will not make firmer the parishioners' faith. The main cause of these parish fights is not faith but money.</p>
   <p>Fights in the parishes could be stopped by the priests themselves. They do not know how to conduct affairs of faith and act like Don Quixote <pb facs="5423970_3_1659.jpg" n="2"/>with the windmill. They are fighting against Buddhism, which is so strange to the Lithuanians that they don't know what the priest is talking about. Condemning Buddhism is for children, not grown-ups. Adults demand something higher, more prudent, more enlightening, more educative.</p>
   <p>The priests may say that the fights in the parishes are provoked by the freethinkers. We know that the freethinkers do not belong to the church nor to the parish. Now, how can the freethinkers provoke fights?</p>
   <p>Dear clergy!! Such stories about the freethinkers are only fit for children, not for grown-ups. Adults have their eyes open and they can use their brains better than children.</p>
   <p>The clergy denounces the newspapers for writing or permitting (others to) write about their black deeds. The clergy says that the newspapers are the cause of the fights in the parishes. Newspapers are the supporters of the public. If someone writes about the priests, they (the priests) have the same right to answer back and clear up the attack on them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1660.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But, unfortunately, the fights in the parishes against the priests are not caused by the newspapers, but by the priests themselves. The priests are collecting money for the benefit of the parish and the church. Their wealth increases along with the debts of their parishes. This is not all. When the parish is being organized, the priest says that both church and parish properties belong to the parish. The people believe him and donate all they can. After a while, when the debt of the church becomes too large, the people demand an inquiry into the parish budget. Then the priest ups and says that the parishioners have no right to look into the parish budget because the church belongs to the bishop, and the priest, by order of the bishop, has full control of the parish financial affairs. When the parishioners find that the parish property has been assigned to the bishop, then trouble begins.</p>
   <p>Should there be no frauds committed by the priests in parish affairs, the freethinkers would have no chance to attack or criticize them. If the priests would preach Christianity and practice it, then everything <pb facs="5423970_3_1661.jpg" n="4"/>would go nicely in the parish affairs. But the clergy, like the tsar, denies the parishioners (the right) to think about the parish budget situation. There is no Russian government in this free country, (where) the people have full right to demand an account from the clergy. Such attitude on the part of the clergy brings to light their hypocrisy and degrades their prestige.</p>
   <p>Also, the clergy are leading immoral lives, and then when anybody writes in the newspapers about it, they denounce the newspapers as infidels. What do the priests understand by morality?</p>
