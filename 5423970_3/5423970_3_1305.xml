<title level="a">AN INVITATION TO A GENERAL CONVENTION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>From a reading of the Lithuanian newspapers, it is apparent that everyone, regardless of differences in viewpoint, feels the need for a general convention. There cannot be two opinions on this matter. A general convention of all the Lithuanians in America must be held without fail. We are all Lithuanians, all the children of the same motherland, Lithuania, and we must discuss her problems and hurry to her aid in common.</p>
   <p>It only remains to select the place and date for the convention. Chicago, as a gigantic Lithuanian colony in which a large group of intellectuals are to be found, is the most appropriate place for the convention. The most convenient time, as the Draugas points out in a recent issue, would be September 25, after the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Federation Congress will have ended. Having conferred with other members of the Federation's executive committee and having received their approval, I am taking the liberty of inviting all of the Lithuanians in America to the General <pb facs="5423970_3_1306.jpg" n="2"/>Convention, which will take place in Chicago on September 25 and, if necessary, September 26. Mr. J. Gabrys had urged that a general convention be held early in September. The Katalikas is not opposed to having the convention immediately after the Federation's Congress, but only desires that it take place as soon as possible. It is true that periculum in mora. Lithuania will soon demand our assistance.</p>
   <p>However, the executive committee of the Federation does not think that it would be convenient to advance the date of the Congress.....However, the work can be started at once. May the donations be heaped on the alter of the Motherland! In the name of the publishers of the Draugas, I am sending five dollars to the Fund to Aid Lithuania, which will ultimately be organized at the general convention. May that fund grow most rapidly! Private individuals, societies, groups, etc., send your donations to the Fund to Aid Lithuania through the newspapers which, I am sure, will not refuse to accept the donations and will publicize them in the columns of their newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1307.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When we meet on September 25 we will already have some money, which will be intrusted to an elected treasurer and used for the benefit of our fellow nationals who have remained in Lithuania and who will suffer because of the war.</p>
   <p>What happens to our motherland, Lithuania, cannot be immaterial to us, fellow nationals! The political changes which will undoubtedly take place in Europe will also affect Lithuania. We, the Lithuanians of America, must be prepared to give Lithuania such help as she might request. We must fulfill our duties as good patriots without fail. All must unite. Do not let unity fail us. At least during this hour, let us restrain our partisan egos, so that the results of the general convention will be most perfect.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Misius</p>
   <p>President, Lithuanian Catholic Federation</p>
   <p>P. S. Other papers please copy.</p>
   <p>[Lietuva editor's note: While we fully agree with Reverend J. Misius on <pb facs="5423970_3_1308.jpg" n="4"/>the necessity of calling a general convention of Lithuanians in America as soon as possible, we believe, however, as we have stated in the previous issue of the Lietuva, that the selected date, September 25 and 26, is too soon. It is necessary that as great a number of Lithuanian-Americans as possible participate in the convention and that every large Lithuanian colony be represented. That can be attained only with the aid of the societies. In their meetings, to which other local Lithuanians also might be invited, they will discuss the situation, will confer with other societies, and will elect delegates. The societies usually hold meetings once a month. Little time remains before the specified date and therefore the machinery of the societies can hardly be speeded to organize the whole matter in such a short time. As has been pointed out in our last issue, the Chicago societies are invited to meet for a pre-convention conference on September 20. That is only a few days before the proposed date. Similar conferences and the elections of delegates in many other places are likely to be held at the same time, and perhaps even a week or two later. Because of this the delegates of many colonies would not come to the convention and it would, therefore, <pb facs="5423970_3_1309.jpg" n="5"/>lack completeness and universality. In our opinion, the date of the convention should be set about a month later. Then it would be neither too early nor too late, and a truly general convention, representing all of the Lithuanians of America, could be expected.]</p>
