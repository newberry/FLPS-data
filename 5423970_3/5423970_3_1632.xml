   <p>After the death of the priest Smolenskas now we have the Rev. Ambrozaitis as rector. The harmony between the parishioners and the rector did not last long. The first struggle came over the collection of money. There are two collections, one for the seats and the other the collection of cents. With the Rev. Smolenskas the parish had both collections under its control; now Rev. Ambrozaitis has tried to take both collections under his control, but the parish committee refused. Then the priest demanded the cents collection, and besides the collection he demanded various improvements in the rectory, even demanding two beds in his bedroom. We see no reason why the priest needs two beds in his bedroom, We the workers are sleeping two in one bed, but the priest wants two beds in one bedroom. We know that his maid has a bed in her bedroom.</p>
   <p>The organist demanded more wages. At present he gets $30 per month.He says that he cannot make a living for his family. The parishioners <pb facs="5423970_3_1633.jpg" n="2"/>told the priest of raising the organist's wages. The priest protested. The parishioners then cut $6 from the priest's salary and added it to the organist's. The priest received $66 per month, now he will get $60. It looks to us as if the priest will not die of starvation at such a salary. He gets paid for all the extra services.</p>
