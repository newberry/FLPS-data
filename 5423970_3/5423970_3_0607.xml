   <p>The echoes of a large variety of activities, which are calculated to benefit our nationality and promote our individual welfare, resound in all sections of Chicago. Although these efforts are undoubtedly launched and conducted by sincere and honest persons, nevertheless, it has been noticed that most of them conflict with one another and extend into diverse and opposing channels. A great lack of unity of purpose in our plans is plainly evident. This chaotic state of affairs is due largely to lack of unity and understanding among the members of our intelligentsia, who act as leaders of our people. It is unquestionably the direct cause of much wasted energy and valuable resources. It is also responsible for the prevalence of many vicious rumors and many painful quarrels among the people of our nationality. The breach between the various factions of our nationality is constantly growing wider. It is clear that under such conditions we cannot even hope to make any satisfactory progress.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0608.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, our position is far from being hopeless. Where there is a will there is always a way, reads an old saying. Unity of action among our people can be brought about by promoting a greater understanding among the members of our intelligentsia, who are our leaders. This highly desirable end could be realized if our leaders would come in contact with each other more frequently, in order to weigh and discuss our common affairs from all angles. Such action would undoubtedly help a great deal in eliminating prejudice, vicious rumors, and foolish quarrels, among our people. It would pave the way for more productive activities. This exchange of ideas and plans by our leaders can be brought about most conveniently by forming an organization of the best educated Lithuanians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The need for unity has been felt a long time by all members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia of Chicago. Many vital affairs of our nationality, which spring up from time to time, require the united support of all Lithuanians, regardless of political or religious affiliations. This fact has convinced many intelligent <pb facs="5423970_3_0609.jpg" n="3"/>Lithuanians of Chicago of the necessity to unite.</p>
   <p>Suggestions for an organization of our intelligentsias have been introduced several times at many of our public meetings. Finally, on May 10th, the idea became a reality. The long efforts of F. P. Bradchulis to form such an organization produced gratifying results. On the above mentioned date, an organization was established with twelve distinguished members of our intelligentsia forming the initial membership body. This new organization will be known as the "Lithuanian Circle." It will aim to unite all members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia in Chicago, for the purpose of rendering united support for all important matters pertaining to our nationality. All members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia, regardless of religious, political, or other personal convictions, are eligible for membership.</p>
   <p>At the first meeting of the Lithuanian Circle, a committee of three was elected to prepare the by-laws of the organization. A decision was made to hold a banquet in connection with the next business meeting of the organization, which <pb facs="5423970_3_0610.jpg" n="4"/>will be held Friday evening, June 12th, at 2001 South Indiana Avenue. At this banquet the matter of adopting the by-laws will be discussed, and permanent officers will be elected. Many matters of vital interest to all members of our intelligentsia in Chicago will be discussed at the meeting. All are invited, without any reservations, to attend.</p>
   <p>We have great hope that our Lithuanian priests and other Lithuanians, who have been engaged in various activities among the non-Lithuanian intelligentsia of Chicago, will not fail to join this most important movement for the benefit of our nationality and general welfare.</p>
