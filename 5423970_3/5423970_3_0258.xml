<title level="a">AN APPEAL FROM CHICAGO LITHUANIAN ORGANIZATIONS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>During the past few days letters have been sent out to all Chicago Lithuanian Nationalist and Catholic organizations in an appeal to form a united front of Chicago Lithuanians for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. If some organizations did not receive letters it is only because their addresses are not known. For their benefit a copy of the letter is hereby printed:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sirs: After reading newspaper accounts of the dire predicament of our brothers in Lithuania, and after hearing their pitiful appeals to Lithuanian-Americans for help, we, the undersigned representatives of various Chicago Lithuanian organizations, assembled on August 1 in Ausra Hall and discussed among ourselves what would be the best possible method of raising funds for Lithuanian war victims. After careful deliberation we agreed upon the following course of action:</p>
   <p>"All Chicago Lithuanian societies, lodges, and clubs should form a united <pb facs="5423970_3_0259.jpg" n="2"/>front for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of our war-stricken brothers and sisters in Europe. As we have already learned through our newspapers, the people in Lithuania are now starving to death; they are badly in need of immediate relief; the amount of relief they are now receiving is very inadequate.</p>
   <p>"We would like to carry on this relief work in a nonpartisan and nonsectarian manner, solely as Lithuanians who love their fatherland and desire to help their brothers and sisters. We are hereby inviting your organization to join in this humanitarian work.</p>
   <p>"We believe that the following is the best method to carry on this work: Each organization, acting independently, should employ various means to raise funds; all funds raised by an organization should be sent directly to Lithuania by representatives of the organization.</p>
   <p>"In order to avoid partisan misunderstandings and quarrels we decided that all funds that are raised should be sent to Lithuania, directly to Dr. Jonas Basanavicius [father of modern Lithuania], whom we all know and respect; he <pb facs="5423970_3_0260.jpg" n="3"/>will then deliver the money to the committee or organization that is engaged in extensive aid for war-stricken Lithuanians. However, if more than one committee or organization in Lithuania is engaged in relief work, Dr. Basanavicius can divide the money among them if, in his opinion it would be beneficial to do so.</p>
   <p>"We realize that as the war progresses the situation in Lithuania might change; in view of this possibility we have reserved the right to change our method of sending relief money to the war-stricken Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>"All activities for raising funds in Chicago shall be supervised and directed by a committee composed of delegates from the various Chicago Lithuanian organizations. Elections to that committee will take place on August 29 in Ausra Hall, 3001 South Halsted Street, beginning at 8:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>"We cordially invite your organization to join in this humanitarian work by sending your president and two delegates to the meeting. Additional information <pb facs="5423970_3_0261.jpg" n="4"/>in regard to this matter will be furnished at the meeting.</p>
   <p>"Let us swing into action, brother Chicagoans ! We are divided into various factions and have three separate war relief funds; we are engaged more in fruitless quarrels and disputes than in useful and productive work. Let us throw aside all party lines and quarrels while our brothers in Lithuania are starving to death. Let us shake hands with one another, fellow Chicagoans, and work in unity. Let us set a good example for all other Lithuanian-American colonies !</p>
   <p>"Believing that your organization will not decline to join in this great humanitarian work, we remain,</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0262.jpg" n="5"/>
