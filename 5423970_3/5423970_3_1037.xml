   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians known by their own experience, that if we want to work for the good of Lithuanians, all societies ought to make an alliance into one parish, to have love among ourselves and to help each other as much as we can.</p>
   <p>The purpose of all of us ought to be one: To work on the Lithuanian field, to enlighten our illiterate brothers, that they would not be so blind. There are many Lithuanians in Chicago, they with great devotion are spending time and money to enlighten themselves and their brothers. But unfortunately, our brothers are very slow to undertake education.</p>
   <p>The society of Gedeminas promised to join the parish on December 11th. Mr. Grinius made motion to join the parish, all the members gladly accepted the motion.Also society Apveizdos Dievo (Province of God) is willing and not afraid to join the parish.</p>
   <p>We have hopes that through the newspaper "Lietuva," all Lithuanians will be united, thus will become good Catholics and Lithuanians.</p>
