  <body>
   <p>In commemoration of George Washington's birthday the Chicago Lithuanian Council and the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies will sponsor mass meetings in all the Chicago Lithuanian colonies.</p>
   <p>These mass meetings--the first of their kind to be held among the Lithuanians here--should prove interesting to all who attend. The life of the great world here will be thoroughly discussed. The speakers will explain why Washington devoted his entire life to win freedom for this country--a freedom which we Lithuanians also enjoy.</p>
   <p>Since we wish to combine all our energies in the effort to make Lithuania independent after this war, it should be of interest to us to know how the American people fought in order to win freedom for this country.</p>
   <p>Many prominent Lithuanian and American speakers will participate in these <pb facs="5423970_3_1141.jpg" n="2"/>meetings. We are happy to announce that among them will be Dr. Knob, editor of the Chicago Daily Journal. Dr. Knob is a Lithuanian sympathizer.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee for these gatherings invites all Lithuanians to attend the meetings, which have already been advertised throughout the various neighborhoods by means of handbills. They will all be held on Friday, February 22. Admission will be free.</p>
