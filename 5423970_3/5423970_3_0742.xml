   <p>Last Sunday, Chapter 28 of the Lovers of the Motherland Society had a family entertainment, or May Festival, in the woods in the vicinity of the Lithuanian National Cemetery in Willow Springs, Illinois. A large crowd, composed only of youth, happily entertained themselves playing various national games. Wherever one turned one saw them playing "Aguonele," "Rutele," "Marute," and "Malunas".....[Translator's note: These are the names of Lithuanian national games.] Tired out, they later sat down to refreshments, which were followed by a program. First of all Mr. B. Lenkauskas read J. O. Sirvydas' lecture entitled "Health through Exercise".....The lecture was instructive and not boresome and was well chosen for the youths, who were apparently pleased with it. Then Mr. J. Biezis....and Mr. M. Duda.... spoke. Comedian "Stepukas" (V. Brusokas) was also on the program. Then again the drawings, games, and singing continued until darkness fell. At the end everybody formed a circle and sang "Lithuania, Our Motherland." It is noteworthy that there was not a drop of intoxicating liquor and that a Lithuanian spirit dominated everything clearly.</p>
