   <p>The Lithuanian organizations of South Chicago are making plans to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of Lithuanian mass immigration to America on October 24, at Koneczny Hall, 88th Street and Commercial Avenue.</p>
   <p>The profit from this celebration will be used to publish Lithuanian School-books, and to pay for the time of two Lithuanian men for making a complete statistical survey of the South Chicago Lithuanian colony. The two men who will gather the statistics will be selected after the above celebration.</p>
   <p>During the celebration the purpose and value of the statistical study will be explained in detail to the people. Everyone will be asked to co-operate with the enumerators to make the survey as complete and accurate as possible.</p>

   <p>The efforts of the South Chicago Lithuanians to make a statistical survey of their colony is a fine example to other Chicago Lithuanian colonies. It would be a very good thing if all other colonies would follow this example, and in that way assist the Lietuva (Lithuania) to make a complete statistical survey of the Lithuanians of Chicago. Questionnaire blanks may be had at the office of the Lietuva, 3252 S. Halsted Street, Chicago, Ill.</p>
