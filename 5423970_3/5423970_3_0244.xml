   <p>The United States Congress, in sympathy with the war-stricken people of Lithuania, has set aside a Lithuanian Day (a tag day) for the benefit of Lithuania. On that day funds will be collected all over the United States, not only from Lithuanians, but from all other Americans as well. The better we prepare for that day the more funds we will collect for our starving fatherland.</p>
   <p>According to reports, Lithuanian Day will be on November 1 (All Saints' Day). Therefore, there is very little time, and there will be very much work to do. In order to start making immediate preparations, and to derive the greatest benefit form this "day for our fatherland", we hereby invite all Chicago Lithuanians, regardless of partisan affiliations, to attend a meeting at which a central Chicago Lithuanian committee will be selected to make preparations for and conduct Lithuanian Day. The meeting will take place on September 13, in St. George's parish hall, corner of Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue and 32nd Place. The meeting will start at 8 P.M.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0245.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This invitation is being made by the editorial staffs of the following Chicago Lithuanian newspapers: Draugas (The Friend), Katalikas (The Catholic), Lietuva (Lithuania), and Savaitinis Draugas (Weekly Friend).</p>
