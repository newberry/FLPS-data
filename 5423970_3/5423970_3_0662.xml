   <p>This Alliance was organized in 1886. It was started in Plymouth, Pa. At the beginning the organization was named, "The Lithuanian Alliance of America", because at that time among Lithuanians, nationalism and religion meant almost the same thing. It was no necessity, they thought, for the Alliance to be of the Lithuanian catholics. As time passed, it was seen that in the Lithuanian Alliance started to appear the free thought idea. Also, it was found that some of the members did not perform their religious duties. From this time they became two parties: the catholics and the free-thinkers, and for this reason disputes started. Then came the necessity of adding the organization's name the word "catholic", because the catholics demanded it. At the beginning, many Lithuanian mutual benefit societies joined and branches of the Alliance were organized in Lithuanian colonies. These branches were named after cities or towns. This was done in order to separate and to take the Lithuanians from the Poles. The Lithuanian Alliance branches have spread enlightenment among Lithuanians; published literature in Lithuanian language; inspired the national spirit, and uplifted the Lithuanian nation's name. The yearly <pb facs="5423970_3_0663.jpg" n="2"/>dues were fifty cents a year. With this money, the Alliance published books, and covered other expenses. When a member died, every member of the Alliance paid 15 cents to the dead member's beneficiary fund. This was done as stated above up to 1897.</p>
   <p>At the tenth convention of the Lithuanian Alliance, the membership dues were changed. It was decided that every member shall pay two dollars a year straight, without any other payment. At the beginning the Alliance had no organ, but from time to time published books. Then after ten years of its existance, established the monthly organ Tevyne,- (The Fatherland).</p>
   <p>In the Alliance the dispute between catholics and free-thinkers became stronger and stronger, and at last in the year 1901, at the 16th convention, Wilkes Barre, Pa., went so far, that 28 free-thinkers delegates demonstratively left the convention hall, while 65 delegates remained at the convention. At the time of the split, the Alliance had 1500 members; 600 members of the Alliance went with the free-thinkers, while 900 members remained in the organization. In the Alliance treasury <pb facs="5423970_3_0664.jpg" n="3"/>at that time there was $2,000. This money was left with the organization.</p>
   <p>Then at this convention it was decided to change the Alliance charter, to name the organization as the "Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America".</p>
   <p>At the 17th convention in the year of 1902, it was decided to stop publishing the Alliance organ Tevyne - (The Fatherland) and in its place to hire some other newspaper as an organ of the Alliance. It was decided to have as the organ the Zvaigzde - (The Star), a catholic weekly newspaper. The Tevyne printing shop was sold. The Zvaigzde was the organ of the Alliance for seven years up to the 24th convention in the year 1909. It was then decided not to have the Zvaigzde for an organ. Then the Alliance for one year was without its organ. At the 25th convention in the year 1911 it was decided to have the catholic weekly newspaper Draugas - (The Friend) as an organ of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>At the beginning the Alliance's aim was cultural instead of material; in order to make the organization stronger, it started to take care of national and public affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0665.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>During the Russian revolution in 1905, the Alliance established a fund to help those who have suffered in their fight for freedom; it was decided that every member must pay five cents a year for national affairs. In 1907, the Alliance established the "National Cent Fund", to which every member paid 10 cents a year.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America National Fund gave support to the following institutions:</p>
   <p>(1) The "Saules - The Sun Society in Kaunas, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>(2) "Ziburelis - The Little Light Society.</p>
   <p>(3) To the St. Casimir sisters convent, which prepares Lithuanian teachers for the Lithuanian parish schools in America.</p>
   <p>(4) To the Lithuanian Information Bureau in Paris, which gives information to the world about the Lithuanian nation.</p>
   <p>(5) The Lithuanian Science and Art Society in Vilnius.</p>
   <p>(6) "Rytas" - The Morning, for the enlightenment of the Lithuanians of Vilnius.</p>
   <p>(7) The Emigration Protective Society in America, etc.</p>
   <p>From the year of 1885 to 1907, the organization paid only $150 in death benefits. The <pb facs="5423970_3_0666.jpg" n="5"/>members were accepted in this organization from 12 to 50 years of age.</p>
   <p>In the year of 1907 they added more death beneficiary payments: $250 and $500 and the children's death beneficiary fund from $25 to $100.</p>
   <p>In the year of 1912 was established the "Orphan Fund" to help the orphans whose parents, while members of the Alliance, died.</p>
   <p>In 1914 at the 24th convention was formed the sick beneficiary fund. The sick beneficiary was made of 4 degrees:</p>
