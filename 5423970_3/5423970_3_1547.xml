  <body>
   <p>At Columbia Hall, Town of Lake, a meeting was held for the purpose of organizing an independent Lithuanian parish. The Reverend V. R. Bonas was the speaker and organizer. The discussion was on the question of who would have control of its assets if the parish were organized. It was decided to inquire of Attorney F. P. Bradchulis how such a parish as was desired could be organized under the statutes of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The hall was packed with people....At the meeting, $23.32 was collected and according to the statement of the Reverend V. R. Bonas, he had also collected $47.80 by going from house to house.</p>
