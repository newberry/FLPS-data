   <p>Of Lithuanian saloons and butcher shops we have enough. All these businessmen are maintained by the Lithuanian workers, although the businessmen are doing nothing good for national affairs. The businessmen organized the parish and obtained a priest. Now they are united with the priest like two trust companies. They are emptying the pockets of the parishioners and leave nothing to improve the conditions of the church-goers. I wonder how long the people will sleep. There are a few people with progressive ideas, but it is very hard for them to do anything good for the public, because they find no supporters.</p>
   <p>By reading the newspapers we see how the cossacks are beating our brothers in Lithuania. So the St. Joseph society members decided to help the revolutionists in Lithuania. At the meeting, after a discussion of the sufferings of our brothers for the national cause in Lithuania, <pb facs="5423970_3_1595.jpg" n="2"/>we decided to contribute $30 to the fighters for Lithuania's freedom. The priest told the parishioners that the $30 will do nothing good for the living revolutionists. We must take care of the souls of the dead revolutionists, and the priest demanded the $30 for which he will pray for the souls. The ignorant parishioners agreed to the priest's request and gave the money to the priest instead of to the revolutionary movement in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Our priest either was bribed by the Poles or he forgot who he is, because last Sunday he started preaching against the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The Rev. Petraitis in his sermon denounced enlightened people for not going to the church and for not giving money to the priest. He warned the parishioners that they should not go to nor take part in the convention of Lithuanian Alliance of America, which will be held on May 27. Whoever participates in the parade will not be confessed not given <pb facs="5423970_3_1596.jpg" n="3"/>the sacrament nor will he be given absolution. When the people left the church some said that something was wrong with the priest, while others said that the priest really meant it. Such is justice with our priest. But when he arranges a banquet for his own benefit, the preaches from the pulpit that everyone must go to the priest's ball; even eighty-year-old women are forced to give their last penny. But to take part in the Lithuanian Alliance of America parade, in order to show Americans that we are a civilized and progressive people, this, says the priest, is sin.</p>
   <p>We, the South Chicago Lithuanians, proclaim that the priest is a degenerate Lithuanian.</p>
