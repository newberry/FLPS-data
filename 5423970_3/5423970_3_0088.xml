<title level="a">QUESTION OF BUILDING LITHUANIAN COMMUNITY HALL RAISED AGAIN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>At a meeting of the Young Lithuanian-American Nationalist Club, held last Saturday in Radavicius Hall in the Bridgeport section of Chicago, long discussions took place about building a home for the Club. It was revealed, by the opinions that were expressed at the meeting, that the Club desires to put up a big building with a large hall, at a cost of fifty to seventy thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>That there is a great need for a suitable community hall for the Lithuanians of Chicago is recognized by everybody. However, there are various opinions as to how such a building should be financed and built. Even at the above-mentioned meeting of the Club there were two different opinions expressed on that point; one group advocated that the Club should finance the building with its own capital, by selling shares to members and outsiders; the other group was of the opinion that such an undertaking is too big for the Club <pb facs="5423970_3_0089.jpg" n="2"/>alone, and proposed that the Club unite with several other Chicago Lithuanian organizations and co-operate with them in this venture.</p>
   <p>Final decision on the matter of the building was postponed until the next meeting. A committee of twelve was elected at the meeting to make a thorough study of the question and make definite proposals at the next meeting of the Club.</p>
   <p>The Club is still comparatively young--it was organized seven years ago--but it is growing very fast. It already has about four hundred members, and about two thousand dollars in the treasury.</p>
   <p>Chicago Lithuanians so need a large hall that the steadily increasing interest in the matter is a very good thing. In our opinion, there is not a single Lithuanian organization in Chicago that is capable of building such a hall alone, without the aid of other organizations. We have in mind, of course, <pb facs="5423970_3_0090.jpg" n="3"/>a large and spacious hall; it is well known that almost any Lithuanian organization in Chicago is capable of building a small hall, at a cost of ten to fifteen thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The Young Lithuanian-American Nationalist Club is a benefit society for men only. It is still in existence.]</p>
