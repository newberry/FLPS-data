   <p>Honorables:</p>
   <p>For a more triumphant and solemn observance of the most important American holiday, the Fourth of July, a society called, "The Sane Fourth Association," has been organized. This organization has invited all the national groups to take part in the celebration of this national holiday.</p>
   <p>So far as we know, seventeen national groups in Chicago will participate in this celebration. Everyone of these nationalities is trying to show its finest aspect to the public.</p>
   <p>In last year's celebration the Lithuanians starred; the American newspapers wrote that the Lithuanian contingent was the best. This has proved that the Lithuanian nation still exists.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the representatives of the Lithuanian societies of Bridgeport, <pb facs="5423970_3_0541.jpg" n="2"/>Town of Lake and 16th Street held a meeting and organized a committee for the collection of money for the celebration.</p>
   <p>Since our performance last year was so triumphant, we cannot refuse to participate this year.</p>
   <p>This committee has decided to hold a meeting of delegates from all of the Lithuanian societies and of prominent Lithuanians, June 19, at 8 P.M., St. George's Hall, 32nd Place, and Auburn Avenue.</p>
   <p>To the societies whose addresses the committee has on hand, letters of invitation have been mailed. We are asking other societies, whose addresses we do not have, to send their delegates to the meeting of June 19th. We also ask all prominent Lithuanians to attend.</p>
   <p>We trust that all of the Lithuanian societies will send delegates and will take part in this celebration, to show the Americans that the Lithuanian nation <pb facs="5423970_3_0542.jpg" n="3"/>exists.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>J. J. Elias, President</p>
   <p>Jonas Jankauskas, 2nd Vice Pres.</p>
   <p>Jonas Jlgaudas, 4th Vice Pres.</p>
   <p>Paul Mazeika, Marshal at Arms.</p>
   <p>Stanilovas Pocevice, 1st Vice Pres.</p>
   <p>Alex Bijanskas, 3rd Vice Pres.</p>
   <p>J. F. Eudeikis, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>J. Hertmanavice, Secretary.</p>
   <p>P.S. For any further information, call the committee's secretary, J. J. Hertmanavice, 3252 So. Halsted Street.</p>
