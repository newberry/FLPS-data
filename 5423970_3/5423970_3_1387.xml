   <p>THE INCEPTION OF THE SOCIETY AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS:</p>
   <p>This society was organized on April 4, 1909, by the girls who had been attending the St. George's Parish School. The first meeting was attended by the following members: Monika L. Gurinskaite, Anna Buziute-Stankuniene, Mary Overlingaite-Miksiene, Francisca Lomite-Bartuseviciene, Josephine Adomavicaite, Francisca Jociute-Burkiene, Eva Jakseviciute-Curiene, Martha Ruleviciute -McIntee, and Catherine Benusaite.</p>
   <p>Most of the help toward organizing this society was given by the deacon, Rev. M. Krawciunas (now deceased) and the present prelate, the Rev. M. L. Krusas.</p>

   <p>The society with its activity and donations has done much for the benefit of church and the nation.</p>

   <p>At Christmas time, when there was need, five or six Christmas baskets were given to the poor families.</p>
   <p>On August 20, 1922, when the United States of America recognized Lithuania's independence, the society participated in the parade. It had two "floats" at its own expense- The American Flag and the School of Lithuania; also forty members carried the three-colored Lithuanian flag and during the parade collected money. The collection was $58. The money, through the Rev. J. Tumas, was sent to the Vilnius Asylum and cultural affairs.</p>
   <p>May, 1928, at the 10th anniversary of the independence of the Lithuanian Republic, the society participated in a parade which was held in McKinley Park.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1391.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The society has its own "Bunco" tables which it loans free of charge to the St. Casimir's Supporters of grade two, to the Benefactors Association, branch five and to the St. Francisco a Sisters.</p>
   <p>The society has a very nicely furnished club room where the members can cook, sew and read; they also have a very good basket-ball team whose president is Miss M. Gurinskaite.</p>
