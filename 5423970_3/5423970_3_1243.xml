  <body>
   <p>The Knights of Lithuania will hold their annual convention in Chicago on July 1 and 2 in St. George's Parish Hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. Among those who have arrived in Chicago to participate in the convention are the following supreme officers of the organization: M. A. Norkunas, president, of Montello, Mass.; A. M. Rackus, secretary, of Worcester, Mass. [Translator's note: He became a Chicagoan later]; and Mr. A. Aleksandravicius [Aleksis] [Translator's note: He changed his name later to Aleksis], vice president, of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Delegates to the convention have arrived from Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; Boston, Mass.; Brockton, Mass.; and from other parts of the country. It is estimated that all together about forty delegates will attend.</p>
   <p>The Knights of Lithuania was organized three years ago. It now has about thirty-four councils in various parts of the United States, and over three thousand members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1244.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the evening of the first day of the convention, a concert by the musical talent of the organization will be given in St. George's Hall. On the evening of the second and last day of the convention, a grand banquet and program will be held in the same hall.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: No mention is made of this convention in the following issues of the Lietuva. The Knights of Lithuania is a Lithuanian-American Catholic youth organization. It became very popular in Chicago, where about ten chapters or councils were organized. The 1916 Year Book of the Lithuanian Catholic Press Society contains the following information about the convention mentioned above:</p>
   <p>"The third convention of the Knights of Lithuania was held July 1-2, 1915 in St. George's Parish Hall, Chicago, Illinois. About forty delegates and many guests attended. The convention was conducted in an orderly manner, and many important questions were discussed. Noteworthy was the decision to issue their own organ entitled Vytis (The Knight). Mr. A. M. Rackus and K. Pakstas were selected to edit the publication. The following <pb facs="5423970_3_1245.jpg" n="3"/>supreme officers were elected, for a term of three years: Reverend H. J. Vaiciunas, of Chicago, spiritual adviser; John E. Karosas, of Chicago, president; Miss Matilda Sukis, of Worcester, Mass., vice-president; Mr. P. Mulevicius, of Chicago, recording secretary; Miss Salome Slegaitis, of Cicero, Illinois, financial secretary; Paul P. Baltutis, of Chicago, treasurer....</p>
   <p>"According to the constitution of the Knights of Lithuania the purpose of the organization is as follows:</p>
   <p>" '1. The organization will concern itself with all matters pertaining to the best interests of Lithuanian-American Roman Catholics, especially young Lithuanians who were born outside the borders of Lithuania and are not acquainted with their mother country. The organization will promote among Lithuanian-Americans, especially among our young people, love for the Lithuanian nationality, language, and literature.</p>
   <p>" '2. This organization of young Lithuanian-American men and women, known <pb facs="5423970_3_1246.jpg" n="4"/>as the "Knights of Lithuania," under the patronage of St. Casimir, will strive to guide its members to lead a moral Christian life and to guard them from those dangers which lead to the loss of religion and morality. The organization will strive to promote the intellectual development and material welfare of its members by proper means, such as the establishment of libraries, and will encourage its members to be industrious, thrifty, to abstain from alcoholic liquors, etc.</p>
   <p>" '3. It is the duty of the organization to promote the spiritual development of its members with lofty entertainments, by sponsoring lectures, presenting theatricals, etc., and to encourage friendship and social life among its members."]</p>
