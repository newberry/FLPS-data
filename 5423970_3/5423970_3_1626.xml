   <p>The committee that went to the Archbishop to complain about the Province of God parish affairs has had no chance to tell the parishioners what the committee heard from the Archbishop as to what are the rights and duties of parishioners. The hirelings of this priest are obstructing their actions. The extra meeting was called on July 23, in order to explain to the parishioners what the committee heard from the Archbishop. At the meeting, twenty people, perhaps hired by the priest, brought about such a commotion that there was almost a riot at the meeting. For this reason the committee had no chance to explain to the parishioners what their duties are in the Province of God parish.</p>
