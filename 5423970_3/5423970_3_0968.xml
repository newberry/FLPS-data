   <p>At the baptism festival, March 21st, of Anna Matilda, daughter of Mr. Kuraitis, a few Lithuanians got together on that occasion. While discussing various national affairs, Mr. Frank Zemaitis mentioned our martyrs who are exiled in the depths of Russia, for national activity. In order to enlighten their ignorance and to aid their oppressed brothers, he showed the necessity of helping Lithuanian students.</p>
   <p>There is great need of an intelligent class. Without an intelligent class of people we cannot make progress. We will uplift ourselves and our nation when we have a strong intelligent group of people in the various branches of science. Intelligent people must have some knowledge of science. To get executive training requires money. We must give money, as much as we can, to help our students. Everybody agreed on this point and contributed $6.00 for this cause. The money was distributed as follows: Two dollars for the martyrs in the prisons of Russia, and four dollars to the Aurora Society students fund.</p>
   <p>In the names of those in need of help, to all the donors, I extend my hearty thanks.</p>
   <p>Juozukes.</p>
