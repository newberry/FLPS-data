   <p>Last Thursday was Independence Day. Thousands of Lithuanians from all sections of the city crowded into McKinley Park, which was the site of the Lithuanian loyalty demonstration.</p>
   <p>Immediately after noon, thousands of members of the Lithuanian societies, led by American and Lithuanian flags and marching to the accompaniment of bands, began to parade from Bridgeport, Town of Lake, the West Side, 18th Street, the North Side, Brighton Park, South Chicago and Englewood, to McKinley Park.</p>
   <p>There a special platform had been erected for the speakers. The many flags and various posters which were carried by the different societies made a colorful sight in the Park. Some of the posters read: "President Wilson is the best friend of oppressed nations"; "The United States will give independence to Lithuania"; "Better to die fighting for liberty than to <pb facs="5423970_3_1119.jpg" n="2"/>live in slavery"; "President, the Lithuanians are with you, body and soul";"not might but right must rule the world." Hundreds of other posters with similar inscriptions were displayed.</p>
   <p>From the speakers' platform it was a wonderful sight, when the Lithuanian legions began to gather around the platform. More and more came. The wave of people in the Park continued to grow until there was no more room. It is estimated that about thirty thousand Lithuanians gathered here.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to describe separately each division here. Let it suffice to say that each division strove to appear the best and, as a result, when they all met in the Park the sight was impressive. One could not help feeling one's heart beat faster as one gazed on the American and Lithuanian flags and listened to the speeches.</p>
   <p>The Speeches</p>
   <p>Promptly at 3 P.M. the program chairman, J. Elijosius [Elias], addressed <pb facs="5423970_3_1120.jpg" n="3"/>the public and explained the purpose of the celebration.</p>
   <p>The program began with the raising of the American flag, while the bands played and the crowd sang the American anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner." After the flag-raising ceremony, Mr. Daw, speaking in English, praised the Lithuanians for their loyalty and patriotism. He assured the audience that the war which is now being waged in Europe will bring independence to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Reverend N. Pakalnis then spoke in Lithuanian. His speech was beautiful and moving when he described Lithuania's long fight with the Teutons and other enemies. It was impressive and full of hope when he painted the picture of Lithuania's present fight to regain complete independence.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Hon. Robert Crowe, judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. He spoke about the significance of Independence Day in <pb facs="5423970_3_1121.jpg" n="4"/>American history and the significance it will now have in the history of the world. He spoke, also, of Lithuanian history and pointed out that even in the olden times Lithuanians were courageous fighters for liberty and, though they were conquered by numerically superior enemies, they never stopped fighting. Now, he said, this fight will be crowned by the regaining of liberty for Lithuania. The audience liked his speech very much and applauded him generously.</p>
   <p>Then John I. Bagdziunas, Commissioner of Chicago's West Park area and a prominent Lithuanian leader, spoke. (Bagdziunas and Elijosius [Elias] had been the most active workers in making arrangements for this demonstration.)</p>
   <p>In his speech Bagdziunas used America as an example to show that liberty gives power to a nation. "Just as a mother's breast," he said, "gives the most nourishing food for a child, and cannot be completely replaced by another source of food; so liberty is the best food on which a nation can grow and prosper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1122.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Today America stands to defend that liberty--as does the rest of the world, including the Lithuanians--from the cruel and despotic militarism which the Kaiser represents. The great war is being waged and will continue to be waged not only until Kaiserism and militarism are crushed, but until not even a sign of them is left on the face of the earth: until they are buried a hundred miles deep in the earth, from where they can no longer even be smelled. Then the world will be free. Then Lithuania will receive her independence and liberty. In order that this may come to pass as soon as possible, we Lithuanians contribute, and will continue to contribute, our utmost to the big fight for the liberty of the world."</p>
   <p>Mr. Bagdziunas' speech moved the audience. The audience many times interrupted his speech with applause.</p>
   <p>A loyalty resolution was read after the speeches. Copies of the resolution were sent to President Wilson and other officials in Washington.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_1123.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The program was varied by the singing of several beautiful songs by a chorus of two hundred voices under the direction of Anthony Pocius.</p>
   <p>Toward the close of the program the Lithuanians draped garlands of flowers on the statue of the martyred President McKinley, which is located in this park. Suitable speeches were made at the monument by Reverend A. Skrypka, who spoke in Lithuanian, and Attorney John Kucinskas, who spoke in English.</p>
   <p>The ceremonies ended with the singing of the American and the Lithuanian anthems.</p>
   <p>One hundred and one societies participated in the demonstration.</p>
