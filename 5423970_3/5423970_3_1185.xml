   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society held its ninth annual celebration on Sunday, October 26, 1902. In this celebration the following societies participated:</p>
   <p>The Truth Lovers</p>
   <p>The Liberty</p>
   <p>The Sons of Lithuania</p>
   <p>The Simonas Daukantas</p>
   <p>They marched from 33rd and Auburn Avenue to Morgan Street; then to 33rd Place, and through 34th Place marched to the Freiheit Turner Hall at 4 P. M. Then the speeches were delivered.</p>
   <p>The President of the society, Mr. A. Bijanskas, opened the meeting and <pb facs="5423970_3_1186.jpg" n="2"/>explained the purpose of this celebration, the birthday of Simonas Daukantas. The first speaker was Attorney F. P. Bradczulis. He stated that other nations have their great writers, so we Lithuanians are celebrating the birthday of our historian Simonas Daukantas, who was the first writer to write the Lithuanian history in the Lithuanian language. As the time passed there appeared more Lithuanian writers who were exiled to Siberia and are starving there because they wrote in the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary Bijanskaite delivered a declamation, "The Love of the Father-land." Then Mr. A. Rudauskas spoke about the solicitousness of Simonas Daukantas, who wrote the history of Lithuania and other books. The speaker urged (his listeners) to read these books, since by reading them they will learn much. Then the Lithuanians can uplift themselves and become equal to other enlightened nations. Then Mrs. M. Lietuve delivered a declamation, "About Lithuania." The four sisters Jovaisaites <pb facs="5423970_3_1187.jpg" n="3"/>sang "Goodby Lithuania," accompanied on the piano by Mr. V. Juszka. Miss Antosi Zimonezaite recited a poem, "The Memory of Antiquity." Mrs. M. Laukiene spoke about the right of women. She told how the women are enslaved by their men, who do not want to give education to them, because they do not care to see or to have an educated woman. She urged the women to unite and organize a society of women, etc. The sisters Chmieliauskaites sang an English song, "October." Mr. F. Eismontas spoke about our affairs in America, where we have found the second Fatherland. He urged us not to forget our language, to read Lithuanian literature, and to educate ourselves. We came to America without having any education, but in this country we have the opportunity to enlighten ourselves.</p>
   <p>Miss Helena Jovaiczaite recited a declamation, "The Brightest Sun, When Will You Arise?". Mr. Olszewski, publisher of Lietuva, spoke about the <pb facs="5423970_3_1188.jpg" n="4"/>history of Lithuania. When our nation was free and made a union with Poland our freedom was lost, slavery was brought into Lithuania, the clergy Polanized us Lithuanians, etc. He showed what harm the Poles have done to the Lithuanians. He explained the sufferings of the Lithuanian writers for the sake of Lithuaianisn and asked for a collection for the benefit of our writers. The good-willed nationalists donated $10.01 The money was turned over to the martyrs fund.</p>
   <p>At the end, Mr. A. Bijanskas, president of Simonas Daukantas Society, in a short speech thanked all the Lithuanians for coming to the celebration.</p>
   <p>The program came to an end at 6:30 P. M. Then the banquet and dances started.</p>
   <p>M. J. Damijonaitis, Secretary.</p>
