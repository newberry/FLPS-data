   <p>The Lithuanian National Council and the Lithuanian-American Council, which represent the nationalist and rightist factions, held a conference at which the following decisions were made:</p>
   <p>Whereas, the United States of America is at war against the Imperial Government of Germany which is striving to conquer Lithuania and, finally, all the nations of the world; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, Germany has publicly expressed the desire to dominate Lithuania economically and to rule it politically; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, by its actions the German government is trampling the will of the <pb facs="5423970_3_0690.jpg" n="2"/>Lithuanian nation; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, complete Lithuanian independence can only be assured by a victory for the Allies; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, the combined effort of all the nations fighting for liberty, including Lithuania, is necessary to achieve such a victory; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, by its example in its relations with other nations, the United States gives hope of materially and morally supporting the organization and upkeep of a Lithuanian legion to be used in the fight against Germany for Lithuania's liberty; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, the United States would guarantee the union of Lithuania with the Allies in this struggle and would also guarantee independence and liberty to Lithuania;</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0691.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Therefore, the Lithuanian-American Council and the Lithuanian National Council of America, having given much thought to the affairs of Lithuania, find that:</p>
   <p>1. The liberty, the life and the foundations of Lithuania are in great danger;</p>
   <p>2. There is only one certain manner by which the liberty and life of Lithuania can be protected, and that is by organizing a Lithuanian army to fight Germany.</p>
   <p>Therefore, both Councils, fully realizing their responsibility to Lithuania and the world, have decided to appeal to the heirs of the spirits of Vytautas and Gediminas to expend every effort toward organizing a Lithuanian army into which all who are able will enter when the opportunity is presented. They will fight under the flags of America and Lithuania for Lithuania's honor and bright future.</p>
