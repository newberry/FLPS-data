   <p>"At this moment there exists a very important problem in our national life. The question is, how to unite all the Lithuanian societies in Chicago--[how] to establish a central office that would take care of all our problems. That such a central bureau is necessary, every one knows.</p>
   <p>"In recent years, the United States Government has passed strict rules regarding immigration. The immigrants now receive horrible treatment in the immigration offices. All other national groups in this country have organized centers to protect their own immigrants. We Lithuanians must have such an organization for the protection of our own immigrants from abuse and bad treatment in the immigration offices.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_3_0820.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"This year is the presidential election year. The factories are closing. Many Lithuanians will be out of work. Many Lithuanian mothers and children are facing starvation. Will we permit them to starve? Such an organized center of the Lithuanian societies in Chicago, would be able to help such unfortunate mothers and children.</p>
   <p>"Another thing. Many Lithuanians need legal help in their daily problems. Many of them have been injured,..and yet, they do not know where and how to obtain legal aid. By having such a Lithuanian central office, we could give our brothers the legal assistance which would protect them from exploitation by various crooks and swindlers.</p>
   <p>"In taking part in the celebration of the 4th of July in Chicago, the Lithuanians have proved to themselves that they could accomplish a great deal <pb facs="5423970_3_0821.jpg" n="3"/>through unity.</p>
   <p>"We also must have our own employment office in order to help our brothers find jobs.</p>
   <p>"On September 7, at the St. George's Hall, a meeting will be held of the Chicago Lithuanian societies who participated in the 4th of July celebration. We appeal to all the Chicago Lithuanian societies to send their delegates to this meeting to discuss and to make plans for the organization of a central bureau for all of the Lithuanian societies in Chicago."</p>
   <p>Signed by the temporary committee:</p>
   <p>Joseph J. Elias, President</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanovicia, Secretary</p>
   <p>Jonas F. Eudeikis, Treasurer.</p>
