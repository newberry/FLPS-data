   <p>There are two contradictory answers to the above question. Consequently, yes and no. So far, our existence in the United States proves to us conclusively that if we carry on further in the same manner as in the past we might just as well draw a line through our entire future and continue to live as pariahs pushed about and ridiculed at almost every step. It is almost more than twenty-five years since Polish emigration started to flow into this country in marked numbers, caused mostly by a vision of a better existence. Many have bettered themselves financially; our monetary earnings have been great during this length of time, but did we derive any benefit from our material position? Did we benefit by the political freedom that has been ours in this country? Have we done anything for our Fatherland? Have we bettered ourselves morally and intellectually? That is another question.</p>
   <p>During the time that other nationalities have benefited in those directions, we have wasted our time and money on quarrels and squables, <pb facs="5423968_5_0187.jpg" n="2"/>adventures and scuffles, and have diverted our attention from everything which betters the human race and increases its strength. Instead, we have gained the questionable fame of adventurers, unruly people, disrespectful of law and order, and, to be emphatic, a nonsensical and ignorant people.</p>
   <p>Neither in the field of knowledge nor in the field of trade and industry; neither in the field of fine arts nor in the field of American politics so easily available to all nationalities, did we bring to ourselves any recognition, but everywhere we have been preceded and forced out by others, and we can say openly that our entire Polish emigration, with very few exceptions, has found itself trailing and has been left in the pitiful position of a working mule.</p>
   <p>All other people who have emigrated to this free country have been able to monopolize for themselves some part in industry, and we are, unfortunately, always at the bottom; always on the side lines as if some ancient curse has weighted itself on our poor race.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0188.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Even the Italian lazzarones and brigands from the Calabrian mountains have been successful in monopolizing the fruit industry and bringing the macaroni trade to the American market; even the Chinese has taken over exclusively the management of laundries in the United States, not mentioning the already immense enterprises of the Germans and Englishmen, only we have nothing, and the whole amount of our part in commerce is the saloon or grocery.</p>
   <p>I know that we have a few Polish factories, a few breweries; but the number of such enterprises is so small in proportion to our two million population that one can hardly take them into consideration when we refer to the development of our race.</p>
   <p>So we can see as plain as the palm of our hand, that in view of the brilliant example set before us in this country, we have not been influenced one bit in the part we have taken in commercial enterprise; we remain continually in our sluggishness, apathy and thoughtlessness and if we continue to remain in the present state, the morrow of a brighter <pb facs="5423968_5_0189.jpg" n="4"/>future will never greet us. Then, what shall we do in order to go forward and not backward; in order to rise, instead of falling? What shall we do? Only work ....work and not bellow; work and not argue; work and not dream of castles in the air; work and not rely on the mercy of our Lord.</p>
   <p>It is our duty in the first place to think about schools in which our children can acquire a higher education, and in colonies where Polish-American schools can be maintained and conducted; everyone should try to see that their children can educate themselves further in existing American institutions.</p>
   <p>It is further your duty to support Polish newspapers, naturally those which are well represented by intelligent and capable persons. In this way we will acquire good taste in our reading and the shady and repulsive press, poisoning our soul and mind, will accomplish its own downfall.</p>
   <p>We must establish not only a private type of enterprise with capital to small to meet foreign competition but with combined efforts, join our-selves <pb facs="5423968_5_0190.jpg" n="5"/>mutually, bring forth our idle capital, develop our Polish factories, develop our Polish trade, and finally we must intend to support our Polish merchants and polish corporations, fasten our ties of Polish trade relations with the old country, to import products from there and distribute them throughout America. By doing this we will endear ourselves a thousand-fold more to our Fatherland, improving her trade and good-will; so that we can shout from morning till night, until we are hoarse, "Poland is not yet dead."</p>
   <p>It is only proper to think about establishing a Polish bank that will take care of our Polish capital, which is not bearing any interest but is uselessly hidden in some "pot" or cached in some "mine."</p>
   <p>There is a great field for action in this country, complete liberty, no boundaries, taxes are small; only work, preparedness and enterprise is all that is necessary, and when we get rid of our ancient indifference; when knowledge ennobles our souls, when our welfare will improve as a <pb facs="5423968_5_0191.jpg" n="6"/>result of business and industry, when our educated children acquire civil offices and influential positions rightfully ours, considering our number, then even the American people will cease pointing at us and looking askance, and they will have to admit, "These poles are a desirable nation and a benefit to this country." Then We will be able to answer the question placed at the head of this article, "Yes."</p>
