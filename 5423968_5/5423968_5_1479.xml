   <p>A meeting of the Central Committee in charge of Polish-American Participation in the Lwow Exposition of 1894 was held last night at the [Polish World's Fair] Reception Committee's headquarters. Mr. Smulski presided and L. Szopinski was secretary. Dr. Dunikowski was present at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The Committee was informed that two organizations, the Polish Roman Catholic Union and the Polish National Alliance, had appropriated three hundred and five hundred dollars respectively, to help cover the cost of a Polish-American exhibit at the Exposition.</p>
   <p>The Committee then turned to further business. It was decided that a fund of from fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars is necessary in order to erect a Polish-American pavilion. The Committee will appeal for donations to prominent citizens and societies. The actual cost of the pavilion will be determined in a few weeks, depending upon the amount of money collected. Plans for the pavilion are being drawn by a Polish <pb facs="5423968_5_1480.jpg" n="2"/>architect of Chicago; it will be after the style used here in America. Dr. Dunikowski will take charge of its erection in Lwow.</p>
   <p>The Committee further decided to issue an appeal to the Polish priests of America, requesting them to send in photographs of churches and schools, school statistics, specimens of work done by school children, etc. The Committee will also appeal to the prominent citizens in every Polish community to form local committees.</p>
   <p>Dissertations for exhibition at the Exposition will be prepared on the following subjects: "Polish Schools in America" (to be prepared by S. Zahajkiewicz), and "Polish Journalism in America" (to be prepared by H. Nagiel).</p>
   <p>Many other questions were discussed at the meeting. In regard to our exhibit, it was decided that it shall contain, in addition to examples of our intellectual, religious, educational, and organizational activities, a certain number of industrial products and models of inventions worthy <pb facs="5423968_5_1481.jpg" n="3"/>of exhibition.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting adjourned, the Committee unanimously decided to ask Erasmus Jerzmanowski, of New York, to be its honorary president and representative. Dr. Dunikowski, who will shortly leave for Poland, was asked to lay this invitation before Mr. Jerzmanowski.</p>
