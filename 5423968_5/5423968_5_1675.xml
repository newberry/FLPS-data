<title level="a">POLISH ARTS CLUB ELECTS NEW OFFICERS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Polish Arts Club, held its annual meeting last Wednesday in the Alma Mater hall. The officers of the club for the coming year are: Mr. M. Drezmal, president; Dr. M. Kostrzewski, vice president; W. W. Wieczorek, vice president; Miss P. Suchowska, recording secretary; Miss Helen Banko, financial secretary; W. Przybylski, treasurer; J. B. Zielinska, adviser; K. Midowicz, and Paul Zaleski, directors.</p>
   <p>After the oath of office had be administered to the new officers, the members thanked the retiring president, Miss J. B. Zielinska, for her untiring efforts in the development of the club. Thanks were also extended to Thaddeus Sleszynski, the most active member of the club.</p>
   <p>The past year has recorded itself indelibly in the history of theclub. Outstanding events of the year were the art show, the Polish concert at Ravinia Park, and the violin concert at the Polish Women's Alliance <pb facs="5423968_5_1676.jpg" n="2"/>Hall; there were also many other activities such as concerts, operas, lectures and such other affairs as pertain to the principal purpose of this brave cultural society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Drezmal, in accepting the office of president, emphasized the importance of the Polish Arts club among organizations such as the Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union and the Polish Women's Alliance. In reviewing the development of Polish immigration, and the battle for the general welfare and education of these masses, attorney Drezmal, portrayed vividly the high goals and ideals of the Polish element of Chicago; he particularly directed attention to those individuals whose fortune, ability and education will be of great value to all concerned. Although we cannot all be artists, authors and musicians, we can however help those who possess a higher learning and ability, and in this manner increase our own knowledge, and create a sincere appreciation of the better and finer things of life.</p>
   <p>The Polish Arts Club is a haven not only for those artists who are considered finished, but also for those of our members who are lovers of literature and <pb facs="5423968_5_1677.jpg" n="3"/>art, and truly value such culture.</p>
   <p>An exhibit of carvings and paintings will open in the Home Bank Building on November 25, 1928. The social attractions of this exhibit will be an informal tea, and a musical and vocal program every evening. Every indication points to a successful venture.</p>
   <p>The literary club opened its season with a lecture delivered by Dr. M. Kroll; the subject of the lecture was the author Kasprowicz. The plastic art division is very much interested in this exhibit, and devotes much of its spare time to attending similar lectures.</p>
   <p>The dramatic division is occupied with general organization work.</p>
