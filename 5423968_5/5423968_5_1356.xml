   <p>We wish to remind the reverend Polish priests that it is high time to consider having photographs taken of their churches and schools so as to be able to send them to the exposition as early as possible.</p>
   <p>Many parishes have already sent in their photographs to the Central Committee, and we will soon begin publication of the names of the parishes which have promised to participate in the exposition and help both morally and financially.</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting points at the Polish-American pavilion will be the section devoted to our schools. We hope that the teachers will not forget about this important matter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1357.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are informed that the Polish women, in Chicago and out of town, are preparing various kinds of handwork for their section. We can already announce that this women's section will contain many interesting things. Our Polish women will not need to be ashamed of their exhibit.</p>
   <p>Anyone wishing to participate in the joint excursion to the Lwow Exposition should give his name to the Polish Central Committee, so that reservations may be made at the cheapest possible rate. The more there will be making the trip, the cheaper will be the cost of transportation. Fifteen persons from Chicago alone have already made their reservations.</p>
   <p>(We are reprinting this information for the benefit of those interested in the exposition.)</p>
