<title level="a">POLISH FINE ARTS EXHIBIT COMPANY APPEALS TO ALL POLISH ARTISTS AND SCULPTORS IN AMERICA AND ABROAD</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The undersigned have organized a stock company, Polskiego Towarzystwa Wystawy Sztuk Pieknych W Chicago (Polish Fine Arts Exhibit Company), incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois at ten thousand dollars. Its aims are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To centralize the efforts of our artists and sculptors for the purpose of securing a separate place at the Columbian Exposition, to be held in Chicago next year, where a collection of Polish art can be on display.</p>
   <p>2. To mediate in receiving, placing, returning or selling various works of art.</p>
   <p>3. To institute a permanent independent salon in Chicago, where the art <pb facs="5423968_5_0546.jpg" n="2"/>collection displayed at the World's Fair will have a place, and eventually, during the course of existence, to reclaim and sell at the highest prices on the American market the finest pieces of Polish painting and sculpture.</p>
   <p>The first of these aims came to realization when the undersigned received the assurance of the World's Fair administration that a separate place in the Palace of Fine Arts has been allocated to Polish art and sculpture. The finest works will be displayed, so as to afford the best advantages to the artist or sculptor. Artists should send in their entries as soon as possible; the deadline is set for May 1,1893. It is stipulated that recommendation for exhibition in Chicago by the Polish masters will be sufficient for qualification, and the works submitted will receive the greatest consideration. It is suggested that the Polish artists abroad form committees in the principal cities of their residence, Warsaw, Cracow, Berlin, Rome, Paris, and Monaco, and have these committees select the best works for display at the Chicago fair; their decisions should be sent in writing to Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0547.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The undersigned also wish to add that the Company will undertake the representation of Polish artists and facilitate relations with the World's Fair administration, especially with Mr. Ives, director of art; medals and awards will be handled, and various other services will be performed. If the Polish artists who participate in the exhibit wish to choose someone to represent them, their representative will be welcomed and will be accorded the finest hospitality.</p>
   <p>As to the realization of the other aims the undersigned have made the following provisions: it is desired to open a separate salon during the course of the fair where, if the number of worthy entries is too great for display at the Polish section in the Fine Arts Palace, Polish works can be exhibited. Without doubt many guests and art connoisseurs will come to Chicago during the fair; therefore, those desirous of seeing or purchasing Polish art will have a better opportunity than ever before.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0548.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The following stipend will be charged: 10 per cent for selling art pieces on exhibit at the fair, 15 per cent for selling objects of art from the above-mentioned salon, 8 per cent for exhibiting entries at the salon, 5 per cent for displaying objects for sale at the fair, in the event they are not sold and are returned to the owner. The packing charges and risk must be borne by the owners.</p>
   <p>The transportation charges and taxes will be paid by the Polish Fine Arts Exhibit Company, provided that the pictures are sent without frames and valued at not more than a thousand dollars. The charges for handling the entries will be collected upon their arrival or sale, or not longer than two months after the close of the Columbian Exposition, or six months after having them displayed in the salon. Entries should be addressed direct "in bond" to the customhouse in Chicago. Those intended for the fair should be marked "For the Columbian Exposition." Frames will be supplied here in order to avoid higher express charges and taxes. Their cost will be defrayed by the Company. In <pb facs="5423968_5_0549.jpg" n="5"/>the event that an artist desires to send his painting framed he should arrange to pay for the cost of transportation and taxes himself.</p>
   <p>Further particulars will appear in detail in circulars which will be distributed. Meanwhile it is urged that all Polish artists make arrangements for sending their choice works and notifying the undersigned of their plans. The deadline for exhibits at the Columbian Exposition is definitely set for May 1, 1893.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that all Polish artists will support this enterprise and will exert every effort to have a cross section of Polish art on exhibit at the Chicago fair. This will be their only opportunity to have their works on display, and it should not be overlooked. It is also hoped that those of the great Polish artists who wish to display something they have already sold will make arrangements with the purchasers to have this work on public view at the Fine <pb facs="5423968_5_0550.jpg" n="6"/>Arts Palace in Chicago. It is only through this medium that the great Polish works can come to the attention not only of the Polish people but of the general public. In this way Polish genius will never die.</p>
   <p>Letters should be addressed to Mr. Adalia Satalecki, 186 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois, U. S. A.</p>
   <p>Chicago, November 26, 1892.</p>
   <p>Directors:</p>
   <p>S. F. Adalia Satalecki,</p>
   <p>Maximilian Drzymala,</p>
   <p>Casimir Sawicki,</p>
   <p>Sigismund Rogalski,</p>
