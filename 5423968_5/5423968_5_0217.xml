   <p>Brother Cisimir Zeglen's bulletproof material underwent rigorous tests last night at Folz's Hall, Larrabee and North Avenue, before a group of City officials, bankers and reporters. The purpose of the tests was to create a wider circle of the interested public in order that they could see for themselves the advantages of this invention.</p>
   <p>Over two hundred persons gathered to see the tests, many were close friends of the inventor. The demonstration was conducted by S. Sarnecki, lieutenant in the Austrian army.</p>
   <p>Bulletproof vests of various thicknesses were shown to the spectators. Each type used depended upon the caliber of the gun.</p>
   <p>The protective material of the vest measured from twelve to eighteen inches and the thickness did not measure more than half an inch. The thickest vest did not weigh more than three fourths of a pound.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0218.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The tests proved highly successful. Thirty-eight and forty-four caliber revolvers were used, with varying charges. The owner of a German type revolver used by the cavalry was in to audience. [His revolver was also used in the demonstration.] A series of fifty shots were fired. The bullets were stopped by the bulletproof material and dropped flattened to the floor. Some of them penetrated the covering, which was used to hide the secret material, and remained inside the covering.</p>
   <p>An amateur marksman was also on the scene with his own pistol. He was permitted by Mr. Sarnecki to test his skill. He fired six shots but each missed the target.</p>
   <p>Several Austrian, Prussian, and American officers were also on the scene. All were convinced of the usefulness of Brother Zeglen's invention, for all doubts were dispelled under the severe tests. The inventor was congratulated upon his remarkable discovery. Although Brother Zeglen has twelve different types <pb facs="5423968_5_0219.jpg" n="3"/>completed, he is working on one that will be as effective against the latest type of rifle.</p>
