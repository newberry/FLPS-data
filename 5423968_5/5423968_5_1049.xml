   <p>For the third time the beautiful play "Perla Cyllejska" [Cyllejska Pearl], by S. Zahajkiewicz, was presented at the School Hall near Bradley Street, and for the third time it held the undivided attention of the audience. True--the audience was not a large one, but it was one that sympathized wholeheartedly with the author.</p>
   <p>With a few minor changes, the cast was essentially the same as in previous productions, so we will not repeat it. We need only add that the play was still more carefully prepared, if such a thing is possible. The title role was played by Madame [Rose] Kwasigroch, who is unrivaled on the Polish stage. A new choral number in the last act added to the beauty of the play, and was warmly applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>The performance was honored by the presence of an archbishop from Mexico, who is a guest of the Resurrection Fathers here.</p>
