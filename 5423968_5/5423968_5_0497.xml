  <body>
   <p>We present Mr. Karol T. Kowalski as one of the best Polish tenors in America. Mr. Kowalski graduated with honor from the Chicago Musical College. He possesses a high tenor voice, if he would only practice more (as is his aim to do so), he could become an outstanding singer. The music critics predict for this Pole success in the future. Not only the Polish but likewise the American public is interested in this tenor. In Chicago and other sections of town Mr. Kowalski very often is presented in public and private festivities, of which he was invited by the more prominent Americans. Many times the English papers have written about Mr. Kowalski and praised him about the talent he possesses. May 16th there was a concert held here in Chicago in which Mr. Kowalski participated. He sang a duet with Mr. A. Mallek the "Songs of our Fatherland" by Debinski. Beside the presentation of these two fellow countrymen other numbers on the program were equally popular, such as Mr. J. Mallek, a famous violinist, Mrs. Hedwig Smulska, Prof. Chopek and many other musical artists.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kowalski is still very young and for the past seven years he works in promoting the singing of St. Michaels Archangel parish in South Chicago.</p>
