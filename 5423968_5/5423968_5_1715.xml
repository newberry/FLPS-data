  <body>
   <p>As a result of Dr. Kostrzewski's splendid lecture on Modern Polish Literature, delivered last Sunday afternoon at the Art Institute, over a dozen members have decided to take up the study of modern Polish Literature. Meetings will be held once a month and each member of the group will be expected to do the reading assigned to him or her and be ready to report at the next meetings. The first meeting will be held at the home of Mr. J. B. Zielinski, 4968 Berteau Avenue on Friday Evening, February 4, 1927. Every member of the group is expected to provide himself with a copy of Mr. Roman Dyboski's lectures on Modern Polish Literature. Mrs. M. Kaletta will lead the discussion at the first meeting. The subject to be discussed is the modern Polish novel.</p>
   <p>Members of the club interested in dramatics will attend the Goodman Theatre on Friday evening, January 21, 1927. The next regular meeting of the club will be held on Sunday afternoon, February 13, 1927 at the Polish Alma Mater Building. Dr. Thaddeus Mijana, of the University of Cracow and now at the University of Michigan, will be the guest of the club throughout the day, at 4: P.M. he will lecture on Polish culture from the historical standpoint and at 6: P.M. there will be a supper and reception held in his honor at which a short program by the members will be given.</p>
