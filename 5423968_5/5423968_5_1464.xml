<title level="a">POLISH DAY CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The sixth consecutive meeting of the Polish Day Central Committee was held yesterday at Pulaski Hall. S. Slominski presided and H. Nagiel acted as secretary. After the minutes of the last meeting had been accepted, correspondence from out-of-town societies was read. The Third of May Society, of New York, notified the Committee that it would send a special delegation, bearing a donation, to Chicago to participate in Polish Day. The Thaddeus Kosciusko Society of Hegewisch, Illinois, will participate in corpore together with societies from Hammond, Indiana. The Holy Virgin of Czestochowa Society, of Minonk, Illinois, expressed its desire to participate in corpore and asked for information. The St. Isidore's Society, of Racine, Wisconsin, plans to be represented by a delegation. The St. Stanislaus and St. Anthony Society, of Hyman [sic] listing about 150 members, reported that it would participate in the parade in corpore. The Battalion of Polish Soldiers, of Buffalo, informed the Committee that a group of its officers would be delegated <pb facs="5423968_5_1465.jpg" n="2"/>to the Polish Day celebration.</p>
   <p>Community reports followed the reading of the correspondence. These reports show that preparations for Polish Day are definitely in progress everywhere. The Immaculate Conception Parish, of South Chicago, will not furnish any floats; nevertheless, it will participate and will probably supply one troop of horsemen. Only St. Josephat's Parish has not yet been heard from, although there is still hope that it will also participate.</p>
   <p>Next came the parade committee's report. After a long discussion, the gathering accepted the parade program and parade route proposed by the committee with one minor change--the St. Adalberts young women's float will be transferred from the second to the first division.</p>
   <p>The parade will be divided into three great divisions. The first division will include the Polish policemen, the societies from the parishes of St. Stanislaus Kostka and St. Adalbert, a troop of horsemen, and the following floats: "Washington, Kosciusko, and Pulaski," "Sobieski," "Poland in Her Prime," "Parnassus <pb facs="5423968_5_1466.jpg" n="3"/>of Poland," "Scene from Siberian Mines," "Slaughter of the Unites," and "Poles under the American Flag". The second division will consist of the Kosciusko Guard of Milwaukee, the societies and the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance, [the societies from the] Holy Trinity and the South Chicago parishes, and the following floats: "Third of May," "Poland in Chains," "Stephen Batory," "Defense of Czestochowa," and a children's float from St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The third great division will include the societies from Town of Lake, with a troop of horsemen; [the societies from] St. Hedwig's Parish, in Bridgeport; the societies from the vicinity of Chicago; [the societies from] St. Casimir's Parish; and the following floats: "Polish Woman, with a Sword at Her Side, Teaching Her Children to Read," "Cracovian Wedding," "Labor," "Resurection of Poland," and a mounted figure representing Wanda.</p>
   <p>The foregoing is merely a summary of the program, which is soon to be prepared in detail and printed for distribution in all Polish communities. A motion by Bielinski that the parade be held on the [World's] Fair grounds instead of <pb facs="5423968_5_1467.jpg" n="4"/>in the city streets was defeated after a heated discussion.</p>
   <p>Speaking for the music committee, A. Kwasigroch reported that an orchestra of forty, under the direction of Czapka, had been engaged to play at the Festival Hall program. The orchestra will cost about four hundred dollars. The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>The feature music for the parade will be supplied by the First Brigade of St. Adalbert's Parish, which will be suitably enlarged for the occasion; the Central Committee will pay for the additional musicians needed.</p>
   <p>Judge [M. A.] La Buy and Mr. Bielinski raised the question of whether or not admission would be charged to Festival Hall. It was decided that all persons wearing the official Polish Day pin would be admitted free of charge; that all others would be charged twenty-five cents and would be given seats in the front rows. The financial committee will be in charge of ticket sales.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1468.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Next followed the report of the committee on arrangements for the celebration at Festival Hall. In reply to the committee's written invitation to the City Council and the Mayor, Mayor Harrison promised to issue an appropriate proclamation. The City Council has already appointed a delegation, consisting of five aldermen headed by Alderman [Stanley] Kunz, which will represent it at the Polish Day festivities. The committee also reported that Mayor Harrison and Dr. [Casimir] Midowicz had accepted invitations to speak at Festival Hall.</p>
   <p>On a suggestion by J. Mucha, it was decided to issue an appeal to all Polish businessmen to close their stores on October 7. Pastors of Polish parishes will be asked to recommend this action in each parish.</p>
   <p>The committee on pins announced that it had placed ten thousand pins in the hands of W. Bardonski, financial secretary. The charges, amounting to five hundred dollars, have already been paid. In order to receive its quota of pins, each society is to apply to Bardonski with a receipt showing that its fifteen-cents-per-capita assessment has been paid. It was decided to order <pb facs="5423968_5_1469.jpg" n="6"/>two thousand more pins, and to issue an appeal to private persons to buy them. Pins may be obtained either from the financial secretary or from the community treasurers.</p>
   <p>[K.] Zychlinski brought up the matter of assigning two Polish floats for participation in Chicago Day, but, since the hour was already late, this and other questions were deferred until the next meeting, which will be held on October 3 at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>Judge La Buy [treasurer] reported that the following additional societies had paid their fifteen-cents-per-capita assessment: Thaddeus Kosciusko Society, of Hegewisch ( 26 members), $3.75; St. Michael Archangel Council, Catholic Order of Foresters (30 members), $4.20; King Casimir the Great Society, of St. Adalbert's Parish (66 members), $9.90; Heart of the Holy Virgin Society, of St. Adalbert's Parish (50 members), $7.50; Brotherhood of St. Dominic (85 members), $12.75; Knights of St. Casimir (54 members), $8.10; Name of Jesus Society, $9.25; and St. Gregory Krakus Society, $4.80. [Translator's note: The last four societies are from St. Adalbert's Parish.] Judge La Buy reported that over <pb facs="5423968_5_1470.jpg" n="7"/>a hundred societies, representing more than seven hundred members, had already paid.</p>
   <p>After a contribution of ten dollars by Mr. Epsztein had been accepted, the meeting adjourned.</p>
