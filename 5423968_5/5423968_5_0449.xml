   <p>This is the day of Anthony Mallek's funeral.</p>
   <p>Michael Bienski of Milwaukee, censor of the Polish National Alliance, has sent an impressive wreath for the bier of the father of Polish song in America.</p>
   <p>The Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance also sent an imposing wreath and took part en masse in the funeral of the former secretary general of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Crowds of Polish people took part in the funeral of this national worker and indefatigable champion of Polish song, which resounds now over foreign soil, thanks to the efforts of such men as Anthony Mallek.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0450.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His spirit has gone beyond, and the cold grave has covered his body. Foreign soil has taken a Polish patriot to its bosom, to whom it was not granted to lay his bones in a free and united Poland, as he so ardently desired in his lifetime.</p>
   <p>It was fitting that our people should honor the memory of this worker, placing masses of wreaths on his bier, and taking part in large numbers in the funeral. Thus does one take leave only of persons who have done the nation a great service.</p>
   <p>Honor to the memory of a gallant worker and former officer of the Polish National Alliance, who worked for the Alliance when it was small, persecuted and poor, without material assets. Anthony Mallek worked not for profit or fame and remained at his post during the most difficult times.</p>
