  <body>
   <p>A great excursion to Kosciusko Park will take place Sunday, September 25. Eighty beautiful lots for residential and business purposes are for sale. The streets are leveled, the sidewalks are completed, and shady trees are growing. This section of land is near the city limits. It borders on Milwaukee, Forest, and Park Avenues. A beautiful park, filled with beautiful flowers and trees, will grace this new subdivision. It is to be one hundred feet wide. These lots are at a high level and are thoroughly drained. They are situated close to the Northwestern railroad and only a few blocks from the Calumet Terminal railroad. Those who desire to purchase a site for their new home are reminded to do their buying now while prices are low.</p>
   <p>Thirty trains daily. Only twenty-five minutes to and from work.</p>
   <p>Four lots have been given free for a new Polish church and school.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0323.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lots are selling from $225 and up. All that is necessary is one tenth of this amount as down payment, the balance to be paid at the rate of five dollars or more a month.</p>
   <p>The train leaves from the Wells Street depot at 1:30, and at 1:40 P. M. it leaves from the Clybourn Junction. Tickets, maps, and other information are available at A. Gray, 77 Clark Street; J. Prange, 161 Blackhawk Street; and A. J. Kowalski, 617 Noble Street. Tickets may also be obtained from the agents ten minutes before train time.</p>
