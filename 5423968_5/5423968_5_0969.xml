   <p>Two plays "St. Nicholas" and "Professor" were staged by the school children of St.Mary of Perpetual Help Parish on January 1. The program was greatly enjoyed by the capacity audience. Besides the two plays, speeches, drills, and declamations were on the bill of entertainment. All were heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>One of the most impressive numbers was that of the school children who sang a song of welcome to the pastor and the parents.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with the presentation of a tableau, "The Mother of God, Guardian of the Innocent".</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that the audience enjoyed the performance. The applause and cheering spoke for itself. The audience was reluctant to leave; however, <pb facs="5423968_5_0970.jpg" n="2"/>it was comforted to hear that a January exercise, a patriotic event commemorating the uprising of January, 1863, against Russia, will be staged on the twenty-fourth of this month.</p>
