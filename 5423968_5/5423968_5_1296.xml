   <p>Adam Szwajkart, manager of the Polish-American Pavilion and representative of the Poles of America, was feted by the Poles of his homeland in Lwow, at the close of the national fair. According to reports it has been acknowledged that the Polish-American Pavilion was the most interesting and the most visited one at the fair.</p>
   <p>To give recognition for the fine work accomplished by the manager of this building, the democratic societies under the direction of Mr. Tyrenkoczy gave a banquet in his honor. Toasts by many prominent individuals were given to the American Pole....</p>
   <p>Mr. Szwajkart delivered a talk on the accomplishments of the Poles in America during the past twenty-five years.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1297.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All agreed that the immigration of the Poles to the new world was not detrimental but advantageous to the homeland; that the schackled people had shed their bonds and grown in strength and power for the first time in more than a century.</p>
   <p>A toast was also paid to the Geographical Business Society of Lwow, especially to Dr. Stanislaus Klobukowski, for a number of years director of Przeglad Emigracyjny (Immigration Review).</p>
   <p>Congratulations for Mr. Szwajkart and his Polish-American Pavilion were received from many people.</p>
