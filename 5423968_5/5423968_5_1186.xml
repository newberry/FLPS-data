   <p>The committee in charge of the Polish section at the Allied Bazaar, to take place next month at the Coliseum for the benefit of Polish war victims, held a full meeting last Tuesday at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall. The meeting proceeded in a dignified manner, and the duties of individual subcommittees were discussed. There is much to be done, and it will be necessary to work energetically if the work already begun is to be brought to a successful conclusion. It should be mentioned that many [Polish] priests have promised to lend their active support. For this reason, it was decided that all of the priests should be made honorary presidents of the committee. Local subcommittees were named, the duty of each being to direct the work in each community. Other subcommittees were also named. One of them is to contact theater owners in Polish communities with the intention of persuading them to dedicate the proceeds of one day, or part of a day, to the Polish section at the Bazaar. A few of the theater <pb facs="5423968_5_1187.jpg" n="2"/>owners have already agreed to this proposition. This source may yield a relatively large sum of money.</p>
   <p>The announcement by Mrs. Felicia Modrzejewski, vice-president of the committee, that she is donating various mementos of the late Helen Modrzejewski [Modjeski], whose memory we all revere, had a pleasant effect upon the meeting. These items will be sold at auction.</p>
   <p>The committee asks all Poles to support this affair wholeheartedly. There is much work to be done--difficult work. The committee asks Polish merchants to contribute either goods or money; advertisements for the program are also being solicited. In the opinion of the committee, contributions can and should be made, not only by business houses but by private individuals who can afford it. All contributions should be made to the local subcommittees, or to the committee's headquarters in the offices of the secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance, 1309 North Ashland Avenue. A <pb facs="5423968_5_1188.jpg" n="3"/>meeting of subcommittee chairmen will be held at eight o'clock in the evening, Friday, December 15, at the Polish Women's Alliance Building. The committee asks all those concerned to attend; important questions will be discussed.</p>
