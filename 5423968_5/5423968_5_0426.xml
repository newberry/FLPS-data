   <p>Madame Jamina Korolewicz a noted Polish singer who triumphed in Orchestra Hall last May, <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>turned to Chicago after a successful concert tour to New York and other cities.</p>
   <p>We will have the pleasure of <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Korolewicz Waydowa again in a short time, at a beneficial concert which will be <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of great operatic arias and popular songs.</p>
   <p>Madame Korolewicz Waydowa will reside in Chicago and from here she will conduct her tours to different cities, where she will give concerts.</p>
   <p>Madame Korolewicz Waydowa decided to open a higher operatic school for solo singing on the pattern of Mr. Jan <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> school in Paris, where she finished her studies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0427.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Madame Korolewicz Waydowa, as we all know, finished the Lemberg Con-servatory of Music (in Poland under Austrian rule), where she was rewarded by a gold medal. It is the same conservatory where many famous singers studied, including Adam Didura. She also studied music in Maddalon, Italy, under the famous teacher of music, Maestro Carignani, who is the friend of Puccinini and Kaestro Campanini.</p>
   <p>Her whole career is one great success and all the critics of the whole world proclaimed her a mistress of music.</p>
   <p>Madame Korolewicz Waydowa, on account of her great talent, was made a director of the Warsaw Opera, where she guarded the culture and art of Warsaw singers. This is a guarantee that she will train the voices of our Chicago music students and make first-class singers of some of them. Our community should receive this new center of culture with great enthusiasm.</p>
