   <p>The bazaar which was held by the well-known Girls' Aid for Girls of Poland Society, at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall from April 24 to April 26, inclusive, was quite successful, as we can see from the financial report. The Society's clear profit from the bazaar was $275, which has already been donated to the designated fund [Polish relief]. The public should be thanked for the success of the affair because despite the bad weather, the attendance was good. Those who contributed items for sale should also be thanked.</p>
   <p>The Girls' Aid for Girls of Poland Society also extends its thanks to all those who participated in the program, as well as to those who helped arrange the bazaar.</p>
   <p>The gross income from the bazaar was $430; expenses were $155, leaving a clear profit of $275.</p>
