   <p>The play entitled "Ogniem I Mieczem" was presented yesterday at the Kosciusko Theater, 1064 Milwaukee Avenue. Probably every Pole is familiar with the incomparable novel of this title, replete with humor and beautiful language, by our late lamented author, Henryk Sienkiewicz.</p>
   <p>Drawn by curiosity, I went to see the play, prepared in advance to witness a parody. It was presented in four acts; the scenario was good, the old Polish language was retained, the costumes were beautiful, and the scenery left nothing to be desired. But most important was the fact that the actors, of whom there were about ten in the play, understood and enacted their roles well.</p>
   <p>W. Wojcicki was incomparable in the role of Zagloba; no author could dream <pb facs="5423968_5_0558.jpg" n="2"/>of a better interpretation of this character. (There have already been several interpretations of <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in Chicago, but none to compare with this one). In the pole of <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Mr. M. [sic] played well, but a little more energy on his part would have helped. Mr. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> played <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> unexpectedly well despite the fact that he lacked the necessary physical proportions for the part. No is one of the foremost Polish actors in America.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Mojcicki played the role of Helena faultlessly, depicting a real Polish type, full of grace and modesty. Mrs. Pawel, who played the Princess, was excellent, adapting herself well to the aristocratic manners of princely blood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pleskazynski deserves special mention for his performance as the old servant, the Tartar; he was a little too old for the part of Rzedzian. Even the smaller roles of Symeon and two Cossacks were played well, and in general, the action was sustained throughout.</p>
   <p>The directors of the theater deserve acknowledgment for presenting this <pb facs="5423968_5_0559.jpg" n="3"/>worthwhile historical play. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> has not yet seen it can still see it today or tomorrow. The play is divided into four parts of four acts each. Four acts will be played each week and anyone who wants to see the complete play must attend every week.</p>
