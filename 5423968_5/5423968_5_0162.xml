   <p>Yesterday, I visited a very interesting Polish industry. It was Mr. M. Wojtecki's jewelry shop, which is located at 677 Milwaukee Ave. I take it for granted that it is the only Polish shop of its kind in existence. Although Mr. Wojtecki is a well known jeweler, and an excellent watch repairer, very few people know that those beautiful adornments and artistic jewels which are exhibited in his wondows, were made right in his shop, which is in the rear of his jewelry store.</p>
   <p>This shop is equipped with the latest and very complicated machinery and tools; and a chemical laboratory. Mr. Wojtecki employs six proficient artisans, who know how to manipulate these machines and delicate tools. In that shop there is a jewelers furnace, in which gold and silver is annealed and purified to a fine carat. The molten metal is poured into specially constructed moulds, in which it hardens, then, it goes through the cutting, stamping, shaping and polishing process, after which it is <pb facs="5423968_5_0163.jpg" n="2"/>formed into beautiful rings, pins, watch cases and other artistic objects.</p>
   <p>Unusually interesting is the bench, at which Jewels are enameled. The enamel used in Mr. Wojtecki's jewelry business, is imported by him, from France. It is made by precious stones and is very expensive. Its cost is six dollars an ounce. Mr. Wojtecki's shop is also equipped with a special furnace which is used for enameling. Not less interesting is the electro-plating bench and machinery, where watch cases and other objects are gold plated. Mr. Wojtecki's establishment is a great success. The Poles should follow Mr. Wojteciki's example.</p>
