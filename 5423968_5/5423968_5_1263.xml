   <p>A meeting of the committee in charge of arranging the Fourth of July picnic for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument was held yesterday in Szulc's Hall.</p>
   <p>President J. Polczynski called the meeting to order, after which several letters were read from societies that had agreed to take part in the picnic in Schuetzen Park. These are King Wenceslaus I of Chicago (group 122 of the Polish National Alliance); Saint Casimir--Jagielonian Society; Love of the Poland Nation Society (group 188 of Polish National Alliance); Association of Polish Printers; Polish Ladies' Star of Victory Society Number I; and Saint Joseph Society Number 2, Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>Then a letter was read from Mr. Z. Schmidt, commandant of Corps 2 of the Polish Army [military societies] in America, in which he notified the <pb facs="5423968_5_1264.jpg" n="2"/>committee that although the societies in Town of Lake and his group of soldiers [members of military societies so called because they wear military uniforms during parades, etc.] were unable to take part in the picnic they would make an appropriate contribution for the monument.</p>
   <p>The committee from Holy Trinity Parish, who had been notified by the pastor, Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, came to the meeting. The president of the Committee received the books for contributions. Mr. Binkowski promised to work hard for the success of the picnic.</p>
   <p>The societies in Saint Adalbert Parish have done nothing as yet, but the question of participation in the picnic will be discussed tonight at a meeting.</p>
   <p>All matters concerned with the picnic are shaping themselves favorably.</p>
   <p>The committee is appealing to all those societies that are unable to <pb facs="5423968_5_1265.jpg" n="3"/>participate in the picnic to do as the Town of Lake societies are doing-- send a donation to the treasurer, S. Wojtalewicz, 550 Noble Street. All donations--cash, liquor, cigars, and cigarettes--will be gratefully accepted.</p>
