   <p>The opening day of the Lwow Exposition is very near, for, only eight weeks separates us from this important event, at which Poland will give account to herself and to others of her cultural attainments. This means that Poland will show how far she has advanced in education, art, commerce, agriculture, etc., in spite of the bondage which has impeded her development.</p>
   <p>The Poles in America have been invited to participate in this Exposition, and it is because of that invitation that we are making this appeal.</p>
   <p>All Polish settlements in America have contributed toward this Exposition by sending many valuable exhibits to the Central Committee in Chicago and to subcommittees in New York and Baltimore--which proves that the American Poles are not lost to their motherland. By participation in the Lwow Exposition, we <pb facs="5423968_5_1344.jpg" n="2"/>will prove that we are united with our native land, that we have not ceased to love it, and that we think about it.</p>
   <p>The accumulated exhibits must be shipped within a few days so that they can reach their destination on time. The last shipment will be made on April 5, 1894. Those preparing exhibits should send them before April 5 to the Committee, care of L. Szopinski, 559 Noble Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>We wish to appeal again to our clergy, societies, patriots, and all persons of good will, for more donations, because we need funds for shipping expenses. We are still short about one thousand dollars. This sum could be easily obtained if those societies which have not yet contributed anything toward the Exposition would send at least a small cash contribution. A donation of a few dollars will not impoverish any society, but it will help the cause. All cash donations should be sent to Boleslaus Klarkowski, 42 Bradley Street, Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1345.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In behalf of the Central Committee, we recommend once more this worthy cause to the generosity of our Polish American public.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>W. Smulski, president.</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski, secretary,</p>
   <p>559 Noble Street, Chicago</p>
