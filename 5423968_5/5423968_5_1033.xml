   <p>A new play was presented last night at the school hall near Bradley Street.</p>
   <p>It was a five-act drama with songs, entitled "The Cave of Beatus" and dramatized by Szczesny Zalhajkiewcz from the story of the same title. It pleased everyone.</p>
   <p>The play presents the story of Count Henry Waldbergen, who was persecuted and imprisoned by the knight Dietrich, his enemy; it also presents the fate of Waldbergen's family. The play contains many dramatic and thrilling scenes. Naturally, the persecuted hero triumphs and the last scene ends with forgiveness. The theme of the play is beautiful and moral. It will interest the audience throughout the whole performance. Excellent scenery, beautiful singing, fine costumes, and pretty decorations added to the beauty of the play and brought great applause from the audience. "The Cave of Beatus" is an excellent drama and will undoubtedly be presented many times on the Polish <pb facs="5423968_5_1034.jpg" n="2"/>stage in America with great success.</p>
   <p>"The Cave of Beatus" was played faultlessly, excellently. We do not know which player deserves the highest praise. J. Grabowiecki portrayed the role of Beatus (the father of Count Henry Waldbergen) excellently. The role of the Count was played admirably by John Nering, and J. Kondziorski re-created the character of gloomy and violent Dietrich exquisitely. Miss W. Chlebowski played, as usual, wonderfully, in the role of "Theodora," the unfortunate wife of the Count, and V. Jozwiakowski, as Otto the falconer, her son, distinguished himself by all his good qualities, namely: by great enthusiasm and good declamation. As to the feminine roles, Miss R. Zukowski played splendidly the role of the energetic wife of the bailiff "Martin". Other young ladies, like Miss A. Lubowiecki, who characterized the wife of Dietrich, Miss A. Nering, who characterized Dietpich's daughter, and Miss W. Barwig, who played Rosie, also deserved applause. On the whole, all the roles, even the smallest ones, were played splendidly.</p>
   <p>We cannot ignore the players of other roles; for instance, M. Brochocki <pb facs="5423968_5_1035.jpg" n="3"/>played the semi-comical role of Martin, the bailiff, splendidly, and A. Huntowski characterized Claus very well. P. Kikulski played the role of Joseph excellently; R. Szajkowski presented the dignified role of an emperor and Miss Stas that of an empress.</p>
   <p>The singing was rendered in artistic style. The "tableaux vivants" were very picturesque. In general, everything was a great success, thanks to the skill of the author, who was the stage director, and the endeavors of A. Kwasigroch, who was choir and music director.</p>
