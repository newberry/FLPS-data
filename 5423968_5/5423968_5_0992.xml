   <p>The Dramatic Circle of Prince Joseph Poniatowski in St. Adalbert Parish presented two plays Sunday, January 19, in the Parish hall, 16th and Paulina Streets.</p>
   <p>The first was "Kwiat Paproci, Czyli Noc Czarodziejska" (The Flower of a Fern or One Magic Night), by Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz. The main roles were played by Mr. F. Daniel, Mr. A. Kichler, Mr. W. Pelka, and Mr. M. Kruszkowski. The role of the witch was excellently portrayed by Miss B. Krasinska; that of the king, by Mr. Frank Herek.</p>
   <p>The second play was "Pieniadz-Smiercczyli Zabojstwo" (Money--Death or Murder), written by Mr. Pawlowski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0993.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this play the roles were portrayed as follows: The host by the author himself (done excellently); Miss A. Tatara; Mr. Frank Daniel (played the role of a Jew very realistically); W. Pelka; and A. Kichler (played well).</p>
   <p>The minor roles were played by F. Herek, L. Ligmanowski, M. Czajkowski, M. Kruszkowski, J. Plocharz, J. Binkowski, J. Lewandowski, M. Torchalski, Miss M. Zoldowski, Miss A. Kabat, and Miss R. Pawlowski.</p>
   <p>Both plays were excellently played. The hall was crowded and the amateur players were rewarded with tumultuous applause.</p>
   <p>The members of our young Circle are bravely going to work and are perfecting their Polish. All honor and praise to them for this.</p>
   <p>One of those present.</p>
