   <p>The Polish University Club has had a number of very interesting meetings recently, and progress has been made in perfecting a much needed organization for the Polish-American youth, interested in making their contribution to the cultural and intellectual life of the United States.</p>
   <p>In a joint meeting of the Polish University Girl's Sorority, the Polish University Club, and the Polish Arts Club, held recently, Professor Stephen Mizwa, the ardent executive director of the Kosciusko Foundation, spoke informally, as a man acquainted with student life and its problems. He pleaded that we, the younger generation, do not forget the Polish language, not only because it may benefit us in dollars and cents, but because the knowledge of the Polish language will better acquaint us with the culture of that nation; and this should be our contribution to the new American culture.</p>
   <p>After the meeting a reception was held for Professor Mizwa at which he explained the future plans of the Kosciuszko Foundation.</p>
