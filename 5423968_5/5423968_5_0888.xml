   <p>In Chicago there has developed the praiseworthy custom of arranging free concerts and plays for the Poles at the public parks. These performances are generally presented by choral and musico-literary societies.</p>
   <p>Yesterday we witnessed two such performances at Eckhart Park. One performance was a concert by a choir of the Alliance of Polish Singers, which took place at 3 P. M; the other, by the Promien (Ray) Society, took place at 7:30 P. M. Both performances were excellent. A large audience attended, especially during the evening performance of the Promien Musico-Literary Society.</p>
   <p>The elocutionists and musicians did their parts exceptionally well. The little comedy entitled "Dwie Tesciowe" (The Two Mothers-in-law), presented by the Promien Society, was especially well liked.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0889.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the present time we do not want to praise these amateurs too highly lest our praise spoil them for the future. This would be a great shame, since, as we already mentioned last week, the Promien Society will present Slowacki's drama, "Marya Stuart" [Mary Stuart], at the Polish Women's Alliance Building on May 6. Let them complete this undertaking successfully, and we promise that each and every one of them will get his just praise.</p>
