   <p>The members of Saint Mary's Sodality staged a play last night in honor of Father Vincent Barzynski's birthday at the new Polish hall on Bradley Street. Before the play Mr. Zagrzebski, the president of the Sodality gave a brief explanation of the delay in the play's production, since it had been scheduled for the fifth of April. [following the speech,] Miss Victoria Mikitynski, praised and congratulated Father Vincent Barzynski in a beautiful Polish birthday song which received a great deal of applause, and then she sang the difficult but beautiful Ave Maria after which the play was presented.</p>
   <p>It was a four-act Polish play entitled Wiara, Nadzieja I Milosc (Faith, Hope and Charity), that described the life of the Polish people and was written by Adam Staszczyk. The amateurs gave their best efforts and the audience which was quite large enjoyed the production.</p>
   <p>In our opinion a Polish theater giving a weekly presentation would be successful.</p>
