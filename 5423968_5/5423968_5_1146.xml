  <body>
   <p>An invitation has been sent out by the Christmas Kermis Committee to the Polish doctors of Chicago [requesting them] to participate in the bazaar at the Union Hall. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>To Polish Doctors of Chicago and vicinity:</p>
   <p>At the recommendation of the representatives of Upper-Silesia, namely: Captain Grzesik-Hauke, commander of the insurrection forces, Dr. Captain G. Mikolajczyk, chief medical advisor in General Haller's army, who has been awarded many medals for his bravery, including the highest ranking award "Virtuti Militari," and Lieutenant Koneczny, valiant and industrious worker of the Silesian mines, I am turning to you, dear friends, in their name to take part in the Christmas Kermis at the Union Hall. This affair is sponsored by veterans of the Polish Army, Post No. 1. The last day of this Kermis will be Sunday, Dec. 18.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The entire proceeds will go towards the aid of the unfortunate widows, orphans, invalids, and the thousands of valiant men who have been wounded in the affray.</p>
   <p>Friends, we are familiar with your generosity, for you have given previously many times without any publicity. Because of the gravity of the present drive for funds, which, without doubt, is one of the noblest, I ask you to spend some of your free time at the Union Hall, which is located at Augusta and Milwaukee Avenues. I assure you that you will find a treat in store.</p>
   <p>In the name of the representatives of Upper-Silesia,</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Pietrzykowski.</p>
  </body>
