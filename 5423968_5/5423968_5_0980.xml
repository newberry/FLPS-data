<title level="a">PICTURES DEPICTING THE PASSION OF OUR LORD, JESUS CHRIST, SHOWN IN THE ST. JOHN CANTIUS HALL</title></bibl>

   <p>(We received the following correspondence with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>Yesterday's exhibition of pictures, on stereopticon slides, of the "Passion of our Lord, Jesus Christ," was more successful than expected.</p>
   <p>There were many guests from other parishes, especially St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity Parishes. At the entrance, very few inquired for the cheapest tickets; the great majority demanded the highest priced tickets--twenty-five cents a person.</p>
   <p>There is an old Polish adage that joy goes hand in hand with sorrow, and yesterday it was truly so, because practically all in the audience shed tears during the scenes depicting the cruel "Passion of our Lord, Jesus Christ," <pb facs="5423968_5_0981.jpg" n="2"/>while they laughed at other pictures, which were comic.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds were turned over to the St. John Cantius Church Building Fund.</p>
   <p>Reverend John Kasprzycki,</p>
   <p>of the Resurrectionist Congregation,</p>
   <p>pastor of St. John Cantius Parish.</p>
