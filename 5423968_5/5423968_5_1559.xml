   <p>A meeting of Polish businessmen from this part of the city was held yesterday, at one of the halls in the St. Stanislaus Kostka School building, to discuss Polish Day plans. A few score of merchants and tradesmen were present. Among their number were grocers, saloonkeepers, bakers, carpenters, coal men, druggists, agents, etc.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by W. Jedrzejek, who named S. Slominski chairman. Discussion on the possible participation of Polish businessmen in the Polish Day celebration was taken up by W. Bardonski, [Peter] Arkuszewski, W. Jedrzejek, J. Mucha, Bieszka, Judge [M. A.] La Buy, Lisztewnik, Keclewski, and many others. Bardonski said that the Foresters (Catholic Order of Foresters), whose meeting was held recently, will participate. R. Meclewski informed the gathering that he was willing to furnish the float "Poland in Chains" in conjunction with others. J. Mucha <pb facs="5423968_5_1560.jpg" n="2"/>offered to contribute one wagon, four gray horses, and a teamster. Both of these pledges were enthusiastically received. Other speakers assured the co-operation of representatives of other lines of business.</p>
