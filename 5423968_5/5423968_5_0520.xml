<title level="a">MR. ANDRE SKALSKI ON THE POLISH ARTS CLUB PROGRAM</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>At the meeting of the executive committee, held at the home of the president, Mr. J. B. Zielinski, many important matters concerning the program of the club for the next four months were discussed and decided upon. Mrs. Edward J. Prebis was appointed recording secretary for the balance of the year, and it is hoped that she will continue in this capacity during the coming year.</p>
   <p>At the September meeting of the club, which will be held at the Midwest Athletic Club, at Madison Street and Hamlin Avenue, Mr. Andre Skalski will give a one-hour piano recital. In return for the hospitality extended by the Athletic Club the members of the latter will be invited to attend this program, which will be held on Sunday afternoon, September 30, 1928.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andre Skalski will also deliver the first lecture of the season before the Polish Arts Club at the Art Institute, Sunday afternoon, October 14, 1928, and will conduct an orchestral concert on Wednesday evening, November 21, 1928. Full details will be given later.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0521.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second annual art exhibition under the sole auspices of the Polish Arts Club will be held from November 25, 1928, to December 9, 1928, inclusive. Miss Jane Palczynski is acting as secretary of the exhibition committee, and all inquiries should be addressed to her home at 2526 North Kedzie Boulevard. The plan this year is to invite Polish artists from other cities to take part in this exhibition.</p>
   <p>The annual box party at the Chicago Civic Opera will be held on Friday evening, November 9, 1928, and all arrangements will be in charge of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Prebis. It is hoped that the new Polish opera star, Marie Olszewski, will appear on that evening.</p>
   <p>All inquiries concerning membership in the club should be sent to Dr. M. J. Kostrzewski, 1152 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
