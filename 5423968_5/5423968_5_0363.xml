   <p>The first day of the New Year was started in grand style at the Illinois College of Music and Dramatic Art, which is under the direction of Marion S. Rozycki. A special entertainment program apropos the holiday season was given. A capacity crowd attended the festivities despite the severity of the weather. Parents, children, followers, and teachers filled the hall at Wicker Park, on Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>The musical program was opened by the young string orchestra, under the direction of Mrs. Wanda Simbor-Manke, which played Schubert's "March Militaire." The second number on the program was the presentation of the scenic epilogue "A Scouts Trip to Fairyland." The students of the school, both boys and girls, took part in the play. The stage and musical direction was handled by Miss Leokadja Ziemba. She not only showed that she was an <pb facs="5423968_5_0364.jpg" n="2"/>able director of the orchestra but also a talented stage director. The amateurs gave their best. The orchestra gave a splendid rendition of their numbers throughout the play. Their harmonious tunes added color to the songs of the singers on the stage. A great hand was given to both at the conclusion of the play. A silver cup was presented to Miss Ziemba by the college. Incidentally, this was her first [or debut] appearance as a music director.</p>
   <p>During the course of the play Miss Ziemba recited Barclay's beautiful verse "The Wheels of Time." A monologue was executed in professional style by Miss L. Rozycka. The title was "The Cullud Lady on the Phone." It was given in humorous and rapturous style. Another monologue was presented by Miss A. Rozycka, it was "The Youngest in the Family." All received generous applause.</p>
   <p>"Around the Christmas Tree" by Tobani was the next musical number to be played by the orchestra, under the baton of Miss Ziemba.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0365.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The final number on the program was a dramatic sketch, "The Neighbors," which was also given by the students.</p>
   <p>After the program Mrs. E. Jensen was honored with a silver cup for her work. Mrs. Jensen was the piano accompanist throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>At the very close, Mr. Rozycki, the director of the school, came out on the stage and thanked the entire audience for their support and cooperation in making the New Year's program a success. He announced that the school has initiated something new in its annals. Hereafter, every Saturday afternoon, beginning at four P.M. parents are free to bring their children to attend special programs at 2021 North Western Avenue. A variety program will be presented each week without cost. He then told the people that a polonaise about the Christmas tree will be given in honor of the children attending the school, and later, for the parents and guests. Santa Claus will present a gift to all, he concluded.</p>
   <p>Gifts were also given to the contestants who competed in the voice contest.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0366.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>First prize went to Miss Bellinger, who received a diamond ring. Miss Florence Gantz, the runner up, was also given a diamond ring. Others received expensive bracelets, electric lamps, etc.</p>
   <p>The affair as a whole was packed to the brim with entertainment. All enjoyed a memorable evening. At the end of the program most of the younger people stayed to take part in the dance, which climaxed the festivities of the evening. Music was furnished by M. S. Rozycki, son of the director of the Illinois College of Music and Dramatic Art, and his Illinois Collegians.</p>
   <p>Thanks must be extended to Mr. Rozycki, his wife Helen, the school faculty, and the entertainment committee, including Miss Ziemba, for planning and producing such a splendid program for the public.</p>
