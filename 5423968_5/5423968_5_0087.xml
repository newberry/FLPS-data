<title level="a">POLISH BUSINESSMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND THEIR BY-LAWS</title></bibl>

   <p>On November 13th a general meeting of the Polish Businessmen's Association, attended by over one hundred representatives of local business firms, was held to reconsider and to adopt the by-laws of the association.</p>
   <p>At the request of Mr. Alexander Busch, chairman of the meeting, that the aims and purposes of the Polish Businessmen's Association be explained and elucidated more extensively, Mr. Jozef Mierzynski, author and publisher of numerous articles on trade and manufactures, spoke as follows on the fundamental principles of the association:</p>
   <p>"The aim and purpose of the Polish Businessmen's Association is to help its members make larger profits in their businesses while serving their customers better. It would be a bad policy on the part of any member of this association, that his first and predominant tendency be that of drawing the most out of his customers, without giving them proportionate values in the form of goods and services, because a merchant following such a policy would not only lose the <pb facs="5423968_5_0088.jpg" n="2"/>support of the community but would also face the deserved condemnation of the public, all against the true spirit of the Polish Businessmen's Association.</p>
   <p>"The members of this association," the speaker said, "will make well deserved larger profits not by charging excessive prices on their goods but rather by selling goods of higher quality at lower prices. This business feature can be attained and accomplished only with the help and assistance of this association, for the reason that by being organized into a powerful and resourceful group, we can buy high quality merchandise in great quantities and, therefore, at the lowest prices, being thus able to sell them cheaper but in larger quantities, thereby making larger profits while keeping our customers satisfied."</p>
   <p>In his final remarks Mr. Mierzynski pointed out the value and usefulness of advertising in newspapers, of trading stamps, and of the premium system for the customers, who thereby share in the profits of the merchant.</p>
   <p>Then there followed the reading of an outline of the by-laws of the Polish Businessmen's Association by Mr. Orlowski, secretary of the association, and <pb facs="5423968_5_0089.jpg" n="3"/>the approval of said by-laws, with the provision that in the course of time the present by-laws of the Polish Businessmen's Association are to be revised with some additional regulations.</p>
