<title level="a">REPRESENTATIVES OF SOCIETIES IN ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH HOLD MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In accordance with an announcement previously made, a meeting of representatives of societies from St. Stanislaus Kostka parish was held yesterday at one of the school halls. Twenty-seven societies, all of which will participate in the Polish Day festivities, were represented. The Reverend Vincent Barzynski presided over the meeting and B. Klarkowski acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>Since the treasurer of the Central Committee [M. A. La Buy] was present, the following societies paid their fifteen-cent-per-member assessment:</p>
   <p>King Jagello Society (39 members), $5.85; St. Stephen's Society (66 members), $9.90; St. Hyacinth's Society (55 members), $8.25; St. Joseph's Society II (100 members), $15.00; St. Martin's Society (25 members), $3.75; and St. John Baptist Society (200 members), $30.00.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1478.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>W. Jedrzejek was elected parish treasurer. His duty will be to receive funds which will be used to pay for parade music. A music committee was also appointed, consisting of J. Tomaszewski, F. Fuhl, J. Gniot, J. Czekala, and A. Nowicki. St. Hyacinth's Society made its contribution of $5.50 to the music fund immediately.</p>
   <p>It was decided that societies will march in the parade in order of seniority; societies whose members will wear Konfederatki [plural of Konfederatka, a four-cornered cap] will form a separate division.</p>
   <p>Further discussion was postponed until Friday, September 22, when another meeting will be held. By this time, all money will have been paid in, and the number of persons to march in the parade will be definitely known.</p>
