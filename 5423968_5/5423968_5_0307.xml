   <p>The unreasonable panic gripping large and small capitalists in this country has communicated itself to the shareholders of building and loan associations. It is felt in Polish associations of this kind also; never before has the withdrawal of money been so general as at the present time. Naturally, those who profit the most are the shareholders who do not succumb to the general fear and do not withdraw their money; for the interest lost by withdrawing shareholders is divided up among those who remain.</p>
   <p>Some people justify their actions with the claim that they are unemployed, and, needing money, have no other course. This is a very unreasonable way of thinking. It would be far more profitable for them to use their shares as security for a loan at the very association in which their money is invested.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0308.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Let us have hopes that now, when confidence is slowly returning and money is again circulating more freely, this panic among the shareholders of building and loan associations will also end.</p>
