   <p>The undersigned has the privilege of announcing to all lovers of music that a large group of young ladies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish has organized a Polish Singers' Society for the purpose of teaching and fostering Polish national songs.</p>
   <p>On January 13, a meeting was held at the home of the Sypniewski family, 630 Holt Street, and the Polish Singers' Society was founded. Eighteen young ladies joined the organization. Shortly afterward, the new members held an election and the following officers were elected: Miss Leonarda Sypniewska, president; Miss Helen Wytyk, vice president; Miss Anna Dembkowska, recording secretary; Miss Sophia Wytyk, financial secretary; Miss Anna Lisztewnik, treasurer; and Miss Stanislawa Kucharzewska, librarian.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0793.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first singing practice will be held on February 3, at the Polish National Alliance Hall, at 8 P.M. Professor R. Hensel, well-known music instructor, will direct the singing.</p>
   <p>All young ladies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish who wish to join the society are invited to attend the first singing class.</p>
   <p>Mention should also be made that this group is to join the Polish Singers' Alliance and will co-operate with all singing societies in fostering songs of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>Hope is expressed that all young ladies who wish to follow in the footsteps of their grandparents will join this organization. In this way the Polish spirit will be awakened and the purpose of this club will be realized.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Miss Anna Dembkowska, recording secretary,</p>
   <p>673 Dickson Street.</p>
