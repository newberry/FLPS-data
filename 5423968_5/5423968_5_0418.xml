<title level="a">POLISH ARTIST BIDS CHICAGO FAREWELL IN SPECIAL CONCERT</title><title level="a" type="sub">[Half-tone, one column-eighth of a page, bust of Mrs. J. Korolewicz-Waydowa]</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>At a special farewell concert given by her friends last night at the Polish hospital auditorium, Mrs. J. Korolewicz-Waydowa bade the Polish people of Chicago goodbye.</p>
   <p>The committee which arranged the program deserves to be commended for their efforts. It was through their energetic work that this concert was not only made possible, but also a grand success. Although a severe cold, which was contracted by the Polish singer at a recent benefit, threatened to keep Mrs. Korolewicz-Waydowa in bed for an indefinite period, she managed to recover sufficiently enough to make her final appearance. Because of the importance of the event and the sentiment attached to her happy days in <pb facs="5423968_5_0419.jpg" n="2"/>Chicago, the Polish songbird was at her best. Then, too, the large crowd added inspiration to her voice. She sang her best as one Pole to another.</p>
   <p>For her first portion of the concert, she sang an aria from Verdi's "Aida" in Italian; a number from Massenet's opera, "Cyd" in French; an air from Puccini's opera, "Manon Lescaut," in Italian; and a selection from Puccini's opera, "Madam Butterfly" in Polish. After her operatic numbers, she sang several Polish numbers. Songs from the pen of Paderewski, Mosjkowski, Niewiadomski, Maniuszki, and Walter which were excellently rendered.</p>
   <p>The entire concert was indeed a musical review of operatic and classical numbers. If she never before displayed her artistic talents in full, Mrs. J. Korolewicz-Waydowa did so last night. The variety of her well prepared repertoire taxed her every ability, however, her brilliant command of her voice conquered all the difficulties and enraptured the entire assemblage. Never before was such talent displayed on a Polish podium.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0420.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Her display of talent at the Polish hospital auditorium was direct evidence of the artistic qualities of her voice, which has been heard in the four corners of the world. Although specializing in another part of the theater, it can be readily admitted that she has gained the same recognition as our immortal Modziejewska, who has gained international fame.</p>
   <p>We have written before about the quality of Mrs. Korolewicz-Waydowa's voice. It would be difficult now for us to write something new. If we were to take all the comments expressed by the critics the world over about her voice in the press, many volumes would be printed. All we wish to say is that we had a wonderful opportunity last night to see her display her talent. Her mighty fortissimo and her miraculous pianissimo could belong to some nocturnal bird which sang in a dream. Her unusual dramatical expressions, her subtle interpretations, and her clear diction made every word, feeling, and movement comprehensible during her musical renditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0421.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This was especially true when she sang the arias from the opera "Cyd," and "Madam Butterfly," and in the Polish numbers, "Dudziarzu" (Bagpipe Player), and "Przadce."</p>
   <p>Her beautiful singing captivated every person present. The applause was long and loud. Shouts of "encore," "encore," were heard throughout the applause. At the conclusion of her singing, she was presented with many bouquets of fresh flowers, and a fitting speech of farewell was given by Miss J. Wachtlow. One of the local editors gave a short speech, pointing out the many invaluable services Janina Korolewicz-Waydowa has rendered the Polish people in Chicago. Her appearance in Chicago was donated to a national cause--Upper Silesia.</p>
   <p>This Polish artist has long been noted for her charitable work in her native country during and after the World War. At times, it seemed as if she worked more for Poland than for herself. It was because of her patriotic feeling that she consented to appear in Chicago in connection with the committee from Upper Silesia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0422.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The concert terminated at 10 P. M. However, many people tarried to bid this generous artist adieu. It was long after 10 o'clock when she finally shook the last hand smilingly, and left the auditorium.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Korolewicz-Waydowa will leave Chicago shortly on an extended western concert tour. After her appearance in the West, she will appear in an important concert at New York City. She does not expect to return to Chicago after her American tour is over.</p>
   <p>Although her decision to leave Chicago came unawares, a group of interested Polish women managed to prepare last night's concert. Those deserving credit are: Mrs. P. Dyniewicz, Mrs. Paczynska, and Mrs. Smietanka, who played the piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>Among those present were: Captain Grzesikhauke, Miss Sullivan, noted pedagogical worker, Dr. G. Mueller and wife, W. Kochanski, well-known violin <pb facs="5423968_5_0423.jpg" n="6"/>virtuoso, and wife, Attorney Smietanka and wife, L. Dyniewicz and family, and many prominent Polish doctors, dentists, lawyers, and businessmen.</p>
   <p>The concert, as a whole, was a success. A capacity audience filled the beautiful auditorium of the Polish hospital.</p>
