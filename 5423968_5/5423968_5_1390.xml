   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the Central Committee [in charge of arrangements for Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition of 1894] was presided over by one of its vice-presidents, Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>After the minutes of the previous meeting had been read, the secretary presented two letters, one from Erasmus Jersmanowski of New York, and the other from the New York [Lwow Exposition] committee. The letter from Mr. Jerzmanowski was received with genuine enthusiasm. Our estimable countryman informs us that he has sent a chock for five hundred dollars to Peter Kiolbassa as his contribution to the fund for Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition. This donation is All the more deserving of acknowledgment, as Mr. Jerzmanowski has already sent, 5,000 guldens [about $200] to know to help <pb facs="5423968_5_1391.jpg" n="2"/>cover the general exposition expenses. In his letter, he expresses his satisfaction that the Poles living in America are conscious of their relationship with their motherland and will show this by participation in the Exposition. The Central Committee decided to thank Mr. Jerzmanowski publicly for his generous offer. His donation has moved the matter of Polish-America participation is the Lwow Exposition considerably forward. Erection of a Polish-American pavilion is how a certainty.</p>
   <p>The second letter, from Adam Bautro, secretary of the New York Committee, gave a report on the Committee's activities to date and requested further information, which the secretary of the Central Committee was accordingly instructed to forward.</p>
   <p>Erection of the pavilion was next in the order of business. T. Lewandowski, a Polish architect who was present at the meeting, presented a sketch which appealed to everyone. It was accepted unanimously and Lewandowski was <pb facs="5423968_5_1392.jpg" n="3"/>instructed to prepare complete plans in the shortest possible time. The architect promised to have them ready for Sunday at cost price. The Central Committee decided to entrust the entire matter of erection of the pavilion in Lwow to Doctor Dunikowski, the professor of polytechnics, Charles Skibinski, and the sculpter Thaodeus Baracz [all of Lwow]. The pavilion will be built according to Architect Lewanuowski's plans, which will be sent to Lwow in the course of the next few days. It will be of wood construction, is the style of an American villa. A reproduction of the projected building will appear in a later issue.</p>
   <p>As next in the order of business, Adam Szwajkart presented a project of a Polish women's exhibit; it was accepted;....it was decided not to create a women's committee, but only to call upon the Polish women for examples of their work.</p>
   <p>The Reverend [Casimir] Sztuczko was asked to accept membership in the Central <pb facs="5423968_5_1393.jpg" n="4"/>Committee.</p>
   <p>A committee consisting of the Reverends V. Barzynski, [A.] Nowicki, and C. Sztuczko was appointed to engage a photographer to photograph the churches and to determine the size of the pictures. Peter Kiolbassa was added to the committee in charge of shipment of exhibits......</p>
   <p>The Central Committee also decided that it would try to obtain reduced rates for individuals who desire to visit the Lwow Exposition.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held on Sunday, November 12, at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
