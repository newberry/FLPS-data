<title level="a">"MACKO BORKOWIC" STAGED AT POLISH HALL</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Dramatical Circle of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish presented with enexpected success W. Rapacki's "Macko Borkowic" [historic personnage of Poland during the 14th century who, although very patriotic, considered himself equal to the king and was executed] on the stage of the Polish Hall yesterday. The play, difficult to say the least, was enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>Thanks for the success must go to the capable director Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, whose untiring efforts made each role ring true to form. Some of the scenes were performed in true professional style.</p>
   <p>The audience especially enjoyed the performances of Vincent Jozwiakowsky, who played Macko Borkowic; Joseph Grabowiecki, who portrayed King Casimir; Roman Szajkowski, who characterized Father Gwillo; and Jacob Oszwaldowski, who took the part of the son of Borkowic.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1012.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The lesser roles were well done by the following: J. Nering, J. Ogurka, J. Kikulski, M. Siudzinski and W. Wieckowski.</p>
   <p>Miss R. Kwasigroch and Miss S. Grabowiecka played their parts admirably.</p>
   <p>The audience gave a great hand to all the players at the close of the play. A capacity audience enjoyed the performance.</p>
