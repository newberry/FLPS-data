   <p>Dear Brethren:</p>
   <p>The ninth convention of the United Polish Singers in America will take place September 3, 4 and 5 in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are inviting to this convention all the choirs of the United Polish Singers in America. Ladies singing societies in the United States, and organizations, are asked to send representatives. We invite all Polish citizens who are lovers of Polish music and songs and who are anxious to spread among the Poles their native songs. Everyone will admit that the Polish national songs are the most important factors with which to awaken the heart and soul of our fellow-countrymen to their country's need. Songs are proof of our love for our past and present attitude towards our country. We sing in the hours of sadness and in the hour of happiness. We Poles always sing, whether at work or at home, because singing is a balm for every Pole.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0752.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And also to give a circumstancial account of our work to our youngsters and the future generation that they may love and cherish the work of our forefathers.</p>
   <p>Our heart and soul, our true feeling, were put into these songs and we must awaken the younger generation to teach their children the love and knowledge of these words and melodies.</p>
   <p>Every heart thrills to hear Polish songs and music. To the older people they awaken and bring back memoirs of their youth.</p>
   <p>The work to preserve and cultivate our national songs is ideal and requires the true support of our fellow-countrymen, for those who are most interested in bringing this dream to reality, deserve an unlimited amount of thanks for their efforts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0753.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>That is why we are inviting all citizens, brothers and sisters and all well wishers to be present to take part in this ninth convention of the United Polish Singers in America, to help in our work of extending among Poles our national songs.</p>
   <p>C. Duzewski, president</p>
   <p>A. Rosinskit, secretary</p>
