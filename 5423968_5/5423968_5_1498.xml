<title level="a">POLISH DAY MASS MEETING HELD IN ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Polish Day movement gains momentum with each passing day. The mass meeting held on Sunday, September 3, at the St. Stanislaus Kostka school hall is proof of this. Although most of the parishioners were tired after having attended the cornerstone laying ceremonies [at St. John Cantius Church (see Dziennik Chicagoski, September 5, 1893)], they gathered in considerable numbers for the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who explained in a few words the need for and the purpose of Polish Day. F. Zagrzebski was called upon to preside over the meeting; B. Klarkowski was named secretary.</p>
   <p>The first speaker of the evening was Judge [M. A.] La Buy. He said that Polish Day must be held, that it is impossible to back out now. Over a hundred societies have already pledged participation in the celebration; <pb facs="5423968_5_1499.jpg" n="2"/>very likely, societies from towns and cities in the vicinity of Chicago, that is, from Milwaukee, Michigan City, Joliet, LaSalle, Otis, Lemont, etc., will also be present. In a word, the celebration will be a magnificent one. Individual members of societies have very little to do; the small sum of fifteen cents is required from each to help cover the costs of the celebration, and besides this, the participants will contribute not more than ten cents per parson to pay for the band music during the parade. The pianist Katski, famous all over the United States, will be invited (and will doubtless accept the invitation) to play at the celebration in Festival Hall. All that is necessary is harmony and brotherhood--and a few small sacrifices.</p>
   <p>The address so moved Mr. Gabrylewicz, a delegate from Nantieoke to the Polish National Alliance convention, that he immediately contributed twenty dollars to the cause. This act was vigorously applauded.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Peter Kiolbassa. He explained that since every other nation <pb facs="5423968_5_1500.jpg" n="3"/>had observed its "day" at the World's Fair, it is absolutely essential that the Poles do likewise. All American newspapers--even papers in Poland--will write of this celebration. In the present troublous times, it will be a manifestation that we are a peaceable, dignified people, that we have nothing in common with those who take part in anarchistic demonstrations. Other nations, in observing their "days", were helped financially by their governments; that we must depend entirely upon our own resources will but make it the more praiseworthy if we succeed. Our celebration will be a beautiful and solemn one; all of our friends and enemies alike will see that we exist. Mr. Kiolbassa concluded his address with a twenty-dollar donation to the Polish Day fund.</p>
   <p>Henry Nagiel, the next speaker, explained the manner in which Polish Day will be celebrated, and read a list of the persons who had already contributed to the fund in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish collected by the committee named at the businessmen's meeting. In addition to the $175 collected at that meeting <pb facs="5423968_5_1501.jpg" n="4"/>and the $40 collected by F. Fuhl on the following day, S. Piasecki and T. Gordon received donations totaling $75.35.</p>
   <p>Donations amounting to $36 were made at F. Wleklinski's bakery.</p>
   <p>Thus, in the course of the last two days, $151.35 has been collected.</p>
   <p>Father Barzynski spoke again, suggesting that another meeting be called for next Sunday; in the meantime, he urged that members of societies pay their fifteen-cent assessment so that this money can be placed in the hands of the Central Committee by next week. He asked the officers of participating societies to give special attention to this matter.</p>
   <p>A. W. Rudnicki spoke next, emphasizing the fact that there has been no opposition to Polish Day plans. He said that the time is short, but if we work together <pb facs="5423968_5_1502.jpg" n="5"/>in harmony, we can perform miracles. We will show the tyrants of the world that the Poles have not been destroyed. An occasion for such a demonstration occurs only once in a great while; it should be taken advantage of.</p>
   <p>S. Szwajkart spoke of the leadership of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish in Polish affairs during his nine-year residence here. He expressed his belief that it would again lead all other communities.</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Midowicz spoke next. "Polish Day," he said, "is now as certain as the fact that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. How numerous the children of poor Poland are here! These children must show that they are peaceful citizens of the United States, grateful to this land of liberty for its hospitality, but they must prove also that they exist as Poles.</p>
   <p>"'There are no Poles!' say the conquerors in Europe. They are wrong! There <pb facs="5423968_5_1503.jpg" n="6"/>are Poles in Poland and in America. Polish Day will prove this to the world."</p>
   <p>Dr. Midowicz' address was followed by a few words from A. Lisztewnik. He said that nothing comparable to the Polish Day celebration had yet been staged. The necessary money must be raised not so much for the money itself but as a demonstration of noble effort. Penny by penny....great work will be realized.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting adjourned, Father Barzynski made a motion that the next meeting be held on Sunday, September 10, at four o'clock in the afternoon in the same hall. His motion was carried unanimously. Father Barzynski then touched upon a very important matter. He called the attention of the Central Committee to the fact that the celebration at Festival Hall would be an appropriate occasion for the Poles to raise a vigorous protest against the linking of Polonia with the current street riots by a few half-wits, who are supported by anarchists and enemies of ours, emissaries, perhaps, of the conquerors of Poland. The idea was thunderously applauded.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1504.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Dr. Kossakowski donated fifteen dollars; this raised the Polish Day fund total in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish to $381.35; the meeting was adjourned immediately afterwards.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that after this mass meeting, the members of St. Stanislaus parish societies will make haste to make their fifteen-cent payments, which are so necessary to cover the costs of Polish Day.</p>
   <p>Julian Stasiewski resigned his place on the businessmen's collection committee as a result of the press of other business. Upon resigning, he placed twenty-five dollars into the hands of Wleklinski as his personal contribution to the fund.</p>
   <p>Since the meeting's adjournment, S. Piasecki has already collected nineteen dollars. Just before going to press, we received lists of contributions collected by F. Gordon, W. Grabowski, J. Suwalski, and J. Chropkowski. These contributions total fifty-seven dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1505.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>The total sum thus far contributed to the Polish Day fund in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish is $482.35.</p>
