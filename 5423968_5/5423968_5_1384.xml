<title level="a">APPEAL TO THE POLISH CLERGY AND SCHOOL TEACHERS IN REFERENCE TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE LWOW EXPOSITION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We have received for publication in Dziennik [Chicagoski] the following appeal from S. Zahajkiewicz, who is preparing a treatise on the Polish schools in America for the school exhibit in the Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition:</p>
   <p>"I need not expand in this appeal upon the Exposition itself--its aim or its task-- for those to whom I address my words are already well acquainted with it.</p>
   <p>"In one and only one occupied portion of Poland-- the Austrian--can Poles use their native language and live as Poles, working for themselves and their motherland; they are allowed to say they are Poles, and now they will be able to show that they are, in deed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1385.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Our most inveterate enemy cries; 'There is no Poland!' We answer: 'There are Poles, and Poland lives!' But mere words do not constitute proof --we must show by deeds that Poland lives, even there where Poles do not trod on Polish soil [that is, Poland exists wherever Poles live]. But I will forego further discussion along these lines and come immediately to the subject at hand.</p>
   <p>"From the newspapers, speeches, private letters, and reports of various committees, we know that the Poles who live here in America desire to show by deed that a relationship exists between them and their homeland, that they desire to participate in the Lwow Exposition. We all want to prove that we are the unspoiled grandchildren of the great Thaddeus Kosciusko, who left wealth and honors here in America to hasten to the defense of his native land at the first notes of its call to arms. I do not want to exaggerate, and I have no intention of expanding on the far-reaching importance of the Lwow Exposition; but it is a fact that, as the participation of Poles in the World's Columbian Exposition convinced all other nations that Poland and the Poles <pb facs="5423968_5_1386.jpg" n="3"/>exist, so will Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition convince our brethren who visit the Exposition in Poland that the Polish spirit still lives within us on this side of the ocean, that we carry high our national banner, that we have retained our [Catholic] faith, and that we are endeavoring to prevent denationalization of our children. To this, our Polish parochial schools will testify most conclusively.</p>
   <p>"I have no doubt that our clergy, who have always led us in every worthy enterprise, will earnestly support this one. They are the chief overseers of the Polish schools, and for this reason the extent to which our schools will be represented at the Lwow Exposition depends upon them. To the Polish priests, then, and further to the nuns and lay teachers, I address this appeal that they provide material for a school exhibit at the Lwow Exposition.</p>
   <p>"Since I have been entrusted with the task of compiling data for such an exhibit, I have taken the liberty of preparing the following short outline <pb facs="5423968_5_1387.jpg" n="4"/>of the information I would like each school to supply.</p>
   <p>1. History of the school.</p>
   <p>a. When and by whom established.</p>
   <p>b. Local conditions, showing difficulties encountered by teachers, school board, and children.</p>
   <p>c. Number of teachers, classes, and children.</p>
   <p>2. Photographs.</p>
   <p>a. Schools.</p>
   <p>b. Teachers and pupils.</p>
   <p>3. Educational system under which the school operates.</p>
   <p>4. Written work.</p>
   <p>a. Polish.</p>
   <p>b. English.</p>
   <p>c. Other languages, if any.</p>
   <p>d. Arithmetic.</p>
   <p>e. Polish History.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1388.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>f. Calligraphy.</p>
   <p>g. Drawing.</p>
   <p>5. Textbooks used in the school.</p>
   <p>6. School children's handiwork.</p>
   <p>"All examples of written work should be done on one or at most two sheets of paper, and in such a way that they can later be bound together in one volume. Examples from each class in each subject should be contained in a separate volume. The parish in which each school exists will attend to the binding of the specimens from that school.</p>
   <p>"The Central Committee will merely take charge of the sorting, packing, and shipment of exhibits to Europe.</p>
   <p>"I again call the attention of all those interested to the fact that all exhibits must be placed in the Central Committee's hands by January 15, 1894, at the very latest.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1389.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"I will be glad to furnish additional information in this matter. All communications concerning the school exhibit should be addressed to me.</p>
   <p>S. Zahajkiewicz,</p>
   <p>45 Sloan Street, Chicgo, Illinois."</p>
