   <p>One of the greatest hindrances to the development of every organization is, undoubtedly, the well-known constant discontent of certain members. These disputing groups are dissatisfied with everything and everyone. Discontent of that type is found everywhere, regardless of the nature of the organization. One can always find individuals who have the false impression that the apex of their sacrifice for an ideal should be finding faults in others. People of that caliber are usually ignored completely until their constant crumbling becomes the cause of unnecessary troubles and difficulties. It would seem that on organization such as the Alliance of Polish Singers, in which there is not even the slightest trace of any "profits," "prospects," or "material gain" for anyone, would be immune from this dissension. Unfortunately, one can find individuals even in it, who, because they have nothing better to do or because they fail to restrain their desire to create <pb facs="5423968_5_0711.jpg" n="2"/>a commotion and attract attention to themselves, sacrifice a great deal of time to this stereotyped method of finding faults. They perform their disrupting work under the guise of working for an ideal. The time has not yet come to call this group of our members to order. Thus far, their "work" has been nothing but silly, childish pranks. If space is allotted this matter in today's edition, it is solely because we sincerely wish to have our colleagues know that, in spite of everything, we are willing to listen to all their complaints for the sake of satisfying them.</p>
   <p>The Alliance of Polish Singers has passed through trying times. It has passed the crises and is now on the way to recovery, to a reorganization. It is no more than right, therefore, that each member who is sincerely interested in the welfare of the organization express clearly what he considers best for the organization. Let him point out any faults or errors and, at the same time, suggest ways and means of correcting and avoiding them in the future. When everyone has expressed himself sincerely and directly it will be easy to prevent any evil from creeping in, and a <pb facs="5423968_5_0712.jpg" n="3"/>method can be found to force a given matter upon the right road. But if instead of conducting ourselves sanely, there is private disruptive grumbling, if instead of openly bringing faults to the fore, we secretely ridicule these short comings, then all our work will go for naught. If any member is dissatisfied for any reason with the present manner of conducting the business of the Alliance, he should openly and without ridicule call the attention of the administration to this. If the administration fails to justify itself, then the matter can be presented before the organization to discover what the members think of it. After all, it must be remembered that the central administration is not the Alliance of Polish Singers, it is merely an instrument that fulfills the will of the majority of the members of the organization. And so, regardless of whether a certain decision of the majority of members is in favor of the administration or opposed to it, the administration must conform to the will of the majority and pass upon a given matter in the way the majority wishes. If, therefore, any of us notices any faults or mistakes then let him present them openly for consideration of the members of our organization. If, on the other hand, he lacks the courage to do this, then let him not waste time unnecessarily in useless <pb facs="5423968_5_0713.jpg" n="4"/>private grumbling.</p>
   <p>Our other great fault lies in the fact that, regardless of who is chosen to participate in the central administration, a certain handful of members of the Polish Singers Alliance is always dissatisfied. They make every effort to make the work of that administration more difficult. Is that the proper way to act? Definitely not! Accidents would never have happened if these colleagues had only stopped to think that, after all, people who join the central administration of the Polish Singers Alliance, without exception, have taken the burden upon their shoulders for no personal gain whatsoever. It is a known fact that the Alliance of Polish Singers is not firm enough financially to shower its officials with money. These people work with very slight renumeration, the amount being so small that it is almost nil. Hence it cannot be expected of them to dedicate all their time for the cause of organization.</p>
   <p>Another point worthy of mention is the fact that, even if officials of the organization had the best intentions and aims, they are not accountants <pb facs="5423968_5_0714.jpg" n="5"/>or people well versed in banking matters and must perform their tasks as their conscience dictates for the welfare of the organization. It is natural to expect some errors to creep in, since the officers depend solely upon their judgment. If we consider that this central administration received various court summonses and debts and an empty treasury, as its dowry from the former administration, then there is little wonder that gigantic results have not been accomplished thus far. It must be remembered that "Rome was not built in a day." If these so-called dissatisfied members were to take these difficulties into consideration, and if, at the same time, they had the good of the organization in mind, it is certain that they would prefer to assist the administration rather than to undermine it. These dissenting individuals should pause to think, should uproot private differences from their hearts, and should stand in the ranks on an equal basis with others. Let them place themselves in the administration's position and exert every effort to assist the organization. If these grumbling groups have no desire to express their grievances openly, then they at least should have enough decency to cease their malicious attacks. Let them stand before <pb facs="5423968_5_0715.jpg" n="6"/>the organization squarely, state clearly what they consider bad or inadequate, and state openly where the administration failed to fulfill its duties. Then, by placing the cards upon the table (to use the vernacular), the whole game will be played honestly and it will certainly be to the complete satisfaction and gain of all concerned. At any rate, it will prove to be most beneficial to the Polish Singers Alliance, whose welfare all Poles have at heart.</p>
