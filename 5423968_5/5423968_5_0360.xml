   <p>As yet the deep feeling of appreciation did not wear off for those who were present at the new musical production. The enchanting tones penetrated the hearts and souls of everyone, held a reverent silence, while the flicker of the candles in their old-fashioned candelabrums faded in awe of the bewitching musical strains. As the enchanting strains flowed through this auditorium filled with spellbound listeners, the audience was filled with wonderment at life and its many passing trials. Truly, nothing adds to life, nor soothes more readily the pains of existence, the desire of the spirit, or the call to love, than do the charms of tones from the magic hands of an artist on his instrument. During the concert the audience discovered the arranger of these captivating compositions at his beloved instrument, the piano, where he played throughout the concert; leaving the air filled with his deft technique, which is equal to that of artists who have already reached their height of fame.</p>
   <p>Among the Polish artists who performed at this concert were: Michael Wilkomirski and George Spinalski. These concerts, or musical gatherings are conducted by Andrew Skalski at the "Romany Club." 36 Bellevue Place to a select group of persons.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0361.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At these concerts gather only the artistic elite, who are especially invited by the organizers. This is not a financial enterprise; but is given for the benefit of only those who love and appreciate the immortal classics. Under the direction of Mr. Skalski, the difficult as well as the more popular classics are played. Many of the selections played at these concerts are seldom heard in the large concert halls, because of their difficulty and the lack of understanding among the general public of such artistic works. Mr. Skalski is the central figure of these festivities and is regarded somewhat as a saint covered with garlands, who, with his successful talents, lifts the name of Poland into prominence in Great Britain and America. Mr. Skalski has also conducted an opera in London.</p>
   <p>Skalski's musical career has taken him over many strange roads of which interesting tours he often speaks. At present he is the head of the Sherwood Musical School in Chicago. Here he virtually lifted the Polish spirit toward the goal of appreciation of the finer things of Poland to such a degree that we now can express ourselves, in our own way, with the great dreamers and creators on this earth in appreciation of such efforts. The Sherwood Musical School is reputed to-be one of the best musical institutions in the country. We arepleased to say that Mr. Skalski, <pb facs="5423968_5_0362.jpg" n="3"/>who is a learned individual, never fails to stir the Polish atmosphere among his associates where and whenever an opportunity presents itself, using his native tongue whenever possible. It is a known fact that, as an artist; namely, as a musical director, he will leave behind him the immortal record of the Polish character and fame.</p>
   <p>In the history of the "Sherwood Musical School" there will be a vivid page given to a Polish name on which will brilliantly shine the letters describing the greatness and love of the most sublime music: Andrew Skalski.</p>
