   <p>The two concerts given yesterday, one by Mrs. Agnes <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ering and the other by the Chopin Choir are the best indication that the Poles of Chicago have no reason to complain of a lack of excellent artistic talent among their numbers. Our artists can compete in every respect with the stars of other nationalities. We have no cause to complain.</p>
   <p>There is not the slightest doubt that Mrs. Agnes <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ering's concert and the Chopin Choir concert were successes in the full sense of the word. The audience at both concerts left the halls well satisfied with the execution of the programs.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about each of the concerts.</p>
   <p>At Mrs. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ering's concert Mrs. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ering starred supported by Mrs. Dombek and <pb facs="5423968_5_0674.jpg" n="2"/>Miss B. Dyniewicz. "The <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of Song" and the <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Polish compositions, were excellently read by <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. The recited with so much feeling and so well <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> soul that the stood out decidedly from the number of others who took part in the concert. Excellent direction, skillful emphasis on specific phrases, <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the unusually successful shading of the three phases in <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> place Miss E. Dyniewicz among first rate elocutionists. The second-best number on the program from the stand point of performance was <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> from <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Butterfly," beautifully sung by Mrs. Agnes <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>"La Serenata," "Elegie," "Amore," <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> song from the "Countess," <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and Butterfly," and the encore, "A Girl Lived in the Village," sung by Mrs. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, received deserved recognition, <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> also did the "<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>" and "Evening Is High," sung by <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and Bombek and Messrs. Kowalski and <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. Their rendition left nothing to be <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0675.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>One of the very successful parts of the program was <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> "Legend" and "Mazurek" (solo) played by Constance Arenz, a violinist who is well known to the Poles of Chicago. The piano solo by Miss Cecelia <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>allek, "Polonaise, Opus <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>," also deserves honorable mention.</p>
   <p>A decorative note was added to the program by Polish, Scotch, and Spanish national dances.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about the accompaniment. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> played the accompaniments as only a pianist of Miss <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> could be expected to play them. The success of last night's concert should, no doubt, be ascribed in a large measure to her skillful accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The Chopin Choir Concert</p>
   <p>The most important groups participating in yesterday's concert were Chopin <pb facs="5423968_5_0676.jpg" n="4"/>Choir No. 1 of the Alliance of Polish Singers, the ladies' choir <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, the Filaret Choir, and Miss <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Symbor, violinist, <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> all of the other people taking <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in the concert aid their number well.</p>
   <p>The concert was a great success in every respect. Mrs. Rose <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> sang very well the solos "My Flower" by Traswel and "Once I Saw" by Kratzer. Mr. L. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>who is seeking fame as a tenor, was surer of himself yesterday in the aria from <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> than at his own concert.</p>
   <p>The choir numbers also came out very well. The Chopin Choir opened the concert with "Jagiello's Frayer," and if this was a case of passing an examination over a year's work, we must <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> that the choir passed it successfully.</p>
   <p>Among the choirs the Filaret Choir under the baton of Professor Rybowiak and <pb facs="5423968_5_0677.jpg" n="5"/>the Morning Star, Halka, and <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> choirs gave the best performances. The Warsaw Choir's number was the weakest. However its encore number saved its reputation somewhat.</p>
   <p>Among the solo numbers one must mention Miss <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> beautiful piano playing and the solos of Miss W. Symbor, who accompanied by Miss <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> played "Souvenir de Bate" by Leonard and "<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>" by <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. These numbers won much applause.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert left very pleasant memories, largely owing to the fact that one saw almost all of the choirs and singing societies on the stage and the fact that all were competing with each other to display the greatest progress made during the year.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a very gay ball and the singers turned to dancing in spite of the gravity of these times.</p>
