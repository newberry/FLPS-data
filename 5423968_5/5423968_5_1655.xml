   <p>A fair at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish was opened to the parishioners and public Saturday evening, October 22, but the festivities did not begin until Sunday.</p>
   <p>The hall of the school building has been gaily dressed for the occasion. The booths containing the lottery wheels are filled with many beautiful prizes, especially with framed pictures of all varieties. One of the corners of the hall is occupied by all kinds of pieces of furniture, which are to be raffled during the course of the fair. Special attention is called to the parlor suite, for it is valued at one hundred and fifty dollars. Among the many pieces are also tables, chairs, sofas, desks, lamps, etc. Every article is attractive to the eye.</p>
   <p>In the gallery an orchestra played while the guests were milling about the <pb facs="5423968_5_1656.jpg" n="2"/>hall during the entire evening. Many young ladies sold lottery tickets to those present. Two bars have been set up at each end of the hall, and here one can quench his thirst.</p>
   <p>Those that were present were a happy lot. Many had occasion to renew old acquaintances. Many persons formed groups and talked about things old and new. It was interesting to watch this happy crowd.</p>
   <p>Last night offered an opportunity to see several of the leading parishioners of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, some of the old-timers of the parish, and many Polish businessmen. Without any doubt the attendance at this fair will increase with each passing day. In this way the parishioners will have performed their good deed.</p>
   <p>The fair is open every evening, with the exception of Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1657.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On Sunday it opens immediately after vespers.</p>
   <p>From all appearances the fair thus far has been a success. And no wonder, since the proceeds are to go toward the building of a tower for St. Stanislaus Kostka Church. Those who wish to support this noble cause are cordially invited to attend the fair.</p>
