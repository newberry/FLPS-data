<title level="a">JUDGEMENT DAY ON A POLISH STAGE</title></bibl>

   <p>Chicago Poles were enjoying themselves last Saturday and Sunday. There was entertainment of some kind, at every Polish settlement, and in every Polish Hall. One of the great attractions was Mr. Feldman's drama, "Judgment Day," which was staged by the Polish club Mloda Polska (Young Poland) at Walsh's Hall. The play was received with enthusiasm; for our public delights in recreations-even Jewish dramas. We could wish for nothing more "Judgment Day," is a drama of a solemn character yet-it supplies many humorous parts, because of its Jewish character. The drama is a presentation of a greedy, rich Jew in a small town, who ruined an old Jewish sage by depriving him of his whole fortune and then, in a Jewish synagogue, under oath denying that he took as much as a penny; but who, when the ruined sage died was very much annoyed by a guilty conscience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldman's intention was to convey solemnity on the stage by using Jewish characterizations; does he not know, that a Jew can also appear in the light of comedy, and impersonate a clown? Mr. Feldman, evidently did not expect his play to be staged in Chicago, therfore, we can sympathize with the actors, who, in spite of their talents and earnest efforts, could not present this drama with solemnity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0912.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The actors, however, played their parts unusually well, for which, credit should be given to Mr. Opalinski, who spared no efforts in training them. They were only amateurs, but they played their parts in a professional manner; each actor was given a suitable role.</p>
   <p>The scene depicting the synagogue was acted in perfect accord, exciting much laughter and a prolonged applause. No effort was spared to make this play a success. The scenery, the lighting, and the costumes were well arranged, and could not be improved upon. The last act, presenting a Jewish cemetary, was very impressive. The play was a great success, and was enjoyed by all.</p>
