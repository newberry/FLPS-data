   <p>Last Sunday, January 8, the Dramatic Circle presented a popular Polish play, "Dwie Sieroty" (Two Orphans), to a capacity audience at the parish hall.</p>
   <p>It was pleasant to note that there were no interruptions during the presentation, which was short and to the point, not a drawn out affair. The actors had been well chosen. Joseph Kamedulski, ably supported by John Miklasz, Anna Jakubowska, Sophia Malinowska, and Frances Chmielecka, was excellent in his interpretation of the crippled "Peter". Among others who distinguished themselves for their excellent acting were William Rentflejsz and Miss Angelica Markiewicz.</p>
   <p>During some parts of the play, the amateurs looked too often toward the director. It is sad to admit it, but some of our people spoil the presentation of our amateur plays by laughing at the wrong time--that is, whenever <pb facs="5423968_5_0847.jpg" n="2"/>a highly dramatical point of a play is reached. This is excusable among children, but in this case the older people are guilty. Such action spoils the effect the author, as well as the players, desires to give; it hurts not only a large part of the audience, which recognizes such efforts, but the amateurs as well. It is timely to recall that old saying: "An insane person can be told by his laughter."</p>
