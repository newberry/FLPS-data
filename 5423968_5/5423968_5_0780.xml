   <p>Sunday the united singing organizations Chopins and Wanda presented in the Walsh Hall, Kurpinskis operetta, consisting of three acts. We shall not read of this play to you, but only wish to note for your interest that this is one of the most original operettas known, that even in Poland it is very much enjoyed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Mallek deserves all the credit due him for his performance and directing the singing organizations. From among the amateurs, Mr. Gatkowski proved himself successful in making the people laugh with his humorous jokes. Solo parts were sung by Mr. Mroz who possesses an excellent voice, also Miss Wojatalenicz, who captivated the general public with her singing.</p>
   <p>After conclusion of all the stage production people danced and enjoyed themselves till 4 A. M.</p>
   <p>We almost forgot to mention that present at this great occasion was the famous 13-year-old violinist Bronislaw Haberman, with his parents. Ten people were all aware of this and honored him with clapping at his appearance.</p>
