   <p>We must admit, that the organizers of the Polish Symphony Orchestra, have accomplished a lot in the field of universalizing Polish music among the Poles. Yesterday's concert was not made up exclusively of works by Polish composers, but the overtures from the opera, "Halka" by St. Moniuszko and three compositions by Chopin were played. The symphony orchestra, in spite of the difficult conditions under which it was organized, acquitted itself very ably. Directors Zygman and Kapalka know well that before the present orchestral assembly can be called a real symphony orchestra, much work has yet to be done. They must make endeavors for more talented musicians and enlarge the orchestra as to instruments. This made itself felt yesterday, in Schubert's composition A Minor, and the more in the Allegretto of the Seventh Symphony from Beethoven.</p>
   <p>The great meaning of a symphony orchestra was brought out in his talk by the president of the Polish Singers Alliance, Mr. Petrykowski. He gave us to <pb facs="5423968_5_0394.jpg" n="2"/>understand that all singing groups in Chicago will lend their efforts toward the success and development of this orchestra. A concert to be held Downtown will not appear so soon. Probably in the spring, because the orchestra must be more finished.</p>
