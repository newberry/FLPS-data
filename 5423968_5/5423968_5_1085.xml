   <p>Three programs of entertainment were presented yesterday in the various sections of the city. This, indeed, was too much for one day. As it happens, there is generally a lapse of many weeks from one social function to another. Something ought to be done to remedy this situation. Perhaps, a committee representing the various societies could be formed which would iron out these present difficulties, and help to promote Polish entertainment and patronage. Yesterday's unfortunate incident would, in this respect, never happen again.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we are happy to present an account of all three Polish programs. In view of such a predicament, it was impossible for the <pb facs="5423968_5_1086.jpg" n="2"/>committee to arrange proper representation of the press to cover these affairs. Consequently, we will only be able to give a short resume of two. A special write-up is only given the fifth anniversary of the St. Casimir Young Men's Club, which appears in another section of the paper.</p>
   <p>A four-act historical play was presented at Schoenhofen's hall, entitled "The Siege of the City of Trebowla," by the Society of Polish Tailors. The leading role was played by Miss M. Winiarska, who gave an outstanding performance. The entire play was given by Polish amateur dramatists. Their acting was of a fine caliber. The audience was well represented, and greatly pleased with the program.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1087.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Polish Dramatical Club gave a dramatization of a five-act tragedy at Vorwaerts Turner Hall on Twelfth Street, near Halsted. The play, "The Heroine of the Insurrection of 1863," was an original one. It was written by one of the members of the dramatical club, A. S. Zdzieblowski.</p>
   <p>At six o'clock, the public began to make its appearance at the large hall. At eight o'clock, when the curtain was raised for the first act, the entire house was sold out. The people were crowded to such an extent that many had to stand, for even the extra chairs were occupied. People came from all the cross sections of the city to view this well advertised tragedy. It was an indication that Polish drama, although occasionally presented, is in demand. The name of A. S. Zdzieblowski was incentive enough to attract an enthusiastic crowd, for he is well <pb facs="5423968_5_1088.jpg" n="4"/>known and well liked.</p>
   <p>The amateur dramatists gave one of their best performances. The acme of acting was reached in the fourth act when the battle between the Poles and Russians was fought. This bit of dramatization took on natural and realistic proportions. The enthusiasm of the crowd reach its zenith. This act brought to many the actual scenes that were experienced by them when abroad at that time. Many a tear ran down the faces of the audience, for this brought back memories of those crucial days in Poland and the heroic struggle of their fathers for a cause that brought them only death.</p>
   <p>The outstanding performances of the evening were given by Miss M. Gintowt, who played the role of "Anusia," Mr. J. A. Gintow, who took the <pb facs="5423968_5_1089.jpg" n="5"/>part of "Marek," and Mr. B. Markiewicz for the characterization of the Jew, "Zelma".</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the play, the enthusiastic audience demanded the appearance of the author. He was greeted with thunderous applause for his outstanding work. The shouts and foot-stamping, plus the applause, was the best recognition an author could ever receive for his literary efforts.</p>
