   <p>The Society Orzel I Pogon presented last night, before a packed house at Walsh's Hall, Mr. J. Korzeniowski's beautiful drama "Isabella d'Aymonte." The leading role, a powerfully dramatic one, was played by Mrs. Wanda Jozwik, who, being the accomplished actress that she is, re-created the part in a manner that moved the audience deeply. The death scene, especially, was brilliantly performed, and the audience rewarded the actress with thunderous applause. Mr. Jozwik played with dignity and grace the role of the heroine's father. Other actors who played their parts well were Mr. Machek and Mr. Wojnicki, Mrs. Zolkowska made a very good duenna; Mr. Waranko gave an excellent performance as the brother of the unfortunate Isabella. The rest of the amateurs played their roles well in every respect, and the play as a whole was a success.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: "Orzel" means "eagle"; "pogon," in the Polish-Lithuanian coat of arms, represents a galloping horse with a rider holding a sword ready to strike.]</p>
