   <p>Miss Olga Orlenska surely belongs to the better Polish songstresses, known here to us in America. However, her program yesterday, for some unknown reason, was so arranged that it did not allow her to display either the technique, so characteristic of well accomplished artists, or the volume of her vocal range. In the entire concert there was not even one cadenza or one difficult passage, nor was there a single note beyond high "C". In this, however, it was not the fault of the artist alone, who sang, as aforementioned with facility and grace, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> that of the one who selected the compositions for the program.</p>
   <p>Besides this, in yesterday's concert at certain times, the artist lacked the freedom of a stage veteran, that sturdy certainty of movement, that ardor and temperament, which enraptures the listener and puts him into a frame of wonderment, charm, and compels him to admire the artist.</p>
   <p>These few observations presented themselves to us yesterday at the concert of the prima donna.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0387.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This concert, nevertheless, is ranked among the best which have been heard here in our colony in recent years, and the kind which we want to hear often, not only within a circle, strictly Polish, but American, international, so that the renown of Polish art will go forth far and wide.</p>
