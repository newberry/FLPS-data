  <body>
   <p>The shareholders of the Original Quartz Hill Gold Mining Company of Middle Creek, California, held their first annual meeting yesterday in the Palmer House.</p>
   <p>Thirty shareholders representing twenty-five hundred shares attended the meeting. However. not all shareholders were present. Reverend Grutz and Mr. Niezorawski, both of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, represented the shareholders residing in that city.</p>
   <p>Zbigniew Brodowski acted as chairman of the meeting and J. F. Smulski as secretary.</p>
   <p>The report on mine operations was read by Dr. K. Midowicz, president of the board of directors. The report shows that the mine is in good condition, that more ore crushers are needed in order to increase the output. Up to <pb facs="5423968_5_0277.jpg" n="2"/>now a total of 178 ounces of gold has been obtained.</p>
   <p>The financial report was read by J. F. Smulski. Both reports were accepted. The financial report will be printed and a copy sent to every shareholder.</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was decided to raise the nominal value of the shares to one hundred dollars, and to double the number of ore crushers.</p>
   <p>Two directors--Peter Kiolbassa, and S. Szopinski--whose terms had expired, were substituted by Reverend V. Barzynski of Chicago and Reverend Grutz of Milwaukee. Z. Brodowski was re-elected director.</p>
   <p>The following were elected officials of the company: Dr. K. Midowicz, president; Reverend Grutz, vice-president; J. F. Smulski, secretary; and Judge M. A. La Buy, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The Polish Gold Mine is a great success. Right after the meeting, a few thousand dollars worth of shares was sold.</p>
