  <body>
   <p>I will not write here of the activity of the Polish young people who are members of the Promien Society, and who are so full of energy and desire for nationalistic work--youth of ardent Polish heart and soul--their deeds speak for themselves. Their splendid ten-year record, from which a hopeful future can be predicted, is marked by many successes in the Society's field of endeavor, the last being its tenth anniversary program, of which I would like to write a few words.</p>
   <p>The recitation of Mary Konopnicka's "Pred Sadem" (Before Justice), by Mrs. B. Wojtowicz, was beautiful indeed. Her diction and the melodic rhythm of the poem combined to make a beautiful whole, striking the ear pleasantly like the song of a lark in our Polish fields, while the great thought of our poetess flowed straight to the heart; before the judge's final pronouncement was made, one knew that the just man would decide that instead of courts <pb facs="5423968_5_0860.jpg" n="2"/>the people need enlightenment</p>
   <p>As to the classical music played by Mr. Orzada on the violin, I can only repeat what has already been said publicly in Chicago by our well-known singer, Thaddeus Wronski, that if we want our people to love music, we must give them the music they understand--[Polish] folk tunes; for our music and songs are second to none in the world.</p>
   <p>More understandable and more in keeping with [polish] character was the piano solo played by Mr. Fifielski, even though it was Liszt's "Rhapsody" that he played. His rendition was beautiful. Please believe me that, although there were very few people in the hall who knew music, the collective soul of the gathering was not mistaken, and demonstrated its feelings in a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>The same can be said of the splendid Philaret Chorus. Mr. Rybowiak is gathering well-deserved laurels for his "Marsz Bojowy" (Battle March). "Piesn Bandytow" (Song of the Bandits) was also very beautiful. It is too bad, however, that the chorus was not adequately prepared to sing it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0861.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And now for the real attractions of the evening: the drama "Czyja Wina?" (Whose Fault?) by Henryk Sienkiewicz and the excerpt from the third part of "Dziady" (Forefathers' Eve) by Adam Mickiewicz.</p>
   <p>In the drama "Czyja Wina," Mrs W. Wachtel and K. Kasperek played their respective parts splendidly. Mrs. Wachtel played with real artistry and abandon, with a complete understanding of her role. Mr. Kasperek characterized perfectly the dignified type of man who takes life and all its manifestations seriously, who does not understand trifling with that sacred emotion called love. The good impression was a little spoiled, however, by his overemphasized motions of despair. A man of stern character should have been able to conceal his feelings more, even though his heart were breaking.</p>
   <p>But then the drama itself is such a strange entanglement on the psychological aspect of "whose fault?", that two young lives passed within reach of happiness and did not see the opportunity.</p>
   <p>In the play, a young artist falls in love with a beautiful and wealthy girl. They are happy until he becomes jealous. His jealousy is entirely without <pb facs="5423968_5_0862.jpg" n="4"/>foundation but leads to their separation through a misunderstanding;through the ambiguity of her words when, in answer to his charges, she says that "she gives more than she gets." She is thinking of love when she says this, while he understands it as an allusion to his poverty, and leaves her without a word. She waits in vain for his return and finally, to "avenge herself upon him and upon her own self" she marries conventionally. Her life is empty and pointless; he devotes the rest of his to art.</p>
   <p>In general, the first act of the third part of Mickiewicz's "Dziady" turned out well. At first, there was a certain confusion and uncertainty among the players--stage fright, forgetting of lines--but the actors soon fell into their parts and played well to the end.</p>
   <p>Especially deserving of recognition for good acting, for feeling their parts, were, first of all, K. Wojtowicz as "Sobolewski" and K. Wachtel as "Konrad." L. Paluszek, F. Scholl, K. Jedlinski, and K. Kasperek also played well. The strongest impression on the audience was made by the relating of the terrible national tragedy, the exile of Polish youth to Siberia. The powerful and <pb facs="5423968_5_0863.jpg" n="5"/>tragic voice of Wojtowicz echoed in the hearts of the audience and many an eye glistened with tears.</p>
   <p>The members of Promien picked an appropriate time to present this excerpt from one of our literary masterpieces. In truth, every heart beat with one feeling, and there was but one thought in the minds of the hundreds present: that Russia is now paying for all the crimes of the Czarist regime; those who once oppressed Poland would now gladly hide in the smallest mouse-hole.</p>
   <p>The poet "Konrau" was splendidly played by K. Wachtel; especially good was his delivery of the lines:</p>
   <p>"Zemsty! Zemsty!! Na Wroga!</p>
   <p>"Z Bogiem--chocby mimo Boga!"</p>
   <p>(Vengeance! Vengeance! On to the enemy'.</p>
   <p>With God--or even despite God!).</p>
   <p>How our thoughts connected this with our present relations with the modern Knights of the Cross!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0864.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The predictions of our genius [Mickiewicz] are being fulfilled. It was he who spoke of God as sowing the seed and the devil plowing it under until God's crop grew up. The Polish hearts that have been plowed under by Czarism and Kaiserism are now growing up.</p>
   <p>Members of Promien! Give us more such spiritual treats.</p>
   <p>[S.] Zaklikiewicz</p>
