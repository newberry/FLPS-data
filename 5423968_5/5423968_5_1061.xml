   <p>Yesterday's performance of the Theatrical Club at Walsh's Hall was a successful one. The play was a fairly interesting picture of Polish life entitled: "Surdut I Siermiega" [Gown and Smock] by Mr. Wladyslaw Gutowski. The amateur actors and actresses deserve the acclaim which the audience accorded them in repeated and enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>The leading role was played by Mr. M. Rzeszotarski. He performed the role with such conscientiousness and finesse that we doubt whether a professional actor could have done better. The other important male role, played by Mr. John Smulski, was also handled with ease and distinction. The performance of the rest of the amateurs was admirable, especially that of Mr. Zdieblowski, whose comedy provoked much laughter and received liberal applause. The play began and ended with dances and was interspersed with ballads. As a whole, <pb facs="5423968_5_1062.jpg" n="2"/>it turned out very well, for which Mr. Tobinski's excellent direction deserves credit.</p>
   <p>A dance followed the performance.</p>
