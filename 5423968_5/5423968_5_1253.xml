<title level="a">REVEREND JOHN KASPRZYCKI'S FEAST DAY CELEBRATION</title></bibl>

   <p>The St. Gregory Choir of St. John Cantius Parish honored their pastor, Reverend John Kasprzycki, with a grand entertainment on his feast day.</p>
   <p>The parishioners and the societies joined together in order to make the affair a success, and we must agree that they did a wonderful job.</p>
   <p>It is really difficult to believe, that this young parish has grown so beautifully in such a short time. But when we consider it more deeply we are not surprised, because Christian love rules there. Peace, unity, and love are evident there. The parishioners themselves realize that their pastor loves them and gives all his thought and labor for them, and for his sincerity, they repay him with as much sincerity.</p>
   <p>Besides the brave pastor there is the leader of the young people of the parish, Reverend Florian Matuszewski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1254.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This last entertainment proves that both the older parishioners and the young people understnad their leaders, and know how to express their appreciation.</p>
   <p>It would be difficult to describe each number on the program, so we will only say that the entire entertainment was excellent. All the speeches and recitations were fine--were given with vigor and full understanding of the subjects. The singing directed by the organist, Mr. Kwasinski, was very good. It could be seen that the St. John Cantius Parish choir has improved considerably lately.</p>
   <p>The comedy, "Help, He Is Crazy," was rendered without criticism. The director, Mr. Ignacy Kowalski, deserves credit for this, because he has directed the parish Dramatic Circle from its very beginning, and the results of his devoted labor are wonderful to see.</p>
   <p>The amateur orchestra conducted by Mr. Henzel also did very well.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1255.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Besides the scheduled numbers on the program there were speeches by Reverend E. Siedlaczek, Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewics, and Mr. Fruzyna, and all were vigorously applauded.</p>
   <p>Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek praised the parishioners for recognizing the good work of their pastor and honoring him for it.</p>
   <p>Good luck to you, Cantians! And to the pastor may we add our own wishes for a hundred years of health and happiness!</p>
   <p>Z.</p>
