   <p>Miss Phyllis Romanowska, who is well known to the public as an artist and songstress by her performances in the last four concerts, made her first appearance this year in the concert given under the auspices of the Women's Trade Union League, at the Masonic Temple, Saturday, July 25.</p>
   <p>The public greeted Miss Romanowska with the greatest ovation and applause. The mass consisted of mostly Polish people who were greatly interested in the fine work and performances of Miss Romanowska.</p>
   <p>Miss Romanowska's program consisted of French, Italian, German and Polish songs, old numbers and new. The first song was from Toski Pruccinie, second was the French "Folk Dance" from the time of Ludivig XI, third was Chopin's "Mazurka," and the last song was the "Polish Country Songs." The applause was so great Miss Romanowska had to give an encore of "Estasi," by Schubert.</p>
   <p>Miss R. Gretchen also appeared on this concert program and sang "Spinnrade," <pb facs="5423968_5_0487.jpg" n="2"/>by Schubert and "Valse De Concert." Mr. Raymond Robins, at the head of this concert, thanked the public for their beautiful support.</p>
   <p>To conclude the program Mr. A. Dresden played Beethoven's "Andante in F," on the piano.</p>
