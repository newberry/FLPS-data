   <p>Our societies in Chicago have received an announcement from the headquarters of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, urging them to take an active part in an international singing contest which will take place on June 13th. The net profits are to go for the cause of the war victims in Poland. The imploring hands of the oppressed Fatherland, going at the present time through an unheard of experience among civilized nations, like hands in misfortune, are stretching in our direction. The lamentation of our poor mother reaches us with the breath of the oceanic wind and fills us with its terror from head to foot. She cries! She is grieving over the destruction of her children, over the mass murders which are being perpetrated by satraps in the present international war!</p>
   <p>Which one of us does not understand accurately this war, so terrible in its effects? The whole world is looking with amazement and aversion upon this slaughter, but without council or willingness, does not care to get mixed up to end these bloody conflicts. It looks, therefore, long, drawn out war, <pb facs="5423968_5_0659.jpg" n="2"/>where, without question, the Polish nation will be most harmed. And these harms will be irreparable, financially it will run into millions which will never be recompensed. For this reason we must act, the more so because we are free to act.</p>
   <p>For this reason the "Cor Filaretow," (Filaret Choir), resolved to collect funds on a large scale and transmit such to our suffering countrymen suffering from horrors of war. These funds can be acquired by staging an international singing contest, which will take place on June 13 at Riverview Park. Eighteen nationalities living in Chicago and surrounding territory will participtate. Because of this we expect that immense crowd of Poles in America and Americans.</p>
   <p>All the Polish organizations in our city are cooperating with the Filaret Choir. The officers of all these organizations have resolved to restrain their groups from giving any picnics or other forms of entertainment on this day, and we, on our part, once more renew our plea and plead that not <pb facs="5423968_5_0660.jpg" n="3"/>one brother, or sister of the Polish Roman Catholic Union should be missing and that we all should participate.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Union ask that the members buy as many tickets as possible.</p>
