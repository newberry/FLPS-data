   <p>Last Sunday a concert was given at Shoenhoffen's Hall by the Chopin Singing Society, the Harmony Society of Milwaukee, and the MONIUSZKO choir of Chicago The attendance was so great that many of the people had to stand. It was one of the finest concerts held at this hall.</p>
   <p>The Polish people showed their true spirits by their attendance, and gave their heartiest support to the youngsters representing the different choirs in singing the Polish songs of our native land. The complete reports of this concert cannot be given at the present time because it was not completed by the time this article was sent to the press.</p>
   <p>The blessings bestowed upon these young Polish singers was due to them with all respect; to give them that credit which is honerably theirs thanks to their magnificent work.</p>
