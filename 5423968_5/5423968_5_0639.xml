<title level="a">CONCERT IN ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH</title></bibl>

   <p>A concert was held yesterday in the large St. Stanislaus Kostka Hall with the purpose of awakening greater interest in nationalistic work. The hall was donated for the concert by the Reverend Pastor Dembinski.</p>
   <p>The foremost artists of our local Poloma participated in the musical and vocal portions of the program; namely, Mrs. Harriet Smulski, Mrs. Zebrowski-Perlowski, and Mrs. Julius Smietanka. The eminent musician and conductor, Andrew Kwasigroch, president of the Polish Organists' Association, appeared with his St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Choir, famous for its numerous public appearances. Thus, the musical and vocal portions of the program were pleasing to all. The concert was closed with the singing of the Polish and American national anthems.</p>
   <p>The patriotic portion of the program was presented by T. M. Helinski, president of the Polish National Committee and member of the Military Commission, and Dr. B. Klarkowski, chief physician for the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>

   <p>Supplementing each other, they presented a good picture of the Polish cause as it now stands and of the need for strengthening the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>As a result, a number of women volunteered to sell tags and to agitate for the Polish Army. The large audience left the hall with feelings of elation, grateful to the speakers for their words of advice and encouragement, and to the artists and choir for their splendid singing. Despite the fact that it was Easter Monday and that the voters were preoccupied with tomorrow's elections, the evening was a great success.</p>
   <p>Father Dembinski deserves thanks for donating the parish hall for this concert.</p>
