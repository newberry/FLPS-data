<title level="a">POLISH-AMERICAN TURNERS IN THE LWOW EXPOSITION OF 1894</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>We have received the following letter regarding the participation of the Polish-American turners in the historic Lwow Exposition:</p>
   <p>"To Brother Turners in America!</p>
   <p>"Hail to you! Practically all the Poles in America are vitally interested in the Kosciusko Exposition to be held in Lwow in 1894. All Polish organizations and societies are actively engaged in boosting the Exposition, gathering photographs and documents relating to themselves and preparing appropriate descriptive articles. Many Poles in America intend to send samples of their products and inventions, so that they can be properly represented before the eyes of their countrymen in the fatherland. Shall we, the Polish turners of America, view this without taking any action of our own? Is it not our duty, even if in a lesser degree, to show our brother turners in Galicia, Cracow, and Posen that we also are interested in this historic national memorial and opportunity to exhibit the <pb facs="5423968_5_1360.jpg" n="2"/>work and industry of the Polish people?</p>
   <p>"Yes, brother turners! Although our nests were organized a short time ago, and despite the fact that our young eaglets (turners) haven't grown feathers yet and can in no way compare with their brethren abroad, we still feel it is our duty to show Poland, to show our countrymen there and show our brother turners, that we are alive, that we love our unfortunate country, and that our ideal is to gain the freedom of our Mother Poland through the efforts of these turners.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, brother turners scattered all over the United States, to action! Combine into one organization. 'Unity Is Life; Disunity Is Death' should be our motto. Together and in peace let us send as many [turners] as possible to the Kosciusko Exposition. It is true that we are still young and perhaps inexperienced, that we cannot, especially in these critical times, send any great exhibits, samples, or any financial help, but we believe that even our small and modest contribution will be gratefully accepted by our brethren in Poland.</p>
   <p>"On Sunday, December 17, at a great meeting of the Polish Turners No. I, it was <pb facs="5423968_5_1361.jpg" n="3"/>unanimously decided to prepare an article describing the activities and growth of the Polish turners in America; also to gather by-laws and regulations, badges and uniforms of the various turner branches. All of this is to be sent to the Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition. It was also decided to revive the old idea of forming an alliance of all the Polish turner societies in the United States.</p>
   <p>"We appeal, therefore, to all the presidents and secretaries of the various Polish turners to gather all material possible about the turners and send it to the undersigned so that we can insert it in the contemplated article:</p>
   <p>"1. Name and location of nest.</p>
   <p>"2. Full name of every officer, director, teacher, organizer, honorary member; also those taking part in drilling exercises and regular members, including the work they do.</p>
   <p>"3. Number of members in turner uniforms.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1362.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"4. A history of the organization and activities of the nest.</p>
   <p>"5. How often and how many hours weekly do the turners drill.</p>
   <p>"6. How many take part in the drills and how many hours do they practice.</p>
   <p>"7. Number of public entertainments, outings, national celebrations, etc., sponsored by the nest.</p>
   <p>"8. Do the members have sword practice, sharpshooting practice or rowing exercises.</p>
   <p>"9. A description of their flag.</p>
   <p>"10. Give address of meeting place and its dimensions.</p>
   <p>"11. What apparatus is owned by the nest, and what is its value?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1363.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"12. Financial status of the nest.</p>
   <p>"13. Does it include a nest of girl turners. Also a description of such nest, if included.</p>
   <p>"This information should be sent to me not later than December 20, 1894, so that we may have time to insert it among other material in our article and send it to the exposition in time.</p>
   <p>"We also wish to appeal to all our brother turners to contact us for the purpose of organizing a turners' alliance, and to send us their opinions and suggestions regarding this important matter.</p>
   <p>"Any further information will be gladly supplied by the undersigned.</p>
   <p>Casimir Zychlinski</p>
   <p>648 W. 17th Street, Chicago."</p>
