<title level="a">POLISH REALTORS' SOCIETY HOLDS MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Twenty representatives of the most important Polish real-estate firms in the city attended the meeting that was held last Thursday evening at the [Polish] Press Club by the Polish Realtors' Society.</p>
   <p>The meeting was informal--more in the nature of a social function than a business meeting. Matters concerning the firms that were represented there were discussed in an informal, friendly manner.</p>
   <p>Andrew Schultz, chairman of the meeting, called upon Mr. M. J. Bereczkowski to read a draft of the proposed constitution. Teophile Stan, Andrew Schultz, Stanley Jakiel, Z. Majewski, L. Segel, K. Nowinski, and others suggested and discussed several corrections and modifications to be made in the final draft.</p>
   <p>Those present agreed in the main with the opinion of the constitutional committee and strongly emphasized that the primary purpose of the society was <pb facs="5423968_5_0064.jpg" n="2"/>to raise the prestige of the profession. This profession now occupies an unfavorable position, as a result of the great number of incompetent and dishonest people who work sporadically in this field and who, through lack of the proper qualifications or through sheer dishonesty, cause their clients great losses.</p>
   <p>This society will try to unite all the Polish realtors who display competency in real-estate management, and is interested only in the quality, not the quantity, of its members. The society will see to it that both parties--the seller and the purchaser--are served honestly and intelligently.</p>
   <p>After a very pleasant supper prepared by Mrs. Klosinski, hostess of the Club, the meeting was adjourned after midnight, and everyone left the Club with the feeling that this society will do a great deal of good for its members, for the entire profession, and for those who employ the services of real-estate agents.</p>
