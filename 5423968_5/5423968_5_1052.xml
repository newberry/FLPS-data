   <p>Yesterday's performance of "Kosciusko At Raclawice" was excellent in every way. The drama is one which may readily be performed by amateurs. It is a colorful, fast-moving play, replete with humor and dramatic situations. Most of all, it is imbued with such patriotism as best uplifts the Polish spirit of our people, and it should be performed as often as possible here in America. It evoked tremendous applause from a large audience at the school hall near Bradley Street last night.</p>
   <p>The performance was very good from an artistic standpoint. The play's director and the orchestra conductor both deserve acknowledgement for their efforts. The scenery was good, the costumes beautiful, in short, everything was such that the performance proceeded without a hitch.</p>
   <p>As to the amateurs themselves, their acting was irreproachable.....It would be difficult to enumerate the many roles in this play. We must, however, <pb facs="5423968_5_1053.jpg" n="2"/>make special mention of M. Skolimowski, who is a Polish actor from Europe. He enacted the roles of Katkow and Jan Lirnik with professional artistry. Mr. Skolimowski's performance was especially brilliant in that the two parts are totally dissimilar.</p>
