   <p>The new Board of Directors of the United Singers, met in Grand Rapids, last month, to make laws to compel all groups of this Order to be represented at these monthly meetings. The different groups of Illinois met in Springfield and demanded a charter; in order to have their own group committees and directors, without being compelled to force the general officers to take time from work just to be present at these monthly meetings. The Central Committee at Grand Rapids soon changed its ideas, and asked that the groups of Illinois call a joint session at which offers from Grand Rapids would be present to discuss the official business of issuing a charter. After hours of heated debate they agreed to issue a charter under one condition that all Polish singers be grouped as one club, under the name of "United Polish Singers of America". The purpose of this organization will be according to the dontents of our documents. "To advance and promote an interest in Polish National and American songs; to organize, and direct, choruses and choirs in the state of Illinois and elsewhere, and in general to foster and encourage its members in the study and development of the art of music". The incorporates of this group are: Cezar Duzewski, Ignatz Mroz, Chester Perlowski, Valentine Kuflewski Marceli GAtkowski and Michael Nowakowski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0755.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The issuing of the charter was made possible by the aid of our notary public member Mr.F.Wegierski, March 18, 1898. We are informing all the Polish citizens in the United States a out this group, and we have great hopes that this parent organization of ours will soon have branches in all the states. Each state that has, or will have, a Society of United Polish Singers in its fold will have the right to hold its own Polish parliament which will be the legal right due to every group.</p>
   <p>Every true Pole, who is interested in spreading and prolonging the use of Polish songs and music among other nationalities, should join one of our groups of "United Polish Singers of America".</p>
   <p>C. Dazewski ----Pres.</p>
