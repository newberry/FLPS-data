<title level="a">RESULTS OF THE ONE-DAY BAZAAR FOR THE POLISH-AMERICAN PAVILION IN LWOW</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, Thanksgiving Day, many people turned out for the Polish-American Pavilion bazaar in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The results were gratifying, to say the least.</p>
   <p>The beautiful prizes on the stands tempted the participants to try their luck, and the plaintive strains of orchestral music held the crowd almost until midnight. Practically everyone carried home a prize. Many businessmen from the neighborhood also took part in this event.</p>
   <p>A gross profit of $412.28 was realized, of which over three hundred dollars was clear profit. Although this sum will not cover the outstanding debts incurred by the Polish-American Pavilion in Lwow, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1301.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Poles of Chicago have demonstrated that no worthy project goes unnoticed, unsupported. This is only a beginning, and it is hoped that other Polish communities will follow suit. With the help of our brothers we will cover all debts and close this matter with honor.</p>
