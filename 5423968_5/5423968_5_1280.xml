   <p>(The Dziennik Chicagoski has received the following article for publication.)</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, September 28, the fair for the benefit of the Polish orphans of Chicago, housed at the Holy Family Orphanage, opened in full swing. Every public-spirited Pole should support this benevolent affair.</p>
   <p>Dear friends! Do not forget the noble purpose of this fair. Remember that it is being given for the destitute Polish children; so you should forget your personal interests and give it your support.</p>
   <p>Attend this fair often, for the admission fee is nominal, and your participation in the various lotteries will enable the unfortunate children to <pb facs="5423968_5_1281.jpg" n="2"/>honor and respect the good will of the participants.</p>
   <p>The purchaser of an admission ticket qualifies for a nightly drawing of a prize which is valued at from two to twenty dollars. In this way no one actually wastes money; instead, he becomes a benefactor. In addition to doing a good deed one will have the feeling that he has spent an enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>Once again we appeal to all Poles to take part in this fair. An appeal is also made to the Polish youth. We feel that everyone, especially those who take interest in noble causes, will take an active part in this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>The admission price is only ten cents for a single ticket or fifty cents for the duration of the fair.</p>
