   <p>The slogan which is the title of this article is certainly familiar to every Polish man and woman. We employ it on every occasion, and many speakers shout it from the rostrums at all sorts of gatherings in order to display before their audiences the solidarity of their patriotism--how they support Polish commerce and industry--how they strive to improve the material conditions of our poor people.</p>
   <p>Most frequently, however, these are but empty words! [They are empty] because deeds do not follow these words, since we ourselves have often seen these persons who shout, recommending to others the slogan, "Go to your own people," carrying out large packages of merchandise purchased at foreign stores. Especially now that the Christmas holidays are approaching, and everybody is making purchases, you can see hundreds of our compatriots, even those on whose lips hangs <pb facs="5423968_5_0116.jpg" n="2"/>the slogan, "Go to your own people", slipping out of Jewish stores, burdened with merchandise, though they have tens of such Polish stores right next door. And, though this is an exception, we have even seen a few of our own businessmen, who thunder at their compatriots that they do not give them proper support, themselves, evidently to set a good example, making all sorts of purchases from foreigners. Our motto, "Go to your own people" sounds pretty in theory, but in practice it is nothing. We blow such soap bubbles on every occasion, bubbles which burst and disappear at the slightest touch of reality.</p>
   <p>We need therefore less mottoes, less empty phrases, less vacant prattle, but more action, greater solidarity on every score. Until we Poles force our way to a higher place in business and commerce, we shall continue to be the ordinary hired men of foreighers, and will have to do the heaviest, dirtiest, the most unhealthy, and at the same time the least remunerative kinds of work.</p>
   <p>This is a country of commerce and industry. These two sources of wealth develop gloriously here, and fortunate is he who knows how to conquer them and profit <pb facs="5423968_5_0117.jpg" n="3"/>from them. But one must know that in commerce and industry, successful competition, and support of one's own people are of the greatest importance. Strangers will not support us in either commerce or industry, because they really adhere to the motto: "Go to your own people", and will go a few blocks out of their way to their own countrymen for merchandise, passing up foreigners. Why then should not we Poles follow the same tactics? Why do we not support with our money Polish commerce and industry, in order to build them up?</p>
   <p>Besides agriculture, commerce and industry are the most important elements in the development of all nations, and fortunate is the nation which knows how to conquer and develop these important factors leading to material wealth. The wealth of individuals in commerce, industry, and agriculture is the wealth of the entire nation, its power and its future. Therefore let us try hard to raise our industry and commerce to the heights which these two branches of material wealth should have attained long ago.</p>
   <p>We remind our countrymen and women of this now because the Christmas holidays <pb facs="5423968_5_0118.jpg" n="4"/>are approaching, and as a result almost everyone will be making greater purchases of all sorts of merchandise for Christmas. We appeal, therefore, to the reason and the sense of solidarity of our fellow countrymen to activize the slogan, "Go to your own people" by purchasing all they can from their own compatriots.</p>
   <p>Your money you have earned by the sweat of your brow; you have given your employers your hard labor, enriching them because you did not receive for your work as much as you deserved. Therefore do not give these pennies earned by such hard labor to strangers, in order to enrich them from this source. Let the money earned by Polish toil and labor go to the Poles-let it elevate our nation, and let it not fatten those who may even be our enemies.</p>
   <p>The Christmas rush has begun already; millions of dollars are pouring forth; let then a part of these millions go into polish hands-let not the polish stores remain empty when the foreign stores are crowded with customers. Believing our slogan, "Go to your own people", let us follow it that it may lead us to our own <pb facs="5423968_5_0119.jpg" n="5"/>stores, and drive us away from foreign stores. Let us support each other in every way, because strangers will not support us. And besides, the merchandise of a Polish merchant is certainly no worse than that of others, about which fact anyone can convince himself; therefore why not go to our own brothers? Why not aid their development in commerce and industry?</p>
   <p>After all the material well-being of Polish merchants and industrialists is the material well-being of all of us. If they have more, then we will be able more easily to earn something from them; and besides for nationalistic purposes, for the enlightenment of the masses, we could contribute money more easily if we were wealthier. Today we are much better able to contribute to all sorts of general causes than we were several years ago when we were poorer, and our offerings will become greater as we become wealthier.</p>
   <p>Those things which you can, purchase from your countrymen, with the thought that this is simply your duty, and not a favor. Let our housewives consider it a national sin to pass up Polish merchants in order to enrich Jews or Germans. Your husbands have to work hard for these dollars, which you sometimes lightly, <pb facs="5423968_5_0120.jpg" n="6"/>without due consideration, spend; therefore at least let them go to our own people--to the Poles.</p>
   <p>Go to your own people--that is the slogan, which should not ring like a cracked bell, but which should be turned into action. Would that our words might find their way into your hearts and your Polish conscience!</p>
