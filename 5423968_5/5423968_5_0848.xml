   <p>That the members of the Polish Dramatic Club Ognisko, in Brighton Park, are very active can be proved by their very interesting and educational meetings, which are held every Friday night. These meetings are held at the Polish Home of Freedom, 46th and Mozart St., and are called Literary evenings.</p>
   <p>These evenings are not only very artistic but also educational. They are composed of musical numbers, vocal and instrumental, such as solos and duets, also the reciting of poems, reading selections from famous Polish authors. Quite often humorous monologues are recited. Besides this, every dramatic evening is concluded by a very interesting lecture either on Polish literature or history.</p>
   <p>At the last dramatic evening, which was held on the 14th of Feb., the following program was staged: Opening, violin solo by Miss G. Jelen, with a piano accompaniment by her sister Miss Mary Jelen, who played, The Danube Waves. Miss Irene Fetter, who is the youngest member of this club, sang Laleczko Ma, a Polish folk song. This was followed by a poetical monologue Sztajer, recited by Miss Eveline Meger. The next number was a solo which was sung by Miss Sylvia Wcislo; she was greatly applauded. The program was continued by a short talk by Mr. A. Guzdek on Ballads of Mickiewicz, which was followed by the piano number, The Fairy Wedding Waltz and The Wayside Rose, which received <pb facs="5423968_5_0849.jpg" n="2"/>a great applause. There were also other beautiful numbers. The program was concluded by a song.</p>
