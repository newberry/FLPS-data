   <p>A lover of music, who wishes to assist the Polish Welfare Association with his simple talent, intends to conduct several operatic recitals at his home. The plan of these recitals is as follows: On a certain designated day of the week the lovers of music, who wish to become acquainted with the contents of a certain opera, will meet at the home of the conductor of these recitals who, while he plays excerpts at the piano, will at the same time narrate the libretto of the opera.</p>
   <p>The admission to these recitals amounts to only twenty-five cents and the entire income (irrespective of the incidental expenses which will be sustained by the sponsor himself) will be given to the administration of the Polish Welfare Association.</p>
   <p>These recitals will be conducted only in the event that twenty people will <pb facs="5423968_5_0829.jpg" n="2"/>come evidencing a desire to hear the music. Also, the sponsor cannot accomodate more than twenty people in his small room.</p>
   <p>For the present the series of recitals will cover the eight following operas: Beethoven's "Fidelio," Bellini's "Norma," Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia," (sic), Flotow's "Martha," Mozart's "Magic Flute," Rossini's "The Barber of Seville," Verdi's "Trovatore" and Weber's "Der Freischutz".</p>
   <p>The newspaper Dziennik Chicagoski will accept all those who apply to hear one or more of these recitals. Applications may be made only until the sixteenth of this month inclusive.</p>
   <p>Other Polish periodicals in Chicago are cordially requested to repeat this advertisement. Each recital will last approximately two hours, from eight until ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
