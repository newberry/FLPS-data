   <p>Composer Wieniawski was on the stage at the Roman Catholic Union hall yesterday. You do not believe it? Yesterday Wieniawski was among us in spirit if not in person. This spirit which created "Memories of Moscow" shown forth in unusual triumph in the rare performance of the violinist Antoinette Zebrowski, whom we heard yesterday for the first time since her return from Europe. Zebrowski's technique and understanding, coupled with her expression of depth of feeling, in playing "Krasny Sarafan"--the melody of which is sad in spots, and interwoven with the sounds of pain and nostalgia--places Zebrowski unquestionably in the ranks of the world's best violinists. Yesterday with her talent and technique she carried "Krasny Sarafan" to great heights and made a lasting impression on the minds of the listeners. As a result an unusual thing happened at the concert of the Students' Aid society: the listeners, carried away by the exceptionally fine performance, burst into such wild applause that they forced the violinist, who was tired after playing two numbers, to play an encore.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Harriet Smulski whose voice has a rare sweetness, brought out the soft emotional quality of her solo, "Welcome the Knights" from the opera "Huguenots" by Meyerberg. Smulski's interpretation of the aria from the "Huguenots" possessed the characteristic mood of the singer's unusual individuality. Smulski is justly considered in the circle of musical savants the best soprano among the Poles in America.</p>
   <p>The audience received Miss Smulski, Miss Dobek, and Mr. Joseph Dumanowski enthusiastically when the trio sang Owen's "Ave Maria".</p>
   <p>The little nightingale of Holy Trinity's men's choir was fifteen-year-old Miss Panek. The reputation of Holy Trinity's choir under the baton of Director Mallek is already established--established and earned--but yesterday with the participation of Rosalie Panek, who sang the solo part of "The Night Weeps", it gained much. It is not surprising that the little nightingale held the attention of the audience and won its enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>The lyric qualities of Miss Dombek's voice found Rutkowski's "Why" and in <pb facs="5423968_5_0672.jpg" n="3"/>Verdi's "Don Fatale" excellent media for expressing their charm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dumanowski gallantly held his ground in Verdi's "La Donna E Mobile", regardless of the difficult competition of the excellent performers who took part in yesterday's program. He sang very well, Noskowski's "The Lark Sings".</p>
   <p>The audience applauded "The March of the Polish National Alliance", which was sung by the Holy Trinity Choir, with such enthusiasm that the Choir was compelled to offer as an encore "The Work Song", with Mr. Ludwik as bass soloist.</p>
   <p>The concert as a whole was very successful. The concert committee should be congratulated for the selection of such excellent performers. Although none of our concerts this season have lacked good talent, yesterday's concert gathered together the best performers which the Poles have.</p>
