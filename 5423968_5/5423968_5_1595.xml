   <p>On Saturday evening, a meeting of the executive committee of the Polish World's Fair Reception Committee was held. The meeting was attended by all members of the Reception Committee. The secretary of the Executive Committee read to the meeting more than sixty letters, received from all parts of Europe and the United States, asking for information in accordance with the announcements published in the Polish papers. These letters were from Poles living in all three of the Polish partitions, from Bulgaria, Germany, Russia, and other places. Each of the letters received an individual reply and the text of the answers was noted upon the originals. With some persons who requested information, several letters were exchanged; a few of the letters expressed gratitude to the Committee for its detailed and careful attention to their requests. Besides these letters, the secretary <pb facs="5423968_5_1596.jpg" n="2"/>explained that a great number of people had applied in person to the Committee's offices for information or advice, and eventually, in search of living quarters, of which the Committee maintains a list. Everyone received the necessary information, and the Committee was able to find living quarters for a majority of the applicants. The Committee accepted the report and expressed its acknowledgment to the secretary for his work.</p>
   <p>The Committee's expenses, up to the present time, amount to eighteen dollars. Of this, $5.75 was spent in sending out announcements to all the Polish papers in America and Europe, including postage stamps, rubber stamps; printing of the announcements (by the Catholic Gazette) cost $6; letterheads and envelopes (printed by the Polish Publishing Company) cost $6.25. To help cover these expenses, the Resurrection Fathers donated $5. A collection was taken up at the meeting which netted $8. Since there will be further expenses, it was <pb facs="5423968_5_1597.jpg" n="3"/>decided that a small assessment be made on each member of the Committee.</p>
   <p>It was further decided that the Committee would give its full support to the inauguration of a Polish art section in Jackson Park, to be held on Friday [August 4] at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Finally, the matter of welcoming Professor Dunikowski, of Galicia [Austrian Poland], was considered. Provided it is informed of the exact place and time of their arrival, the Committee will greet them at the railroad station; the Committee will also hold a reception for these distinguished visitors at its offices, and provide living quarters for them. It will conduct them on sightseeing tours through Chicago and the Fair grounds, and in general, do everything possible to make their stay among us a pleasant one. Following these decisions, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
