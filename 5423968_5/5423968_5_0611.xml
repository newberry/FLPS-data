   <p>Delegates to the convention of the Polish Women's Alliance of America are invited to attend a concert. The pre-convention committee is working together with the Alliance of Polish Singers.</p>
   <p>The Administration of the Alliance of Polish singers, in order to honor and properly entertain the delegates to the Polish Women's Alliance Convention, who are due to arrive Sunday Aug. 21, have arranged a great concert to be given at the Polish Roman Catholic Union hall, which is located on Milwaukee Ave. at the corner of Augusta Blvd.</p>
   <p>The Committee which is made up of the following singers, W. Panka, vice president, Eugenja-Pawlowska vice president, Mieczyslaw-Wyrzykowski general secretary, Wlad L. Pietrzykowski president, are working together with the pre-convention committee of the Polish Women's Alliance. At the proper time the Delegates will be presented with complimentary tickets. They will be seated in a section of the concert hall reserved for their occupancy only.</p>
   <p>A great deal of publicity is desired, in order to assure large attendence. The Polish songs and music will be spiritually stimulating. The delegates will also have the opportunity of meeting and mingling with all of the Polish socialites, gathered here from all parts of the United States. More details pertaining to the concert will be forthcoming at a later date.</p>
