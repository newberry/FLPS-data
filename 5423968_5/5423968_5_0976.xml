  <body>
   <p>The school children of Saint John Cantius Parish gave a performance yesterday in the upper school hall that was a success in every way. The hall was filled.</p>
   <p>The main attraction was "Aquilina," a drama containing four acts, five scenes, and a tableau, which pleased everybody so much last year. This year, again, the acting was superb, the costumes were beautiful, the girls were charming, their diction was extremely correct, the scenery was flawless, all of which proves that the sister-teachers do not mind the work and also shows how intelligent their students are.</p>
   <p>The last tableau was especially marvelous; it created a tremendous impression.</p>
   <p>Equally pleasing were the little girls in the sketch "Busy Bees"; they were <pb facs="5423968_5_0977.jpg" n="2"/>applauded time and again.</p>
   <p>During intermission the local choir,directed by Mr. F. Kwasinski, the organist, sang a few songs, and the carefully instructed orchestra of small boys, who have shown great progress, played, and were followed by violin and piano playing by Mr. Frank Kryl (a Bohemian) and Mr. Stanislaus Szwajkart.</p>
   <p>The performance ended very early, it began at seven-thirty o'clock in the evening and continued without a break until just a little before ten o'clock.</p>
