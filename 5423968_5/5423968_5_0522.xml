   <p>An exhibition of paintings by local Polish artists under the auspices of the Polish Arts Club, will begin next Sunday evening, Sept. 18. It will be held on the second mezzanine floor of the Home Bank Building, and will be open every evening until Sunday, Oct. 2, and every afternoon after 3 o'clock. There will be over fifty paintings, practically all of which will be for sale, with prices ranging from $30 to $65 among which are a large selection at about $150 each.</p>
   <p>Among the artists who will exhibit are Mrs. Harriet B. Krawiec, Mrs. Sliwinski, Mr. Kaczmarski, Mr. Walter Krawiec, Mr. Michael Ackucki and Mr. Casimir Majcwski. The next meeting of the Polish Arts Club will be held Sunday, Sept. 18, at three o'clock in the exhibition gallery. The exhibition will be open to the public at 7 P.M. There will be no admission charge, and every one is invited. Mrs. J. B. Zielinski is chairman of the exhibition committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Clarence Dawson, editor of Poland, thanked the Polish Arts Club for its active interest. He spoke to the members and friends of the Association at the opening of the exhibition and thanked them for the loyal support given to his magazine and asked for a continuance of their patronage.</p>

   <p>He said that Poland is very anxious to publish reports of the progress which is being made in all Polish communities in the United States-not only along commercial lines but especially in the field of music, art, and literature. He offered his co-operation in the work and expressed the hope that such events as the Polish Concert of Ravinia Park and the present exhibition of paintings would become annual events, not only in Chicago but in every large Polish community in the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edmund Kalenski, Polish vice-consul, congratulated the Club for what it had accomplished in less than two years, expressing wishes for a still greater activity in the future.</p>
