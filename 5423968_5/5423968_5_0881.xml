   <p>Last Sunday, groups 15, 46, 73, and 193 of the Polish Women's Alliance sponsored a rally at J. Slowacki's hall,at which the participants were entertained with a one-act play, violin and piano solos, a monologue, and a lecture. Mrs. A. Milaszewicz was chairman. The lecturer was Mrs. Helen Setmajer. A violin solo was played by Chester Frankiewicz, and Miss Manikowski recited a monologue. Miss Victoria Milaszewicz sang a vocal solo, and a piano solo was played by Miss Brzezinski. The play "Adam and Eve" was excellently performed. Mrs. Helen Sttuzyna played the role of Adam splendidly, and Mrs. Jadwiga [Harriet] Gluchowski was very good in the role of Eve. Mr. H. Ziolkowski gave an excellent performance as the Count. Miss Sophia Milaszewicz played the piano accompaniment to the songs in the play. The collection to defray the expenses of the evening yielded $15. In a word, the evening was a success in every respect, and the large audience did not stint its applause.</p>
