   <p>The Union of Polish Saloonkeepers on the Northwest Side of Chicago, at their meeting held on June 12, decided that beginning to-day, they would inaugurate a novelty in selling bear, namely, that instead of selling it by liquid measure, in pints, they would sell a quart of beer, or two pounds, for five cents.</p>
   <p>More than a hundred saloonkeepers in our community already belong to this Union, and it is a branch of the State Protective Association, which numbers over 6,000 members.</p>
   <p>This new system of selling beer was decided on because the saloonkeepers were losing fifty cents on a barrel in selling it by liquid measure, by the pint, which was only guessed at.</p>
   <p>So we shall drink our beer by the pound.</p>

   <p>Any member of the Union of Polish Saloonkeepers found selling beer by the pint will be fined the sum of five dollars.</p>
