   <p>At a meeting held on October 16, 1927, the Polish University Club elected its officers for the 1927 and 1928 term. The meeting was opened by Mr. Pawlowski, retiring president of the club. He presented his report of the club's activities in the closing year. The assembly approved the report, and a rising vote of thanks was accorded, Mr. Pawlowski, for his splendid interest in the welfare of the young and energetic club.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pawlowski tendered his resignation from the office of president, with the explanation that he could not devote the necessary time to his regular duties. His resignation was reluctantly accepted. He assured his colleagues, however, that he will be ready at all times to serve the Polish University Club in an advisory capacity.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the president's report, the vice president and various secretaries read their respective reports, and a rising vote of thanks was granted each of them. Members of the club commented favorably on the individual records of the Administration. The nominations and elections of officers then followed. Mr. J. Sokolowski, was named president, Mr. J. Ulis, Vice President, Mr. E. Grajewski, recording secretary, Mr. S. Kusper, financial secretary, Mr. M. Kilanowski, treasurer, Mr. W. Kmieciak secretary of publicity, and Mr. Z. Rogozinski sergeant-at-arms. Mr. T. A. Pawlowski, the retiring president, administered the oath of office to the new administration, and wished them success and Godspeed.</p>
