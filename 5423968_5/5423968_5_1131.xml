  <body>
   <p>Let us familiarize ourselves with our strength in commerce and industry, financial institutions and organizations, so that the general public may acquaint itself more extensively with the sort of enterprise and industry we are conducting. We must do it jointly.</p>
   <p>A group of merchants and manufacturers have presented a project, i. e., a purely-Polish exhibition of trade and industry. This organization is headed by Attorney Andrew C. Bisek, 1152 Milwaukee Avenue. The exhibition will be held from December 3 to December 9 at the home of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, daily from 4 P. M. to 11 P. M.</p>
   <p>Our merchants and manufacturers are taking great interest in this exhibit, and are applying to the head of the committee, Mr. Biska, in great numbers for rules and regulations regarding the exhibit. According to information received from the committee, 10,000 invitations and announcements have already been sent to persons and about 20,000 more will be sent out. The exhibition promises splendid results.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Only Polish firms are permitted as exhibitors because the committee wishes to demonstrate the fact that the Poles are interested in the development of commerce and industry.</p>
