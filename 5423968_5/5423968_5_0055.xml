   <p>Milwaukee Avenue is steadily becoming more and more Polish, especially the block between Division and Cleaver Streets. Until not very long ago, this block was occupied by businesses other than Polish, and only here and there could one find a Polish firm. Since the Poles began to replace the businessmen of other nationalities, both in number and kind, they now represent an important business group in this block, standing on a higher level than the others.</p>
   <p>The following are the Polish firms now located on Milwaukee Avenue, between Cleaver and Division Streets: Progress Clothing Company, owned by Vlanowski and Sobieski; Polonia, owned by Cieslak and Miedzanowski; Plucinski Brothers and George Plucinski; Kaminski; Press's bakery; E. Misiewicz's floral shop, Bzowski's barber shop, Gladkowski's beauty shop, and others, not counting lawyers' and doctors' offices. They are really ornaments in the block.</p>

   <p>Recently, a new enterprise has been added to this list of businesses--namely, a first class Polish drugstore, at 1174 Milwaukee Avenue, owned by W. Wieczorek, a young Falcon and member of the Polish National Alliance, Council 2.</p>
   <p>Because of its equipment and stock of medicines, Wieczorek's drugstore is counted among the best in Chicago; prescriptions are filled with the greatest care and accuracy.</p>
   <p>The drugstore was equipped at a cost of three thousand dollars by the very well-known Polish firm, A. Kulesza and Company, which has earned recognition and distinction for itself in the best American circles. Its factory and salesrooms are located at 1313-1319 Division Street.</p>
   <p>The furnishings of Wieczorek's drugstore are really attractive, and we wish him success in his enterprise.</p>

   <p>Who of the Poles will be the next to open a business in this block?</p>
