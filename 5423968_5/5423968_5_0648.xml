   <p>Last Sunday evening the J. Slowacki Library and Commune 39 of the Polish National Alliance arranged a concert at J. Slowacki's hall, the proceeds of which are to be turned over to Polish relief. Despite the severe cold, a goodly crowd assembled.</p>
   <p>After a short speech by Mr. D. Hojnacki, president of the library, the following program was begun: The first number was [a musical selection] by the orchestra of the Union of Polish Musicians, under the direction of Mr. B. J. Zalewski. The united choirs Lutnia, Philomen, Druzyna, Vistula, and Lyre sang the"Kujawiak" (Polish rejional dance) "Od Dworu do Dworu" (From Manor to Manor). The little nightingale of Town of Lake, Miss Harriet Drzewiecki, sang the waltz "Arditi" as a soprano solo with piano and violin accompaniment. With her beautiful and pleasant voice the soloist completely charmed the audience and was forced by the storm of applause to sing an encore. The Lutnia Singing Society sang, under the direction of Mr. B. Zalewski, an excerpt from the opera "Duch Wojewody"</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_0649.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(The Voivode's Spirit). The solo parts were sung by Mr. R. Miller, Mr. I. Wutkowski, Mr. Z. Urbanowicz, and Miss Drzewiecki. The orchestra, conducted by Mr. Zalewski, played an overture. The Philomen Male Chorus sang J. Galla's "Wiosna" (Spring) under the direction of Mr. B. Zalewski. To conclude the first part of the program, the Druzyna Choir sang "Wiazanka Melodji Narodowych" (Medley of National Melodies), by Eugene Walkiewicz.</p>
   <p>After a short intermission the orchestra began the second part of the program, which was followed by a piano solo by Miss M. Szymanski. Mr. B. J. Zalewski, baritone, sang several comic numbers to the delight of the audience. The Vistula Choir, under the direction of Mr. Z. Filisiewicz, sang Noskowski's "Wedrowny Grajek" (The Wandering Minstrel), in which Miss Helen Jurkowski sang the solo parts. Miss I. Drzewiecki, soprano, and Mr. B. J. Zalewski, baritone sang a duet with piano accompaniment. The Lyre Choir, under the direction of Mr. J. J. Jakaitis, sang "Ten Las" (This Forest). In conclusion the united choirs, as at the beginning, sang a polonaise by Zukowski under the direction of Mr. B. J. Zalewski. About two hundred people took part in the numbers by the United <pb facs="5423968_5_0650.jpg" n="3"/>choirs. All the numbers came out exceptionally well and the audience applauded so enthusiastically that all the numbers, both solo and choral, had to be encored.</p>
   <p>It should be added that, through the efforts of Mr. B. J. Zalewski, the orchestra, composed of members of the Polish Musicians Union, gave their services gratis, for which they deserve recognition. Mr. Peter Buczynski, owner of a piano store at 5048 South Ashland Avenue, sent over a piano,also gratis, for the occasion. Finally, Mr. D. Hojnacki, chairman of the committee, announced that a police permit was not obtained for the raffling off of the objects left over from the bazaar, and that the raffle would take place next Sunday, March 11, at Slowacki's hall. Admission will be free. The raffle will begin at 3 P.M. All those having raffle tickets should be present.</p>
