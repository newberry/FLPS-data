   <p>The following letter has been received for publication in Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"The Fair in St. Hedwig's parish will be officially opened on August 5 in the evening. The Fair is being held for profit as well as for pleasure, the profits being dedicated to the church, and more especially, the rectory. Since it is the sincerest desire of St. Hedwig's parish to accomplish its purposes, it invites, through the medium of Dziennik Chicagoski, all of its neighbors to attend the Fair's opening night, for which a parade has been planned. The Fair will continue for about two weeks. We have prepared many surprises for those who attend: in general, we have tried to introduce as much variety as possible. We hope that these considerations, as well as the worthy purpose of our Fair, will gain it the support of all who have the good of our parish at heart.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1608.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, we invite all of our countrymen, promising that they shall be well received and that all of their expectations shall be satisfied.</p>
