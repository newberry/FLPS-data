<title level="a"> THE QUESTION OF THE POLISH THEATRE IN CHICAGO</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>We Poles are a cultural nation; this we all know and so speak about us other friendly nations.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, here in America they do not think that of us. They ask what have we done in the field of development of our culture, what kind of literature do we have, music, painting, sculpture, and drama? Most naturally, we will say that we have all of these things and that they are developing among us beautifully. Next we will say that we have geniuses, dramatic writers, that our theatre stands very high. All of these are only words because we cannot make this evident to the masses over here in America. The Americans consider the Germans as a very cultural nation, because of the fact that they work diligently on universalizing their art. The Germans are bringing over well educated, literary persons, painters, sculptors, and through their efforts these transported artists give lectures on German culture. The Germans also <pb facs="5423968_5_0555.jpg" n="2"/>have their own theatre in Chicago. It is not just a mediocre type of theatre. There they stage very prominent works of art, these works point out the German talent and acquaint the Germans born over here with their parental literature.</p>
   <p>The German organizations maintain a theatre, have assessed every member and today have an advantageous cultural outpost. How the Germans care about the theatre is demonstrated by the fact that the German ambassador, Dr. O. L. Wieldfeld, arrived in Chicago yesterday and did not fail to visit the cultural outpost. The English newspapers immediately trumpeted the news and published photographs of the occasion.</p>
   <p>Will we ever acquire our own theatre? THat thought has long ago affected profoundly the minds of the better part of our society, but somehow we cannot all get together and establish such an outpost. You know <pb facs="5423968_5_0556.jpg" n="3"/>that our literature is not worse than the German and the drama and music even more beautiful. All we need is action and we can give America the opportunity to acquaint itself with the pearls of our art. Did we ever hear played anywhere at some concert the works of our musicians and composers outside of Chopin and Wieniawski? No, and nevertheless our music is even praised by the Germans. Karlowicz, Noskowski, Zelenski and Rozycki are known well in Western Europe, and likewise many others. We have neglected ourselves a bit. However, with good desires an evil can be remedied quickly.</p>
