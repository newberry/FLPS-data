  <body>
   <p>Yesterday evening, the Polish businessmen of St. Stanislaus parish met in the school hall near Bradley Street in the interests of Polish Day. Although attendance was relatively small, important results were achieved.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Vincent Barzynski presided over the meeting. Speeches were made by Chairman S. Slominski, J. Lisztewnik, Fr. Wleklinski, [P.] Arkuszewski, J. Gniot, J. Mucha, Judge [M.A.]La Buy, and others. It was decided to take up a voluntary collection immediately, and to appoint a collection committee which would solicit funds from businessmen not present at the meeting. F. Wleklinski was unanimously elected treasurer for the community.</p>
   <p>The voluntary collection yielded $175. The collection committee, which will solicit funds from neighborhood businessmen and from anyone else desiring to <pb facs="5423968_5_1507.jpg" n="2"/>contribute, included the following: F. Fuhl, T. Gordon, F. Wleklinski, W. Grabarski, J. Chrapkowski, J. Suwalski, Judge La Buy, and S. Piasecki. They have been formally authorized to collect money for Polish Day. All money will be placed into the hands of the treasurer, Mr. Wleklinski. The businessmen decided to hold another meeting next Friday, September 8, in the same hall.</p>
   <p>Thus, a beginning has already been made; the matter will undoubtedly make rapid progress from this point onward. We have hopes that by next Friday, the total contributions will be at least ten times the sum collected at yesterday's meeting.</p>
   <p>Last-minute information reaches us that F. Fuhl has already collected the following contributions:</p>
   <p>The total sum collected, including the money collected at yesterday's meeting, <pb facs="5423968_5_1508.jpg" n="3"/>is now $215. If other collectors will be as conscientious as Mr. Fuhl, there is no doubt that St. Stanislaus Kostka parish will be worthily represented.</p>
