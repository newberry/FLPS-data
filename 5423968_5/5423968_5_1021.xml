   <p>The Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish Polish Dramatic Club presented a historical drama--"Renegat" (Renegade) yesterday afternoon at the school hall on Bradley Street. The public was evidently very much interested in the play, for it paid great attention and remained very quiet, for which it deserves praise.</p>
   <p>The amateurs, also, deserve credit. It may be said that they played in a professional manner, which revealed they had done their best to learn their roles and were following to the letter the stage director's instructions. The first act made a deep impression on the audience. It was acted with grace, which is rare on amateur stages. Other acts were also played splendidly. In her short but tragic role of "Kasztelanowa Zminska" (Lady Zminski, wife of a Polish castellan), Miss Zukowski thrilled the audience. Mrs. Jozwiakowski, as "Helen," charmed her listeners during the entire play.</p>
   <p>In the masculine roles were J. Grabowiecki, as "Lutowidzki"; Jozwiakowski, as <pb facs="5423968_5_1022.jpg" n="2"/>"Zenon" and "Waclaw"; Klafta, as "Stanislaus"; Nering, as "Walenty"; Szajkowski, as a doctor; Studzinski, as "Dabrowa"; Oszwaldowski as a secretary; and Wieckowski, as "Lisocki." The play was a hit. These amateurs played their roles so well that each was cheered and applauded. There were also other less important roles, but even these were in the hands of experienced amateurs.</p>
   <p>The Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish Polish Dramatic Club has demonstrated again that a good stage director can mold first-class amateurs, and we hope that, as one play succeds the other, the acting will satisfy even the most severe critics.</p>
