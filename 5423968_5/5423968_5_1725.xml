<title level="a">FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF LITERARY CIRCLE OF HOLY TRINITY PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>On April 2, the Literary Circle reached its fifteenth year of existence and work in the educational field. During this time, in spite of all obstacles, the Circle has given proof of the value of its work and has lived up to the purpose for which it was organized on April 2, 1902, by Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, its first director. During this time and according to circumstances, the Circle's public appearances have differed from one another both in the quality of the programs and the success of their presentation. At any rate, the efforts made by the Circle in the direction of spreading enlightenment and education among our young people have not been without meaning or good influence. Thanks to the Circle many young men have preserved their Polish language, spirit, and traditions. All have had the opportunity of becoming better acquainted with the Christian culture of the Poles, which is so lofty and beautiful. Lectures, speeches, songs, music, comedies, and dramas--all have a niche in the composite Polish mind and heart, and have enlightened and united us into one national organism called Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1726.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the past few years the Circle has allowed itself to yield to the temptation of presenting such classical works as H. Sienkiewicz's "Quo Vadis," J. Slowacki's "Lilla Weneda," Sigismund Krasinski's "Irydyon," and Adam Mickiewicz's "Dziady" (Forefather's Eve). This is an obvious sign that the Circle has not deviated from its motto of "Go Forward and Light the Way."</p>
   <p>It was fitting, therefore, for the Circle to celebrate its fifteenth anniversary, and for this purpose it set apart April 22. At 9 A. M. a Mass was said as a thanksgiving to God for his blessings and to ask Him for strength and guidance for further efforts. In the evening a play, "Victim of Suspicion," was presented at St. Stanislaus Kostka parish hall.</p>
   <p>For the first time in its existence, the Circle presented on this occasion a serious drama based on modern trends and of rather broad proportions. It is possible that this was the first time that anything like it had been presented on the Polish stage. At any rate the Circle tried its strength in a new field.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1727.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There can be no question as to the successful completion of its undertaking. The Circle again showed itself worthy of its calling, as it has always done. The play was a success in every respect.</p>
   <p>The cast could not have been better. All the leading characters, such as "Isabel," "Francis Lowicz," "Christopher Lubomirski," "Cornelia Lubomirski," and "Barbara Morsztyn," all demanding talent, were played according to the requirements of the author.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the good memory of the actors, their excellent poise and freedom of movement on the stage, and the able direction of the play, the action unfolded smoothly.</p>
   <p>Superior dramatic acting, presenting the entire gamut of human emotion, from hearty laughter to the most sensitive nuances of the wounded heart of an unfortunate mother, was given first place. The naturalness of the acting drew and held the sympathies of the audience. Rarely do actors so control the emotions of an audience as to be able in one moment to carry it from <pb facs="5423968_5_1728.jpg" n="4"/>hearty laughter to child-like weeping. This was accomplished by the members of the Circle under the direction of Francis Peska, our well-known attorney.</p>
   <p>The play must have made a deep impression on the audience, since on going home many people expressed the wish that it be repeated. Whether this will be done depends on the decision of the Circle.</p>
   <p>Although all the actors played very well, special recognition is due Miss J. Kempski (Isabel), Mr. Justin Jankowski (Lowicz), Miss Clara Dymek (Cornelia), Mr. Victor Stelnicki (Lubomirski), and Miss Eugenia Pilitowski (Barbara).</p>
   <p>Besides the presentation of the play, the Circle issued a Fifteenth Anniversary Brochure, which contains the history of the Circle, literary works of members, and a small section of humor. This brochure is offered in a very nice, artistic form and can be purchased at the rectory of Holy Trinity Parish.</p>

   <p>P. S. The music was furnished by the Circle's orchestra under the direction of the Orlowski Brothers and the furniture was supplied by the Perlowski Brothers. Our sincere thanks to them.</p>
   <p>S. V. I.</p>
