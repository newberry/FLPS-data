<title level="a">IMPRESSIONS FROM THE CONCERT GIVEN BY THE FIRST POLISH MILITARY BAND</title></bibl>

   <p>It was indeed a heartbreaking sight--the practically empty Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall at the concert given by the first real Polish military band, which consists of Polish soldiers who are not playing for money but for soldiers' pay. Can this be why the hall was empty? Or is it because its conductor, Wasilewski, did not appear under some high-sounding foreign name? Or finally, is it because he does not demand a salary of $300 a week and the musicians are not paid from $35 to $50 weekly?</p>
   <p>It is not my intention here to delve into the causes for the public's coolness; it is not the public's fault, and it is up to the press to look into those causes as soon as possible. The Poles here are beginning to complain quite loudly, and the voice of the people must of necessity be heard, or the peoples' generosity to the Polish cause will flag, as the empty seats at Union Hall testified. Does it not hurt these boys of ours who practiced for a long time, <pb facs="5423968_5_0637.jpg" n="2"/>confident that Chicago Polonia would attend their concert en masse and by this alone encourage them to further effort?</p>
   <p>When I donated some music for the band to Conductor Wasilewski, he pointed out to me that the instruments were beneath criticism. I looked over a few of them and saw that they were of the cheapest conceivable make, these instruments for which the monstrous sum of 800 was supposed to have been paid. I can only marvel that these boys are able to get any musical tones out of such "junk". As an authority, I can say that nearly all of the instruments are out of tune. Under such conditions (cracked clarinets), our soldiers deserve great credit for having been able to do what experienced musicians would not have been able to accomplish.</p>
   <p>Thanks are due to the National Department, which has agreed to purchase new instruments for the band; probably all Polonia will applaud this as a worthwhile deed. If I were allowed to be a member of the committee for the purchase of instruments, I could, as a professional musician and conductor, be of help <pb facs="5423968_5_0638.jpg" n="3"/>to the committee in the selection of instruments. At the same time, I could save it several hundred dollars, foregoing any possible profit to myself, by purchasing instruments at wholesale rather than retail prices. In addition, I myself, or rather my music publishing firm, will provide gratis as much music as Conductor Wasilewski requests, even if this should amount to a considerable sum.</p>
   <p>Let me appeal once more to Chicago Polonia for the largest possible attendance at the concerts of this first real Polish military band, for these are real soldiers, who, when the order comes, are ready to lay aside their instruments, and, rifles in hand, bury their bayonets in the breasts of our greatest enemies, the Germans, thus helping to free Poland from its age-old oppressor.</p>
   <p>B. J. Zalewski,</p>
   <p>Director of Polish choral and orchestral groups in Chicago.</p>
