   <p>Joseph E. Chapek, the well - known violinist, was born in Chicago, and received his musical education here, under the direction of his father, Professor Joseph H. Chapek, eminent violin pedagogue. He grew up in an atmosphere of music, and as a young boy was noted for his artistic violin playing, appearing as soloist in many concerts and recitals.</p>
   <p>He became professor of violin at the Chicago Conservatory of Music and later, at the Chapek music conservatory, 3350 Broadway, Chicago. Mr. Chapek spent the seasons of 1926 and 1927 in Europe, where he devoted his time to further study; appearing as soloist in some of the principal cities. Professor Otokar Sevcik, of the Budapest conservatory, said: "He is an excellent violinist and a remarkable teacher." Professor Henry Feld of the Prague conservatory of Music highly complimented Mr. Chapek's excellent technique and said that in the study of his concert repertoire he displayed great talent and musical understanding.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday evening, March 28th, at 8:00 P.M., Mr. Chapek will be heard in a violin recital at the Kimball Hall, 306 South Wabash Ave.</p>
