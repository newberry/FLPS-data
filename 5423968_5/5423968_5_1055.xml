   <p>"The Three Rogues," presented by the St. Cecelia Society for the benefit of the Kosciusko Memorial Fund, was a noteworthy success. The hall where the performance was given was filled to capacity, and it is expected that the amount to be contributed to the fund will exceed one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>The performance of this very entertaining melodrama was excellent. The players Czekala, Huntowski, and Mroczkowski--who were in charge of the three principal roles--acted their parts with professional skill.</p>
   <p>The rest of the cast had very little opportunity to display any talent, but the performance as a whole was above reproach.</p>
   <p>The play was directed by Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, and the music was conducted by Mr. [A.] Kwasigroch.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1056.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The play was preceded by an acrobatic act by Mr. Trojanowski. Mr. Trojanowski is undoubtedly a master of his art, but, in all truth, we believe that had his act been omitted, the performance would have lost nothing.</p>
