   <p>(We have received the following correspondence, with a request that it be published.)</p>
   <p>We wish, herewith, to notify the Polish public that the grand picnic of the Polish Societies in Chicago (to be held July 4, at Schuetzen's Park, for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument) will be a grand success.</p>
   <p>The following societies have signified that they will participate in the affair: Saint Florian Society (Holy Trinity Parish); Polish Cabinetmakers' and Carpenters' Society; Polish Tailors' Society; Pulaski Court, No. 482, Catholic Order of Foresters; King Menceslaus Society; Saint Joseph Society; Holy Cross Society; Adam Mickiewicz Society; Polish Commune; Polish Cavalry; Saint Cecelia Society (from the Saint Stanislaus Kostka parish); Polish Commune, No. 1; First Branch of the Polish Young Men's Alliance of America; Ag. (sic) Giller Society; Polish Shoemakers' Society; Pulaski Guard; T. Dzialyneki Society.</p>

   <p>The main committee has asked the following members of the Polish Cavalry to help: Mr. Frank Kwasigroch, Mr. Andrew Szulc, and Mr. August J. Kowalski; all three men have accepted the invitation, and have agreed to help as much as possible.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting, the committee reported that they had called on Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who was asked for his help and support.</p>
   <p>The Committee was assured that vigorous support would be given to this cause.</p>
   <p>Another special committee visited Reverend John Kasprzycki, who announced that he would like to see the monument built as soon as possible--he is certain that his parishioners will help the cause along.</p>
   <p>Other special committees visited the pastors of Saint Adalbert's, Saint Hedwig's, the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and other parishes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1268.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A subcommittee was chosen in the Saint Stanislaus Kostka parish to give all the help possible to the picnic committee. The following were elected to this subcommittee: Mr. J. Nering, Mr. T. Krolik, Mr. St. Czajka, Mr. J. Mucha, Mr J. Czekala, Mr. T. Suwalski, and Mr. V. Bardonski.</p>
   <p>In other parishes also, subcommittees will be selected, and they will be given all necessary information by the main committee.</p>
   <p>Collectors' receipt books were distributed to the following: Mr. F. Kwasigroch, Mr. S. Wojtalewicz, Mr. A. X. Centella, Mr. And. Szulc, Mr. I. Pulkowski, Mr. A. Kowalski, Mr. St. Mallek, and Mr. Lejman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Szulc has already collected fifty dollars, and Mr. Pulkowski announced that the A. Mickiewicz Society had purchased twenty-five tickets and paid for them at once, as a donation.</p>
   <p>Meetings of this committee are held every Friday in Mr. A. Szulc's hall on Noble <pb facs="5423968_5_1269.jpg" n="4"/>Street.</p>
