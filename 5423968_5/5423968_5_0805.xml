  <body>
   <p>The concert of the Nowicki Brothers Orchestra took place yesterday at three o'clock in the afternoon in the large Bradley Street Hall. The program featured a few solo numbers, as well as the Saint Cecilia Male Choir of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish. From an artistic viewpoint, the performance was a success.</p>
   <p>The thirty-piece orchestra played a number of selections, among them "Coronation March", by Meyerbeer; a group of Polish melodies by Troszla, and "Awakening of the Lion," by Katski. The "Boar Hunting Scene"--an original piece, accompanied by singing, shouting, and shooting--pleased the audience so much that a part of it was repeated. Mr. Crane's cornet solo was greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>There were only two vocal numbers on the program. Two extra numbers on the program--"Spring," and Troszla's "Mazurek"--were sung by Miss Wanda Barwig, who, together with Mr. Kondziorski, also sang a part from the opera "Halka".</p>

   <p>There was no end to the applause and shouting, for our amateurs sang like accomplished artists.</p>
   <p>Miss Barwig was presented with a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>The audience, although not too numerous, was well pleased. It is hoped that we will be able to attend more of these performances and that future concerts will draw larger audiences of music lovers.</p>
