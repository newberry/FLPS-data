<title level="a">CONCERT OF CHOPIN CHOIR.</title></bibl>

   <p>A concert of the universally popular and well-liked Chopin Choir No. 1 was held last Sunday evening. The large hall of the Polish R. C. Union was filled to capacity. This proved that the Chopin Choir is enjoying support and interest among the Poles in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The program was composed of ten numbers. Four of these were taken up by the Chopin Singers alone, rendering choir compositions with great artistry, color and full of emotion.</p>
   <p>The rest of the program was composed of solo appearances. An excellent selection from the opera, "Il Trovatore" was rendered by Professor Rybowiak, leader of the Chopin Choir and Miss Martha. Szlachiciak, well-known singer. Mr. Casimir Jasinski, who played the composition "Canson A Boire" from the ballet "Fiametta" on the cello violin, received a thunderous applause. Mr. M. Gaworski and Mr. Nowakowski <pb facs="5423968_5_0397.jpg" n="2"/>rendered selections from the opera "Verdi".</p>
   <p>With the greatest of enthusiasm, however, was received the appearance of Miss Sophia Maciejewski, who sang arias from the opera "La Traviata". Miss Maciejewski has seldom appeared on the Polish stage. Her appearance, however, so overcame the public, that whenever in the future she decides to appear among us, she will always be welcomed with enthusiasm and recognition as one of the best of our Polish singers in America.</p>
