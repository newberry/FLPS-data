   <p>When the historical drama, "The Siege of Czestochowa," written by Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, was presented on our stage, everyone who had an opportunity to see it said that not only was it the most beautiful play ever presented on the Polish amateur stage in Chicago, but that it would be hard to produce another play like it or a better one. In the meantime, the great success of the play, "The Children of Israel," which has been presented at the Polish hall on Bradley Street, has proved that the author himself did not agree with these opinions, for he has written and--with the help of the Polish Dramatic Club--presented a drama which was a still greater success.</p>
   <p>The unusual talent of Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, which has already gained him recognition in Europe, brought him fame again here in America, although in a different field, for, on account of different conditions, he is obliged to write dramas based on the life of common people. This talent, <pb facs="5423968_5_1101.jpg" n="2"/>combined with genuine diligence, triumphed last night.</p>
   <p>The large audience was indeed charmed and enraptured. This was proved by the great attention displayed by the whole audience--young and old--by continuous applause, and by the great enthusiasm with which the author of the play was greeted when he appeared in the last scene in the role of "Jacob". Last night, our public discovered and proved what it wants from Polish dramatic clubs and what kind of plays it enjoys and desires to see. Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, on the other hand, deserves much credit for writing a drama which pleased the public so immensely and which probably will triumph on the Polish stage in the United States.</p>
   <p>The plot of this drama is known very well; it is the Biblical story of Joseph, who was sold by his brothers, and who was elevated in Egypt. The details of the story were arranged with such accuracy and are so unusually beautiful in ever respect that no other play like it can be found in Polish literature.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1102.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Polish Dramatic Club presented this drama under the personal supervision of the author of the play himself. Almost eighty persons took part in this play, and every one of them was greatly impressed with the importance of his or her task. Under capable supervision, the play was staged excellently, although the amateurs did not have much time for preparation, and last night the drama was presented on the stage by the Dramatic Club.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, lack of space prevents us from fully describing even some of the details that come under our pen about last night's wonderful performance. However, we will suggest that everyone should acquire a copy of this play, which has been published and is already offered for sale at the bookstores. We regret that due to lack of space, we cannot mention the name of every actor, though each of them deserves praise. This also refers to the author, for our words cannot express our great admiration for his achievement.</p>
   <p>We also wish to point out that the musical portion of the play was composed <pb facs="5423968_5_1103.jpg" n="4"/>by our well-known organist, Mr. Andrew Kwasigroch. As a jeweler enjoys the work of setting a fine gem, so, in our opinion, Mr. Andrew Kwasigroch must have enjoyed his gratuitous work of helping Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz create his drama, and thus to contribute to make this play a success.</p>
   <p>In order to name those actors who distinguished themselves, we must mention the most important role, that of young "Joseph". This role was played by Mr. Vincent Jozwiakowski, whom we like to mention whenever we write about the Dramatic Club. This young man has a very promising future, because, on account of his patriotism and love for the Polish language and literature, he is a beautiful example to our youth, and last night he proved it. The author himself played the role of old Jacob. It was indeed thrilling to watch the actors as they observed every move of their master, as they strove to reach the level, not of his ability, but of his emotional depth. The sons of Jacob and his beautiful daughter (Miss Frances Bock) played their parts well. Miss Bock's acting was superb: no actress could have played her role any better. Other roles were also played well.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1104.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The play was a great success and the public was charmed. The author, who indicated to us the mission of the Polish stage in America, celebrated a triumph last night. It was a beautiful moment and many would have envied him if they did not love him.</p>
