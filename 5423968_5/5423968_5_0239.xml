   <p>(We have received the following correspondence with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>Our newly organized Polish Painters' Union is growing stronger right along. On March 3 of this year, we received our charter from Springfield, Illinois, and immediately thereafter we elected a permanent set of officers. They are as follows: Casimir Brukwicki, president; Stanislaus Jankowski, vice-president; A. G. Weight, recording secretary; Stanislaus Uznanski, financial secretary; K. Barwig, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The regular meetings of the union will be held in Lisztewnik's Hall, at 589 Dickson Street.</p>
   <p>We cordially invite our countrymen painters, who have not yet joined this <pb facs="5423968_5_0240.jpg" n="2"/>union but who would like to belong to it, to come to our next meeting on March 21, at the above-mentioned hall. This is the last opportunity to join at the low initiation fee of only $2.50. After March 21 the initiation fee will be fifteen dollars.</p>
   <p>We invite every Polish painter to join our Union now and take advantage of this low initiation fee.</p>
   <p>Polish painters! Act while there is yet time. Let us all take into consideration our own business and the benefits accruing from it. Let us organize so that we will not be left behind the others.</p>
   <p>A. G. Weight,</p>
   <p>recording secretary.</p>
