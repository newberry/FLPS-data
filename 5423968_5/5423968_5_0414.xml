   <p>On the Northwest Side of our city, near the Polish section of Avondale, lives our eminent compatriot, honorably known to Poles all over America, Mme. Rose Kwasigroch. People of other nationalities call her the "Polish nightingale". She was born in Chicago, the daughter or Peter Kiolbasa; her father, one of the most eminent Poles in America, was at one time treasurer or our city.</p>
   <p>She received her elementary education at St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish school; later she attended the Sacred Heart of Jesus Academy, situated near the Chicago Cathedral. Her interest in music and her love for it were awakened by the Notre Dame Sisters. They gave her the elementary principles of the theory of music and singing. Later, because of the enthusiastic encouragement and praise of Mr. Stanislas Szwajkart, then editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, she enrolled at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors. She continued her vocal studies with such out-standing <pb facs="5423968_5_0415.jpg" n="2"/>singers as Edward D. Reszke, Bradrowski, Mme. Sembrich-Kochanska, and others, during their brief stays in Chicago. Her other famous teachers were such noted singers of the Chicago Opera Company as Messrs. Herman Devries and Maurice Devries and Mme. O. Fox. One can say without fear of contradition that she received the finest instruction in the theory of music and in voice production.</p>
   <p>Her first public appearance was in the Auditorium under the Direction of the noted teacher and conductor, Theodore Thomas. She sang an aria from the opera "Mignon". All the receipts were given to the Alexian Brothers Hospital. Later she took part in many concerts, but the receipts were always given to charitable institutions, such as the Polish hospital [St. Mary's Hospital], St. Hedwig's day nursery, the fund for Polish war victims, the Iroquois Memorial organization, and many others. She also sang in other cities; in New York City she appeared in the Terrace Garden. Her repertoire includes many operas; among them are "Lucia di Lammermoor," "Mignon," "Lohengrin," and "Il Trovatore". Mme. Rose Kwasigroch could have had a <pb facs="5423968_5_0416.jpg" n="3"/>career in grand opera were it not for the fact that she married Francis A. Kwasigroch, a substation postmaster, and because of her love for her family gave up her operatic work.</p>
   <p>She always has been and continues to be very active in our Polish community. She has sung with Polish parish choirs as soloist; for many years she was a soloist in the Chicago Cathedral. Her recitals are always successful.</p>
   <p>She is an honorary member of the Polish Singers' Alliance; she also belongs to many other Polish and non-Polish organizations. Her marriage has been blessed with five children, now all married and well established. Many of her vocal successes are recorded on Victor records; they are thirty in number. Mme. Kwasigroch lives at 2651 North Kimball Avenue.</p>
