   <p>Immediately after the inception of the Dramatic Club by the patriotic organization a special meeting was held last night in order to get into productive activity as soon as possible. After the reading of the constitutional amendments, the members enthusiastically proclaimed that this club will now be given an opportunity to expand. All stated that they will put a special effort into their work in order to make this an outstanding organization.</p>
   <p>The members made a motion for plans to be made for staging a play as soon as possible. It was agreed to produce "Children of Israel" during the latter part of this month. This play will be given as a token of appreciation to the Polish Patriotic organization for their ratification of the constitution. The proceeds will go for the upkeep of the hall.</p>
   <p>The members pledged their best support for they want their initial effort to <pb facs="5423968_5_1083.jpg" n="2"/>be one of the finest. Roles given to the various actors have been accepted. However, this coming Sunday a meeting will be held to make certain that all are satisfied with their parts.</p>
   <p>It is understood that the author, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, has made some changes in the play which have made the entire story more interesting.</p>
