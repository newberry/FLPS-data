   <p>The program staged yesterday by the school children of St. Stanislaus Mostka Parish, under the direction of the Sister's of Notre Dame, proved to be a success. The exercises were given in honor of the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor, for whom the day was named. When the pastor approached the auditorium with his escort he was greeted with loud applause by the school children. The program was opened with a march of welcome, played by the Misses F. Ostrowska, <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and K. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> at the piano. Other parts of the program were filled with songs, recitations in Polish and English, drills, and various other musical number A dramatic sketch in three acts was also enacted. Both the girls and the boys gave outstanding performances.</p>
   <p>Every number on the entertainment program was rendered in perfect order. This smoothness indicated that the <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> training the school children receive from their teachers, as well as the special guidance, is given with understanding. The capacity crowd spent an enjoyable evening. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> was an agreeable surprise <pb facs="5423968_5_0768.jpg" n="2"/>to them. There was not one dull moment throughout the program, although it was rather long and did not conclude till quite late.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Vincent Barzynski and the Sisters of Notre Dame can be justly proud of the parish school and the performance of the pupils. All the exerted efforts were not wasted, for the fruits were abundant. And this is something of which all Poles in Chicago should be proud.</p>
   <p>May God continue to bless the efforts of the Catholic priest-and Pope.</p>
