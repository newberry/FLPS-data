   <p>The following article was received by the Dziennik Chicagoski for publication:</p>
   <p>Present day conditions are indeed trying for Polish Catholics in America. The attack on the Polish Catholic Church in this country is reducing us to a state of despair and deep sorrow--but it is in this hour of need that we should not abandon our energetic work and we should support every rising Catholic church, every Polish parish, especially those in which the parishioners are honest and have a desire to save their souls.</p>
   <p>A new Polish church, St. Hyacinth, was erected in the Avondale community recently. The parishioners' wish for a permanent pastor was granted.</p>
   <p>Besides the work in service for God, work has been begun amid the Polish youth of this community. The children are overwhelmingly happy to have the Sisters of Nazareth in charge of the local Polish school. These same nuns are making <pb facs="5423968_5_1005.jpg" n="2"/>plans to establish a kindergarden for four and five-year-old children. A school of this kind will be invaluable. Parents who wish to send their children to such a school are requested to get in touch with the Sisters of Nazareth for further details.</p>
   <p>First steps relative to or organizing the St. Hyacinth Parish have been taken. Despite the success of this initial move the St. Hyacinth Church is in dire stress. A great deal of help is required to maintain the steps taken. In this respect the members of this parish have told me "The Poles of Chicago will aid us." Because of this I have completed plans for the presentation of a play for the benefit of St. Hyacinth Church, which will be staged on Sunday, September 8. St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish has graciously granted us the free use of the school hall on Bradley Street. It is expected that this occasion will receive the full support and patronage of the Poles.</p>
   <p>The finest Polish amateurs have been secured for the play, and they have given their services free of charge. A Polish orchestra has also volunteered <pb facs="5423968_5_1006.jpg" n="3"/>its services.</p>
   <p>Because of the careful plans made for the play and the distinguished cast of amateur players taking part in it. I anticipate a capacity crowd at this benefit performance.</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph Gieburowski,</p>
   <p>Pastor of St. Hyacinth Parish.</p>
