  <body>
   <p>The Polish Social Club, presented two comedies on the stage of Walsh's Hall yesterday. "Walka O Meza" (Battle for a Husband), a one-act comedy, was translated and localized from the French by Countess Lubienska. Its portrayal on the stage made a great hit with the audience. All the roles were enacted with professional finesse. This play, although all the parts go to the ladies, is worthy of repetition. The parts were characterized by Countess Lubienska, and Mesdames Bardonska, R. Modrzejewska, Butkiewicz and Barszczewska.</p>
   <p>The second play "Dobry Numer" (Good Number) brought recollections of Fredro's old "Nikt Mnie Nie Zna" (Nobody Knows Me). This comedy was also acted in good style. The two leading roles were executed admirably by Z. Brodowski and J. F. Smulski. Other parts were taken by Messrs. Butkiewicz, J. J. Chrzanowski and Slubicki; the lesser roles, by Miss Louise Szwajkart and Miss Kossowska, were well done. The stage director was Dr. Czupka.</p>
