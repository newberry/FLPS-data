   <p>Since one of the purposes of the Polish University Club consists in helping students of Polish extraction to obtain a university education, and to foster better social contact among Polish students in general, the Polish University Club realized that some worthwhile recognition is due the Polish graduates. They therefore decided to sponsor the first annual dinner which will be held at the City Club of Chicago, 315 Plymouth Ct., on Thursday, June 28, 1928, at 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>The following is a list of the Polish graduates: A. Beckett, C. Biegalski, C. Buczynski, Z.A. Czeslawski, A. Felik, H. Gierat, J. Golosiniec, L. A. Kulczynski, S. Kusper, I. Kupczynski, B. J. Korzeniewski, S. A. Lesniewski, M. Mlotek, T. Olechowski, B. Pierzynski, J. Sokolowski, A. Szulczynski, A. L. Tchinski, J. Ulis, F. Wiza, J. Wegrzyn and N. Zulinski. It is probable that some of the names many have been omitted, because of the difficulty of segregating all Polish graduates. A careful check, however, is being made by the dinner committee; and we are hoping that the entire list shall be completed prior to June 28, 1928.</p>
   <p>Besides the aforementioned the Polish University Club will honor three men, who, in their chosen professions have served the Polish people in a <pb facs="5423968_5_1684.jpg" n="2"/>remarkable manner.</p>
   <p>These three men will receive the Key of honor, of the Polish University Club, the highest award this organization can offer, in appreciation for the wonderful work they have done, and are still doing, for the benefit of Polish communities. The men who are to receive the Golden Key are to remain incognito at this present writing.</p>
   <p>The dinner will be informal. Reservations may be made by applying to Henry Dankowski, chairman, 1935 West Division Street.</p>
