   <p>The Standard Coffin and Casket Mfg. Co. is a Polish corporation which was established five years ago. Despite its many difficulties, the firm has grown very rapidly and is now a very successful business institution, of which we are proud; not only its founders and share holders, but also the whole Polish community shares this sentiment. One of the great barriers in the development of this concern was the lack of necessary capital; and were it not for the new individuals who came to its rescue with financial aid, it would still be struggling for a mere existence.</p>
   <p>The business has progressed so rapidly that it was necessary to buy a larger and more suitable building which is located at Chicago Ave. and Carpenter Sts. This structure is to be converted into a first class coffin factory, and will be open for business on May, the first. Mr. Joseph Magdziarz is its president.</p>
