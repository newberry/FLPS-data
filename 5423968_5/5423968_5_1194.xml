   <p>The Leszek Bialy group of Holy Trinity Parish, a member of the Polish Falcons Alliance and affiliated with the Polish National Alliance, held a banquet to celebrate the winning of a silver cup by five of its members at the convention in South Bend.</p>
   <p>About two hundred people, men and women, attended the banquet at the parish hall, sitting down at heavily laden tables. These people constituted the well-known parishioners of Holy Trinity Parish, who sincerely support the activities of the Falcons, and are happy to see them progress.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Plucynski, president of the Leszek Bialy group, opened the banquet.</p>
   <p>Reverend L. Szybowicz, chaplain of the Falcons who are affiliated with the alliance, acting for Reverend K. Sztuczko, rector of Holy Trinity Parish, who was unable to attend because of the death of his brother, said grace, and then called upon Mr. Stephen Gorecki to act as toastmaster.</p>

   <p>After the sumptuous dinner, plentifully accompanied by excellent champagne and other beverages, a series of speeches were delivered, interspersed with wrestling matches by the seven-year-old Jakubczak twins. The little fellows certainly entertained the guests with their matches, which were carefully watched by the chief of the group Mr. W. Rajski.</p>
   <p>Antoinette Zebrowski played a violin solo; Adelina Gorecki sang a solo accompanied by Miss Zebrowski on the violin and Mr. A. Mallek on the piano. The Misses Lis sang a duet, and Miss Helen Kempska sang a solo. A dialogue was read by Miss M. Nowakowski and Mr. J. Ziolkowski.</p>
   <p>Excellent speeches, full of zeal for the Falcons cause, were given by Reverend L. P. Szybowicz, director; H. Lokanski, secretary of the Polish Falcons Alliance; Professor T. Sicmiradzki; Mr. Lesner, president of Circuit II; Mr. Zychlinski; Reverend S. Gruza, C. S. C.; T. Helinski and Brother Piatr. With the singing of "God Save Poland," the banquet was ended.</p>

   <p>This pleasant evening will remain in the memories of those who participated, and will surely bring in new members and friends to the Falcons.</p>
