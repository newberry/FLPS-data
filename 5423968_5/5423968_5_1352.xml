   <p>Although for quite some time we have not said anything about the work connected with the preparations for our participation in the Lwow Fair, this work is progressing very rapidly, with cash donations and exhibits coming in from everywhere. The Lwow Fair Central Committee, which has been working very energetically, will begin within a short time to ship the articles to be exhibited.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday the Lwow Fair Committee met again and settled many problems. Reverend T. Jakimowicz, who attended this meeting, furnished the Committee with all necessary information concerning the Polish churches in the United States.</p>
   <p>This valuable information, which will be used in statements, was gladly received, and the Committee thanked the informant by rising. Reverend T. Jakimowiez was made a member of the Committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1353.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Shipping of the exhibits to the Lwow Fair was entrusted to Mr. F. Bieszez, who has already made the necessary arrangements with several transportation companies and who promised to present a statement showing the cost of transportation.</p>
   <p>A special committee for arranging the photographs and contacting the Polish businessmen in Chicago was formed.</p>
   <p>This committee, which has already begun its work, consists of Mr. W. Smulski, Dr. Casimir Midowicz, Mr. H. Nagiel, Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, and Mr. L. Szopinski.</p>
   <p>We are submitting a new list of donations sent to the Lwow Fair Committee for the benefit of the Polish-American exhibition.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Klarkowski, financial secretary, received the following donations:</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Zulawski, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania sent $45. This sum was <pb facs="5423968_5_1354.jpg" n="3"/>collected by [Pittsburgh] church societies belonging to St. Adalbert's parish. They are listed as follows: St. Adalbert's Society, $15; St. Joseph's Society, $10; St. Ladislaus' Society, $10; Knights of St. Casimir, $5; Society of St. Anthony de Paul, $5.</p>
   <p>The Archbrotherhood of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, from Bay City, Michigan, sent $1.90.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Szopinsi received $20 from Reverend L. Szezepanski, of Wilmington, Pennsylvania. This sum was collected by church societies belonging to the Polish Parish in that city. The donations are listed as follows: St. Joseph's Society, $7; St. Stanislaus' Society, $3; Holy Frinity Society, $3; St. Hedwig's Knights, $2; Holy Rosary Society, $2; Polish Band, $1; Reverend L. Szczepanski, the pastor, $2.</p>
   <p>St. Casimir's National Society, Bay City, Michigan, sent $25.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1355.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Lwow Fair Committee in Philadelphia collected $40.</p>
   <p>Chicago Poles will contribute some furniture. Mr. Maximilian Marcinkowski will give a beautiful settee and a cushion. Mr. Zdziebloski is preparing samples of furniture. A number of cabinet-makers and carpenters desire to construct a large model of an American home. In other words, our Fair will be a success.</p>
   <p>Circulars containing information concerning churches, schools, societies, and Polish journals will be ready when the time comes. The report committee must have their notes ready before March 15. A few thousand copies of circulars containing descriptive material will be printed.</p>
   <p>The Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth are preparing a few beautiful articles for the exhibit at the Lwow Fair--one of them is a chasuble.</p>
   <p>Polish groups from other cities are sending large collections of articles, which will be sorted and sent to the Lwow Fair.</p>
