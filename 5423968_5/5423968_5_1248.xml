   <p>S. Czajka, Moszczynski, F. Kwasigroch, and Val. Wlerlinski.</p>
   <p>The transportation committee reported that the streetcar company promised to supply all the cars necessary on Elston Avenue, so the difficulty of getting to the grove is taken care of.</p>
   <p>It was decided to place signs at important intersections to indicate the transfer points.</p>
   <p>The Committee decided to extend a public invitation to all Polish priests and editors of Polish papers to take part in the festival.</p>
   <p>The fireworks committee reported that it had purchased seventy-five dollars' worth of fireworks for forty dollars.</p>
   <p>The societies from the Avondale district will join the parade at Elston and Western Avenues.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_5_1250.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Committee warns that all games of chance, sale of pictures, etc., for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument fund, must take place outside the grove.</p>
   <p>The marshals of the Holy Trinity and the St. John Cantius Societies will receive their badges a half hour before the start of the parade in front of the Zgoda offices, from Committeeman Centalla; the Societies of the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, the cyclists, the military societies, and all the other societies will receive badges from the president of the Committee, Mr. J. Polczynski, in Mr. Kaczmarek's store, 668 Noble Street, opposite the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church.</p>
   <p>This concluded the last meeting of the committee.</p>
   <p>The committee wishes to take this opportunity to urge all our countrymen to support this affair, so that the labors of the committee will not be in vain and that the Kosciusko monument can be built as soon as possible.</p>
