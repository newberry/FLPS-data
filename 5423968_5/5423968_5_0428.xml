<title level="a">YESTERDAY'S CONCERTS OF WRONSKI'S MILITARY BAND</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In accordance with a previously arranged program, two splendid concerts were presented yesterday by the Polish Military Band, under the direction and with the assistance of Thaddeus Wronski. The attendance at both concerts surpassed all expectations and hundreds of people had to be turned away for lack of seats.</p>
   <p>The first concert was held at the St. Hedwig Parish Hall on Tyndale Street, beginning punctually at 3:30 in the afternoon with a rendition of the Polish and American national anthems, while the Polish and American flags, were held by two young volunteers to the Polish Army on the front of the platform.</p>
   <p>The first part of the concert consisted of seven Polish ballads....which the audience rewarded with great applause. Next, the lights were lowered, and to the quiet accompaniment of the orchestra playing "Piesn Wieczorna" (The Evening Song) by Moniuszko, Wronski spoke on the misery and ruin in <pb facs="5423968_5_0429.jpg" n="2"/>Poland and of our fine Polish Army which has gone to fight for the freedom of our motherland..He spoke so emotionally that there were few people in the hall who did not have tears in their eyes.</p>
   <p>In part three of the program, Wronski sang a few melancholy Polish ballads to the accompaniment of the orchestra. The final number of the third part of the program, "From a Polish Village," delighted everyone. In it, all the barnyard noises, the barking of dogs, the croaking of frogs, the crying of children, the ringing of church bells, were skillfully imitated; the audience was so enthusiastic that it seemed there would be no end to the applause.</p>
   <p>After a short intermission, a film concerning the "May Campaign" [A million dollars for the Polish cause and ten thousand recruits for the Polish Army] was shown, and it was explained so eloquently by Wronski that surely everyone will support the noble efforts of the campaign's initiators.</p>

   <p>The next number was a dance, a Mazur, executed by four couples in Cracovian costumes. They danced so well that one felt like leaping upon the platform and dancing with them. As an encore, they repeated the number.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Wronski spoke again, explaining that his orchestra's only aim is patriotic agitation; for the extremely low price of admission can hardly cover transportation and other costs. Following this short speech the orchestra played a medley of Polish songs, bringing the concert to a close. The concert had a great effect upon the audience, and the general impression was that it was all too short.</p>
   <p>Acknowledgement is due to the Reverend Obyrtalz and the local citizens' committee for their aid in making the concert a success. We are sure that Wronski and his military band will receive the same enthusiastic welcome, which they richly deserve, wherever they go.</p>

   <p>The second concert was given at the St. Joseph's Parish Hall at 48th and South Paulina Streets. The fifteen hundred seats in the hall were all taken and many persons who came too late had to be turned away. The program of the concert was the same as the one given in St. Hedwig's Parish; evening concerts, however, are more effective. At the closes of the concert, A. Wolski, chief recruiting officer for Center II, delivered an address in which he urged the young men to enlist in the Polish Army and called upon the older people to contribute money to the cause. In conclusion, Wronski thanked the local pastors from the community of Town of Lake and the local Citizens' Committee with its president, B. Kowalewski, at the head, for their aid in making the concert a success. As a final number, the orchestra played a medley of Polish songs, after which the audience left for their homes with faith in a better future.</p>
   <p>Among the audience, we noticed the Reverend S. Cholewinski of St. Joseph's Parish, Reverend F. Karabasz of Sacred Heart Parish, and Reverend L. Grudzinski of St. John of God Parish; also, the Reverends J. Grzesinski, K. Pijanowski, <pb facs="5423968_5_0432.jpg" n="5"/>and others. In addition to a select public from Town of Lake, there were many people from other communities present, including Mrs. Harriet Smulski, Mrs. Antoinette Zebrowski-Perlowski, accompanied by her husband and mother; W. Szrojda, of the Central Citizens' Committee; W. Lubicz, vice-president of Circuit II, Polish Falcons' Alliance, and many others. As many persons remarked to one another, such concerts should be given oftener in Town of Lake.</p>
