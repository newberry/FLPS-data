   <p>When President Hoover first announced his proposal to the powers interested in a one year's moratorium, our nation as well as the nations across the Atlantic were dumbfounded. Since this was an unexpected move, the world had to be given time to try to understand it all. However, the news was followed by wild enthusiasm. Hoover was heralded as the man who saved the world from economic ruin.</p>
   <p>Stock markets of the world reacted promptly to the news from Washington. For the first time in years, lethargy and pessimism were dismissed. The optimistic attitude continued, since messages received from numerous capital cities indicated the favorable response to this program. Then came a period of negotiations with France, during which time the people began to show skepticism toward the plan.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0996.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One rumor was to the effect that English influence was directly responsible for the proposed moratorium. Also that English and American capitalists, who have loaned large sums of money to Germany, were behind this plan. It was suggested that they alone induced the President to propose the moratorium, thus guarding their own interests. Regardless of the fact that these rumors may not be inventions altogether, the benefits derived from a moratorium would nevertheless be greatly advantageous. If English and American capitalists would be protected against heavy losses resuiting from the acceptance of this plan, is it not plausible then that the economic life in both of these countries would be served equally as well? Another rumor is to the effect that the moratorium is an effective means of election propaganda. The moratorium, in the opinion of many, is no cure for our suffering economic life and the proposed moratorium is but a smoke screen intended for political propaganda. Mr. Hoover cannot be accused of such an act, however, since all during his administration, especially, since the great stock market crash of 1929, he has made many different <pb facs="5418474_4_0997.jpg" n="3"/>remarks in regard to the economic rehabilitation, showing an astounding lack of knowledge and logic as well. Mr. Hoover has developed into an idealogist, who lacks the qualifications of dealing with things in a realistically political way. On the other hand, the President has never made any declaration to the effect that the moratorium would be a universal cure for the economic ills. It is beyond doubt that Germany would be the immediate beneficiary from the proposed moratorium, which was designed to prevent Germany's economic disaster. This accomplished, there is no doubt that other nations will be benefited by this plan too. If Germany, which is the strongest enemy of Bolshevism, breaks down, the red peril is likely to spread all through Europe. The offer of the moratorium is to prevent this calamity. It would be fool's optimism to expect that all of a sudden depression would make its exit and would give way to a prosperity unequalled in history. Neither did Mr. Hoover promise that as the result of the moratorium.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0998.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The President's point was to show to the world that the German nation is suffering desperately from economic ills; also, that it is in no position to consider the Young Plan. Furthermore, if no assistance is forthcoming, it is bound to collapse. Another point made clear by Mr. Hoover was that Germany must be given a chance to survive. This is, however, only the beginning of action which will finally lead to the revision of the Young Plan, and also to the revision of the treaty. President Hoover deserves full credit for this splendid work.</p>
