   <p>Does Litsinger speak German? Can a fish swim? Edward R. Litsinger, the candidate for mayor of Chicago of the Deneen-Brundage Republican faction, proved yesterday before a distinguished audience, that he has a thorough command of the language of his parents. He gave a German speech in the Lincoln Turner Hall which was received enthusiastically by the audience.</p>
   <p>There were no exaggerations, but he did not conceal his qualifications either. Litsinger told of the days of his youth, of the days of privation and hard work, and of the subsequent better times. He expressed his willingness to serve Chicago as mayor.</p>
   <p>The meeting was arranged by the "German-American Litsinger-for-Mayor Club." Among other speakers were Capt. A. F. W. Siebel, president of the German Club, and Dr. William C. Teichmann, president of the Steuben Society.</p>
   <p>At other meetings, Litsinger reproached the police for their inactivity. At the West End Women's Club, Monroe Street and Ashland Avenue, 1,800 persons listened to his speech.</p>
