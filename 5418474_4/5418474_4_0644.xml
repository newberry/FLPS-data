  <body>
   <p>The Fire Ordinance with its seven sections at last, four months after the Great Fire has been printed...</p>
   <p>The Southside by five wards and a part of the 6th ward is inside the fire limits. This certainly goes much too far, and if section I is adopted as it now stands will probably lead to lawsuits... On the other hand the S. W. corner of the 5th and the N. W. corner of the 16th ward, up to now largely inhabited by Americans, remain outside the fire limits of many of the plot-owners. Some of the Aldermen, especially on the Southside are very dissatisfied and have permitted themselves to be understood that they expect the mayor to veto it. Alderman Holden averred that the Legislature would take the fire limit issue in hand, if the Alderman should pass the Ordinance over the veto of the mayor. This threat was received with ridicule.</p>
   <p>There will be many communications made and petitions presented next Monday night; perhaps there will be amendments and substitutes of which nobody so far has thought. The wards that have not yet made any remonstrances have still time till Monday evening.</p>
