   <p>Judge Eustace rejected the nomination of a delegate to the Constitutional Convention because the man was not eligible. The nomination was then offered to Caspar Butz. When he declined the honor, Mr. John Henry Muehlke was nominated. Neither Mr. Muehlke nor Mr. Butz, sought the nomination, but were requested to serve their German fellow citizens in the very important Constitutional Convention; and we sincerely hope that Mr. Muehlke will accept the responsibility. There can be no doubt that a German should be a member of this Convention in which a constitution is to be drawn up for the purpose of protecting the rights of not only the Germans, but of all citizens by adoption, when their civil or political interests are at issue, or to preserve the interests of the laboring classes and the businessmen when proposals regarding the all important bank-question are made.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0730.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Muehlke is not a politician, but an able business-man, and we are convinced that the interests of our German populace may be confidentially placed in his hands. We have often heard that the people do not want to have anything to do with politicians, and we are happy to note that the men who propose nominations chose a business-man. In accepting an office which he did not ask for but which was offered to him, Mr. Muehlke will prove that Germans are not as much bent on obtaining offices, as on preserving their rights and that there are business-men among them who are willing to sacrifice time and money, when the interests of their countrymen demand it.</p>
