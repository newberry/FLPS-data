   <p>The Redemption of Large Cities, title of Dr. Adler's lecture last night given before a select German audience. In 1876, Doctor Feliz Adler became the chief executive of those societies known in this country as the "Societies for Ethical Culture." The sole purpose of this organization is to help humanity to realize its duty toward society, family and government, and thus develop in each individual the urge to conform himself to a better and more essential life.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1348.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, as Dr. Adler pointed out, this does not mean the suppression of one corrupt political party in favor of another, which may promise much but do very little, as it may happen in many large cities. It must be a movement free of political connections and influence. All political or religious characteristics must be excluded from this movement. On the other hand, any individual, whether Catholic or Protestant, Democrat, Republican or Socialist, may join this movement. There is no doubt that the better element of our citizens, notwithstanding their conception of life or social position, has one common interest; namely: to have a clean <pb facs="5418474_4_1349.jpg" n="3"/>and orderly city, to protect life and property, to eradicate vice and to punish crime. The city administrations of most of our large cities are very much in need of improvement. This is especially true of Chicago. Every clear thinking citizen recognizes the danger, and insists that something must be done to bring about a change of conditions.</p>
   <p>Recognition of these undesirable state of affairs is already a step forward in the right direction. And, under proper guidance, a reform movement could shatter the old political organizations, which for the sake of plundering, try to dominate, and should therefore be defeated.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1350.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Dr. Adler has shown the way as may be found in the local news reports. Action is needed now. As in New York, all patriotic and upright citizens of Chicago should join this movement, and thus fight toward a final victory. Thousands of people no doubt are fully in accord with the suggestion, but unless they join forces against their common enemy, they will remain ineffective and powerless. Chicago will soon have a chance to declare itself for better conditions if the citizens will cooperate. City elections are before us; therefore, it is time to organize. Yesterday's meeting was an impetus to it. The city administration of Chicago has been very bad indeed during recent years, so much so that an investigation of city officials by a grand jury will compile the findings <pb facs="5418474_4_1351.jpg" n="5"/>and then proceed with the prosecution of the guilty, according to law.</p>
   <p>People are ruled by their own decree. If citizens are interested in taking part in a movement by which the standard of Public Administration would be raised, the standard will most assuredly be raised. But if no interest can be aroused, Chicago will sink deeper and deeper into that political mud-hole established by the Harrison Administration.</p>
