   <p>The report published exclusively by the Chicago Times yesterday morning, that city tax comptroller George Von Hollen has become a fugitive, leaving behind a deficit of at least $100,000 has created a general and painful surprise.</p>
   <p>Americans as well as Irish and Germans had absolute faith in his honesty. In 1871, when due to the great fire, the Germans had taken almost no part in the putting up of candidates, he was appointed tax comptroller by his American party friends and served as such under Medill. At that time, all the city taxes still went through his hands and it was easy for him to appropriate single accounts of $5,000 or $10,000 for his private speculations. After his reelection, when the city taxes went through the hands of the county treasurer, this would have hardly been possible. The manner in which he embezzled moneys entrusted to him, justifies the appellation: a second D. A. Gage. As Gage, so was Von Hollen prompted by ill-fated private speculations, to make loans from the accounts entrusted to him. As in the case of Gage, he had the intention to repay these loans, but instead of doing so, he felt compelled to make new loans. As Gage finally, he took to gambling <pb facs="5418474_4_1543.jpg" n="2"/>in the hope of clearing the debt. There is ground for the supposition, that the city editor of the Times was informed of the flight of Von Hollen, ahead of any other newspaper, on account of his close association with the gamblers.</p>
   <p>This embezzlement has been made possible, by the complete lack of supervision over the bookkeeping of the city tax comptroller. The best means to prevent a recurrence is the abolition of the now completely superfluous office of city tax comptroller.</p>
