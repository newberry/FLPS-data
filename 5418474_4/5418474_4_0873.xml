   <p>And now, after all, Matthias Benner is not Chicago's fire marshal! Barroom politicians predicted last Tuesday that the mayor would again oust Benner, although the council had reinstated him; but this rumor was not based on fact. Benner himself said to the mayor: "Thanks, I won't play ball any longer." And so the man resigned of his own accord, after the city's aldermen had reinstated him in a most imposing manner last Saturday evening--a political slap to Harrison. After the reinstatement, Benner served as fire marshal for only one day.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday, the mayor received a letter from the headquarters of the fire department which we reprint below:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0874.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chicago, July 16, 1879.</p>
   <p>"To Carter Harrison, Mayor of Chicago,</p>
   <p>"Esteemed sir:</p>
   <p>"In order to eliminate any friction which may exist between you, as the city's highest official, and the fire department, I herewith tender my resignation, which is voluntary and unsought, so that you may reorganize the department in a manner you deem best in the interest of the city. Simultaneously, with this I desire to assure you that I never questioned your authority or objected to your opinions, and that I had no intentions at any time of coming into conflict with the administration."</p>
   <p>(Signed) Matthias Benner,</p>
   <p>Fire Marshal.</p>
   <p>The mayor accepted the resignation, and appointed Assistant Fire Marshal <pb facs="5418474_4_0875.jpg" n="3"/>D. J. Swenie to take charge of the fire department until further notice.....</p>
   <p>A reporter of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung interviewed Benner about an hour after he had resigned. The marshal was at headquarters, his insignia laid on a table, and he was awaiting the arrival of Swenie. Benner said to the reporter:</p>
   <p>"You would like to know Why I resigned. You can see I am quite contented, and I believe that I proceeded in the proper anner."</p>
   <p>"But," said the reporter, "You did not indicate yesterday that you victory, the reinstatement based on the decision of the city council, would be of such short duration."</p>
   <p>Benner replied: "I could not state my intentions at the time. The aldermen <pb facs="5418474_4_0876.jpg" n="4"/>supported me splendidly, and I did not want to dash their hopes to the ground -- I had to stay in office at least a day. But everybody must admit that matters cannot continue in the present manner and, under the circumstances, I considered it my duty to resign. I think it best in the interests of the city."</p>
   <p>"Did the Mayor desire your resignation?"</p>
   <p>"No, not by a word. I acted entirely of my own accord!"</p>
   <p>The reporter then saw Mayor Harrison, who was in an excellent mood. Many newspaper men were present.</p>
   <p>"I suppose," said the reporter, "it is useless to ask the honorable mayor about Benner's resignation." Satirical grins from the members of the <pb facs="5418474_4_0877.jpg" n="5"/>newspaper fraternity, and the suddenly serious mien of the city's chief executive, convinced the reporter that he could expect no explanation. The reporters, however, were persistent; they joked with the mayor, who finally said that Benner's resignation had nothing to do with the conversation the mayor and Benner had had on the previous day.</p>
   <p>Benner's resignation caused considerable excitement at the city hall, and all kinds of conjectures were made--that Benner's resignation had been a part of a regular planned procedure, and that the fire marshal would be reappointed at the end of his official term, on August 1st. It was also said that Corporation Counsel Adams had induced Benner to write the letter, but Adams denies;this others said that Benner had received a lucrative offer from out-of-town, but this assertion found less credence than the belief that Benner will be reinstated on August 1st.</p>
   <p>The reporter was able to find only two aldermen, Cullerton and Lawler. The <pb facs="5418474_4_0878.jpg" n="6"/>former said: "what will the Benner aldermen do now? They ought to be ashamed of themselves!"</p>
   <p>Lawler added, rather dejectedly; "I cannot understand it!"</p>
   <p>In seeing Marshal Swenie, the re orter said: "Well, now you are the chief again!"</p>
   <p>"Yes," replied the new fire marshal, "but not for long."</p>
