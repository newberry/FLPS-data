   <p>Yesterday afternoon the Committee on Political Action of the Personal Rights League met at the latter's rooms, Illinois Staats Zeitung Building. Nearly all of the members of the committee were present. The committee organized by electing Robert Lindblom President and Charles Bary  as Secretary.</p>
   <p>President Lindblom, W. H. Dyrenforth, Jesse Cox, and Charles Hary reported from the Citizens' movement, stating that they, as also others were present at the meetings not as representing the Personal Rights League, but as individuals, and then only conferees, and not as identified with the movement until it should be known what would be done. From present indications the gentlemen said that they were not prepared to recommend to the league cooperation with that movement.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the following resolution was adopted unanimously: Resolved, that the Personal Rights League do not cooperate with the citizens' movement, at least at present.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0272.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The following resolution was also unanimously adopted: Resolved, that the Personal Rights League employ all honorable means to secure the defeat of De Witt C. Cregier if he be nominated for mayor.</p>
