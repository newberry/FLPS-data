   <p>The greatest election battle will be fought in the middle west in the following six weeks in Illinois and neighboring states. It is absolutely necessary that the Republican party must unite if it wants to emerge victorious. Chicago Germanism will be stronger and more successful than for many years, even if it does not get more offices than in previous years. Notwithstanding the Europeon War, the Chicago Germanism wins more and more recognition. The news that the well known sausage manufacturer Oscar Mayer had been arrested in Canada as a German spy, and which was treated in the beginning as a joke, has been confirmed as a fact. He was accompanied by Mayor Harrison and the hunter Joseph Winter, and hunting in the North East of Canada. When Oscar Mayer, after a missing shot, began to swear in the German language, the Canadian guides returned and denounced the party as German spies, as they had represented themselves to be French Canadians. Judge Cooper has been very sympathetic with the affairs of the Germans and also showed a letter from Mr. Albert W. Gilschrift the ex-Governor of Florida, showing great sympathies with the German cause.</p>
