   <p>A new factor will soon enter into the calculations of Cook County politicians if they would figure with any degree of reliability. For the first time since their organization, the German Turners' societies intend to take an active part in politics. They number five thousand, nearly all of whom are voters, as the societies do not receive men as members unless they are citizens or at least have their first papers.</p>
   <p>But in their organized capacity, they have never before appeared in politics. The experiment is being watched with great interest by the Turners all over the country. If it is successful in Chicago, which is the strongest district in the North American Turnerbund, the Turners everywhere will follow suit.</p>
   <p>At the last district convention at Grand Crossing, there was organized what was called the Vorort fur Gelstige Bestrebunger, meaning a literary department, which, however, promises to lead the Turners directly into the political arena.This public affairs department consists of a committee to which each society in <pb facs="5418474_4_0278.jpg" n="2"/>in the district sends one delegate, together with the second speaker of the district as ex-officio chairman.</p>
   <p>The members of the first board are Robert Hirsch of the Forstschritt Turnverein, ex-officio chairman; Jens Christensen of the Vorwarts; Charles Heineke of Fortschritt; Charles Bary of the Swiss; F. Czolle of the Gut Heil; and Fred Engelhardt of the Fortschritt. Standing committees have been appointed to develop the plan of work.</p>
   <p>It is intended to establish a school of oratory in order to promote public speaking. Public meetings will be held for the purpose of discussing subjects of general importance. Public demonstrations of the Turners for the expression of their views on the questions of the day, not avoiding political issues, will be arranged. The plan is to have every society put itself on record before next spring as to the exact scope of its demands in the political field. If it appears necessary, candidates of their own are to be nominated, campaign committees appointed, and eventually the polls will be manned by them in the interest of the desired political reforms.</p>
   <p>In the Fifth Senatorial District, the Turnvereins Vorwarts and Einigkoit have appointed committees on political action and will enter the campaign.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0279.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The meeting to discuss public questions will be held regularly during the winter in all the turner-halls in the district. The list of speakers is being made up not merely of turners, but of prominent citizens outside of the organizations.</p>
   <p>Lectures will be delivered in English and German, to be followed by debates. Their efforts will be chiefly devoted to devising means to bring about a clean government of municipal affairs.</p>
   <p>In view of the closeness of the vote in Chicago and the well known independence of the turners as voters, the promoters of the plan think they will hold the balance of power and be in a position to exact reforms from the old parties.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Committee on political Action of the Personal Rights League met at the league headquarters last night and confirmed the action of the branch league in the Fifth Senatorial District in nominating an independent candidate. The league, together with other organizations in that district, will run independent candidates. The Executive Committee decided to appoint an Investigation Committee to ascertain the character of the various candidates.</p>
