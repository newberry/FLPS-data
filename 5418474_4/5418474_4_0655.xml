   <p>The Cincinnati Volsfreund congratulates the German citizens of Chicago upon the defeat of Mr. Medill's Fire Ordinance and the discomfiture of the nativistic bullies of Tribune, Times and Journal. The paper adds: " The friendly memory of the nativistic infamy will remain, and is going to re-awaken now and then in future, when certain politicians will turn for support to their honored friends of German descent.</p>
   <p>The Volksfreund is right. It is in Chicago political circles no secret, that Horace White and W. F. Storey have merely used the agitation about the Fire Ordinance in order to break the power of the German voters, and so to throw the congressional election to a "liberal" Free Trade candidate White and Storey seek revenge for the defeat they suffered-primarily due to the Illinois Staats Zeitung with the election of Farwell in 1870. For this reason they now wanted to make the Germans the butt of general indignation by depicting them as a gang of rebels and by bringing, if possible,(if they had found in the Grand Jury enough scoundrels of their own stripe) the editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung on the defendant's bench. Had they been successful they would have re-awakened <pb facs="5418474_4_0656.jpg" n="2"/>completely the benighted spirit of knownothingism...and would have started a new "citizens" movement...</p>
   <p>Something like that is certain to be tried out, because while the hope of the noble brothers White and Storey who are worthy of each other, has become very feeble, they intend at least to conquer Chicago and Cook County for themselves. Of course, this is possible only, if they succeed in rendering impotent the German vote. The attempt to effect this by preventing the reconstruction of the German district of North Chicago has failed.</p>
   <p>Now another means is to be used; dividing the Germans by creation of a scandal sheet that supposedly is to represent, the decent part of the Germans, but that in fact will represent nobody but a small clique of hungry(and especially thirsty)literary bums, who make of themselves serviceable Moors of the crafty "liberal" Knownothing gang", and who will be dealt with as summarily as other Moors as soon as they have done their duty.</p>
