   <p>The convention of Chicago and Cook County Workmen has shown a better behavior than their opponents would have expected. Their general platform is moderate and sensible, though it naturally expresses a few immature opinions. But among the proposed candidates are men who deserve the support of all good citizens.</p>
   <p>The platform principally doesn't demand more than what was promised by the national platforms of the older parties, whose platforms were shaped under the pressure of the great labor movement. But in regards to the local administration, it is setting up demands which have been eliminated by the older parties and which deserve the general public approval. Particularly this refers to the corrupt county legislature, which needs improvement and a good cleaning.</p>
   <p>Until now, the platform rightfully points out, the various parties have used money and promises of jobs to accomplish the election of candidates for county office positions. The thus elected county officials are forced to pay from their income all corrupt political debts, made during the election campaign, <pb facs="5418474_4_0565.jpg" n="2"/>and further more to hire all parasitical politicians, who have supported their election. The candidates of the Labor Party, however, are brought before the public without any personal expenses for them. The election campaign will be financed by public donations and contributions from the party organization, which is supervising and watching all phases of the campaign. The elected candidate therefore don't have to pay any political debts, whereby all temptations of graft are eliminated, as far as that is possible. This procedure doubtless is the only way to get an honest county legislature. As a further means towards this goal, the Labor Party is demanding the abolition of the present contract system and suggests in its place the purchase of all merchandise for county institutions through honest officials in the public market.</p>
   <p>The Labor platform is demanding similar (platform) reforms for the city administration and this end is suggesting the elimination of Chicago's division into three towns.</p>
   <p>Harmonizing perfectly with this spirit of honesty and reform aspirations is the set-up of German candidates for the county office: Stauber for county treasurer and Altpeter for county councilman. Both have been members of the <pb facs="5418474_4_0566.jpg" n="3"/>City Council and as such have lived up to honest principles. Another German candidate, Mr. Eilert, has a good name and clean record like Stauber and Altpeter. It would be childish to throw good citizens like these three men into one pot with the anarchists, particularly in consideration of such a moderate platform. The Labor Party has removed from itself most thoroughly the suspicion of anarchism, by the stand it has taken in regard to the election of judges. Almost unanimously the Labor Party decided for the election of Anthony and Hawes, who have been proposed again as Superior Court judges by the Republican Party and who proved to be conscientious, strict law enforcers against criminals of any kind. By supporting the reelection of these judges, the Labor Party is rejecting more expressively the cry of the anarchists and their condemned leader, Fielding, "throttle the law" than by the most oratorical resolution, because facts are speaking louder than words. By also renouncing any further separate candidacies for judgeships and choosing wisely among the Democratic and Republican candidates, the Labor Party has proved to consider the election of judges as something high above all parties, even the Labor Party.</p>
   <p>Those workers, who want to play the game of a separate party as "bolters" against the described Labor Party, will recognize soon enough the folly of their fruitless efforts.</p>
