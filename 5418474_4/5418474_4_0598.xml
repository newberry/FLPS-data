   <p>The expectation that the budget might be settled at the council meeting last evening did not materialize; in fact, after the four-hour session the council had shown but little progress....</p>
   <p>Turner made a motion that the Board of Health officers be given salaries of eight hundred dollars, a raise of eighty dollars above the present figure. The council was opposed....</p>
   <p>Stauber (Socialist) asked for an appropriation of five thousand dollars for bathing houses. Tuley, representing the committee handling legal matters, declared that no legal difficulties confront such a measure. The proposition was defeated, as the following tabulation of votes shows-In favor: Tuley, McNally, Lawler, Eissner, Ryan, Stauber, Niesen, Schweisthal, and Jonas.</p>
   <p>Opposed: Pearsons, Ballard, Sanders, Cary, Phelps, Gilbert, Tully, Turner, <pb facs="5418474_4_0599.jpg" n="2"/>Loding, Cullerton, Riordan, Oliver, Beidler, Cook, Throop, Seaton, Rawleigh, Thompson, Janssens, and McCaffrey.</p>
   <p>The following refrained from voting: Smyth, McNurney, Waldo, and Knopf.</p>
   <p>Stauber asked to set aside the sum of ten thousand dollars to pay every alderman three dollars per session. His motion was defeated 25 to 4. Orginally, ten aldermen favored the proposal, but subsequent fear of unfavorable newspaper publicity induced the gentlemen to change their minds. Lawler, undismayed, tried to revive the salary proposal.....but to no avail.</p>
   <p>Stauber asked for an appropriation of $7,500 for public reading rooms in three sections of the city. He based his assertion upon the fact that the library is available to only a samll number of people, and that the North, Northwest, and Southwest Sides should have branch libraries. The proposition was tabled.</p>
   <p>Stauber also asked for an appropriation of $100,000 for kerosene lamps to <pb facs="5418474_4_0600.jpg" n="3"/>illuminate those streets where no gas pipes have been laid. The proposal was declared out of order.</p>
   <p>Another motion by Stauber, this time to provide a contingent fund of fifty thousand dollars for the Commissioner of Health to use in case of an epidemic, was also regarded as out of order.</p>
   <p>Stauber (shouting): "That's exactly what I expected, gentlemen. You have provided princely salaries for clerks, but when an issue concerns the poor people you object!"</p>
   <p>Chairman McCaffrey considered it out of order. Lawler then suggested an appropriation of twenty thousand dollars. Schweisthal said he believed the general contingent fund would suffice during a calamity. If Stauber's proposition were accepted, an "epidemic" might break out among the taxpayers.</p>
   <p>Stauber: "I believe it. But the taxpayers I mean are not the ones you refer <pb facs="5418474_4_0601.jpg" n="4"/>to. The true taxpayers, in my opinion, are the poor devils whose labors enrich the wealthy; yet the efforts of the workers cannot buy bread for their starving children!" Adjournment followed.</p>
