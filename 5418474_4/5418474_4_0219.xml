   <p>If Governor Fifer entertained the idea that those German, who voted for him four years ago, will again support him in his battle against Altgeld, then the unusual German anti-Fifer demonstrations, and the anti-Edward law sentiments of recent weeks and days must have opened his eyes, unless he is to-tally blind.</p>
   <p>Although there remain a few German Republicans, who apparently find it consistent with their sense of honor to support a man who has allied himself, obviously, with the worst enemies of the German element..., yet these will not be able to rescue Fifer from his ignominious defeat on November 8th.</p>
   <p>... Again we are happy to report of another large anti-Fifer demonstration by German voters in the Lincoln Turner Hall in Lake View. The four independent German-American Citizens Clubs released the following appeal a few days ago:</p>
   <p>"Every citizen who appreciates liberty and justice and is ready to defond them is urgently invited to attend a mass-meeting to be held on November 3rd in the Lincoln Turner Hall. This is the last appeal before the decisive battle on <pb facs="5418474_4_0220.jpg" n="2"/>November 8th. Do not miss it! Step into line for action!"</p>
   <p>So many responded to this appeal last night that it exceeded by for the most extravagant expectations. The large hall could not hold half of the thousands of Germans who came to prove their loyalty to the Democratic banner in this struggle for justice and liberty, no matter to what party they previously belonged. It is regrettable that thousands were unable to hear the speakers that evening.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Club of the 26th Ward, the J. P. Altgeld Club of the 25th Ward..., and the regular Democratic Club of the 26th Ward marches into the hall with music and banners... The following Evangelical Lutheran churches of the 6th senatorial district were likewise represented by a large group of members: St. Paul's, St. Jaboci, St. Lucas, and Bethlehem church.</p>
   <p>After H.W. Schlacke, the chairman, had opened the meeting wish some fitting remarks, he introduced Judge Altgeld, who was greeted with boundless shouts of joy. The issues of the present campaign he touched upon in succession, but <pb facs="5418474_4_0221.jpg" n="3"/>the school question he expounded more elaborately. Referring to the Republican candidate for governor, he said that Fifer is, undoubtedly, secretly allied with nativistic societies, with whose help he hopes to win; however, the German Michel will completely upset his clever calculations.</p>
   <p>Then Altgeld left the hall at about 9 o'clock to attend the meeting in the Auditorium, he was requested from the audience to any something about the prison labor problem. This he did and left the hall under a tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>The school superintendent of the state, H. Raab, who was elected three years ago by a majority of 35,000 votes - two-thirds of these from German voters - now spoke to the audience in German.</p>
   <p>"Fellow-citizens and Friends: ... You all know what this campaign means to us. Every voter, who does not fight for the party which protects our interests most adequately, is not worthy to be a free American citizen.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0222.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"My ancestors and my family have been in this beautiful country over a hundred years, and they have always defended the rights of the people, not only here, but also in the old country. I trust my descendants shall do the same. We are approaching the day of election very rapidly. The issues involved are clear and important.</p>
   <p>"Every one of you knows what results we may expect, if J. P. Altgeld  is elected, and a liberal state legislature, to back him up. You are also aware what the conse quences will be, if Fifer is reelected and supported by a legislature composed of narrow-minded men.</p>
   <p>"What is true Democracy? Is it not equal rights and equal liberty for all? I am not attempting to force the German Republicans to become Democrats, but if they do not find the Democratic candidates upon the state and national ballot better than the Republicans, I have lifted my voice in vain."</p>
   <p>Mr. Raab then discussed the tariff question with great skill. Again he <pb facs="5418474_4_0223.jpg" n="5"/>touched the anti-liberal tendencies of the Republican party and asserted that they have nothing more to offer to the liberal element, and that their task is done. If they would remain in power, we soon would have a prohibition law, besides the Edward law, to enslave us. We can never forgive the Republican Party, in whose ranks our best Germans have stood, especially during the Civil War, for having sold out, soul and body, during recent decades, to the Know-Nothings.</p>
   <p>"To me," he stated, "this campaign is a matter of life and death to the German-Americans. The Germans of all parties should unite in order to right the nativistic prohibition-Famatics and the bigoted Sunday-closer more effectively.</p>
   <p>"Referring to the school question, I can only say that I esteem the system of public schools very highly. Thirty-six years of my life I have devoted to it, but I am not blind to the advantages of private and parochial schools. No parent should be dictated. to as to the school to which he must send his children."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0224.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Mr. Raab concluded his speech with the words: "Do as Moltke did, 'Look before yea leap.' Examine the candidates of both parties, and then make your decision. If you join the Democrats in this campaign, you will not be in bad company. Men like Cleveland and Altgeld are worthy of your support."</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Professer W. Herzberger, whose address was received with much enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>"I am an American," he said,  "although I am of German descent. He who is ashamed of his mother tongue and of being of German descent, is a contemptible creature.... The law does not recognize Lutherans, Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, Democrats or Republicans, but only Americans. We are all equal before the law. The constitution of this country declares every one a citizen, who obeys the laws, pays his taxes, and stays out of prison...."</p>
   <p>Professor Bock addressed the audience in Low-German. Emil Hoechster concluded the meeting with a very enthusiastic appeal to the German voters,  urging them to defend justice and liberty, and to vote for Grover Cleveland <pb facs="5418474_4_0225.jpg" n="7"/>and J. P. Altgeld.</p>
