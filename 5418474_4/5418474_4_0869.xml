   <p>p. 4...As candidate for mayor two years ago, Carter H. Harrison emphasized his friendship for the German people, and especially his great interest for German instruction in public schools. What was actually his first act after being elected to that office? He reduced the number of German members of the School Board from four to three, and appointed two of the worst enemies of the Germans, General Stiles and John Curran, members of the School Board. And what was his next move? He removed Mr. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, a German fire marshal, from his post, offering it to an Irishman; and with due credit to him not a single German is holding the rank of chief or marshal in the fire department at the present time.</p>
   <p>The German voter may bear this in mind when he casts his vote next Tuesday.</p>
