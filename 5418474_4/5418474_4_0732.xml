   <p>The present local administration has been very accommodating to those of German stock in the community. Seldom in the history of Chicago have so many political offices, both high and less important, been held by German-Americans. This is gratefully acknowledged by those of German stock. They are conscious of the fact that, because of their great number and their importance both economically and culturally, they can justly insist that they be given a suitable number of public offices. They also know, however, that they have not always been given this consideration.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances it is all the more unpleasantly surprising that two German police captains, Max Danner and Mathias Homer, have been getting the cold shoulder. Both are of German extraction and have at all times been on good terms with the German community. Both have justly enjoyed <pb facs="5418474_4_0733.jpg" n="2"/>the reputation of being good and experienced policemen and capable administrative officials. Their characters have never been impugned by anyone. Danner and Homer have been members of the police force for a long time, and during the last few years have held the responsible position of captain.</p>
   <p>A short time ago this treatment of them started. No complaint was made against them, and it may be assumed that they have done nothing blameworthy. Nevertheless they are condemmed to inactivity. They report for duty every morning and then learn that they have nothing to do. Their duties are performed by substitute captains. This is an injustice and is at the same time a waste of public money. It would be a good thing if the police commissioner explained to the public his reason for taking this action against these two excellent members of his department.</p>
