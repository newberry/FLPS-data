   <p>Judge McAllister has issued a Writ of Error for Alderman Busse who has left the county prison after his father-in-law put up a $5,000.00 bond.</p>
   <p>The arguments of Attorney Emory A. Starrs for his demand of issue of a Writ of Error were as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The proposal of an official to be bribed could not be viewed as act that is to be punished as if the bribe had really been given and received, and the court had recognized this view at least in part as correct.</p>
   <p>2. Neither in the United States nor in England existed in the history of the courts a case that an official had been found guilty in a similar way as Busse.</p>
   <p>3. The witnesses have testified that Busse was already in favor of the acquisition of Goggin's lot, before his conversation with Goggin....</p>
   <p>5. The States Attorney had with some success, misinterpreted the fact that</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1604.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Busse sent Goggin to Walsh. Walsh expressly observed when a sum of money that should be deposited was mentioned, that one should not tell Busse about it.......</p>
   <p>7. The instructions given the jurors actually led the jurors astray.</p>
