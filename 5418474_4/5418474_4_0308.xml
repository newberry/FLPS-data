<title level="a">THE SOCIALIST COUNTY CONVENTION</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Socialist county convention was held at Greenebaum's Hall, Fifth Avenue, yesterday evening at eight o'clock. About 150 members of the German, Scandinavian, Bohemian, English, and French Sections were present. George Schilling opened the convention, and Alderman Christian Meier was elected president. Tim O'Mara, T. J. Morgan, and Captain Frank Bielefeld were secretaries.</p>
   <p>Schilling made a motion that people who are interested, but are not members of the Socialist party, be admitted, but not be given the right to vote on questions arising in the convention.</p>
   <p>Thorsmarck was definitely opposed. He said: "Whoever is not a member of the party should not be present at the convention. Anybody can join the party, and secure thereby the right to attend political meetings."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0309.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Schilling's motion was defeated. Then the platform of the Socialists was read and adopted. The document, as usual, was steeped in vitriolic expressions, such as "merciless monopolists," "unfair distribution," and so forth.</p>
   <p>A special county platform was proposed. We quote it herewith.</p>
   <p>"We demand:</p>
   <p>That the officials elected by the people fight any form of monopoly.</p>
   <p>That all privileges given to certain taxpayers be abolished.</p>
   <p>That all streets of the county be regarded as the property of the people, under the control of the people. Said streets shall not be sold or leased to individuals for the purpose of exploiting the people, as is done at present.</p>
   <p>That eight hours be declared the time limit for a day's work whenever county labor is performed.</p>
   <p>That the contract system be abolished whenever work is done for the county, and that all material necessary for construction be bought in the open market.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0310.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>That all public institutions be reorganized, and above all, that the county agent's office be so managed that it realizes the purpose for which this branch was intended.</p>
   <p>That the available funds be used immediately to aid the poor and not for the benefit of the political party in charge of the fund--nor for the purpose of buying votes.</p>
   <p>That the county jail not be used as a gold mine to enrich party politicians, but that this building be used only as a place of confinement for criminals.</p>
   <p>That superintendents of insane asylums make life more pleasant for the inmates, instead of aggravating their condition as they do at present.</p>
   <p>That the poorhouse be managed in such a manner as to become a respectable haven of refuge for the poor, the infirm, and the crippled, instead of a place of disgrace, as it is now."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0311.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Upon Morgan's motion the following additions were adopted:</p>
   <p>"1) The three adjoining towns [names not given] shall be incorporated with Chicago.</p>
   <p>2) City bonds shall be issued, bearing a lower rate of interest than the present bonds, in order to save money."</p>
   <p>After a prolonged argument, other additions were proposed, but not voted on. The county platform was adopted by a large majority vote.</p>
   <p>The central committee then drafted an oath, which all candidates nominated by the Socialist party must sign.</p>
   <p>The convention nominated the following candidates for county treasurer: Frank Stauber, Louis Lutz of the Sixteenth ward, Dr. Ernst Schmidt, D. F. Schultz, George Schilling, and N. Juergensen.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0312.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>O. F. Schultz's name was withdrawn [reasons not given], Frank Stauber declined, as did George Schilling and Dr. Ernst Schmidt. The last named made the following statement: "I cannot accept the candidacy under any circumstances. I do not intend to be looked upon as an office seeker. The party will understand my sentiments. I was a candidate during the Spring election, and do not intend to be a candidate now. Do not consider me. I prefer not to be a candidate, and my refusal will be in the best interests of the party. The people at last are forced to the conclusion that the Socialist party has so few capable men that the same persons must always be selected."</p>
   <p>But the convention was insistent, and Dr. Schmidt had to decline three times before the assembly gave up. The votes for the other candidates were as follows: Louis Lutz, 37 votes; N. Juergensen, 113 votes. Juergensen was declared nominated.</p>
   <p>For the county board, the following party members of the North Side were <pb facs="5418474_4_0313.jpg" n="6"/>nominated: Davoust, from the French section, Eilert and W. H. Neebe. The vote was as follows: Davoust, 80; Eilert, 43; Neebe 2. Davoust was declared nominated.</p>
   <p>The two county commissioners to be nominated for the West Side were Johnson and Bishop. Because of the prevailing confusion, it was necessary to vote twice; the second ballot gave the following result: Eric Johnson, 81; John Gimbel, 39; Maurice Boler, 65 and O. A. Bishop, 70. Johnson and Bishop were then declared nominated.</p>
   <p>John Paulson, harnessmaker, was nominated county commissioner for the South Side. He received 57 votes; Dusey, 46. For clerk of the superior court, the following candidates were considered: M. Bowler, and J. B. Behlohradsky. The former received 90, the latter 25 votes, whereupon Bowler received the nomination. For county surveyor, Gustav Wedekind was given the highest vote; he received 95, McNulty 41, and A. Hoseth 11 votes.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0314.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Morgan made a motion that the central committee nominate a candidate for the superior court, after the Democrats and Republicans make their selections, provided, of course, that the candidate shall not have been nominated by another party. This nomination shall then be submitted to the various sections for ratification. Peterson was opposed to the idea. Hirth suggested Harry Rubens as candidate for judge of the superior court. Harry Rubens declined, and said that it would be ridiculous for him to aspire to such a responsible post.</p>
   <p>The meeting then proceeded with the agenda. Long after midnight, and after about two-thirds of the candidates had gone home, the assembly concluded not to make any nominations for judge of the superior court.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
