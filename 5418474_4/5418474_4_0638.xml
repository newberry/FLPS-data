   <p>At a time when Korner himself seemed still irresolute we named him as a candidate for the office of governor. If in Cincinnati an able and honorable man like Davis or Adams had been nominated as candidate for the presidency, and if Korner had declared for him, we would have seen no reason to fight Mr. Korner's candidature, on the contrary, we would have supported him. But that he declared for so dangerous a clown as Greely, we regarded as a self-prostitution which could only inspire loathing and nausea.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Korner imagines, because we supported him before he prostituted himself, we are obliged still to support him after he has declared for the most repulsive temperance fanatic of America. And because we do not recognize such an obligation Mr. Korner takes every occasion to spread cowardly and malicious caluminations and insinuations against the Illinois Staats Zeitung.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung was already a Republican paper at a time when Korner was still pro-slavery Democrat. It is a Republican paper still after Korner has been prevailed upon by the hope of seeing his ambitious desires of many years fulfilled, to scurry back again to the Democrats....</p>
