   <p>During the short time, in which the "United Labor Party" existed, she played a very sad part. As a special political party she was relegated long ago to the affairs of the past. Under the leadership of a Morgan, McLogan, etc., the Messrs. workers sailed upon the delusive ocean of politics. With their new vessel, the third political party, proudly called the "Party of the Future", the workers started out with high hopes only to be wrecked on the rocks of jealousy and discord in a short time. Now their vessel is gone and on the decayed wreckage are sailing factions under different flags, sending out their signals of distress and seeking refuge in the Democratic Party. In regard to the workers in Chicago one can readily predict that most of them will join the Democratic Party. Almost the only question, which is still discussed at meetings of workers, has reference to the tariff problem. Most workers speak in favor of the democratic ideas of "free trade".</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0294.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Briefly, the Labor Parties in Chicago, neither the "Union Labor Party" nor the "Radical Labor Party", manifest any intention to hurt the Democrats; on the contrary, it seems all radical factions will support the Democrats unitedly.</p>
