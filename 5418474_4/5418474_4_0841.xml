   <p>Yesterday the Mayor ordered most of the department heads to fire the Republican crib-biters and replace them with fanatic Democrats. He himself handed them lists of selected Democrats who should be permitted to the crib.</p>
   <p>As we see, the list does not contain many Germans, and our "prominent" Germans, therefore, are deeply enraged morally. Their organ, the Reptile, in its "sacred rage," is trying to hit the Mayor with its tail and it is indeed sheer luck that the city box has such thick walls.</p>
   <p>Inside the city box the Reptile has nothing to say any more.</p>
   <p>The madness of the Reptile is after all, easily understandable; it intended to complete its dozens of subscribers again by pushing the employment of a few hungry, German spoil-politicians; but now that fell through.</p>

   <p>Only Paddies,it laments, came to the municipal crib. W. Berblinger, division clerk in the water department, was thoughtless enough to refute his office because he did not want to co-operate with so any "Irish brothers."</p>
   <p>Mr. Emil Dietzsch, the great poet, who once in a while dumps his "mental products" in the Reptile [this is supposed to be the reason for Mike's growing such large potatoes in Wisconsin], realized yesterday that he has no more chances at the municipal crib. He was first clerk in the engineering department some time ago, and in his blindness, hoped to preserve this remunerative job on account of the stump-speech he made for Roche (which speech was duly criticized in the Arbeiter-Zeitung). He resigned because he saw that he had no chances with Cregier.</p>
