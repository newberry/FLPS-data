   <p>Expressions of sympathy for A. C. Hesing are continuing to arrive daily. Here are some of the letters:</p>
   <p>"New York, June 29, 1876.</p>
   <p>"A. C. Hesing, Esq.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>"On account of business reasons I have been here since January. Through the newspapers I have learned of your trial.</p>
   <p>"You have found it advisable to plead guilty to some points of the government indictments and I took it for granted that you acted thus, because you knew, that Rehm, in order to protect himself would accuse you of participation in the fraud. Your fait is a very hard one under the present circumstances and I shall always be ready to sign a petition in order to obtain your pardon from the government. I hope to meet you after my return.</p>
   <p>Your friend</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1163.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"A. C. Hesing, Esq.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>"As a friend, who during past years was your political opponent, I wish to say that I consider your punishment unfair and unjust. This opinion is shared by many of my friends. I do not wish to intrude but perhaps I could be of service to you. Should you desire my services, they are at your disposal. I do not expect any fee nor reward, except that which comes from doing one's duty.</p>
   <p>Respectfully Yours</p>
   <p>C. F. Bull, Attorney."</p>
   <p>"Ludington, Mich., June 29, 1876.</p>
   <p>"Dear friend,</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1164.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Although I am prostrated by the news from my son Paul, telling me of your harsh sentence, I wish to extend to you my most deepfelt sympathy. Dear friend, such a fate you did not deserve. You helped, where help was needed, you were an honest adviser, a disinterested friend, an upright leader, strong in times of misfortune. The Germans owe you a debt that they will never be able to repay.</p>
   <p>"Dear friend, keep up your courage. The number of your friends is daily on the increase. I hope to see you soon.</p>
   <p>A. V.</p>
