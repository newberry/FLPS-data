   <p>The German Section of the Socialist Labor party held its session yesterday afternoon at 54 West Lake Street. J. Florus acted as chairman. The semiannual election of officers was held at the beginning of the meeting, and the following were elected: Chas. J. Frank, organizer; John Boening, recording secretary; Thomas Greiff, financial secretary; W. Pfeiffer, treasurer; J. Seelig and W. Kempke, delegates for the Central Committee; and Henry Homburg and Anton Mack, revisors.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were adopted:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, the members of the Socialist Labor party, condemn the action of Aldermen Stauber and Altpeter, who contrary to Socialistic principle voted to give away La Salle Street to the Board of Trade. [Translator's note: The Board of Trade wanted La Salle Street closed to traffic, making it a sort of private promenade.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0578.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Resolved, That we recommend for adoption the resolutions of the Main Section."</p>
   <p>The report of the treasurer and those of other officials were postponed to the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The Main Section of the Socialist Labor party also was in session yesterday. The fairly well attended meeting adopted the resolution drafted by Morgan in his peculiar verbose style, in which exception was taken to the assertion that Guiteau [assassin of President Garfield] was a Socialist. In the resolution the Socialists protested vigorously against the aspersion, expressed indignation for the attempted assassination, and at the same time made the declaration that the office of President and the Senate should be abolished. Then followed the semiannual election of officers. Charles Wheeler was elected organizer.....[No German names listed.]</p>
   <p>According to the treasurer's report the receipts amounted to $378.28, but the expenditures exceeded this sum by $92.61. <pb facs="5418474_4_0579.jpg" n="3"/>Upon recommendation of the German Section Aldermen Stauber and Altpeter were censured after a debate for their participation in the attempt to give away La Salle Street to private interests.</p>
