   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The following will be presented to the convention before a ballot is taken. It speaks for itself.</p>
   <p>To the Chairman of the National Republican Convention, Chicago,Ill.:</p>
   <p>The German-American Independent Republican Organization, would respectfully urge upon the National Republican Convention, the following consideration:</p>
   <p>The nomination of General Ulysses S. Grant, has elicited much opposition from independent Republicans, partly because a third term is objected to on principle, and partly because the former administration of General Grant, was in many respects unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>Without repeating the well-known arguments on these points, it is important, at this moment, to remember the undoubted fact that the great mass of the German-Republican voters, in common with many other Republicans, are firmly determined, under no circumstances, whatsoever, to vote for or, otherwise support General Grant, and, in the event of his nomination, will endeavor to <pb facs="5418474_4_0588.jpg" n="2"/>secure the nomination of some other Republican candidate whom they can conscientiously support.</p>
