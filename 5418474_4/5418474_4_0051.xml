   <p>In the last session of the City Council the conflict between the aldermen and the mayor has taken a turn that is to be deeply regretted. Last Saturday, those members who so long had held up the nomination of commissaries for the Bridewell, agreed to renounce the nomination of an Irishman and to insist on a German. The mayor named some thirty men, among them five or six Germans of unexceptional character. From this list the deputation of the City Council selected three (Sherman, S. S. Hayes, and John Heating) whom they recommended to the mayor. Mr. Mason, thereupon seems to have thought he should not have shown himself too compliant and should not altogether renounce his right of initiative. So he sent in on Monday evening, three names (C. C. Hammond, Mancel Talcott, and Louis Wahl) who should have been perfectly acceptable to the City Council. However, these names too were voted down (by a divided vote of 17 to 17). With the exception of Glade, all German aldermen (Schmitz, Ratterman, Buhler, Schmidt, Schintz, Schaffner, and Busse) voted against the confirmation of the German Louis Wahl.</p>
   <p>The demand that one of the three commissaries should be a citizen of German birth we have thought justified - not as the vulgar and libelous Times intimates - out of national hatred against the Anglo-Americans, but for the very simple reason that many Germans being unable to speak English, the appointment
 <pb facs="5418474_4_0052.jpg" n="2"/>of a German speaking commissioner is the only way to deal with various complaints and abuses. However, when the mayor - yielding to this demand - nominates a highly respected German citizen, a gentleman of the most honorable character, of recognized business ability and splendid education, and then his name is voted down - then it is easy to conclude that the reasons for this resistance are such that must fear the light of day.</p>
   <p>The Council can and shall refuse confirmation to unqualified candidates, but it shall not vote down excellently qualified men, because, if Mr. Schintz had been mayor, he would have named different persons. If this is being done, then the only result will be what a certain side aims at: Namely, that enmity is sown between the English and the German speaking Republicans.</p>
   <p>The mayor, without doubt, will send in the three names again tomorrow. Until then, we hope, some of the seven Germans who voted Monday against the German Louis Wahl will have arrived at a better judgement.</p>
