   <p>The City Council Committee, which dared to dictate its politics to the school council, has already come partly down from its high horse.</p>
   <p>It will now recommend the ratification of the nominations of the Mayor excepting only the one of Halle. With Halle they wish to have nothing to do because he might "probably" try to carry through the re-introduction of German instruction in the primary classes.</p>
   <p>If this way of acting was not dictated so much by malice, one could find it amusing. For how could Halle alone carry through what he is supposed to favor? How could it harm the "Nati-Fadists," in case he really did fight for the complete restoration of German education? And again when he is not the only one who finds it proper to teach German, gymnastics, drawing and singing right from the beginning in school, why should he be the only one to be "punished?"</p>
   <p>The thinking ability of the professional politician Noble and his just as noble <pb facs="5418474_4_0779.jpg" n="2"/>pals seems really to be in a very bad condition.</p>
   <p>Now it remains to be seen, whether the German members of the City Council will be willing to insult their nationality and themselves. If they really consent to deny admission to the only German who was proposed by the Mayor for the school board, they will be despised by the German voters and mocked by all other citizens. By its numerical strength and importance the German element in Chicago is entitled to a much larger representation in the school board than it formerly had.</p>
   <p>Therefore it would be a lasting disgrace when German Aldermen would be assisting to weaken the influence of the German Nationality in the public schools and to force out a German solely because he is fighting for the German language. If other objections had been made against Halle, the case would appear different of course. The Germans in the United States are much too good citizens to demand the placing of a useless and unworthy man because he happens to be of German origin. They prefer to vote for a good Irishmen before they vote for a rotten German. But they enter a protest against the rejection of able and honorable Germans solely of his German opinion.</p>
