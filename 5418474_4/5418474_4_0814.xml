   <p>In view of the approaching, election, the result of which is of paramount importance to the Germans, we, the undersigned German Lutherans, think it proper and fitting to define more clearly our attitavie toward both large political parties, and a request others to do the sake.</p>
   <p>Although we have for years stood on the side of the Republican party, and have defended its principles, and although we still approve of some of the principles, we nevertheless are of the opinion that it is not in the interests of our countrymen but also for the benfit of all friends of personal liberty, Iaw, and order to vote the Democratic state ticket at this election. The reasons are the following:</p>
   <p>First, because inrecent years a certain clique was arisen within the Republican party of our state, as well as in other states of the great West, and the leaders of the Republican have acceded to this particular group a certain do ineering position, which is an cross contradiction to the farmer liberal principles of the Republican party. To prove our statement we have only to point to the last Republican state Convention.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0815.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Second, because during twenty-five years the government of the state has been in the hands of one party, and during this time corruptions have crept in, which can be remedied only by a change of party.</p>
   <p>Third, because the Republican politicians have simply neglected certain laws which were inconvenient to some of their party members, and in fact, these laws were never enforced. We point to the amendment of prison labor, which was entirely ignored, although thousands of workers and business men suffered on account of the neglect.</p>
   <p>Fourth, because the taxes have increased annually during the twenty-five years of Republican state rule, until the percapita ratio of taxes in this state exceeds by far the ratio of similarly situated states.</p>
   <p>Fifth, because the Republican party has broken its promise as far as the school problem is concerned, and it will not hesitate to do so again.</p>
   <p>Sixth, because the management of our large charity institutions, which have cost millions of dollars and are still costing millions to maintain, are in <pb facs="5418474_4_0816.jpg" n="3"/>the hands of incompetent men, who exploit these institutions for political purposes.</p>
   <p>Seventh, because J. P. Altgeld, candidate for governor on the Democratic ticket gives as the assurance that if he is elected, he will remedy the bad situation in a short time.</p>
   <p>Eighth, because Judge J. P. Altgeld has gained our full and unrestricted confidence. We are of the opinions, that under his leadership we will have a far sighted and impartial government.</p>
   <p>Ninth, because we think it advisable, as practical business men, to have the books of the government examined by an auditor.</p>
   <p>For these reasons we have decided to vote for the Democratic state ticket. We request all German Republicans to do likewise. (Many signatures were affixed.)</p>
