   <p>The public was told by the Times yesterday that city tax comptroller Von Hollen had taken to flight. He left the city Wednesday evening on the Michigan Central railroad. He probably will go to Europe via Canada and Quebec. He said shortly before his departure that he intended to go directly to Germany, in order to raise enough on the family estate to repay the deficit to the city. Those who know him best, do not doubt that he will pay back the deficit should he be able to do so. His kindness and pleasant manners made him popular everywhere, so that he was constantly the victim of sharpers, who preferred to borrow rather than to steal. From all the money with which he has absconded, he took only enough along to cover his expenses and to his wife he left but $350, to take care of herself and her children. The family home is at the corner of May and Lake Streets. The bond of Von Hollen is $250,000 and is the highest of any city employee. His bondsmen are John Feulner, Mike Evans Clark Lipe, Franz Binz, John Berry and Louis Schultze. Clark Lipe seems to be the only one able to cover the deficit without having to go bankrupt. If he will do it is another matter. Only one point of the account of the Times needs further elucidation and that is that Von Hollen was introduced to the gambling hells through Frank B. Wilkie <pb facs="5418474_4_1545.jpg" n="2"/>editor-in-chief of the Times. He is reputed to play only with marked cards and to have or have had in his pocket most of the money embezzled by Von Hollen. Through Frank B. Wilkie also, the Times received the first news of Von Hollen's flight.</p>
