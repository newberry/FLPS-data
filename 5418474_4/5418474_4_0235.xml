   <p>The meeting held last night in Yondorf's Hall furnished convincing proof that the Republicans have been seriously mistaken, when they have assumed and told ever where, that the Germans had changed their minds again, and had returned to their "first love".</p>
   <p>The meeting was held under the auspices of the Independent Citizens League of the 6th and 13th Senatorial Districts, and was attended by Germans from the North Side, as well as from the West Side. The large hall was filled.</p>
   <p>Although the majority of those present, perhaps 90% of them, have been, until now, loyal Republicans, who have always voted Republican, they have definitely changed, for every time the names Altgeld and Cleveland were mentioned, an enthusiastic applause roared through the hall. The good Republicans undoubtedly are determined to vote Democratic. The leaders of the Republicans undoubtedly badly mistaken if they are of the opinion that the Germans have returned to their fold again....</p>

   <p>The first one, F. A. Hoffmann, as well as the following speaker, expounded the school question primarily. He declared emphatically that it does not only concern the Lutherans, but all Germans, who wish to remain German-Americans, and retain their mother tongue for their children. The speaker pointed out again that the Germans must defeat their opponent more severely than in 1890. in order to have peace finally.</p>
   <p>Hoffmann depicted the candidate, J. P. Altgeld, in a very characteristic manner, saying that he was an immigrant, and had experienced the joys and sorrows as such in his youth. At the age of sixteen he joined the army and took part in the Civil War... The speaker closed with the urgent request to agitate, unoil the election, everywhere, for the "German ticket", and to vote for the Democratic Party, being the progressive party now, unitedly.</p>
   <p>Oscar H. Kraft, from the Editorial Staff of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, explained the problems, which had been forced upon the Germans, and aroused them from their passivity, because the honor and the rights of Germanity was being attacked. When the speaker asserted that prohibition did not concern the Germans from the standpoint of the use of beverages, but from the standpoint <pb facs="5418474_4_0237.jpg" n="3"/>of personal liberty, he received a thundering applause.</p>
   <p>Another speaker was J. Goldzier, the candidate for Congress of the fourth district. He explained the historic development of the Edward Law, and its embarrassing consequences for many Germans. This law, he stated, is directed against the liberty if citizens.... No German is so stupid as not to have his children learn the English language. This election battle involves the German school and the German language, and it is up to the Germans to vote for Cleveland and Altgeld. "This will secure the enjoyment of your rights and privileges", the speaker concluded....</p>
