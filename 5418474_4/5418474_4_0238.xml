   <p>Under the auspices of the German Republican Central Union a meeting was held last night at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>Not quite as many people were present as had been expected and were previously announced. Nevertheless, quite a large crowd assembled, listening to the different speeches, and enjoying the musical entertainment....</p>
   <p>Dr. Bluthardt introduced the first speaker, Daniel Wardwood, candidate for 'Drainage Trustee'. This speaker complimented the German-Americans, praised the Republican Party for its work, and above all, for the protective tariff system. According to the speaker's opinion, B. Harrison's administration must have the approval of all true patriots, in view of his success within our own country and in its relationship to other countries. Consequently, the party should remain in power in the county, state, and in Washington....</p>
   <p>The outstanding speaker of the evening was Wm. Vocke, who also spoke in English. He restricted himself almost exclusively to the tariff question, and explained its history from 1789 on.... If the Democrats blame the Republicans for robbing <pb facs="5418474_4_0239.jpg" n="2"/>the poor workers or others countries of their bread through this tariff system, we must answer them that "Charity always begins at home" and that "self-preservation is the first law". All European nations protect themselves, and the Americans must, first of all, protect the good wages of their workers.....</p>
   <p>Other speakers of the evening were C. B. Neely, candidate for States-Attorney, F. Struckmann, candidate for the Council, and F. G. Ball, candidate for judge of the Superior Court.</p>
