   <p>Jacob Rehm will hear his sentence today. He has at least been ordered to appear in court for that purpose.</p>
   <p>Rehm expects that, should his lawyer be unble to get him off without any penalty in view of the fact that he testified for the state, he will at least get not more than six months imprisonment.</p>
   <p>That such a small penalty would create general indignation does not need to be said. Through the fact that he has been segregated from the other defendants, Rehm has been put into the rather unpleasant situation, that a more detailed attention is paid to his transgressions. If one analyzes the indictment against him, one realizes that wishout him the conspiracy would hardly have taken place, that he was the only one to bribe the officials and that afterwards he collected his dues from them without shame or pity. Thus, the Tribune reminded us yesterday that Rehm forced the unfortunate G. H. Muller to pay the $1,000 that his brother owed him; that from Waterman he received $500 for the appointment and subsequently $200 each month; that from Robinson he received $200 monthly for 14 months, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1526.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These extortions from poor people will hurt Rehm much more in the eyes of the public than the contributions he received from the distillers. Yesterday afternoon Rehm went to the county jail. First he went to the door and asked Cooper to come out to meet him. when the latter refused, he went first to the Sheriff's office and then into the jail, where he spoke with Cooper and Pahlmann. It seemed as if he only intended to enter into friendly relations with the other prisoners, who are of course angry with him. If he will be successful the future will tell. Most of them refused to talk to him. On leaving, he said that he expected to return tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The storekeepers also must appear in court tomorrow. It is hoped that their punishment will be a light one.</p>
