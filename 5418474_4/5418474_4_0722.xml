<title level="a">THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF MAYOR FRANCIS C. SHERMAN</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>On page four of this issue, in the description of the inaugural ceremonies of the new city administration, our readers will find the complete inaugural address of Mayor Francis C. Sherman.</p>
   <p>Although we are political opponents of the new chief executive, we must admit that we are entirely satisfied with his speech and with the principles and opinions which are expressed in it. With respect to the terrible Civil War which is raging in the country, the Mayor takes the same position that is assumed by Republicans and all law-abiding and freedom-loving citizens, irrespective of political differences and partisanship. While Mr. Sherman opposed the election of President Lincoln, he declared that it is fortunate for the country and for the cause of freedom and justice that Lincoln's <pb facs="5418474_4_0723.jpg" n="2"/>administration has proved to be patriotic, conservative, and efficient. We hope that we shall be able to say the same of the city administration of Mayor Sherman.</p>
   <p>Concerning Sunday amusements, the new Mayor voiced opinions which the Germans in this city will hail with especially great satisfaction. Mr. Sherman takes the position which the Illinois Staats-Zeitung has advocated for years: that police authorities should not interfere with such amusements as long as they remain within the bounds of decency and do not disturb the public peace or the religious services of the Christian citizens of the city.</p>
   <p>In regard to fees for licenses, the Mayor would make a distinction between retailers of distilled liquors and those who sell beer and light wines; he recommends that the license fees for the latter group be decreased. From this we infer that the Mayor now has the right idea about temperance; for <pb facs="5418474_4_0724.jpg" n="3"/>an increase in the consumption of lager beer and light wines, in which term Americans include grape wines, means that less whiskey will be consumed, and thus the cause of moderation will be promoted.</p>
   <p>Although the voters of Chicago voiced their wish in no uncertain terms, the police commissioners do not yet see fit to submit to the will of the majority of the people by resigning. Indeed, they have asked one lawyer after another for legal opinions on the matter; they have printed and circulated these opinions, and we heard long ago that they intend to resist the will of the people and retain their well-paid offices. And that is just like them. The Mayor promises that he will reorganize the police, and we hope that he will soon show these stubborn commissioners the Court House door. All good citizens are disgusted by this violation of republican principles, and will side with the Mayor in this matter.</p>
   <p>As long as the new administration remains free of partisanship, as long as it works for the welfare of the public, it will have the support of the people and the press.</p>
