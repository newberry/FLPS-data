   <p>The report comes from Washington that the grand jury will be requested to investigate accusations against employees of the War Department. It is asserted that the high authorities of the Federal Government are inaccessible to political influences or to corruption. That this is, unfortunately, not the case has often been proved. Most people still remember the great oil scandal under President Harding in which former Secretary of the Interior Albert A. Fall played a very sorry role. Investigations by a Congressional Committee also brought to light the fact that irregularities occurred in the Postal Department during Hoover's Administration. At least, when contracts were awarded to steamship companies for carrying the mail, things occurred which can be explained only as the result of corrupt influences.</p>
   <p>That the corruption extends even to the army is for most Americans a painful <pb facs="5418474_4_1216.jpg" n="2"/>disclosure. Some time ago the House Committee on Military Affairs demanded the dismissal of Benjamin D. Faulois, who is at the head of military aviation. Secretary of War Dern has so far declined to dismiss Faulois, however. Here is a situation in which both sides are in the right. No one can doubt that Faulois made statements before the Committee which were objectively false. All signs point to the fact, however, that Faulois did not make false statements intentionally, but that he himself was not correctly informed.</p>
   <p>Faulois also assured the Post Office Department that the army fliers could take over the transportation of airmail without any trouble, although it was afterwards revealed that they were not in a position to do so. Therefore Faulois made a serious and fatal mistake, but his personal honesty cannot be doubted. It is easy to understand why the Secretary of War is against punishing an officer whose record is good otherwise, by summarily dismissing him for a thing of this sort. It cannot be said, however, that the Administration is trying to find a scapegoat for the many accidents which occurred when army fliers carried the mail. The Administration and the proper <pb facs="5418474_4_1217.jpg" n="3"/>Congressional Committee have a right to establish who is responsible in this case.</p>
   <p>The Committee has also ascertained that bribes have actually been paid to officials of the War Department. Against these officers legal action will be instituted. The action of the investigating committee will meet with approval and recognition from the whole nation. It is perhaps impossible to keep any organization clear of sordid elements. But when irregularities come to light it is the duty of the proper authorities to deal severely with the culprits. It is difficult, with our political system, to keep the Government clear of political influences. But when it goes so far that officers who hold responsible positions in the War Department accept presents from contractors, then it is a situation which cannot be endured. The Government can restore the people's confidence only if it takes prompt and severe measures against the corrupt officials.</p>
