<title level="a">CAMPAIGN LIES AGAINST HANECY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The story of a wealthy young man who went awooing and whose demand to see his future bride before the marriage ceremony was to be performed, is generally known. Upon the display of a bag of money his request was granted, although reluctantly, when this particular examiner exclaimed: "Her nose is not to my liking."</p>
   <p>This is an example of the attitude of Harrison and his followers towards Hanecy's candidacy for mayor of Chicago. Judging from the past of Mr. Hanecy as well as by his character and his great ability, and taking into consideration his platform and especially his integrity which vouches for truthfulness and dependability of his program, are points in his favor. Thus it would be unwise to deliberately take a stand against this candidate. Then too, an attempt has been made to discourage the voters by resorting to the usual campaign tactics by warning against Mr. Hanecy's election in the following way: "It was the Republican Convention which nominated Mr. Hanecy; however, the political machine is really responsible for the nomination, and the Republican machine does not inspire our faith".....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1043.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is a generally recognized fact that the Democratic candidate Mr. Harrison, who typifies the political machine, which under the name of "Bobby" Burke is the most unscrupulous, corrupt and pernicious in the United States....</p>
   <p>It is unquestionably certain that with Hanecy at the helm of the city administration, Chicago would no longer have to suffer under the distasteful machine rule. It is also beyond doubt that Mr. Hanecy would be the proper type for this post, if elected to the city administration, moreover, he would not permit a political machine or any member of a machine to dictate or even influence him. This is his own solemn promise. Further-more, it can be predicted with certainty that his sole concern would be centered around the welfare of the people and in no way would consideration to corporations form the basis of his administrative principles. It is also a fact that Hanecy is determined to comply with the city's justifiable demands, especially, to give his assistance to the Surface Lines Corporation, thus helping them to obtain their rights.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1044.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This alone is sufficient. The alarm sounded by a political machine which would be identified with Hanecy in name only may have a frightening effect upon children but it would most assuredly miss its purpose among the citizens of Chicago. They seek information about this candidate not in nursery tales or in despicable campaign lies, but in the records of his many years in public service. Lies are absurd, and any suspicion that the German instruction or the gymnastic instruction would be curtailed under Hanecy's administration is also one of those lies which was discovered before irreparable damage was done. On the contrary, the study of German as well as the athletic instruction would have a staunch supporter in Mr. Hanecy. On the other hand, the election of this candidate would put a finis to the political machine in Chicago.</p>
