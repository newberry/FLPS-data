   <p>The City's budget for the year 1933 is a problem which may only be solved with difficulty. No matter how much economy was practiced last year, there is an even greater need for curtailment this year. The Sargent Committee, which set out to reduce the county's public expenses in order to lower the taxes, intends to curtail taxes in Cook County from a round total of two hundred and ninety million dollars to two hundred million. It is a measure which undoubtedly should be supported, for in these times there are only a few persons who are able to pay taxes as high as those collected during the days of the industrial boom. With the carrying out of this proposal the automatic reduction of the budgets of all administrative offices becomes a necessity.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago has already been taking steps toward the preparation of the budget for the coming year. The appropriations required for the individual administrative offices have been submitted. They total a little <pb facs="5418474_4_0410.jpg" n="2"/>more than fifty-two and one-half million dollars. According to preliminary figures, nine and one-half million dollars must be eliminated from this appropriation to make the city's expenses conform with the anticipated incomes, because presumably there will be no more than forty-seven million (sic) to be disposed of. As has been pointed out, this puts a very difficult task before the city administration.</p>
   <p>To solve this problem, Mayor Cermak appointed a committee of five: Corporation Counsel Sexton, Commissioner for Public Works Sprague, City Treasurer Szymczak, Mr. Cullerton, personnel director, and Mr. Ricbert, financial expert. The members of the committee have strict orders from the Mayor to be guided in their resolutions solely by the welfare of the general public. In case the five men should not be able to reach an understanding with regard to the reductions needed, the Mayor himself will make the necessary decisions. It is expected that the committee will soon submit its proposals for economy.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0411.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Even in times of normal trends in industry the principle of balancing the budget is a fundamental prerequisite in public finance. In times of dire depression, such as today, the least deviation from this principle may bring public finance to the brink of ruin. Chicago and Cook County have had enough of this. During prosperous years public money was just thrown out of the window. No warning was heeded that this wanton handling of finances might have bitter consequences. The men at the helm gave with lavish hands, and when they no longer had anything left, they borrowed in the grand style. This practice of borrowing is today a great liability to the City's pocketbook. For interest and liquidation of public debts alone, the school authorities will have to raise approximately twenty-two million dollars next January and February. The large banks have already promised to purchase a sufficient number of tax certificates, under the proviso, to be sure, that the economic policy proposed by the Sargent Committee will be effected.</p>
   <p>Along with the savings to be made by the city's administration, dismissals <pb facs="5418474_4_0412.jpg" n="4"/>of employees cannot be avoided, hard as it may be to those who will lose their jobs in this manner. The uppermost goal is to retain intact the functioning of the municipal administration. Further, the need to combine a few departments will result in cheaper operation. Above all, dismissals must be made in highly paid positions which can be dispensed with. The distress of our times demands that this time a really good job be done about the matter of saving. One may look forward with interest to further developments at City Hall.</p>
