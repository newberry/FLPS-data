   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The local professional politicians, from the $100,000 a year job-hunter to the few dollars a day during election henchman, have no more feeling of humanity than any loan sharks stealing money out of people's pockets</p>
   <p>These unscrupulous cut throats must possess a goodly part of moral degeneracy as they deliberately, professionally and for their own benefit slander and lie publicly not once but a hundred times. Worse for human society, than a professional thief whom the police cannot catch is such a professional slanderer and defamer.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago for instance pays $160,000 per year for keeping the streets clean. Of course only those people receive contracts who somehow served the party in office and they do not take the duties of the contract any too seriously. How can we wonder therefore why our alleys are filled with dirt and rubbish?</p>
   <p>We figured out that a Mr. Berz who has the street cleaning contracts for the 11th, 12th, and 13th wards makes a yearly profit of $10,000, and all he does is to drive out in a carriage twice a month through these three wards. Mr. Berz had to sell his saloon about 2 years ago; he was down and <pb facs="5418474_4_1442.jpg" n="2"/>out, and was going around in shabby clothes and living in a basement in S. Peoria St.</p>
   <p>Today he owns a palatial building at 299 W. Jackson St. with plenty of money to entertain his friends.</p>
   <p>All this he did not acquire through his knowledge or intelligence as he possesses none, but through his ability to secure a number of votes for his party. There are many examples but this one shows that you can get some place as professional politician if you possess the necessary lack of character.</p>
