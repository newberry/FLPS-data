   <p>A few weeks ago the Chicago City Council was urged to approve an ordinance according to which the thirty-five city wards will be increased to fifty, each ward to be represented by one alderman instead of two. Thus we are to lose twenty aldermen. In addition, the Council itself will in the future appoint the mayor.</p>
   <p>This ordinance, which was proposed and approved without much ado by the old party representatives in the Council, deprives the voters of not only twenty aldermen, as stated above, but also the right to elect a mayor. And neither William Hale Thompson, Republican, nor Robert Schweitzer, Democrat, nor their respective party managers, have voiced any objections, nor did the large English-language newspapers protest. The silence of the latter before election is absolute proof that they have all acted in concert to nullify the power and judgment which the people have exercised through the referendum.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1308.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So we are to lose our right to vote for a mayor. It will than be easier for the great commercial interests known as "Big Business" to influence a majority of aldermen, because there will be twenty less to deal with. Consequently, unless the ordinance in question is reconsidered soon, our hands will te tied, politically speaking.</p>
   <p>Although this is the true state of affairs, the old parties in Chicago still speak of democracy and liberty. A great number of American citizens of German descent are not informed on politics, but by no means are they too blind or apathetic to protest.</p>
   <p>Not until John Fitzpatrick is elected mayor and brings his humanitarian qualities to bear, can relief be expected in the form of municipalization, as specified in his platform.</p>
