   <p>Nothing new developed yesterday as far as Benner is concerned; that is, no action was taken in the matter [of his dismissal]. But it was plainly evident that local politicians, particularly friends of the mayor, did their best to mold public opinion, and so bring to naught the efforts [of others] to reinstate the man.</p>
   <p>It was rumored yesterday afternoon that the mayor had "fixed" thirteen aldermen, so that their votes against Benner's reinstatement can be relied on when the case comes up before the council.</p>
   <p>Our reporter was told that the following aldermen were bribed by the mayor: McCormick (18th Ward), Barrett (17th Ward), Meyer (15th Ward), Peevy (9th Ward), McNally (7th Ward), Grannis (4th Ward), Clark and Phelps (3rd Ward), <pb facs="5418474_4_0893.jpg" n="2"/>and Cullerton (6th Ward), and also the Four socialists--Altpeter, Stauber, Lorenz, and Meier. Besides these, Tuley is to be kept in reserve, so that he will vote favorably, if the need arises, but he will not appear at the session of the council.</p>
   <p>Grannis and Clark were talked to by former Alderman Kirk, who convinced them yesterday that the mayor was wrong. It is also very doubtful that the socialists will side with the mayor; first of all, they are Germans, and second, Benner's dismissal resulted from his objection to salary reductions in the fire department, and these points are significant in so far as the socialists are concerned.</p>
   <p>It is also claimed that the mayor had hinted that he will reinstate Benner on August 1st, if no one interferes now. It is to be hoped that no one will fall for that. Alderman Meyer's decision to stand by the mayor is attributed <pb facs="5418474_4_0894.jpg" n="3"/>to the fact that Meyer is the father-in-law of the new oil inspector, and that makes it expedient for him to support Harrison, in order to protect the son-in-law's job.</p>
   <p>The mayor declared, last Monday, that he had proved to L. Z. Leiter that Benner's dismissal was absolutely justified.</p>
   <p>However, Mr. Leiter refuted this yesterday--his partner, Mr. Willing, can vouch for it. After Leiter had listened to the mayor, he was inclined to regard Benner's dismissal as justified, but, after hearing Benner's statement, Leiter changed his mind and concluded that, if he were a member of the council, he would vote for Benner's reinstatement as fire marshal. Mr. Willing said that Mr. Leiter had informed the mayor accordingly.</p>
   <p>As to the committee, nominated at the mass meeting to see the mayor in <pb facs="5418474_4_0895.jpg" n="4"/>behalf of Kenner, one of the members, Frank Schweinfurth, denied most emphatically that the mayor had convinced him. On the contrary, after leaving the mayor's office, Schweinfurth felt very indignant about Harrison's attitude and, after seeing Benner, Schweinfurth and most of the other committee members felt that the affair is an outrageous injustice.</p>
   <p>The committee will see the city council Thursday evening, and submit the resolutions adopted at the mass meeting.</p>
