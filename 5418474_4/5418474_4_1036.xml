   <p>Mr. John Traeger declared that he does not aspire to the nomination for City Treasurer. The candidacy for this office was offered to him, at the German-American meeting, by the Carter H. Harrison party last night. This, he said in an interview granted a reporter of the Abendpost, will be his reply to the committee, which is expected to call on him later in the day. Overwork and his delicate state of health at present, are the principal factors in his declining to accept the honor extended him. We also implied that these are exactly the reasons which prompted him to withdraw from the candidacy for the office of mayor. Nothing else, he said, would have caused him to refuse to take up the fight for his nomination for Mayor on the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>The reporter asked repeatedly if he intends to take an active part in the campaign for the nomination for City Treasurer, to which he replied in the negative.</p>

   <p>"If my health and business would permit, I would choose the candidacy for the office of Mayor" he declared adding, "this, however, requires an active campaign, and that, in turn, a strong physique, in order to withstand the strain, inevitable in political campaigns. I appreciate the offer made to me by the German-American people; nevertheless, my decision remains unchanged. But I will not neglect to further the interests of Carter H. Harrison, as far as my impaired health will permit."</p>
   <p>That Mr. Traeger, the former City Treasurer, declined to run again for that office, did not come as a surprise, Mr. Harrison declared.</p>
