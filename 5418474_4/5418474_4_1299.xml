   <p>Although the very wise man at the head of our city is unaware of the fact, the ratio of the number of crimes committed here in Chicago to the number of the city's inhabitants is all out of proportion to the corresponding ratio for any other city in the United States and probably in the entire world. That is to say, crimes are nowhere as frequently committed as they are in our midst.</p>
   <p>But the policy of emulating the ostrich [i.e. the policy of self-delusion] has as yet never achieved any results. Whenever and wherever there is a stench, it is always wiser to search after its source and to take effective measures against its causes, rather than to pretend that there is no smell, thus playing the innocent angel. The evil is not thereby lessened; on the <pb facs="5418474_4_1300.jpg" n="2"/>contrary, it very quickly becomes intolerable, and just as the danger of an explosion is always present when poisonous gases accumulate, a similar danger may well be slowly developing in the Chicago stinkpot, with consequences difficult to foresee. The gentlemen in the City Hall, whose "head colds" arising from political causes make them impervious to the foul gases that surround them, should not rely with too much assurance upon the inexhaustible patience of the public. The citizenry is in a mighty ferment, and under certain circumstance a very few drops may suffice to make the barrel run over.</p>
   <p>The citizens spend millions every year to secure their persons and their property--with what success can be seen each day in the newspaper, filled largely with accounts of crimes and scandals that have occurred in the city during the preceding twenty-four hours. It is useless to look for a scapegoat for these shameless conditions. No one individual is solely responsible for them; the blame attaches to the political system, which is diseased with corruption.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1301.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If all those entrusted by the citizenry with a public office and a public responsibility would put their whole heart and soul into the task of administering their trust solely in the interests of the entire community, then conditions like those which lend such sorry fame to our city would never be possible.</p>
   <p>But fate would have it that many Chicago politicians are closely allied with all kinds of unholy elements, whose company they seek either because they are drawn by instinct in that direction or because they believe that the influence of these elements is indispensable for re-election. As long as men of this ilk are able to do whatever they want to in this city, the honest citizen must be satisfied if the vultures spare the lives and property of himself and his family, returning thanks each day to the Lord for not having been robbed, assaulted, or murdered.</p>
   <p>Not all of our officials are corrupt, dishonest, and unscrupulous. Many of them undoubtedly have the welfare of their fellow citizens at heart, but under the existing circumstances it is only with the greatest difficulty that they <pb facs="5418474_4_1302.jpg" n="4"/>can dissociate themselves from the corrupt influences of the others [i.e., the unscrupulous politicians]; they must howl with the wolves if they want to retain their offices. [Translator's note: The expression "they must howl with the wolves" is a literal rendition of a German idiom whose equivalent is usually, but in this instance, somewhat inappropriately, given by "in Rome, they must do as the Romans do".] Only a few of them have the strength of character permanently to resist the sordid influence of their political friends. They [i.e., the well-meaning but weak politicians, not steadfast "few" mentioned in the previous sentence] are likewise a part of the system and "go along," whether they want to or not.</p>
   <p>At times they may not even be aware that they are being shamelessly misused by their political associates. And if they do become aware of it they are smart enough, for reasons of self-interest, to keep their mouths shut and not compromise their friends, especially since in most cases they themselves would stand revealed either as accomplices or as fools. And of course no one would go that far; the burden of a common guilt is an effective deterrent.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1303.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>And, after all, what would the honest politician gain by exposing his political bedfellows? The gratitude of the public, of the citizenry? There is no more ungrateful creature on the face of the earth than the people in the aggregate. They [i.e., the people] may for a while look upon a deliverer in time of need as a great man and honor him accordingly; but their memories are exceedingly short, and they would very soon....fall on the necks of the very same demagogues and betrayers from whom they have just been delivered. The proverbial saying, "the world wants to be received," is likewise applicable to politics, especially Chicago politics.</p>
   <p>The heads of the administrative departments make a daily practice of throwing sand by the handful into the eyes of the residents [of Chicago] while they themselves engage in self-adulation and laud one another to the skies. At the same time, they make speeches in which they tell their patient audience how they are wearing themselves out in behalf of the welfare of the citizens, to which they also promise the moon. But only the most naive among them try to convince their <pb facs="5418474_4_1304.jpg" n="6"/>listeners that corruption and crime are on the wane in our city; these men evidently regard Chicagoans as even dumber than the police assume.</p>
   <p>As part of the "sand" that is thrown into the eyes of the citizens can be reckoned the sporadic raids that are carried out here and there. But these are were show pieces, about which column after column is written next morning in the newspapers; they are simply products of the art of advertising, without any great intrinsic value. And even in these raids a person "in the know" can at times detect traces of venal political influence. Their very sporadic nature testifies to this; anyone who can look behind the scenes is led instinctively to ask the question: why was the raid conducted at just this or that particular spot, whereas other places no less notorious for their illegal practices are, for some strange reason, unmolested? Suppression of gambling dens is primarily the business of the police. How does it happen, then, that the State's Attorney acts over the head of the police in this matter? It is the duty of the police to enforce observance of the laws--above all, to prevent crime--and, failing this, to apprehend the lawbreakers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1305.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>They should be guided by the severity of the crime and not apply the same yardstick to all violations of the law. Serious crimes occur so frequently in Chicago that the police would have their hands full in administering deserved punishment to those guilty of these criminal acts, As long as the present disgraceful conditions continue in our city, this is their foremost duty, to which they should completely devote themselves, instead of occupying themselves with the enforcement of laws that fundamentally do not concern them at all or, at best, concern them only in the last resort, since special departments exist for that purpose. The citizens are not paying the police to go around snooping for forbidden liquor, but to prevent crime and to arrest and haul into court those who are guilty of criminal acts, failure in this line of duty is not to be compensated for by all kinds of success in another.</p>
   <p>But, after all, the police are only one of the departments over which the citizen, in his simple-mindedness, in his limited lay understanding, must shake his head. The sad failure of the administration of justice in the jurisdiction <pb facs="5418474_4_1306.jpg" n="8"/>alloted to it is another circumstance which should provoke the citizen to serious thought regarding the corrupt political system which he permits to rule over him. To deny or to gloss over the failure of the police, of the courts, and of the prosecuting agencies is unworthy of an honest person who should know better or, at any rate, has every opportunity to become informed. Should he nonetheless close his eyes to this dereliction, he must resign himself to being judged by the conduct of his political friends.</p>
