   <p>Not long ago, a strong movement, emanating from the ranks of professional politicians, was under way, to decrease the number of public elective officers and to supplant them with men appointed by the administration of the party in power. One object of this procedure was greatly to simplify the means of election; another was to decrease the cost of elections.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that there was considerable opposition to this proposal among professional politicians who were not "living off the public" at the time, but had hopes of acquiring some office at some future election. There was quite a strong fight "under the surface". It seems that the advocates of the idea are gradually getting the better of their opponents.</p>
   <p>In order to save what could be saved, the office of the county assessor was <pb facs="5418474_4_0387.jpg" n="2"/>chosen and efforts were made to defend it against the attacks of the "moles". The defenders contended that it would be an encroachment upon the rights of voters if they [the defenders] were not permitted to elect so important an official as a tax assessor themselves. "Everything must be done", they say, "to present the one who holds this office from becoming subject to the authority of a political machine. The little taxpayer must not continue to bear the greater burden, and the "greats" must be taxed more heavily. That can be done only if the office of the assessor remains an elective office."</p>
   <p>It is not yet certain just how many names of candidates for office will be on the ballot at the coming primary election. No doubt the number will not be small. However, only a few will have the backing of an organization prospect of being nominated and elected under the present condition. The lists of candidates of the political parties have been compiled by order of the influential leaders of the respective parties. In some cases these leaders dictated who was, or is, to be a candidate and the candidate for the office of assessor <pb facs="5418474_4_0388.jpg" n="3"/>is one of the men whose names were placed on the list in this manner.</p>
   <p>No matter who is elected to the office of assessor as a strict party man, he will have to submit to the policy of the party just as though he had been appointed by one of the bosses of that party. The voters do not elect their assessor. They merely receive permission to select a candidate who has been designated by party leaders. Everything else connected with elections is counterfeit and known self-deception.</p>
   <p>Elections would have a different aspect if the one or the other party did not assume a rather uncertain responsibility for the conduct of the various administrations, and if every individual officer was made responsible for his own acts. This could be done theoretically, but as far as practice is concerned--well, all the people who could enact such a law are politicians.</p>
   <p>Thus one can only say: Every name added to the ballot increases the cost of an election and makes a survey of the ballot difficult. If fewer names are <pb facs="5418474_4_0389.jpg" n="4"/>placed on the ballot, the voter benefits thereby. As long as primaries and elections are held according to the present political system, only party men can become public officials. Thus the whole complicated procedure could be shortened and simplified by appointing as many officers as possible.</p>
