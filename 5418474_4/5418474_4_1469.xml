   <p>It seems incredible, but we have people in Chicago who see an opportunity in the attempted assassination of President Garfield to express their wretched party hatred.</p>
   <p>The worst offender in this respect is one of Carter Harrison's appointees, the infamous General Lieb, a man devoid of character and of conscience, a mercenary turncoat and adventurer, whose moral standards are on the same level as Guiteau's. Lieb insolently declared that Garfield's condition was nothing to worry about, and that the President's injury was described as dangerous merely for political purposes--to injure Conklin! This was the declaration of the scoundrel, although every respectable Democrat, even Jefferson Davis, felt incensed about the assassination and showed great concern about the President's condition. Guiteau's attack is no more despicable and condemnable <pb facs="5418474_4_1470.jpg" n="2"/>than the assertion of that bushwhacker politician, Lieb.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Johnson of the Chicago Avenue district, whom the Mayor promoted from the ranks, expressed himself almost in a similar vein when news of the attack on the President reached Chicago. The officer said at the time:</p>
   <p>"What of it? If Garfield dies, the country can get along without him!"</p>
   <p>That was the opinion, nay, the inhuman indifference expressed by one of Harrison's adherents, while his fellow men were vainly striving for words to express their resentment over the outrage.</p>
   <p>And such rabble feed at the public trough and insult the people who pay their salaries!</p>
