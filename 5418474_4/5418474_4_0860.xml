   <p>"The Staats-Zeitung deserves credit for having squelched the private waterworks project," said Alderman Wickersham to a reporter yesterday. "I submitted the project to the city council, and like many others, I did not see its far-reaching consequences until an explanation by the Staats-Zeitung exposed the matter. I am convinced that the petition for the concession would have been granted, since the promoters had obtained the signatures of all the influential newspaper publishers in the city with the exception of the Staats-Zeitung (Editor's note: which we definitely refused), and so the proposal would have quietly slipped through if the Staats-Zeitung had not issued its warning about the project and its serious aspects. And the Staats-Zeitung was so well informed on the entire waterworks question and gave such strong, irrefutable arguments that the other newspapers were compelled to fall in line; even the Tribune was so closely cornered that it now advocates considerable modifications, in spite of the fact that <pb facs="5418474_4_0861.jpg" n="2"/>one of its main stockholders, Mr. Cowles, is closely associated with the scheme. However, the Tribune's proposal is by no means a flawless plan. I also wish to state that all the information which I obtained, and which was subsequently given out by Commissioner Waller, was imparted to me by my German friends who had read the Staats-Zeitung. The public is certainly greatly indebted to the Staats-Zeitung for the successful fight which it waged against the proposed monopoly of our water system."</p>
   <p>Our readers who have followed the waterworks question will probably agree with Alderman Wickersham. It is a fact that the Staats-Zeitung was the first newspapers which called attention to the potential danger, and that the Times only issued its warnings after the Staats-Zeitung had repeated its first admonition in English (which a German paper, supposedly published in the interests of labor, tried to ridicule in an English article), and also that the Journal, the Inter-Ocean, and the News only began to fight the project after the waterworks question had been discussed by the Illinois Staats- <pb facs="5418474_4_0862.jpg" n="3"/>Zeitung in English.</p>
   <p>As far as the Tribune is concerned, its recommended modification is only a sly circumvention, since that paper proposes the construction of a high-pressure water system by a private corporation which would lease the works to the city for a hundred years at a low rate of interest, whereas we urged that the wealthy citizens of Chicago provide the funds free of interest for five years, since the promoters of the plan pretended that no profit could be expected for the first four or five years.</p>
   <p>Although hardly any one now favors the building of such waterworks by a private corporation, Mayor Harrison still clings tenaciously to the plan which he advocated, since there is nothing else that the city can do, in his opinion.</p>
   <p>If it can be definitely shown--and we doubt it--that the construction of a <pb facs="5418474_4_0863.jpg" n="4"/>high-pressure water system is an absolute necessity, then ways and means can be found to build such works without aid from a private corporation. The fetters which retard the activities of our administration, so that it cannot cope with the growth of the city, can be broken, even if it becomes necessary for one to elect honest assessors who will appraise Chicago property at its true value.</p>
