   <p>Among those seeking the Republican nomination for assessor, Paul H. Wiedel undoubtedly tops the list. Born in Chicago of German parentage, he was educated and trained in the city which he now aspires to serve as a member of the Board of Assessors. Paul H. Wiedel is better suited than anyone else to fill the difficult post of assessor, which is of such great importance for the small real-estate owner. As an employee of the Board of Assessors since 1898 he has worked himself up, by diligence, perserverance, expert judgment, and conscientiousness, to the important position of chief of the Real Estate Division, which he now holds. His expert knowledge of the value of real-estate would be an asset to the Board of Assessors that cannot be overestimated. Wiedel enjoys great respect and popularity in German circles, and German voters should show their appreciation by voting unanimously for his nomination, and thus reward loyal service with promotion.</p>
