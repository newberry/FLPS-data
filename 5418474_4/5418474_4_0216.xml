   <p>The published names of the recently appointed officials, whose jobs have been doled out by the newly elected office holders, brought about a protest meeting at Jung's Hall, at the behest of the German Democrats. The meeting was called by the executives of the German Democratic Central Association, and a large number of German Club delegates as well as German Democrats in general.</p>
   <p>We append the resolutions, which a committee, consisting of H. Lieb, M. Stern, Wm. Reisenegger, F. Demmler, K. Bechstein and M. N. Simon, has drafted in conformity with the wishes of the assembly.</p>
   <p>"The German-American Democrats of Chicago protest against the shameful disregard for the German speaking citizens by those, who were elected with the united help of the German element, and also against the leaders in the last campaign, who promised to consider the German contingent, but broke their pledges in favor of a greedy, office seeking horde. The German-American Club considers the deliberate procedure by which its recommendations were nullified and shelved, to be an absolute disregard of the German people which comprises exactly one third of the voting strength of Cook County, but it also sees therein a definite proof, that <pb facs="5418474_4_0217.jpg" n="2"/>a more drastic organization and greater aggressiveness by the voters becomes imperative, since their representatives are chosen by non-Germans who have no sympathy or consideration whatsoever for us, and this realization prompts us to admonish all German voters- 'Do your work early in order to attain the achievements to which our Germanity is entitled: equal duties and equal rights:</p>
   <p>"The German-American Democratic Association, also herewith expresses its gratitude to those, whose mental and financial contributions help to improve the political conditions for the German-Americans and who energetically defend these rights.</p>
   <p>"If anyone deserves considerations, then it should be given to the German organizations, who had the hardest and most thankless job in the campaign. They ought to decide who the German representatives shall be in the various administrations and they should not be at the mercy of some Irish alderman who dictates which particular German is eligible. And, is it a disgrace to acquire any public position, important or unimportant?.... General Lieb, (probably spelt Lieb, Transl.) made a very poignant speech about the 'Gang'. 'What we must do in the future', he exclaimed, amidst vociferous approval, 'is to be <pb facs="5418474_4_0218.jpg" n="3"/>prudent and circumspect at the very beginning. If one of those mayoral or aldermanic candidates comes around, whining for our votes, let us ask him, who is behind you? Who nominated you? If it's the gang - then, rauss mit ihm:' (Throw him out.)"....</p>
