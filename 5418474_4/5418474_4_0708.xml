   <p>Like vultures and harpies the speculators are swooping down on the field of ruins of the German part of Chicago. Alderman McCauley has moved, on the day before yesterday, to sell out the Northside to the railroads. All German citizens of the North Side who want it to become again what it has been should protest as vigorously as possible against this plan.</p>
   <p>Now that Chicago is half burnt down and its extension towards Hyde Park is prevented for long years to come, the North Side with its magnificent Lincoln Park at last should be able to catch up with the unnaturally inflated South Side. But if, as McCauley in the pay of the railroads demands, the North Side is furrowed with railroad tracks and is made into a smoky, ill-smelling freight yard - then good night, old North Chicago with your pleasant German life! Then you are condemned to become a dirty district of proletarians!</p>
   <p>Whether Chicago shall become a Yankee nest, in which Brother Moody rules and where the "Dutch" form a contemptible subordinate class, or if it shall be resuscitated as the most cosmopolitan city of America, that is now up for decision.</p>
