   <p>According to the statement of County Agent Mc Grath, 2283 persons received public assistance in the quarter ending May 31st, 1880; 1379 live on the Westside; 1026 widows; 968 Irishmen; 543 Germans; 263 American and 199 Scandinavian; 384 people were received at the Hospital and 103 buried at County expenses; 113 received free R.R. transportation, 125 were sent to the poorhouse. The total expenditures of the institution during the last quarter were $16,525.01.- This amount is to be divided as follows: Bread $3,222.36; coal $3, 149.10; meat $2, 865.31; salaries $4,693.00.</p>
   <p>As can be seen from the above figures about 26 percent of the allotted amount, is paid to those few officials who manage the Poor-administration. This is more than one fourth of the sum, which is meant to help thousands and is pocketed by about 2 dozen officials.-This is a wonderful way of managing the affairs of the poor; the main purpose seems to be to take care of a number of political bums and to let the deserving paupers suffer.-</p>
