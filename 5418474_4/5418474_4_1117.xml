   <p>A well attended meeting was held last night by the Republicans of ward sixteen. Mr. Charles Probst presided. The first speaker of the evening was Mr. Henry Zimpel, who accused C. H. Harrison of indiscretions in appointing to city positions unqualified men, for the sole reason that they were connected with his party. Mr. Clark, he said, was a capable business man and an excellent civil engineer, well qualified to take charge of those important city projects.</p>
   <p>The speaker had words of praise for each Republican city and town candidate.</p>
   <p>Colonel Arno Voss said in English that party politics should be excluded from the selection of aldermen and emphasized, that the himself would never sanction an appointment of a man not qualified for the office for which he was appointed, regardless of what the political affiliation of the mayor who made the appointment may be. "My policy for the City Council is non-partisan," said Mr. Voss.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1118.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Wetterer, speaking in English also, pointed out the importance of the election of John K. clark, as the successor to Mr. Harrison.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. A. C. Hesing, responding to the general request, analysed the importance of the city elections in the offing.</p>
   <p>According to the Times and also the News, one would be led to the assumption that A. C. Hesing was the Republican candidate for the office of mayor.They do these newspaper-both being organs of Cartor H. Harrison-busy themselves with him, is beyond his comprehension, unless it is because he does not beat around the bush but announces his opinion freely. This, according to his custom, he intends to do this evening again when he will enumerate reasons, why it is so vitally important for good of the city and German citizens that Chicago elect the Republican candidate for mayor.The law of compromise planned and drafted by the speaker himself was adopted and incorporated as one the city's ordinances in 1873, and is still in effect today. According to this ordinance the doors <pb facs="5418474_4_1119.jpg" n="3"/>of taverns should be kept closed, and shades on windows lowered on the Sabbath day. This compromise has been accepted with great deal of enthusiasm, because it was the one system used in all the large cities of Europe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harrison neglected, however, to put this ordinance into effect. Nevertheless the law abiding Germans of the North and West Side comply with it. In sharp contrast to these citizens, certain districts of the South Side are crowded with gambling dens of the lowest kind. The cry, that Mr. Clark's intention is to close all the taverns on Sunday, is simply ridiculous. However, if elected, he would introduce system and order, which the present administration is sadly lacking.</p>
   <p>The Innkeepers' Society adheres to its principle not to grant membership to persons of questionable tactics or to those who sell liquor to minors. And in this they would have the full cooperation of Mr. Clark. It is regrettable that the temperance question takes a predominant place during all city elections, while much more important public affairs are <pb facs="5418474_4_1120.jpg" n="4"/>not receiving consideration at all. The majority of the American people are liberally minded, and insist only on closing such undesirable taverns as are objectionable to the Germans also.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison declared at a meeting held in the thirteenth ward that he was approached by neighbors and friends of innkeepers, whose license have been revoked, with the plan for new permits. A. C. Hesing, he said, also pleaded in favor of a tavernkeeper of the South Side.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harrison's statement about me, is a malicious lie however. I have never requested of any mayor to grant corrections to any innkeeper whose license had been revoked. Quite to the contrary, it is any candid opinion that such a decision is the autheritative responsibility on the mayor alone. My attitude in this matter is well known to Mr. Clark. Another big lie is the newspaper publication, telling that I have approved the closing of taverns on Sundays, with the exception of open-air restaurants. Every tavernkeeper, <pb facs="5418474_4_1121.jpg" n="5"/>in fact every German, suffers under Harrison's indiscriminate license issues. He alone is directly responsible for the fact that an individual, like the owner of the Wabash Ave. pavilion, a man named Snell, whose photograph adorns, for the last two years, the rogues gallery at the police station, maintaines a tavern frequented by the lowest class of customors, while the life of a decent citizen may be jeopardized if he enters the tavern purely on business matters. Nowhere in the whole world is this possible, but in Chicago, under the Harrison administration.</p>
   <p>Continuing, Mr. Hesing recommended the election of Mr. Clark, who is popular with both business-man and the laborer. He favored the election of Messrs. Raber, Underwood, Sennott and Adolph Mueller and pleaded for the success of the Republican ticket.</p>
