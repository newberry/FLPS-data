   <p>The undersigned would like to ask you for supplementation of your report on the mass meeting of June 8th. After the motion of Mr. Kielholz had been adopted to send three men from each ward to an anti-Temperance Committee. Mr. Richard Michael is moved to reconsider this resolution, and to replace it by one according to which the Executive Committee should call meetings in each ward, in each of which three citizens should be elected to form together with the members of the Executive Committee an Anti-Temperance body. This motion was adopted. Signed: Max Eberhardt, President A. C. Lebell, Secretary.</p>
   <p>To Our German Fellow Citizens:</p>
   <p>In execution of the order that we received at the mass meeting on June 8th, we are inviting the German citizens of the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th ward on Saturday June 10th at 8 P.M. to meet at the place of Mr. Karl Nibbe, Larrabee and Willow Street, respectively that of Mr. Muller, Sedgwick and Sigel, respectively that <pb facs="5418474_4_0054.jpg" n="2"/>of Mr. Theadore Willems, Larrabee and Elm, respectively that of Mr. Almendinger, Oak and Rush, respectively that of Mr. Rodemeyer, Clark and Indiana Street, in order to elect three Committee members in each ward.</p>
   <p>All friends of personal freedom and independence without regard to party are invited.</p>
   <p>Signed: The Executive Committee.</p>
