   <p>The German workingmen's club of southwest Chicago held a meeting at their hall, 139 West Polk Street, on yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>During a portion of the time there were at least one hundred attendants. while fully half that number remained until the adjournment. About twenty five new members were admitted to fellowship of the club.</p>
   <p>The call and prospectus of the new German workingmen's weekly paper was read. A liberal translation of its German title would read "Forerunner for City and Country." It says in substance that the daily English and German papers, failing to see the true state of the people's affairs, constantly slander, lie about, and insult the working and middle classes. All office-seekers, ward bummers, tax-eaters, contract swindlers, and press parasites sneer at the new ideas of this party. The meetings of the workingmen's club have either been entirely ignored by the German press, or have been grossly misrepresented, and the workingmen's party has been already declared dead, and the above named parties have prematurely danced on the corpse. The Forerunner is published to show that the wake was held too soon.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0632.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is owned by the workingmen's party, and will be published by them for the benefit of the workingmen's and farmers' movements, and proposes to expose the wrongs perpetrated on them.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Klings, Winne, Greenhut, Krause, and others addressed the meeting in German. No English speeches were made, all in the room being of thoroughly Teutonic proclivities, drinking the national beverage whilst listening attentively to the harangues of the communistic brawlers. The main argument of all the speakers was that the working masses having votes, and having votes, and having the power of creating public opinion, it was vital to their interests that the power of the ballet-box should be intelligently used to better their condition. They should no longer be the more voting cattle of Hesing or any other demagogue or political back, and should no longer listen to their pernicious counsels.</p>
   <p>The movement has already created ten German Clubs, one Bohemian, one Polish, one Scandinavian and one Irish club.</p>
