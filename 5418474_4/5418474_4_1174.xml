   <p>Even yesterday it was still impossible to learn from Prosecuting Attorney Bangs, on what day sentence would be pronounced upon Jacob Rehm and the distillers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bangs told the reporters that the matter would be settled this week, that so far he had been too busy to take care of it. There is no doubt that most of the distillers will get off free. In regard to the case of Rehm, the Federal prosecuting attorneys have apparently turned to Wshington in order to hide behind the large back of Uncle Sam, in case they should let him go free or impose only a nominal punishment.</p>
   <p>The ones convicted are, due to the great number of expressions of sympathy, doing fairly well. "Buffalo" Miller and Simon Powell have lost none of their friendly attitude. A. C. Hesing alone is still moody, but the conviction expressed by many, that he did not deserve such a harsh punishment, is helping him to regain his composure.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1175.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The situation of the convicted ones will be ameliorated in the next few days. The county commissioners have decided to turn the present rooms of the grand jury into a part of the prison. The grand jury rooms are on the third floor of the Criminal Court building and comprise two ante-chambers and other facilities.</p>
