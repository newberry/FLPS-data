   <p>Mayor Harrison announced lately, that the Germans form one third of Chicago's population. And even if he had some good words for the German citizens, it also was he who omitted to consider the quality and quantity of the Germans. Even in the domain of public instructions, the Germans did not find the acknowledgment due them by right, owing to the fact that the Germans as pedagogues, are pointed out as a shining light to all cultured nations, as one whose example should be followed. It is a mistake on the part of the Germans, that they permit themselves to be pushed aside without resistance. But it is to their glory that in the hour of need when the city needs whole men, men whose conscience and ardour for duty, whose will and knowledge is beyond question, those Germans who are shoved into the background, are called into the limelight, and are given problems, the solution of which has been vainly confided to others. Years ago, when the gambling devil threatened to swallow Chicago, and the police seemed to be smitten with blindness or impotence, it was the German, Hermann Schuttler, the magnificent assistant chief of police, who took it upon himself to clean the city. And now it is again a German, who, after the city has been thrown into excitement, is called upon to restore quiet and do the purification work. Last Monday, light was thrown in this column upon the hair raising occurrences in the vice districts. Policemen and policemen stood against each other with guns in their <pb facs="5418474_4_0751.jpg" n="2"/>hands, and an excellent guardian of public order, had to pay for his obedience to duty, with his life. Days have since passed. There is no trace of the murderer. And vice, against which the police were sent to fight, is still flourishing, unabatedly, while it is claimed, the police are not fighting, but on the contrary are protecting it.</p>
