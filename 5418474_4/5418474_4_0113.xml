   <p/>
   <p>Edward R. Litsinger, Republican candidate for mayor of Chicago, in the Deneen-Brundage faction, spoke yesterday before 500 members of the German Lutheran Welfare Society. He declared that the time has arrived when the German element will finally wield the influence in Chicago which it deserves.</p>
   <p>Mr. Litsinger states that in all industrial and commercial enterprises the German spirit is prominent, but never before, with but one exception - has an American of German descent thought of becoming a candidate for mayor of Chicago. Litsinger himself is of German descent, but not for this reason alone is he seeking the support of the German-Americans. He is aware of the fact that if he were not qualified otherwise, it would be impossible for him to get the votes of the German-American element for this high position.</p>
   <p>In case he should be elected not only German-Americans would benefit, but all Chicagoans. His principal task would be to find a solution to the traffic problems, and he is convinced that he would be successful. Then, indeed German-Americans could be proud of the fact that it was one of their own race who had put an end to an intolerable evil in this rapidly growing cosmopolitan city.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0114.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Since 30% of the population of Chicago consists of Germans, then the promotion of a candidate of German descent for the highest position in the city can be justified on this ground alone. The Evangelical-Lutheran associations of Chicago will now also start a campaign for Edward Litsinger.</p>
   <p>Litsinger will speak Wednesday at a luncheon at the Hotel Morrison before a number of prominent Americans of German descent. At this meeting Arthur F. Albert, Alderman of the 43rd Ward, who supports Litsinger as a candidate, will also speak.</p>
