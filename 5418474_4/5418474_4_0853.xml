   <p>Under this headline, the Louisville Journal ( Anzeiger ), an influential and well edited independent Democratic newspaper, is expressing itself about our recent editorial, "The Fall Campaign and the Germans", as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Illinois Staats Zeitung is giving a serious sermon to the two major parties for their negligence toward the German element in the filling of public offices. Now, with the fall campaign ahead of us, the two parties are worrying about, to which of the parties this time the German vote will go. It always has been a trait of American politics, that ahead of the election, <pb facs="5418474_4_0854.jpg" n="2"/>the Germans patted, flattered and assured of the highest admiration towards their race. Unfortunately, many Germans are taking these flattering, hollow phrases for serious, fall for it and after the election are ignored and turned away by the same political bosses, who previously begged their votes for job promises. This systematic repulsion of Chicago German, as elsewhere in American cities, has been going on for years and justifies the Illinois Staats Zeitung in declaring war on both parties. This attitude will help the German-Americans to consolidate their political standing and force in time the public American opinion, to acknowledge the right of worthy Germans to be considered for the filling of important public offices.</p>
