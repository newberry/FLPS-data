   <p>Among the candidates for the Republican nomination for the lower house of the Legislature who are entitled to the full support of liberals we find, heading the list, Charles L. Fieldstack of the Twenty-Fifth Senatorial District. Fieldstack was a member of the lower branch of the Legislature for eight years and has always shown himself to be a dependable and experienced friend of liberals and their objectives. Running against him are the protege's of the Anti-Saloon League and of affiliated groups supporting prohibition, Joseph J. Manning and Henry S. Lighthall, both of whom are, of course, wholly unacceptable to liberal-minded people. Since Fieldstack was confined to his bed during the last week of the campaign, he was unable to promote his candidacy as effectively as he had always done in the past. His friends and liberal elements in general should, therefore, make a special effort to get him renominated and re-elected. He is an experienced legislator, absolutely reliable as a liberal, and has a large following among the German voters. Fieldstack is himself a member of several German clubs.</p>
