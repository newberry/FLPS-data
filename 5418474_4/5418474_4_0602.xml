   <p>However uncertain other elements of the campaign in Cook County may be, almost the entire German vote may be confidently relied upon in favor of sound money. This circumstance will be a material aid in the election of the three Republican Congressmen from the Chicago districts. It has been demonstrated by the conduct of the Democratic party in the encouragement it has held out to the Nationals, by the Democratic platforms and the utterances of the Democratic candidates, that, if there be a Democratic majority in both Houses of the next Congress, serious efforts will be made to force a return to an irredeemable and inflated, if not an "absolute" or "first" currency. It has also been demonstrates that the only hope for escape from the follies and errors of a new period of inflated and depreciated currency is through the opposition of the Republican party. Under these conditions, it is the duty of every man who is in favor of a full and honest dollar to vote for the Republican candidates for Congress. That is the absorbing issue of the Congressional fight. There is no doubt about the GERMAN devotion to substantial money. An industrious and frugal <pb facs="5418474_4_0603.jpg" n="2"/>people, they want some assurance that the money they earn and save shall not be cheapened in value by artificial means in order to help impecunious speculators to avoid paying their debts in full. No German, whether Democrat or Republican, should vote for any other than a Republican candidate for Congress this year, for it is only in this way that he can make his vote count against the desperate scheme for debasing the currency of the country.</p>
   <p>The Germans who reside in this city, in the Cook County towns, and in the two Counties of Du Page and Lake, which are attached to two of our Congressional Districts, are intelligent, hard-working people, and excellent citizens. They have always had good newspapers published in their own language, and are well informed upon the currency as well as other questions. They are universally in favor of a dollar that will buy loocents' worth, or less; they want a dollar that they can put by in confidence that it will be worth as much a month or a year hence as it is now.---It is safe, therefore, to count with certainty upon the vote of Cook County being cast more solidly for the Republican Congressional candidates this year than at any time since the War.</p>
