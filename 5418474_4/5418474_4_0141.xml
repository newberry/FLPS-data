   <p>Regardless of the fact that most of the leaders and progressively-minded German citizens, as well as the turners,the United Societies, and others, indorse Mr. Merriam, the present City Counsellor, as a true advocate of personal liberty, there are still a great number who are dubious about the sincerity of this candidate. And that, despite his repeated announcements of no interference in the present Sunday ruling on taverns and other places of entertainment! Neither does he show any inclination to revise the antiquated blue laws. What are the underlying causes which are detrimental to him? Here is the interpretation, namely; his unforgiven carelessness to live in a district where beer has no place in the life of its citizens. This is the principal objection. Of course, an offense of this character can never be overlooked. In addition, he lives in a dry district, which in itself was cause enough for the sounded alarm. And last, but not least, he is a member of the faculty of the University of Chicago, financially supported by <pb facs="5418474_4_0142.jpg" n="2"/>Rockefeller....Is it surprising then that the professional and grafting politicians do not let an opportunity like this escape, labelling the Germans as void of any other interest but that of the beer glass. Any of their scheming politicians who are clever enough to throw sand into the eyes of the German voters, can win their utmost confidence by insisting that the least popular candidate is the one opposed to liquor.</p>
   <p>Merriam is no Prohibitionist, neither is he interested in that movement. When plans for Chicago's charter were under way, Merriam vigorously defended self-government for every district. It is this regulation against which the prohibition advocates have fought unsuccessfully ever since, but they still carry on the fight. Although Merriam's name appeared on the list of the Hyde Park Protective Association, he was never a member of this organization. Neither did he work in the interest of the principle the Association had stood for, but only as a representative of Hyde Park, of which he happened to be Alderman.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0143.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The candidate in question has studied in Germany and speaks the language fluently, being intensely interested in the honest and business like manner of their city administration of which he made a thorough study. Furthermore, he is well aware of the fact that in this respect Chicago is twenty years behind the times, and he will, with all the forces at his command, try to reform our city administration....This is his aim, and in the interest of tax-payers his election is the big issue.</p>
