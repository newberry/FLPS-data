   <p>It is well-known that the Republican Party convention chose candidates for County Commissioners whom the Republican "machine" dictated to them, although our citizens cannot trust even one of those candidates. Therefore, the great mass of Republicans and the Republican press condemning their action anxiously waited for the results of the Democratic convention. Those of us who had faith in this convention were not disappointed, for the Democrats put up a ticket which can be supported by any well-meaning voter.</p>
   <p>The five Democratic candidates for the office of County Commissioners are business men of the best reputation, and of characters above reproach. The Germans especially should be interested in this ticket, for it contains the names of three well-known Americans of German extraction, and other highly reputable candidates.</p>

   <p>They include William M. Tilden, a well-to-do cattle trader and a man of liberal views; Peter Fortune who is the younger member of the prominent Fortune Bros. Brewing Company; Mr. Christian Cassclmann, the old-time citizen of the 14th Ward, and proprietor of the tannery who is so well-known that it would be needless to say anything more as to his desirability. He is a former alderman, and a Westtown collector; Mr. Fritz Gotz, who is the principal stockholder of a boiler manufacturing plant and a man of spotless character; Mr. Christian Geils the rural district candidate, who is the proprieter of a lumber-yard.</p>
   <p>Steps have been undertaken by the Democrats, to endorse Lidney Smith, the Republican, as the independent candidate as judge for the Superior Court. The Democrats, in their endeavor to nominate honest people as judges, extended their non-partisanship and endorsed the Republican candidate for the Superior judgeship, Mr. B. D. Magruder.</p>
