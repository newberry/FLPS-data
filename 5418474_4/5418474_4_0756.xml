  <body>
   <p>At the end of a noisy caucus which lasted fully an hour, four members of the West Park Roard, Suddart, Lichtenberger, Graham, and Fowler elected the following officials for next year: president, Charles Lichtenberger; auditor, Charles Kopf; treasurer, F. M. Blount; secretary, Ernest G. Schubert,... and several others.</p>
   <p>The election progressed smoothly. The present president, Joseph Suddart, who has been officiating since 1896, definitely declined to be re-elected. It was generally assumed that Charles B. Paulicek ... would be chosen, but during the caucus the members nominated Charles Lichtenberger, the youngest member of the board. For that reason Paulicek were absent at the plenary session.</p>

   <p>It was rumored that commissioner Kopf would resign because he is a member of the legislature, but thus far he showed no intentions. Secretary Schubert, who, aside from his position, also happened to be a Senator, two years ago, declared that Kopf is entitled to both positions, according to law.</p>
