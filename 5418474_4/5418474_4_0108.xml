   <p>On the occasion of the opening of the headquarters of the German-American National Organisation for Al. Smith, a political meeting was held yesterday in the Atlantic Hotel, which far exceeded the limits of what was expected of local activity.</p>
   <p>Not only the leaders of the German-American organization were speakers, but also almost all the political leaders of the Democratic Party in Illinois. The tenor of all the speeches proclaimed fealty to Al. Smith. About 100 prominent Germans of Chicago promised him their support. The establishment of this German-American organization reveals <pb facs="5418474_4_0109.jpg" n="2"/>that most of the German-Americans are surely going to vote for Al. Smith on election day, Nov. 6th.</p>
   <p>President Ernst J. Kruetgen confessed that until today at the age of sixty, he had not had anything to do with politics. If he is taking a political stand today it is in order to help his country in one of its most important hours.</p>
