   <p>When we gave an account of the city council's decision to relinquish LaSalle Street between Jackson and Van Buren Streets to the owners of adjacent property, we asked: "Given away or sold?"</p>
   <p>The answer was not long delayed; at least the following incident leaves little doubt that not all the aldermen expected to give away LaSalle Street gratuitously, and that they expected to be remunerated for their votes.</p>
   <p>Former Alderman Jonas, who is in partnership at present with Alderman Cullerton in managing a liquor store on Washington Street, was visited by Alderman Hirsch last Tuesday morning and was warned to be careful, since the "boys" were not willing to wait any longer for the "LaSalle Street money"; [Hirsch also stated] that Jonas was under suspicion of keeping the money. Jonas <pb facs="5418474_4_1449.jpg" n="2"/>retorted, that he had nothing to do with it, and that he had no LaSalle Street money in his possession and had never promised any.</p>
   <p>Hirsch went away. But soon afterwards Alderman Murphy, Hirsch, and Adam Meyer, [Purcell], resorting to vile abuse, demanded a share of the LaSalle Street money. Jonas told him also that he knew nothing about it and had no money for Purcell or for any other alderman. Murphy, Hirsch, and Meyer tried their best to quiet their raving colleague from the Eighth Ward and told him that Jonas had made no promises to any one. Cullerton, [they asserted], was the man whom they would have to see. Finally, after the row had almost ended in a fight, Jonas succeeded in getting rid of Purcell and his companions, who, by the way, did their best to pacify the infuriated alderman. Finally Purcell decided to see former Alderman Woodman, who was to blame for the whole thing.</p>
   <p>In the interim Hirsch hurriedly left and saw Woodman, whose restaurant is in <pb facs="5418474_4_1450.jpg" n="3"/>the vicinity, to inform him of the impending visit of the delegation.</p>
   <p>Woodman laughed, pointed to his colored waiters, and said that he would be able to manage the entire city council. Although he had no money for the alderman, he promised to treat them right.</p>
   <p>The visitors, so abruptly announced, did not see Woodman, and Jonas also has not been molested by any alderman since that time. Furthermore, he has given special orders that no aldermen are to be admitted to his place of business if it appears that LaSalle Street money is involved.</p>
   <p>In order that all may fully appreciate the import of the disgraceful affair, we submit to our readers a rumor which our reporter heard, the truth of which Mr. Jonas does not exactly vouch for, but which at the same time, he does not wish to deny.</p>
   <p>When the LaSalle Street matter was on the agenda, much was said about large <pb facs="5418474_4_1451.jpg" n="4"/>sums of money which interested speculators had available to bribe the city council with, but the gossip in general narrowed to certain specific points shortly before the final vote. At that time it was rumored that a lawyer who represented Messrs. Bensley, Kent and Armour, the buyers of Scott's property, wanted to give $25,000 to Jonas with which to bribe the council, but that the attorney changed his mind because a blond Irish alderman of the South Side said that he did not trust that "d---d Christ killer on Washington Street". On the evening of the final vote a messenger called Jonas to the Grand Pacific Hotel, where he met an alderman of the North Side who pretended to represent a ring of the aldermen, and the gentleman demanded forthwith the payment of $25,000 in cash or certified check; otherwise the ordinance would be beaten. Jonas declined to have anything to do with the matter and absolutely refused to be involved in any shape or manner.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to say just what happened after this conversation, but it was asserted that Cullerton hinted to the aforesaid ringleader that everything was all right. When the affair came to a vote, every one followed Cullerton <pb facs="5418474_4_1452.jpg" n="5"/>and Smyth; Smyth was also regarded as an agent of the LaSalle Street syndicate. Smyth, however, changed his vote prior to the final announcement, but this was regarded merely as a ruse because Smyth took his seat very shortly before the vote was taken. Hirsch also, who originally had shared Cullerton's ideas in the matter, voted against the measure, likewise Meier and Imhoff of the Sixteenth Ward, who had been opposed to the proposition from the beginning.</p>
   <p>A few days after this session it became apparent that the "boys" were incensed because the LaSalle Street money had not been paid. If one takes the trouble to recall the incidents involving the city council which occurred when the LaSalle Street affair was first being discussed and how the aldermen, to the great delight of the Mayor, openly asserted that the property-owners on both sides of the street which was to be given away were supplied with everything that the city council could wish for, then one may draw his own conclusions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1453.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Mr. Jonas, who was interviewed by a reporter, was very reticent; he emphasized, however, that he had had nothing to do with the affair, regardless of what might be believed about his colleague Cullerton. He [Jonas] did not wish to injure any one, and therefore he preferred that no particular stir should be raised; after all, he considered the whole incident as merely the irresponsible ravings of a drink-crazed alderman who was unaware that he faced the penitentiary if he had been bribed.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the grand jury will investigate the matter, so that it may be revealed who wanted to bribe the city council, and which members actually accepted bribes. After all, the biggest crook is the fellow who offers bribes to officials.</p>
   <p>The entire story shows how deeply our city council is steeped in corruption again, and how easy it is for people with money to obtain anything they want, a gas monopoly, a water monopoly, a streetcar monopoly, or the gift of a street!</p>
