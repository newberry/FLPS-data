   <p>To give the definite result of the election at this hour, is simply an impossibility as we are being swamped with telegraphic reports from all the directions of the compass. We can only apply the law of probability and even that is as stupendous a task as the scientists effort to reconstruct an antideluvian monster from a few petrified bones and foot-imprints....According to present indications, it is highly probable that Harrison emerges as victor. He has a majority in New York State... an evident plurality of 8,000 - 10,000. This alone, suffices to beat Cleveland.</p>
   <p>As far as the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois are concerned, we have the agreeably surorising result, that many thousands of Republicans, mostly Germans, voted for the Democratic candidate, Palmer, for Governor. In the city his majority over Fifer is around 7,500 and in all of Cook county it will hardly be less than 4,000.</p>
   <p>From various parts of the State reports have been received, showing that Palmer ran'way ahead of his party associate, Cleveland; both being on the same "ticket".</p>
   <p>Considering all that has been said about Palmer, no further explanation is <pb facs="5418474_4_0845.jpg" n="2"/>necessary to show, that the results will be highly gratifying to the liberal minded Germans. Those Republicans who intend to follow in the tracks of the crazy inmates of Iowa and Kansas will then be confronted with a forceful reminder. In that event, Palmer's election may prove as cleansing to the State's Republicans, as did Colvin's victory fifteen years ago in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Now, let us hope for the best and remember, that a probability is by no means a certainty. The final telegraphic reports are on the next page.</p>
