   <p>23rd Ward: The German Democratic Club of the 23rd Ward held its meeting yesterday at John A. Stierlin's Hall, 105 Wells St., which was attended by more than 100 persons.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. Meyer was the chairman and Mr. John A. Herzog the recording secretary. The latter, in speaking to his audience, gave a lucid explanation of the legal requirements for the voters during the primaries and asked the assembly to take an active interest in the election.</p>
   <p>More speeches followed, notably by Messrs. G. Meyer, L. W. Kerdrich and others, after which the preliminary work for the primaries absorbed the attention of the gathering. The reports of the precinct captains are very favorable in regard to the election of Hesing delegates.</p>
   <p>15th Ward: The German Democratic Club of the 15th Ward had a crowded meeting at Wendell's Hall yesterday evening, at which Messrs. L. A. Rademacher, August Koenig and Gustav Rosenberger were appointed delegates for the county <pb facs="5418474_4_0206.jpg" n="2"/>convention. The club will hold another session next Saturday, at the same location.</p>
   <p>German Democrats of the 24th ward: The German Democratic Club of the 24th Ward will hold a meeting today, Wednesday, 8 P. M., at its head quarters, Saxonia Hall, 120 Wells St., to consider preparations for the next primaries. All members are requested to bring friends and acquaintances to the hall, as a membership drive is in progress. The officials are: Joseph Schlenker, pres. ....(four names follow.) The five delegates from each of the North Side German Democratic clubs, will meet at the office in the German-American Bldg., 55 N.  Clark St. Room 2.</p>
   <p>North Avenue Meeting: All Germans who live in the vicinity of North Ave., will meet today at Fred Kuhlen's Hall, 254 E. North Ave.</p>
   <p>Since Chicago's origin, no election has been of such intrinsic interest to the German population as the approaching one and, commensurate with its importance, the Germans recognize the high goal and are gathering their forces.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0207.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Tried and true men will speak tonight and probe the political questions we must solve.</p>
   <p>21st Ward: A "Washington  Hesing Head quarters" for the 21st Ward has been organized at Garfield Hall, at Garfield and Lincoln Aves. It will be under the leadership of Mr. J. H. Faymonville.</p>
   <p>1st Ward:  The German Democratic Club of the 1st Ward will hold an important meeting on Feb. 15th, at Jacob Zimnermann's Hall.</p>
   <p>Germans of the 12th Ward: In the 12th Ward, where no German Democratic Club has existed before, an attempt will be made to organize one. All German Democrats of the Ward are invited to be at 1436 Harrison St., Thursday, P. H. Good speakers from the Central Association will be there.</p>
