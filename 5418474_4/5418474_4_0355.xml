   <p>At the place of Emil Dietzsch, East Randolph Street, a meeting was held yesterday, in order to elect delegates for the Reunion and Reform Convention at Cincinnati. (Attendance being extremely small, a discussion ensued if the meeting should elect delegates).</p>
   <p>Mr. Ruhbaum:</p>
   <p>I am not surprised that so few are present, today, because the call was not published in the Illinois Staats Zeitung, and so naturally only a very small part of the Chicago Germans were informed of the meeting. But time is short and the delegates should be elected, today, and from among those present.</p>

   <p>Mr. Emil Dietzsch:</p>
   <p>I hardly know an intelligent German who is not in sympathy with us. But it is undeniable that at present a certain lethargy prevails among the Chicago Germans. The absence of many therefore should not be construed as disagreement. (In exact count of those present at that time, waiters and reporters of six papers included netted the impressive number of twenty-eight).</p>
   <p>After a protracted discussion a motion was carried to hold a mass meeting, Thursday, in the Turn Hall, - after Hermann Lieb had pledged himself to get the necessary funds from his American friends. In expectation that the mass meeting would be largely American the twenty-eight present elected ten German delegates without loss of time.</p>
