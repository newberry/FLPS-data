   <p>Last week Chicago witnessed a most disgraceful spectacle, when a clique of professional gamblers who had been indicted by a grand jury, were acquitted by our highly esteemed institution, commonly known as the trial jury, and generally considered to be a "palladium of freedom". The victory of these criminals over our court was complete. How was it won?</p>
   <p>There can be no doubt on this question among those who followed the proceedings. The evidence given by the police could not stand up under the bold lies of the defense. The State's attorney failed to summon as witnesses men who had made convicting statements before the grand jury and the Sheriff assembled a jury which was sympathetic to the accused. The latter took the unnecessary precaution of filling the courtroom with their henchmen, rough, criminal rogues, who, by their very presence, and by unmistakable threats, "persuaded" the chief witnesses for the prosecution to withhold evidence which would lead <pb facs="5418474_4_1579.jpg" n="2"/>to a verdict of guilty.</p>
   <p>What is it that gives these criminals such great power over our police and our courts? In the first place, it is money. The enemies of society surely can expect a return of favors from a sheriff whom they presented with a diamond-studded star worth $3,000, and from police officials to whom they pay heavy graft under the guise of sham sales and by other pretenses. In the second place, criminals wield great influence through primary elections.</p>
   <p>In the primary election held last fall these cliques of gamblers worked especially for the Republican party, but they also worked for some of the candidates of the People's party. Well do we remember how valiantly the latter fought to rid itself of undesirable candidates, and it succeeded in part, but not altogether. The officers who owe their election to organized criminals consider themselves servants of the latter, and not of the people. The nomination was of primary importance to these friends of scoundrels, and once they are nominated, they depend upon "party discipline" to do the rest. Therefore <pb facs="5418474_4_1580.jpg" n="3"/>they endeavor to gain the favor of the criminal element, since it knows how to "fix" primary elections.</p>
   <p>This evil makes "election by the people" a disgraceful farce, and it can only be eliminated by abolishing the system of primary elections entirely. The honorable leaders of the People's party tried to do this last fall, but their efforts were frustrated by the very people who now have brought dishonor upon the party to which they owe their election. We must succeed, however, in doing in 1875 what we failed to do in 1874. This time there will be no state or national election to interfere. Only county and city officers are to be chosen. We shall thus have a favorable opportunity to put a stop to the work of those ward politicians, whose entire knowledge and ability is limited to fraudulently acquiring nominations at primary elections. Thus there are good prospects that the freedom of the ballot will be restored to the people who had been deprived, or rather robbed, of it, under the present abominable system.</p>
   <p>If about a hundred honest, educated, and prominent citizens of this city <pb facs="5418474_4_1581.jpg" n="4"/>disregard any differences of opinion that may exist among them with reference to religion, local or national politics, and nationality, and compile a list of candidates, excluding professional political job-hunters, criminals, etc., then the moral influence which the recommendation of these eminent citizens will carry, will be strong enough to counteract, and thus destroy, the influence of the criminal element. Then the two political parties will not oppose each other like two armies in which the undesirable element has a standing, but the decent citizens who have the welfare of....[Translator's note: The remainder of this article has been removed by a clipper.]</p>
