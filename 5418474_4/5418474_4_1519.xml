   <p>The published statements made under oath yesterday bring to light the fact, that A. C. Hesing has pleaded guilty only as having been a distiller, that he should have been punished only as such, and that Judge Blodgett had no business to represent him as having been a ringleader. To prove that A. C. Hesing was no ringleader we have the statements of many federal officer, whom he would have been obliged to try to influence had he filled such a leading role. Under these circumstances it it impossible to understand how Judge Blodgett, who must have been well acquainted with these facts, sentenced Hesing to two years imprisonment, while the other distillers received only from three to six months.</p>
