   <p>Mayor Anton J. Cermak issued the following proclamation on German Day:</p>
   <p>"It is no more than right that the German-Americans of Chicago should honor with a festival the achievements which must be credited to the German people of the United States.</p>
   <p>"Our country owes its growth to the fact that many nationalities have added their bit. Everyone contributed their traditions, their national character, and their culture.</p>
   <p>"In the history of the United State's battle for liberty are such names as Steuben, De Kalb, Frederic, Peter Muehlenberg, and many others. The loyalty of the German people in the United States to the cause of the Union during the Civil War must be considered as one of <pb facs="5418474_4_0737.jpg" n="2"/>the deciding factors in the final victory of the Northern States.</p>
   <p>"The history of the State of Illinois can not be written without remembering the performances of Altgeld or Karl Schurz, to whom the State owes so much.</p>
   <p>"In Chicago there are many great personalities of German descent in the fields of commerce, medicine, science, music, and fine arts.</p>
   <p>"With the greatest pleasure I, as Mayor of Chicago, call your attention to the date of June 7, when German Day will be celebrated at Soldiers Field, and request that as many of you as possible participate in this celebration."</p>
