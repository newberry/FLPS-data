   <p>Yesterday's proceedings were most interesting and threw a glaring light upon the administration of American justice. Here is Jake Rehm, self-confessed head of a gigantic conspiracy, having as its aim the evasion of taxes. Realizing that the evidence against him is too great he volunteers to turn state's evidence, provided escape from punishment will be his reward.</p>
   <p>The attorneys are well acquainted with the law and know that a witness for the state can make such a request, provided he is able to convince them that he is telling the truth. But in the case of Rehm, the prosecuting attorneys lacked the courage to acknowledge openly that Rehm would go unpunished, and have only promised that he would get at most six months in jail and no penitentiary confinement.</p>
   <p>The proceedings had therefore as their aim to decide if Rehm should get a nominal punishment or none at all. The prosecuting attorneys granted that Rehm was entitled to go unpunished and that the only obstacle was the willingness <pb facs="5418474_4_1167.jpg" n="2"/>of Rehm himself to accept a light punishment. In other words the proceedings were a farce to fool the public and to make it appear as if Rehm had to remain unpunished on account of the law. Judge Blodgett said that he would pronounce sentence in a few days.</p>
