   <p>"I have nothing against Hayes, he is a good man, but I like Tilden better, he is a Statesman. I do not want to know anything about Hendricks. He favors prohibition, therefore I am for Wheeler. I vote for Tilden and Wheeler."</p>
   <p>This was said to us by an honest Swabian, who has been five years in this country, and this fall receives his second papers. Without doubt many German-Americans would vote the same way, like this Swabian, who had not ample time, to get acquainted with the laws of the Federal Constitution, if this could only be done!</p>
   <p>And it would quite well begin, if the people immediately in their primary election could vote directly for the nomination of the President and Vice President. But there is the point! The President's and Vice President's election is only indirect, the people merely choose the electors.</p>
   <p>But the case of our Swabian indicates, that the direct electoral system of the <pb facs="5418474_4_0612.jpg" n="2"/>President's and Vice President's election, is not an "empty formality" through this it divides the primary voters, under such circumstances; in doing so it creates a strong unpleasant restriction.</p>
