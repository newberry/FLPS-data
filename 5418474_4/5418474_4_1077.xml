   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Illinois never had a governor from Chicago... There is an opportunity now to elect a very capable governor for Illinois from Chicago, and that is J. P. Altgeld. Altgeld has made himself familiar with conditions and requirements of all parts of the state. Many years of active life in our midst, and his experiences as judge enable him to know what Chicago needs. He would exert his whole influence to benefit Chicago, without, however, disregarding other parts of the states.</p>
   <p>Altgeld, as governor, would use his keen intellectual powers to work out a practicable and reasonable law of taxation; one that is based upon the actual selling value of the property, and not upon a fictitious percentage basis. The latter makes it possible for the rich to evade taxation at the expense of the middle classes.</p>
   <p>Altgeld would likewise exert his whole official and personal influence in order to repeal through the state legislature certain laws and statutes, which impede far reaching and real improvements in Chicago....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1078.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are many highly important matters, which concern not only Chicago, but all the rest of Cook County, that a governor from Chicago could more readily adjust, than one from a country town.</p>
   <p>Chicago's population constitutes 35% of the total of the whole state. Chicago's colossal commerce is a benefit to the whole state. The voters of the whole state should, therefore, elect a governor from Chicago, especially since this Chicago, J. P. Altgeld, is thoroughly familiar with the other sections of the state, and would, as governor, be just as loyal toward them, as he would toward Chicago and Cook County.</p>
