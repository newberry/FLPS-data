   <p>Yesterday Judge Blodgett pronounced sentence over the master mind of Chicago's whiskey conspiracy, Jacob Rehm. The sentence is six months in the county jail and $10,000 fine.</p>
   <p>No comment is needed for those who have followed all the trials closely. Had the sentences been pronounced in Russia or in Turkey, every one would have talked about miscarriage of justice. But here in civilized America, such a thing may not be said, because it would be "contempt of court" and the judge could send anyone to jail, who would call the sentence he pronounced on the scoundrel Rehm, unjust because too light.</p>
   <p>As we do not want to make ourselves liable to contempt of court, we are not going to say that the decision of Judge Blogett is insolently unjust, that it is a mockery of justice, that it offends the sensibilities of people more than any fraud of the whiskey ring. We do not affirm all that. Nor do we want to affirm that the federal prosecuting prosecuting attorneys could not have treated Rehm more considerately, had each one of them received $10,000 from Rehm's robbery loot. We do not want to affirm such things because we would <pb facs="5418474_4_1161.jpg" n="2"/>be guilty of contempt of court and also because we want the reader to draw his own conclusions. Every one knows that Rehm was the originator of the whiskey conspiracy and that his proceeds from it amount to about a quarter of a million dollars. The fact of the matter is that those witnesses who told the truth receives a sentence twice as heavy as Rehm who was called a perjurer by a jury of 12 men. Many have reproached us for having attributed the severity of A. C. Hesing's punishment to his leadership of the people's party in 1873. Now that Rehm has been convicted we leave it to our readers to form their opinions in regard to A. C. Hesing's sentence.</p>
