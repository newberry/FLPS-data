   <p>Chicagoans should well remember the Sanitary District scandal, for it died down only a short time ago. They will be paying for the waste and extravagance of the members of that Sanitary Board for years to come. It seems that they have learned no lesson from the disclosure of those dishonest deeds, however, for they have not used caution with other officials who disburse money collected through taxes, nor prevented them from following the unscrupulous example of the Sanitary District grafters.</p>
   <p>In its report to the Governor, the newly elected West Park Board proved that during the previous Board's term of office the latter was guilty of the offense of the Sanitary District Board--the former members of the West Park Board had squandered large amounts of the taxpayers' money. Contrary to law, they had placed hundreds and thousands of their party workers on their payroll, although <pb facs="5418474_4_1255.jpg" n="2"/>there was no actual need for the services of these workers. As everyone knows, civil service laws decree that appointees of this kind may be hired only temporarily--for no more than sixty days; otherwise all existing vacancies must be filled by people who have passed civil service examinations. In order to simplify matters, the West Park Board held no examinations; thus it was easy to fill vacancies in newly created positions with job hunters or relatives--regardless of their eligibility. In this way, the parks which were intrusted to the care of the Board were allowed to go to rack and ruin.</p>
   <p>The mismanagement, graft, and failure to obey the law have been so flagrant that the State's attorney has taken a hand in the matter, and he will endeavor to punish the guilty as they deserve--by sending them to jail or to the penitentiary. But is it not true that the citizens of Chicago are also responsible for permitting such conditions? Whenever a scandal of this kind is revealed the citizens become highly indignant; but why do they not pay attention to the character of the persons whom they place in responsible positions? They certainly know that certain of our politicians are corrupt to the bone, and that when one of them is elected to office he immediately begins to look upon that office as the <pb facs="5418474_4_1256.jpg" n="3"/>"goose that must lay golden eggs". Why do so many of these politicians get rich so much more quickly than other persons? Is their pay the source of their wealth? Not a few of our citizens are familiar with the story of the development of many an influential but notorious politician.</p>
   <p>Under present conditions no one need be surprised at occasional scandals. But the number of scandals would be considerably reduced if our citizens would keep their officers under closer scrutiny. Scandals are usually revealed through accident or political malice. The former Park Board hailed from the ranks of the Republicans; the present Board consists of Democrats. If a Republican Board had been successful in the recent election, then undoubtedly the inclination and haste to divulge the misconduct of the former Board would have been much less in evidence. This is not intended as an attempt to cast aspersions upon the Republican party. Indeed not! The Democrats have often followed the same principle. But the gullibility and indifference of the people who permit themselves to be mulcted by smooth politicians, and yet who continue to trust the latter with their hard-earned dollars, is indeed astonishing!</p>
