<title level="a">WOODMAN ATTEMPTS TO ASSOCIATE ALTGELD WITH MCDONALD.</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Republicans hope to use... Police Court Judge Woodman as the guardian angel for Fifer... on the following pretext... The honorable Woodman made a sensational admission in court last Saturday... It only involved a $50,000 bribe and so he tried to associate the name of Mike McDonald, the infamous gambler, with Altgeld.</p>
   <p>A party trick... seized upon by the party organ, the Tribune, with avidity.... That Mike McDonald tried to bribe Woodman, no one doubts. Woodman himself admits he took the money... he kept it for days and arranged another interview... presumably for more... and then adroitly adds Altgeld's name.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago, where everybody knows and vouches for Altgeld's character and honesty, any combination which includes a person of McDonald's type, is simply unthinkable and is therefore considered only in its true light, a desperate move by "Know-Nothing Joe" to avert a political disaster which prompts him to grab for the mud pile.</p>
   <p>But it is not meant for Chicago. The object is to create prejudice by <pb facs="5418474_4_1402.jpg" n="2"/>linking McDonald's name with that... of Altgeld, to show that a gambler has considerable influence with the potential Governor and this will irk the rural population.</p>
   <p>What does Judge Altgeld say to this? He replies:"I am not surprised at anything when Woodman is the source. First of all, the Governor has nothing to do with the domination of Justices of the Peace. The judges of Cook County elect them and the Senate affirms the selection. The Governor's only connection with it, is a final certification. when I was a judge on the Superior Court, I objected twice to Woodman's two elections, as his reputation at the Desplaines Street station, where he acted as policecourt judge, was very unsavory." ("Aha!" - editor's remark.)</p>
   <p>"Hundreds of men and women were arrested at night so that Woodman could extort $1.00 from each for signing the bail-bond papers. My opposition succeeded in 1890, but Governor Fifer intervened and saved him. In regard to McDonald, every politician knows, that he collaborated with others to defeat my nomination, that he favored Wilson, then General Black and finally, when it appeared definite that I was given the nomination, he scrambled to the bandwagon of the winner, just as he always did."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1403.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Altgeld might have added, what little opposition he finds in Cook County, is centered in the McDonald clique. Here we find, next to McDonald, the ruling Republican boss, Perry Hull, right wing adjutant of Fifer.</p>
   <p>The Republican party press called Altgeld Nike McDonald's man. The trumpets are blaring forth with greater vigor now. It won't help much. Altgeld's past, his entire life history, his flawless career as a judge who inspired fear, because he would give no quarter to men of the McDonald and Woodman variety, that is his great protection against the miserable aspersions which Fifer employs in the hope of winning.</p>
