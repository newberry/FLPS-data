   <p>P. 5 The German Republican Central Organization of Cook County, held its meeting yesterday, at which the delegates from Will County were also present. The committee to whom was assigned the task of working out a constitution plan for the German Republican state organization of Illinois, submitted its report to the meeting. The same was read by Joseph Brucker, Chairman of the committee, and found full approval. This was followed by a short speech by Mr. Brucker in which he said, that a German Republican delegation was sent to Peoria, to be present at the state convention. It is the job of these delegates to interest more people in this organization so that at the end of June, a German Republican state convention can be planned.</p>
