   <p>The monthly business meeting of the German Section of the"Socialistic Labor Party" was held yesterday afternoon at 54 West Lake Street. After the agent Mr. Bartels, opened the meeting, A. Florus was elected, Chairman.</p>
   <p>The Secretary of the Society read the minutes of the last session, which accepted, they elected Mr. Franz, Secretary of Finances in Mr. Jeffer's place,who on account of business difficulties, could not keep the position. A large number of new members were also admitted. The departing secretary of finances reported on membership contributions. Waller reported that the Revision Committee had finished the semi-annual revenue report of the German Section, and found same correct in every respect. Agent Bartels reported further, that on the corner of 22nd and Wood Streets, a new division has been formed, which promises to have a large membership.</p>
   <p>It would not be a bad idea to adopt a policy of employing experienced agitators, and pay them according to their work.</p>
