   <p>Mr. Lorenz Brentano can look back with pride on yesterday's meeting at Miller's Hall, which once and for all disproved the assertion that the Germans were against his election. The spacious hall, upstairs as well as downstairs, was completely filled, and the meeting was not only attended by Republicans, but also very considerably by Tilden-Republicans, yes even by dyed-in-the-wool Democrats.</p>
   <p>After a few other speakers had spoken, Mr. Brentano was requested to speak. He said:</p>
   <p>You have heard quite often that I am a German. I recollect a few words Carl Schurz once said in Munich: "Should I repudiate a venerable mother because I have a bride to whom I am devoted in love? Should I deny that with natural feeling I am attached to the old fatherland, while at the same time I belong with heart and soul to America? I am standing before you not as a German, but as an American citizen (Applause) <pb facs="5418474_4_1146.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Brentano then came to speak of the civil service reform. He told that he had thoroughly studied the German civil service and promised to try to have a similar system introduced in the United States....</p>
