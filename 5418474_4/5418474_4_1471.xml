   <p>A large number of Alderman Frank A. Stauber's friends, have answered the call of the "Fackel" to help to celebrate the victory, as the result of the well known Stauber-Mc Grath case, and to get the facts of the proceedings of this process, which were not mentioned in the capitalistic press. At this meeting, William Bluhm functioned as chairman, and A. Spies as secretary. He made the purpose of this meeting known, and introduced Richard Prendergast, the Attorney for Stauber, in the Stauber-Mc Grath court battle. Mr. Prendergast briefly explained the whole case, and found it appropriate, that the victory should be celebrated by all honest citizens of Chicago. The political parties anxiety for supremacy is only natural, but the character of our Institutions demands, that the decision of the majority, is the law, by which we have to abide. But a victory, is a victory only then, when the criminals receive the punishment, which they justly deserve.</p>
   <p>Therefore the following resolution has been resorted to! In consideration of the fact, that the appelate Court decided against the manipulation of the election judges of the 7th precinct of the 14th ward, and in consideration that almost a <pb facs="5418474_4_1472.jpg" n="2"/>year has elapsed, since the criminal election judges Gibbs and Walsh, have been committed to the Criminal Court, but no steps have been undertaken by our Attorney-general, to have Justice meted out to them, therefore we, the citizens of the 14th ward, decided at this mass-meeting, to request of our servant the Attorney-general to do his duty and bring the criminals to justice.</p>
   <p>Paul Grattkau addressed the meeting in the German language, with highest praise for the defenders of the case, and urged all on toward a triumph, which will be of great significance not only for the present time but forever.</p>
   <p>Gratitude has been expressed for Judge Thomas A Moran's work, and for his final decision in this case; eternal gratitude has been expressed to the fearless Judge William K. Mc Allister. Frank A, tauber, expressed his gratitude to Richard Prendergast, Peter Petersen and the courts.</p>
   <p>As we are approaching elections again, it is of utmost importance, that our citizens would clean out the City Council's office, and vote men into it, who can be trusted as to their decency and honesty.</p>
