   <p>The American people are resigned to the fact that a certain amount of corruption is unavoidable in the administration of local affairs. It is actually unavoidable; it is the inevitable result of our political system which is founded on the erroneous assumption that all citizens are willing to serve their community honestly, unselfishly, and to the best of their ability. This system ignores human weaknesses, although it is generally well known that these weaknesses really exist. The French express this fact by the pun: "One does not serve it (the community), one uses it". [Translator's note: This quotation is translated verbatim. There is no English equivalent.]</p>
   <p>However, it was generally believed that the Federal Government is free of graft and corruption at least in peacetimes; of course in war, irregularities cannot be overlooked, for various reasons. Now it is evident that large divisions of the Government are permeated by graft. Therefore, the most important and the <pb facs="5418474_4_1238.jpg" n="2"/>most significant of all presidential orders is that which cancels air-mail contracts. The contractors who dealt with the Government had become accustomed to dealing with a go-between who had great personal and political influence with the proper authorities. It is not necessary to say that this system paved the way for graft and corruption. Now the contractors will have to become accustomed to dealing directly with the Government, without the mediation of influential politicians; and that is a step in the right direction.</p>
   <p>Its prime importance lies in the fact that the administration is wont to give no consideration to the Democrats who are involved. This is evident from the severe measures adopted by President Roosevelt in dealing with corruption in the C.W.A. The President again proved that he is no respecter of persons when he consented to revealing the corruption in connection with the letting of army contracts, which involved some of his most ardent supporters. Reports from Washington indicate that charges will be filed this week, and all attempts to shield those under suspicion have been futile. That, too, is one of the new courses of procedure, and, verily, it is not the least important one.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1239.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Republicans, who constitute the opposition party at present, have not criticized the administration's relentless prosecution of grafters. However, there are still some among them who have not yet felt the trend of the new course, and who believe that they can still succeed by employing bold methods. Senator Arthur Robinson of Indiana, is one of these. He declared in the Senate that the administration had been prejudiced in its investigation of the air-mail contracts, and that the committee did not summon a certain air line because the latter had contributed, nothing toward the Democratic campaign. Senator Black immediately replied that he would summon this company, and would inquire regarding its contribution to the campaign, if Senator Robinson would name the company. Senator Robinson thereupon saw fit to change the subject.</p>
   <p>One can understand the colossal stupidity of this representative of the people only when one considers his political background. He received his education in statesmanship during the dark age of Indiana's political history, when this state was ruled by the Ku Klux Klan and the Anti-Saloon League, in conjunction with a totally corrupt Republican administration. He was appointed senator by Governor Ed Jackson, who succeeded in evading prosecution on a charge of fraud by pleading that the time for filing criminal charges had elapsed. D. C. Stephensen, who <pb facs="5418474_4_1240.jpg" n="4"/>was convicted of murder and has been confined to prison for many years, was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Indians.</p>
   <p>No wonder a politician who has been brought up in such an unhealthy atmosphere cannot accustom himself to the pure air of the New Deal. It is regrettable that the Republicans did not dispose of this man long ago; for an honorable and intelligent opposition is always desirable under our political system; but that is out of the question, so long as the opposing party employs a man like Senator Robinson as its spokesman.</p>
