   <p>At the congressional election on November 7th six German born men, all told, will be candidates. Of them all, Mr. Brentano should have the best prospects, because in his district the ratio of German speaking citizens to the others is as favorable as in very few districts in the whole country. To deny the extraordinary ability of Mr. Brentano for a seat in Congress, can only be due to the most unscrupulous partisan enmity, or to the most bitter personal grudge, whose judgment is of no account. In general education in the thorough knowledge of public law, and in clear insight into the political and economic needs of the country, Brentano is far superior to the average caliber of English speaking Congressional candidates.</p>
   <p>When the German speaking citizens of Chicago in days when their countrymen in many other large cities of this land were still treated as "voting cattle", already had an influential and often determining position in the Republican party, they owed that in large degree to the efforts of Brentano as former <pb facs="5418474_4_1148.jpg" n="2"/>editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung......</p>
   <p>This is the first time that the Germans of the State of Illinois have been given a chance to send a man of their own national community to the National Chamber of Deputies.</p>
