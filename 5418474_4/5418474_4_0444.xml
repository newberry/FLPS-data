   <p>The Associated Societies for Local Self-Government met in Wicker Hall yesterday for their fourteenth convention. They dedicated themselves anew to the principles of personal liberty, self-government, and uniform taxation--principles for which the Association has fought for the last fifteen years, not for selfish reasons, but because, as several speakers stated yesterday, these principles are the foundation of a free country, and without them democracy cannot exist.</p>
   <p>A firm stand was taken against the prohibition of intoxicating liquor, against the ban on the use of tobacco, against the restriction of immigration, against the violation of freedom of the press and free speech, and also against the restriction of instruction in foreign languages.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0445.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In connection with this last restriction the following resolution was unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, There has been introduced in the State legislature a bill to abolish the teaching of foreign languages, or to restrict such teaching; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, This bill evidently is merely the first step in an attempt to muzzle or destroy the foreign language press, and to prohibit the use of any foreign language in any field, especially the fields of education and religion, which would be a very serious infringement upon the rights of the people; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Associated Societies for Local Self-Government condemn this and any similar legislation, and that their executive board is hereby ordered to do everything within its power to prevent the acceptance of this or any similar bill."</p>
   <p>It was decided that only those delegates whose liberal attitudes are a matter <pb facs="5418474_4_0446.jpg" n="3"/>of record shall be sent to the constitutional convention next January. It was also voted a committee of five be appointed who will assist demobilized soldiers in finding employment. Finally, an executive committee of one hundred and forty-five members was appointed to elect the officers of the Association for the current year. The committee will meet for that purpose on the coming Thursday.</p>
   <p>A congenial spirit prevailed throughout the convention. The meeting was called to order by Mr. John Koelling, president of the organization. After "The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung and an organization committee was appointed, Secretary A. J. Cermak read the executive committee's annual report, which contained a review of the work done by the Associated Societies during the past fifteen years, in the interest of personal liberty, local self-government, and equal taxation. He expressed the widely cherished hope that the dark clouds which loom on the horizon of personal liberty will soon vanish.</p>
   <p>According to the report, the War has created new problems for the Associated <pb facs="5418474_4_0447.jpg" n="4"/>Societies, and has imposed new duties upon the members. Therefore the organization has devoted its attention to the solution of these problems and the performance of these duties, even though the principles of the organization have suffered thereby.</p>
   <p>To quote the report: "We have always proved our loyalty, and we have shown that we were eager to make any sacrifice for our country, and every effort to help bring the War to a successful conclusion. We point to our activity, not to boast, but to show that the loyalty which we demonstrated during the war is partly responsible for the success of the opponents of personal freedom in forcing prohibition upon our people. But the battle against personal liberty is not yet over. Smoking, dancing, and singing may also become the objects of attack."</p>
   <p>The report then calls attention to the political activity of the Associated Societies; it recounts successes, and mentions the unsuccessful attempt of the organization to prevent the enactment of the "snooping" laws, and also <pb facs="5418474_4_0448.jpg" n="5"/>states that the Governor was earnestly petitioned to veto this legislation.</p>
   <p>"We fought the streetcar bill," the report continues, "and we recommended that a convention be called to frame a new State constitution, the issuance of bonds to cover the cost of improving streets and sidewalks. We also advocated the placing of all private banks under the State's supervision. Our hopes were realized in all these matters, of public interest."</p>
   <p>According to the report, 1,087 societies are now affiliated with the organization, which has a membership of 258,224. Twelve societies, totaling 1,449 members, were incorporated into the Association, and twenty-seven societies, totaling 9,553 members, severed their connection with the Association during the past year. Two prominent members, Karl Kellermann, who served two terms as president, and Dr. Robert Leonard, passed away.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael F. Zimmer was chairman of the convention. He appointed the <pb facs="5418474_4_0449.jpg" n="6"/>committee which selected the members for the executive board, and the committee on resolutions. While these two committees were at work, the convention listened to several speakers, who denounced the customary interference of world improvers and puritanical reformers.</p>
   <p>Adolph C. Weiner, chairman of the committee on political activity said that the work of certain religious sects was responsible for the victory of the prohibitionists, and recommended that church property be taxed.</p>
   <p>Edward Maher spoke on "Freedom of Speech and Radical Legislation". A. J. Cermak and Leopold Neumann, founder of the organization, also addressed the convention. The latter said that 423 German societies, with a membership of 45,976 men and 19,136 women, are affiliated with the Association.</p>
