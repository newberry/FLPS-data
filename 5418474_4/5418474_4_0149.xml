   <p>An extremely just and commendable article appeared in the Chicago Tribune regarding the two candidates who are competing for the post of the city treasurer. The Tribune has displayed its non-partisanship all during the present election campaign, and the article to which we referred and which we subsequently reprint, is a proof of it.</p>
   <p>The two opposing candidates for the office of the city treasurer are prominent citizens and who have taken an active part in the political and economic life of Chicago for a considerable time. The Republican candidate, Doctor Theodor J. Bluthardt has distinguished himself with a thoroughly satisfactory record as a public servant, holding highly important offices at various times. The other candidate, Mr. Gunther, was Alderman of Chicago through a period of several years, and enjoys an enviable record. The treasury department would, therefore, be safe in the hands of either of the two candidates. However, Doctor Bluthardt is, in one instance, superior to his competiter, althought not in the opinion of one Democratic newspaper, which gives a sketch of the life <pb facs="5418474_4_0150.jpg" n="2"/>of Mr. Gunther. It says: "He has given three years of distinguished patriotic service to his country during the Civil War." This would imply to the one not acquainted with the real facts that Mr. Gunther fought in the Army on the Union side, which fact alone would justify him to the votes of the old Union soldiers. But Mr. Gunther did not defend the Union, moreover, he offered his services to the Confederate States. Doctor Bluthardt, on the other hand, also departed for the South, on a different mission however, to fight against the Confederates. Doctor Bluthardt gave his services for the good of the country,while Mr. Gunther was engaged to do just the opposite. No doubt the old Union soldiers will vote for their old comrade.</p>
   <p>The fact that Mr. Gunther fought on the side of the rebels has been explained in the Daily News, a newspaper warmly supporting his election.</p>
   <p>Enmities which had its roots in the Civil War, should not be revived. Both of our candidates are men of irreproachable character. Nevertheless, the one who defended the cause of the Union should be given preference to the candidate who gave his support to the enemy forces.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0151.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Doctor Bluthardt's services to the country can not be emphasized sufficiently. As a physician in the Union Army, he won for himself the distinction of being zealous, able, and sacrificial. Furthermore, he also gave his blood for the Union in the battle of Lexington and Chattanooga. Not veterans of that great War only, but every patriot, young or old, should consider seriously the election of Doctor Bluthardt, the candidate for city treasurer.</p>
