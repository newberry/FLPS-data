   <p>The German Democrats wish the National Convention real success. Democracy at the Chicago Wigwam shall determine whether or not it will rise to the level of the progressive element of the population by recognizing some feasible reforms. These reforms are urgently desired by different nationalities who have made the United States their new fatherland....</p>
   <p>For almost one third of a century the American people have suffered under an oppressive class-legislation, and the expolited masses have been effected extremely. The intolerance of the Republicans, their hatred towards foreigners, and their attempt at regimenting personal liberty is no less contemptuous than their prohibitive tariff system against nations, whose voluntary immigrants colonize and enrich the northern section of the United States.</p>
   <p>Mankind is yearning for international fraternization. Inventions are conquering space and time upon the earth. The Democrats must declare themselves definitely against the regression of the Republicans and must meet the needs of the whole population.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0550.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Germans of Chicago trust the National Democratic Party for practical and definite methods. They demand a specific platform, and the nomination of a president and a vice-president, whose reputations will be a guaranty of their dependability. If this will be done, the quarter of a million German voters in Cook County will secure the victory for the Democratic Party in the state of Illinois. The Northwest will decide, whether or not the National Convention has done its duty, and whether the Democrats will win or be defeated at the coming election.</p>
   <p>Although the German raise no violent quarrels among their fellow-citizens, and are not political job-hunters; they nevertheless will vote in large numbers. But they will vote only for trustworthy leaders, who serve the people, and are devoted to progressive measures.</p>
