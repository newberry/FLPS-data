   <p>Moe Rosenberg, former boss of the Twenty-fourth ward, who died a few months ago, has left his friends in both parties a very disagreeable inheritance. The Revenue Department thought that Rosenberg had committed tax frauds on a large scale. When he found that his situation was none too good, he went to Washington for the purpose of effecting a compromise with the proper authorities. The Attorney General, however, who had jurisdiction over the case, did not agree to Rosenberg's proposals but ordered that he be prosecuted in the Federal Court at Chicago. The case never came to trial because Rosenberg died in the meantime.</p>
   <p>Now, however, a newspaper has gained possession of a copy of the statements that Rosenberg made in the office of the Attorney General. It has not yet been established how this record came into possession of the newspaper, and Attorney General Cummings has ordered that a rigid investigation of the matter <pb facs="5418474_4_1234.jpg" n="2"/>be made. Rosenberg tried to justify himself by stating that a large part of the money which had been entered on his records as a profit was not really a profit but merely a disguised campaign contribution made by the Insull Companies and the American Telephone Company.</p>
   <p>Rosenberg carried on a junk business. He claimed that the aforementioned corporations sold old iron and other metals to him at so low a price that he was able to realize an unusually large profit; but that this profit was not intended for him; that he merely acted as a mediator between the corporations and the politicians; that he passed the money on in the form of campaign contributions to politicians, especially to the leaders of the large local political organizations, and to members of the State legislature and of the city council, upon whose good will the companies were dependent; and that he had disbursed about half a million dollars in this manner in two years.</p>
   <p>Of course, it is not yet certain whether or not Rosenberg's statements are true. Most of the politicians in question assert that they never received <pb facs="5418474_4_1235.jpg" n="3"/>the contributions mentioned. Others admit that they received campaign contributions from Rosenberg but state that they were not nearly so large as he said. The corporations that allegedly made the contributions also declared that most of Rosenberg's statements are fantastic. They assert that they neither sold their old iron exclusively to Rosenberg nor sold to him at unusually low prices. They have offered in proof of their statements figures from their financial records; and it will not do to doubt these records. Thus it is by no means impossible that this scandal will peter out, just as did many other sensations that were dished up to the public.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, Rosenberg's statements, which were published in so sensational a manner, attracted much attention at first. It is difficult to understand this, since it has long been known that the so-called utilities have always been very liberal to politicians. It was common knowledge, for instance, that Samuel Insull, who was once the head of quite a number of utility companies, tried to purchase a seat in Congress for his friend Frank L. Smith. Of course, such practices are not in conformity with the demands of clean, <pb facs="5418474_4_1236.jpg" n="4"/>honest politics; but experience teaches that they have always been prevalent in our country.</p>
   <p>In any event, the Rosenberg matter shows that our laws are very deficient with reference to campaign contributions. All candidates for a national office, that is, all candidates for the presidency, vice-presidency, and Congress, are forced by law to issue sworn statements relative to the sources and the amounts of their campaign funds, and it is an undeniable fact that this legal provision has done much to purify politics. However, this law does not apply to candidates for a State office or a municipal office, and it certainly is not necessary to prove that the lack of such a law is responsible for much corruption.</p>
