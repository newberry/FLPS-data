   <p>Anton Imhoff, the candidate for alderman of the 16th ward said that the taxpapers had made a complaint that workers and tradesmen of said ward doubt his honesty very much and we are sure that they have all reasons to be doubtful. It certainly makes us feel very sorry that a man like Anton Imkoff could be dishonest after having 14 days previously sworn in and promised to be true, honest and loyal to his fellowmen, and now is in the hands of the police and locked up in Lakeview Station. Too bad a man like him ever received such a position in his ward. The prosecutor accused him of stealing from the State of Illinois, as he charged that ward for using 3 teams to do the workthere and in fact he only used 2 teams. He confessed that he had only paid for 1 team, $25.00 monthly and kept $1.25 a day for himself. Also he discharged old help, if they refused to vote for his party on election day. He also made political collections from his workers and always kept part of it himself.</p>
