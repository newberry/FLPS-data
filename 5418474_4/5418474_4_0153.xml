   <p>p. 5.. The Republican campaign of German-Americans was opened yesterday. Judging by the enthusiasm of the large assembly, the German-Americans of Cook County trust McKinley despite imperialistic propaganda. The demonstration was arranged by the German-American Republican Central Club of Cook County and was held at the Central Music Hall.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that the spacious hall was packed long before the appointed hour, several hundred persons congregated outside holding an overflow meeting. Their enthusiasm equalled the demonstration inside the hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. John H. Logeman, chairman of the campaign committee, introduced Mr. Franz Ambert as chairman of the evening. The octet sang the campaign song. The main address was given by Dr. Friedrich W. Holls of New York. He said in German:</p>
   <p>"... There never was a greater necessity to take a stand on political questions than at the present time. All of us are familiar with the exultant shouts of the Democratic Populistic Party: 'There is no question but that we have the good will of the German voters.'...</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0154.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Regardless of the many political errors made during the last few years, we enjoy prosperity as never before in the history of our nation. Our export is heavier than England's during the last two years. But best of all is the fact, that that well-being is not confined to a certain class of citizens, but is shared to some extent by every one....</p>
   <p>"It seems most appropriate to analyze our opponents' accusations, especially in regard to the foreign policy of our present administration.... Mr. Andrew D. White, the American Ambassador in Berlin, tells us that the friendly intercourse between these two nations was never more intimate than at the present time. This is true as far as diplomatic relations are concerned.</p>
   <p>"The attitude of the German people and of the press is of a different character. When it became evident that a war between the United States and Spain was unavoidable, hatred and jealousy for America seized a certain class of the German people. Some of the yellow press of Berlin and Hamburg competed in the misinterpretation of our motives in every way and manner.</p>
   <p>"But we had the approval of the German government and of all the Liberals. Among those was a large majority of scientists and others whose opinion was <pb facs="5418474_4_0155.jpg" n="3"/>of great value to us.... It is plain that our present administration pursues a policy of friendly relations with the German government. For this I have the assurance of Count von Buelow, the foreign minister of Germany. Furthermore, our present government was the only government to undertake diplomatic steps to end the Boer war.</p>
   <p>"Could any patriotic American have expected our government to declare war, in order to aid the Boer Republic?... Despite the lies of our enemies, it was humanitarianism that led us into war. It was a credit to the Democratic party which wanted action. The war with Spain was not due to material motives, our objective was purely idealistic....</p>
   <p>"In my opinion, not even the most fanatic anti-imperialist would maintain that we have absolutely no right to the Philippine Islands. Any high principled observer has to admit that we are justified in being there. And this being the case, we have to perform our duty until the Philippines demonstrate their ability for self government; and decide in favor of independence in preference to the American protectorate....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0156.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Is it possible that there are individuals who are helping the election of Bryan just by their indifference? Only recently an Irish politician in the East exclaimed: 'We are going to win, we have got the western Dutchmen;' If victory at the coming elections would come to our political opponents, a lasting stigma would mar the history of the Germans in America.</p>
   <p>"Every German-American should consider it his duty to engage in propaganda for the cause. Thus he would serve the country and deserve a well-earned share of the victory."...</p>
