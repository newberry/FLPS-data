   <p>Mr. Ernst J. Kruetgen, trustee for the World Exposition, also chairman of the German group to the Exposition, took office as member of the Municipal Authorities for Local Improvements to which he was appointed yesterday.</p>
   <p>After taking oath, Mr. Kruetgen entered the chambers of the Municipal Authorities, and was greeted by the president, Mr. Benjamin F. Lindheimer, and members of the Board for Local Improvements, who were present at the meeting. The session promptly changed into an executive meeting, the purpose of which was to elect Mr. Kruetgen vice-president.</p>
   <p>He said in his inaugural speech that he had been quite familiar with the city affairs for some time since he had the honor of serving as member of the School Board, also as a member of the Chicago Plan <pb facs="5418474_4_0994.jpg" n="2"/>Commission, and thus had ample opportunity of widening his experience.</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting, Mr. Kruetgen visited the chambers of Mayor Cermak, who extended a cordial greeting to the newly appointed member of the Board for Local Improvements. Mr. Cermak expressed hope for Mr. Kruetgen's success in the service of the city of his adoption.</p>
