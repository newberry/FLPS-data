   <p>It is rather peculiar of the Germans - who have always been governed by their well-developed mental power - to have remained political sentimentalists, while in the field of science and technology they have proven their alertness. Politics is a field of activity that must not tolerate thoughtless sentimentality, since it could only prevent the fulfillment of that which our normal mental powers direct us to do. This is not an uncommon occurrence in German history, to mention here only two added to it during recent years.</p>
   <p>They are: The wire sent by Wilhelm II to Ohm Krueger, and the "Nibelungen faithfulness" toward the Royal House of Habsburg. Two decades have passed since sending that dispatch to Krueger and history has shown that the political attitude expressed in that message was both detrimental and wrong.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_1000.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The blame for this error had to be placed on someone, why not the former German Kaiser? Of course, as head of the political institutions of Germany he should have foreseen the result. On the other hand, he yielded to persuasion, applauded by the entire German nation. The pro-Boer enthusiasm ran high in Germany then, and the message to the Boer President, indicated a personal message from the German people.</p>
   <p>Germany upheld the treaty with Austria, notwithstanding that nation's political selfishness, and thereby sealed its own doom. The Kaiser and his government were accused of political diplomacy, of which no information has reached the public. This is true theoretically, although, the treaty with the House of Hapsburg enjoyed great popularity in Germany. Furthermore, the German nation would have been puzzled over their country's failure to go to Austria's assistance at the outbreak of the World War. Nevertheless, it would have been the only <pb facs="5418474_4_1001.jpg" n="3"/>course to pursue, had Germany relied upon its own clarity of thought instead of sentimental tenderheartedness. . . . . Might is right in politics, and it is not a question of whether that might is achieved through political or economic maneuvers. Germany has no political power at the present time, thus it is compelled to endure wrongs very frequently....</p>
   <p>Humanity has not yet advanced to the point where its aspirations for righteousness would eclipse any selfish endeavor....Still, it would be almost impossible for the German nation to adopt a different standpoint than the one they think ideal. This has recently been demonstrated again. If only a few days ago the German people had been asked to state the name of the President of the United States, the majority would have been at a loss to do so. And this notwithstanding the fact that the President was the Food Administrator, and in this capacity alleviated the suffering in Germany considerably. Today his <pb facs="5418474_4_1002.jpg" n="4"/>name is known to every person in Germany, because it was he who gave the impetus to the moratorium. Germany will probably rename streets after him, for he is now considered the savior of Germany. Only time will prove whether or not he will live up to his reputation. Who can foretell whether the French Government will accept the plan? On the other hand, it is rather questionable whether the proposed moratorium would really stop bankruptcies in Germany. If the German people interpret President Hoover's attempt of assistance as an act born by compassion they will be greatly disillusioned.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoover is President of the United States; therefore, he works in the interest and for the benefit of his country. Mr. Hoover proposed the moratorium because of the imminence of inflation lurking in Germany, which might result in the loss of American investments. Therefore, the economic relief instituted by Mr. Hoover must be considered in the <pb facs="5418474_4_1003.jpg" n="5"/>first place as a protection of American interests. England's economic situation is similar to this country's economic picture, on these common grounds they are eager to co-operate. While Germany would be considerably helped by this plan, it must be regarded only as a means in the attainment of security for themselves, while upholding the economic life in Germany.....</p>
   <p>Thus far the United States does not contemplate releasing Germany from its obligations toward this country. Moreover, the great masses of the American people are not concerned whether or not Germany was responsible for the World War. The majority of the people are probably of the opinion that Germany's guilt was not greater than that of other nations. However, this is no grounds for releasing Germany from its obligations toward America....Germany would do well to limit its hopes of assistance from the American President, thereby running less risk of an equally great disappointment. The American capitalistic <pb facs="5418474_4_1004.jpg" n="6"/>interest is Mr. Hoover's first concern, the assurance of which warrants the proposed plan.</p>
