   <p>Under the auspices of the "German-American Democratic Central Society" a meeting was held in Orpheus Hall, 49 La Salle Street, yesterday evening, at which 150 persons participated. Every ward was represented. Max Stern presided and Adolph Sturm acted as secretary. The latter read a declaration of principles in which the fight against Gas and other Monopolies was recommended; also an honest city administration, based on business principles; also a more just equalization of taxes and maintaining of special branches of instruction in the public schools.</p>
   <p>Several speeches were made and in conclusion the nomination of Washington Hesing to the office of Mayor, was unanimously proposed. The regular meeting of the delegates will take place tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock in the Headquarters of the "German American Central Society," 167 Washington Street. Next Saturday, before primary elections, there will be held in the Central Music Hall a meeting, at which Washington Hesing is going to speak.</p>
