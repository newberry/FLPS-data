   <p>The Staats-Zeitung, yesterday morning, published the following concerning the alleged love-feast between the warring wings of the local Democracy. Last Friday afternoon a conference was held between the representatives of the Chicago Democracy and the Cook County Democracy in the room of ex-corporation Counsel Hutchinson in the upper story of the Briggs House, a sort of peace festival.</p>
   <p>The conference was of no definite result. It was but a talk over preliminaries to such a union; nevertheless the Democratic party organs contained the news that peace and harmony were again reigning in the ranks of the quarrelling brethren, and that henceforth, under the banner of united Democracy, the Republicans would suffer defeat after defeat. Probably the most astonished readers of this peace program were the members of the Chicago Democracy, and foremost of these the German-Americans, who unquestionably were the backbone of the organization. They were not astonished that such a union had taken place, because such a reunion was expected and hoped for; but that this unification of the two factions after two bitterly contested campaigns, in which the struggle was fought to the finish, should sneak in by night like a thief, such a thing was not expected. Much less still was it expected that the conference for such unification was held in the rooms of the same Jonas Hutchinson, who, but a few weeks ago was one of the principal grounds of attack used by the Chicago Democracy; that he and <pb facs="5418474_4_0556.jpg" n="2"/>the leaders of the "gang" were in fact responsible that the organization of the Chicago Democracy had become at all necessary.</p>
   <p>Time and again in the meetings of the Chicago Democracy it was asserted that these people who had occasioned the movement and against whom the attack was mainly directed, were to be removed before any reconciliation could take place; and now, yesterday, as the members of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Democracy came to the conference at the Briggs House where they were invited not by President Winter, but by Adolph Kraus, whom did they meet there? Jonas Hutchinson, John Hopkins, Alderman Gahan, Walter Bogle, John O'Brien, and James C. Strain, the representatives of the County Democracy. As representatives of the Chicago Democracy, were present - Frank Winter, Adolph Kraus, Austin Doyle, Charles Thornton, M. I. Keane, and I. I. Ludden.</p>
   <p>The meeting was secret. The Democrats who took part promised secrecy and still, the next morning, we find a report evidently inspired in the Democratic party organs which is interesting in one respect only. Not enough contented by speaking confidently about unification, although nothing but its preliminaries had been discussed and a sub-committee appointed to work out a plan, the gentlemen cooly considered the idea to remove the color-bearer of the Chicago Democracy, Carter H. Harrison. In short, they let the cat out of the bag a little too early. Are they already so confident as to suppose that they have the Chicago Democracy <pb facs="5418474_4_0557.jpg" n="3"/>in their breeches' pockets?</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung does not arrogate itself the right to demonstrate with the Democratic party, because it is not a party organ. It is in the position, however, to tell the gentlemen who are about concluding a peace to look at the people who supported Harrison and formed the backbone of the Chicago Democracy. The representatives of these people are not made of the stuff to be delivered in a bunch to an organization created over night, but they are men who have given up the idea of dancing to the tune of the party whip and of machine dictation. Never will these men, two-thirds of whom are German-Americans, recognize the leadership of the Gahans, the Hopkins, and the Strains; and should Kraus, who as we are informed is the leader of this unification movement, conceive the notion, he may find out that he has misjudged the meaning of the movement in favor of Harrison.</p>
   <p>A reconciliation with this committee can never be realized. This is the sentiment expressed by a large number of the most influential members of the Chicago Democracy. These men are disposed of and everybody believes that even if a union was perfected under their auspices, they would knife the leaders of the Chicago Democracy at their first opportunity.</p>
   <p>"Much better to enter a campaign as an independent party than to enter the field <pb facs="5418474_4_0558.jpg" n="4"/>in company with a Hopkins or a Gahan", said a prominent Democrat who was asked for his opinion. "The German-American voters, Democratic or Republican, are satiated with "drawing the chestnuts out of the fire" for the party they have begun to shake off party shackles and to feel in local elections as independent citizens. Should a reconciliation be perfected under disgraceful conditions, a large number of them would leave the Chicago Democracy as well, and join an independent party." But Americans and Irish agree with these sentiments and will never sanction a reconciliation with the "gang".</p>
   <p>The sub-committee, composed of Boyle, O'Brien, Cahan, Doyle, Kraus and Thornton, which is to perfect a reconciliation, plans to meet next Friday. As we are informed, Adolph Kraus is not ready to enter into a discreditable combination. "These people", he says, "must accept our conditions and our declaration of principles before we can talk of unification. If the Central Committee and the members of the Chicago Democracy agree to a reconciliation, then a general election shall decide who will be members of the Central Committee."</p>
