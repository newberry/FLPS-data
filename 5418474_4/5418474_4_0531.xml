   <p>Large crowds of German citizens of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd wards came to Muller's Hall last night to attend a mass meeting. It was the purpose of this meeting to break the power of political cliques of the most vicious type, dominated by C. Harrison; to retaliate for the unheard of suppression of German votes at the last mayoral election, and to make definite plans to elect the citizen candidate, S. W. Allerton.</p>
   <p>The speeches, above all the persuading force of A. C. Hesing's arguments, opened the eyes of the people to the real situation, and to the dangers that threaten German achievements. Every appeal for concerted action made by the speaker received a storm of enthusiastic applause, and this <pb facs="5418474_4_0532.jpg" n="2"/>was, undoubtedly, the best assurance that the whole situation with all its implications was well understood. The mass meeting made a unanimous resolution to fight against such oppression.</p>
   <p>The first speaker to appear before the assembly was S. H. Kerfoot, well-known real estate dealer. After expressing his regret for not being able to speak German, he said: "One thing is definitely certain, that our community is infested with the worst and most intolerable evils. The corruption and negligence of the municipal, county, and state administration has become a disgrace, and the people must remedy this situation. The demagogue, C. Harrison, is the embodiment of this evil." The speaker has known this man for over 30 years; he assisted in Harrison's first election, but deserted him when the latter sold out to the chief of gamblers, M. McDonald. At the time when there was a scarcity of money, McDonald paid Harrison's taxes, totaling $27,000. "When Harrison became mayor, he was a poor man, but he was a millionaire when he left the office."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0533.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The applause which followed the speech became overwhelming as soon as Hesing appeared upon the rostrum.</p>
   <p>"I do not need to tell you," the new speaker commenced, "that I am glad to see so many German citizens here, with the hall filled to the last place. I believe you have come to achieve what is best for Chicago. This reminds me of the uprising of the Germans 36 years ago, when they were seeking deliverance from the tyranny of the Irish.</p>
   <p>"Today the situation is just as threatening as then. For this reason I appeal to you to put aside all party interests, and to become fully aware of the dangers. If decent citizens are robbed of their right to vote, then they must, irrespective of party affiliations, defend their human rights if they want to rescue themselves from mental slavery.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0534.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Why is it that the Irish controlled the 20th, 21st, and 22nd wards completely, although these are overwhelmingly German? We have now two candidates for mayor. The Harrison gang brought about the nomination of their chief with brutal force. In the 5th ward 110 of the 165 German votes were destroyed; and the same thing happened in other wards. Everywhere the Germans were prevented from voting by brutal force. The Irish element rules our city, our country, our legislature, and wherever there are official positions to be had. Even the German park commissioners are not safe any more. They want to replace old Mr. Karnatz, who created the beautiful Garfield Park, with an Irishman. We are protected from complete ruin by that law, which restricts taxation and debts of our city. If it were not for this, we should have been betrayed by a corrupt council long ago, as in New York City.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0535.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"The only possibility to save ourselves from destruction is the election of a man, who is capable and unimpeachable. From such a man only can we expect protection and justice, and such a man is S. W. Allerton."</p>
   <p>Hesing's speech had an overwhelming effect and when he concluded the audience again gave him a thunderous applause.</p>
