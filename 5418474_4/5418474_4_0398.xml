  <body>
   <p>The dissatisfaction with the primary elections which never stopped since the primary laws were introduced five years ago, is now receiving more vigorous expression on the part of the State Legislature. The urge to economize is here, and since primaries cost money, much money indeed, members of both houses in Springfield carry themselves with the idea to propose, in the coming session, the repeal or the alteration of the laws governing primary elections. This is a problem which is of primary interest to the voters of our State.</p>
   <p>It is known that not all states have legalized primary elections. Their intention is clear. They [laws] are to make it possible that individual candidates for political offices should no longer be appointed by the bosses, <pb facs="5418474_4_0399.jpg" n="2"/>but by the voters themselves. This purpose has not been fulfilled by them. The party machines have managed to keep their influence as heretofore. The wishes of the party leaders remain predominant in the making of the list of aspirants for office, and whom the gods of the party disapprove of has little hope of being nominated. The difference between now and then is that before, under the boss system, the candidates were selected by the various party conventions, the party leaders took over the responsibility and, so certain limits with regard to the candidates' moral and other qualifications, could not be overlooked, unless they wanted to incur the danger of being hurled from their throne. Now, however, they may continue in the exercise of their power with respect to the choice of candidates, but need assume no responsibility, because formally the candidates are nominated by the voters. It is, therefore, not better but worse.</p>
   <p>One is reminded of the attacks upon the candidates that used to be on the ballot at every primary. Who knows them all, who can call their names! Any one possessed of some political ambition, and of these there are quite <pb facs="5418474_4_0400.jpg" n="3"/>many, may make use of the latter in his aspiration for nomination in the primaries. In such manner, the average voter's sense of judgment becomes confused and the distinction between the chaff and the wheat becomes increasingly difficult. In this case, it is much better if the party administration, which knows its people well, appoint the candidates and at the same time carry the responsibility for them. The present condition is so muddled that it makes for political chaos.</p>
   <p>A further reason for speaking against primary elections is the fact that they are in a position to gravely jeopardize the unity of the parties. This may happen when aspirants for the same office within the party exceed,in the struggle for the primaries, the limits generally set for the campaign between parties. We are reminded of the bitter strain exerted by Judge Lyle and Mayor Thompson in behalf of the nomination for mayor within the Republican party. Candidates from two opposing parties could not have bombarded one another with accusations more grave than those of the two Republicans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0401.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>That, under such circumstances, harmonious cooperation within party may be impeded at the time of the main elections is rather clear. Viewed from the standpoint of the parties the primary elections have done nothing but damage.</p>
   <p>Now, as a last and most essential objection to the primaries, comes the question of costs. Money is scarce these days in all public banks. One must save where saving is possible. Since through the abolition of the primary laws considerable sums could be saved each year we would welcome the realization of the plans for their repeal. Nothing good came from the primary elections, they justified no need, and to spend money for superfluous things neither the state nor any other branch of the administration can afford. The question of expense (as such) should be reason enough to do away with the primary elections.</p>
