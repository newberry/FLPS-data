   <p>We have always been of the firm opinion, that Politics and Religion are two different things, which should be kept apart everywhere.</p>
   <p>We noticed lately, that certain Chicago clergymen have apparently forgotten the purpose of their profession and are openly preaching their partisan political attitude from their pulpit. Some even went so far, to call the Lord's blessings down on some favored political leaders.</p>
   <p>We must express our disgust concerning these politically overheated churchmen, who have been hired and paid, to preach the gospel and only religious subjects.</p>
   <p>To mix religion and politics is a dangerous experiment, which has been tried and practiced with disastrous effects in the old country, which for this reason has a list of bloody wars and slaughters on its record. Religion, if drawn into politics, is a bitter enemy of freedom of thought, which is one of the most important fundamentals of "Liberty" as we know and idolize it in this country.</p>
