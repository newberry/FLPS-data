   <p>As far as the political hatred and race prejudice between the North and the South is concerned, the German press must of necessity be neutral, adjusting its political activity toward the preservation of the German national traits and characteristics. It is not exaggerated to affirm that the German press has a mission to fulfill, that is, to protect the common interests of all against the Anglo-American conceitedness.</p>
   <p>Public opinions indicate the summary of individual opinions; we need a German organization to represent the common impulse of Germans. A German headquarters should be the rendezvous of the German delegates to the National Democratic Convention, and also for visitors to the Chicago World's Fair. There are 400,000 Germans in Chicago, and for the presidential election there are, at least, 50,000 German speaking citizens registered. The economic conditions of the German population are increasingly prosperous, and represent considerable material interests. We can not relinquish political power and administration to the Irish and Americans. We are capable of governing ourselves, and we are in the majority in many election <pb facs="5418474_4_0826.jpg" n="2"/>districts.....</p>
   <p>The peculiar conditions, which exist among the population of Chicago and the Northwest, require that the Germans assert themselves politically. They are well off materially, and can spare time and means to stand on their own feet. The German laboring class has clearly proved that the German masses can organize themselves and become jointly responsible. Clubs and lodges are common among them, but everywhere there is an apparent lack of political activities.</p>
   <p>In this day and age of the division of labor nearly all citizens have the necessary time to discuss their political and economic questions and to take part in election campaigns. Chicago workers have ample time to meet their political obligations, and to form their viewpoints in regard to trusts, protective tariffs, and other matters harmful to the commonwealth...</p>
   <p>Our German manufacturers and master-mechanics have come from the labor classes and do not constitute a special clique of exploiters. What they possess they have earned, without exploiting their workers, or without taking undue advantage <pb facs="5418474_4_0827.jpg" n="3"/>of their customers. The German working classes in Chicago and vicinity have roomy comfortable homes for their families, which do not give evidence of poverty...</p>
   <p>The German socialistic labor movement in Chicago has materialized into trade unions, and the former political labor party has broken up. Not a single club or association of workers for political and election purposes exists, because the German socialists are aware of the fact that a Labor party in Chicago cannot succeed at the presidential election. Both of the national parties are now engaged in a controversy about political economy, which enables the Socialists to discuss their own aims and proposals within the general election movement, and to be active in German political organizations.</p>
   <p>John P. Altgeld has proclaimed his position toward the social question of the present very definitely, and it is useless for employers and employees to take into consideration a special political Labor Party. There has already been an "Altgeld Labor Legion" organized within the Democratic party and its aim is to clarify the feasible demands of the local and national labor movements.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0828.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is the duty of the well-to-do Germans to establish permanently a political central office in order to make the German influence upon American politics felt, and to prevent the useless dissipation of German votes on election days. John P. Altgeld, the Democratic candidate for governor, is a worthy representative of the German nationality, and a friend of progress. He is not afraid of the urgent economic problems of our time. We could carry on our own German election propaganda, because whole districts of Chicago and whole towns of Cook County are German. This would give us an opportunity to manifest to the alien-haters the standpoint of the Germans. The heat of the summer must not scare us away.</p>
