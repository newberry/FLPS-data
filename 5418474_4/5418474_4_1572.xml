   <p>On several occasions Sheriff Agnew has tried to mislead public opinion by asserting that "Hesing's paper" (The Illinois Staats-Zeitung), in disclosing his (Agnew's) delinquencies, follies, and crimes, is merely venting a personal spite, since [A.] Hesing had been trying to "run" the Sheriff's office, and had been foiled in that attempt. In order to enable the people of this city to form a correct opinion on this matter, I desire to give them a full and explicit statement of whatever personal relations have existed between the Sheriff and me.</p>
   <p>To begin with, I have never asked Agnew for a favor in the shape of the appointment of any friend of mine to an office under him. The only exception, if it may be called an exception, consisted therein, that I joined several very prominent citizens of Irish extraction in recommending that Peter Mundt be appointed jailer. However, neither in that case, nor in any other, did I take the initiative in recommending a new appointment.</p>
   <p>When it was rumored that Agnew intended to appoint McHale and his own brother, <pb facs="5418474_4_1573.jpg" n="2"/>Luke, to responsible positions, a committee of our very best and most highly respected citizens of Irish birth called upon me and requested that I do everything possible to prevent such a disgraceful act. They told me that McHale was a rascal who had never done an honest day's work in Chicago, a drunkard and a ruffian, and that Luke Agnew was in the habit of "going off on a spree" and staying drunk for days and even weeks. I saw Agnew, repeated to him what I had been told, and cautioned him against making such appointments. He admitted the facts, but tried to tone them down somewhat by saying that McHale had been rather wild, but yet he appointed McHale as well as his own brother.</p>
   <p>On that same occasion I spoke to him about the bailiffs; I told him that he could not conduct his office successfully unless he retained some of the old and experienced help, since he himself was utterly inexperienced. I advised him to secure the services of Tim Bradley, and to retain men like Merrill, who had been chief bailiff in the criminal court for many years, and had carried out his duties in a very efficient manner.</p>
   <p>I also asked that he keep Galpin, who had filled his position with great credit <pb facs="5418474_4_1574.jpg" n="3"/>to himself for fifteen years; Probsthan who had done duty in the criminal court for eight years; and Ostermann and George Voecke. In reply he told me that he could not, and would not, retain Merrill, but would appoint in his stead Hutchinson, a man of rather dubious character, who is known for his habitual association with gamblers, ruffians, and people of that ilk. He also mentioned, as fit to be retained, two men who were the very type of men who ought to have been kicked out, for they are well-known characters among "sporting men," in nowise trustworthy, and the very last men in the community to whom should be entrusted the highly important and responsible work of selecting jurors to try gambling cases. Thus I tried to "run" the Sheriff's office, and thus I succeeded!</p>
   <p>Very soon afterwards I was informed that the Sheriff was going from bad to worse; that he was hardly ever sober; that he was a regular visitor of houses of ill fame on Fourth Avenue, and was even attempting to entice his own subordinates to accompany him to haunts of prostitution; that he was a frequenter of well-known gambling resorts; that his appointees in the county jail were committing the most despicable outrages against decency and discipline, by holding veritable <pb facs="5418474_4_1575.jpg" n="4"/>orgies under the very noses of the prisoners whom they were appointed to watch.</p>
   <p>Then I sent for him and advised him to mend his ways, emphasizing to him the danger of destroying his reputation in the community, and of bringing disgrace upon his best friends. He listened to my advice and solemnly promised to reform, but he did nothing of the kind. The disreputable characters who brought disgrace upon the office were retained in their positions, and conditions at the jail became worse than ever before, in spite of the remonstrances of Peter Hand.</p>
   <p>The climax was reached when the Sheriff, having been in office for scarcely six weeks, became the recipient of a diamond star, allegedly worth $2,000. This was a gift from those very disreputable men who are a curse and a bane to our city, and whose immunity from punishment for their offenses against our criminal laws is based on their ability to control the selection of jurors by the Sheriff. [Translator's note: In an editorial entitled "Gamblers, Police And Courts" which was published in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung on February 1, 1875, the <pb facs="5418474_4_1576.jpg" n="5"/>value of the star referred to was given as $3,000, while the author of this article estimates it at $2,000.] I did, and still do, consider Agnew's acceptance of a gift from such a source a slap in the face of public opinion, and, acting upon that conviction, I publicly exposed the disgraceful transaction in such terms as it deserved.</p>
   <p>The manner in which Agnew took revenge, namely, by removing from office all men who ought to have been retained in the interest of the community, is well known to our citizens. What may be less generally known, is the fact that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, previous to the last election, took a very determined stand against the extravagantly high costs of the Sheriff's office and insisted that they be substantially decreased.</p>
   <p>That, probably, is the real reason for Agnew's bitter and venomous spite against me. I know of no good reason why the Sheriff of this county should make from $60 to $75 per day at the expense of the prisoners under his charge, or, to be more correct, at the expense of the taxpayers who pay him about four times the amount <pb facs="5418474_4_1577.jpg" n="6"/>which he actually spends for the sustenance of those prisoners.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I wish to say most emphatically that I have never desired, or attempted, to "run" the Sheriff's office, or any other office. It is well known in the community that I have been active in politics, but all my efforts have been confined to organizing political parties and managing political campaigns. They have never been devoted to the petty business of finding political jobs for men under the officers elected by the people. Where and when my advice has been desired I have given it freely and without prejudice or malice, but I have never tried to force anybody to follow my advice. Every department of our municipal government will bear witness to the truth of this assertion. So would Sheriff Agnew, if the truth were in him.</p>
