   <p>The results of last Tuesday's election involving the various bond issues coincided with the general predictions of those who are fairly well informed about our city and county affairs. The voters voiced their objections to all appropriations, with the exception of the proposed bonds for the enlargement of Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>The election results are so lucid that even a simpleton finds no difficulty in reaching logical conclusions and adjudging the sentiment, as well as the motives, of our citizenry. Among the city and county politicians we probably find nary a one whose mental capacity denies him sufficient understanding to comprehend <pb facs="5418474_4_1010.jpg" n="2"/>just why the voters objected to the bond scheme. They know where to look for the stumbling block but pretend to be naive, and are animated only by the desire to enjoy the warmth of the cradle and prolong its comforts as long as possible. At present this represents their only requirement for existence, and to attain it, they are prepared to feign even greater naivete and stupor, if such be necessary.</p>
   <p>The fact that the voters even declined to reimburse the property owners whose land was obtained by condemnation proceedings, regardless of the constantly mounting interest payments caused by such a delay, bespeaks an utter lack of confidence in Michael Faherty. And it must be remembered that this gentlemen disburses the money to those whose grounds were acquired in order to broaden the streets. Such a vote <pb facs="5418474_4_1011.jpg" n="3"/>of mistrust is not a novelty, and we may expect repetitions. Mr. Faherty is genuinely comatose and indifferent; he ignores the matter and so does his chief, the mayor. They have resorted to this method before, and such a successful political procedure will be continued as long as the voters tolerate it.</p>
   <p>However, considerable time will elapse until the people have another opportunity to assert themselves, and in the interim the herd will monopolize the crib for better or worse. Lately the fodder has not been so plentiful. The harvest showed diminishing returns as a result of haphazard manuring. The fertility of the soil, maintained by a conscientious citizenry, has not kept pace with our expectations. But even so, a little is preferable to nothing, and no one knows when auspicious seasons will recur. After all, the opinions of the voters <pb facs="5418474_4_1012.jpg" n="4"/>are a strange, flexible entity. Whoever is elevated to the very sky today, may be condemned tomorrow; and the converse is equally true.</p>
   <p>The politicians, as everybody will agree, are baptized with all varities of waters, hence, subscribe to any dogma. They are experienced, acquire a pachydermal hide, remain motionless during a shower and then divest themselves of the droplets in true canine fashion, like Fido returning from the pond. Whoever intends to be a"successful" politician must first acquire that essential tough, impermeable epidermis so necessary to outlast the voters. The latter gentry usually forget within a year or two just what facts made a certain candidate undesirable and also the basic reasons for the accusations. When the candidate makes his appeals to be re-elected, he faces virtually a new public. After all, the voter has a proverbially <pb facs="5418474_4_1013.jpg" n="5"/>defective memory, and that fact is the foundation of the career of the able politician.</p>
   <p>It is rather unusual for voters consistently to disapprove certain measures for years. If the proposals of important public officials meet with constant rebuffs, then pressing reasons must have necessitated these drastic rejections.</p>
   <p>Michael Faherty's bond issues have been definitely rejected several times by a large vote. That is evidence of the people's attitude. Regardless of this oftrepeated attitude he again insists upon placing the proposal on the ballot. He even threatens to call a special election (at public expense, of course) to attain his goal. Let us hope that the city council will nullify his intentions, since that body is fully aware of the public's sentiment. His attempt would be futile, but if it is even made, it would exact <pb facs="5418474_4_1014.jpg" n="6"/>several hundred thousand dollars from the citizens. However, we are still confronted with the problem whether or not our council is manly enough to cope with the infamous bond question. Even here it is customary to dance to the master's tune.</p>
   <p>Obviously, only one possibility exists whereby the property owners can be paid for their confiscated property within a reasonable time.</p>
   <p>Faherty's intention makes the answer apparent.</p>
