   <p>Hejmdal, the much-read Danish newspaper, says in today's edition:</p>
   <p>"The enemies of the opposition party seem to believe that the best weapon against A. C. Hesing is the unveiling of his past. Fortunately for Mr. Hesing it is precisely his past which entitles him to an office. If his opponents say that Hesing intends to rob the County Treasury to pay his debts. they contradict themselves. It is stupidity on the one hand to distrust a man and to consider him capable of committing a crime, and on the other hand to ascribe to him such nobility that for the sake of his creditors and to satisfy his obligations toward them, he would be willing to jeopardize his good name and his position of leader of the opposition party in Cook County. There are few who are so well able as A. C. Hesing to resist the allurements of public office.</p>
   <p>"As long as Mr. Hesing fought in the ranks of the Republican party, he did not lack recognition, unless the honors bestowed upon him by the Republicans were <pb facs="5418474_4_1181.jpg" n="2"/>merely granted by them to keep him in the Republican fold. Should Mr. Hesing have asked them to pay his debts as the condition of his further co-operation, they would have paid them at once. No one doubts that should Mr. Hesing return to the Republican fold as a contrite son, he would be a rich man next year as the result of Republican benefactions.</p>
   <p>"The prospects for Mr. Hesing's election are very good, and we will gladly give him our votes."</p>
