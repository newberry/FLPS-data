   <p>In the fall of 1873 the People's Party had a sweeping majority at the election that took place. The leaders of the incongruous and hitherto adverse combination, Irish and German, were impressed with the belief that a like success would be as easily attained at future contests. The leading spirit of the first named nationality got the most important and lucrative positions in the People's gifts, city treasurer, an office from which but few of his supporters derived any benefit, as it required but a small clerical force to run it. While the county treasurer, county clerk, and city collector's offices were conferred on men of the last named nationality, the patronage in the gift of these officials was extensive, and though some of their employes are men of the very worst character, we had no protest from Mr. Hesing, the autocrat-in-chief of the politics and politicians of Cook County, and self constituted conservator of the morals of public officials and their employes.</p>
   <p>Early in the fall of 1874 the politicians commenced operations; it was evident to the most casual observer that the leaders of both parties anticipated a close contest. Conventions were held by the People's Party, and nominations made that were condemned by the leaders. Withdrawals and new nominations were next in order, and although <pb facs="5418474_4_0623.jpg" n="2"/>this action was unprecedented it was sustained by the people, as it was evident they desired to have the best men placed on the ticket. At this time the press and the public had it that the office of sheriff was conceded to the Irish, probably on account of a majority of offices to which patronage was annexed being given to the Germans the year before. The candidates for the office were numerous, and never in the history of Cook County was there such a thorough canvass made by any candidates. The convention held in Turner Hall was intensely exciting, resulting in the nomination of Frank Agnew, and in the election held some two weeks afterward he ran ahead of his opponent some eight thousand votes, and ahead of the general ticket between four and five thousand, which demonstrates conclusively that he was the most popular candidate on either ticket.</p>
   <p>Now, as Mr. Agnew is unquestionably the choice of a large majority of the voters of Cook County, is it not, to say the least, both impertinent and presumptuous of Mr. Hesing to assume a dictatorship as to how the sheriff's duties are to be performed, and to insist on having men selected by him to fill various positions under the sheriff? The card published by him on the second inst., is disingenuous, inconsistent, and untruthful. He commences by asserting that he recommended no one to any position, and further on he plainly admits that he sent for Mr. Agnew and remonstrated with <pb facs="5418474_4_0624.jpg" n="3"/>him relative to some of his appointments, and then demanded the appointment of others and concludes in a tirade of slanderous abuse for which he is actionable at law. By what authority does he assume censorship on the official or private conduct of an officer who is accountable to the people only. His unparalleled effrontery is truly astounding. If he, in the role of editor and proprietor of a public journal, assumes such unwarrantable authority, why did he not protest against and expose the generally-admitted mismanagement and corruption practiced in the old county jail? Was it because Mr. Folz and his subordinates were Germans and members of the party who then permitted this Dutch bully to do as he wished because he claimed to carry the German vote in his breeches pocket. It is high time that means were devised to put a stop to this man's assumption of authority. If no other means be found, he should be prosecuted as a public nuisance.</p>
   <p>Yours, P. H. M.</p>
