  <body>
   <p>It should be pointed out once more that it is imperative to vote at tomorrow's election, for the thirty-million-dollar loan. The money was destined for relief, and has already been spent. If the voters do not grant this loan, then the whole amount must be raised immediately through taxes.This would, naturally, mean a considerable increase in taxes. If the loan is approved, it can be paid off gradually in the course of the next twenty years. For this no increase in taxes is necessary because during this long period, the amount can be raised from the regular tax income.</p>
   <p>For the authorization of the loan a majority of all the votes cast is necessary. Therefore every voter should consider it his duty to vote for the loan. Every vote not cast will have the effect of a vote against the loan when the results <pb facs="5418474_4_0371.jpg" n="2"/>of the voting are compiled. For this vote there is provided one of the small ballots which will be handed to the voter at the same time that he receives the large ballot. Pay special attention to this ticket, and do not place it in the ballot box until you have put your cross in the "yes" column. The matter is of great importance to every taxpayer.</p>
