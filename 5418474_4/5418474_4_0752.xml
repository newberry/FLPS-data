   <p>In the old days before there was a democracy it was believed: to whom ever God gave authority, the gift was accompained by intelligence for guidance. Since the offices are now a gift of the people, every one elected should possess the desire to thoroughly comprehend the interest of the people, and to serve them well. But Mayor Carter H. Harrison has given the people of Chicago mighty little opportunity to find out that he is so inspired. Only yesterday, especially to us Germans, who are according to his own estimate, about one third of the city's population, he briefly and authoritatively declared that he does not give a tinker's damn about our wants and due interests.</p>
   <p>The composition of the School Board, is to us of no inferior interest. Mayor Harrison treated the committee, as if they were school boys. The committee was from the German - American National Association, and asked for proportionate representation on the School Board for the Germans, but Mayor Harrison flatly refused this demand. Mayor Harrison, evidently forget, that those men were part of the population, whose paid servant he is.</p>
