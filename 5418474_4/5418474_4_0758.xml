   <p>In twenty "wigwams" of the Tammany organization office holders were chosen with the following result: a splendid victory of the Harrison followers over the Altgeld contingent! Although the exact results will not be known until later today, there seems to be no doubt that the mayor enjoys the full support of his party in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 24th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 33rd and 34th wards and the Tammany Democrats of the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd wards who will select their new officers on Monday, will also be faithful adherents to Harrison's cause, at least as far as the majority will be concerned. In many Wigwams resolutions were passed in which Harrison's re-election was endorsed. In the 26th ward however, where Altgeld lives, there the Harrisonites were not successful in obtaining an adoption of a similar resolution for which the mayor might express his gratitude-especially to Alderman Schlake. He insisted that the aforesaid petition be put to a vote which resulted in 50 against 38 votes, whereupon the city father declared, he does not wish the incident to be construed that he,(Schlake) is antagonistic to Harrison or a promotor of Altgeld's aspirations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_4_0759.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He only wishes to prevent dissension in the Wigwam, and there is sufficient time later, to give resolutions for endorsement, after the party selected its candidate for mayor.</p>
   <p>It is claimed, that Alderman Schlake's proceedings were received with considerable misgivings by the Harrison Camp, since it is known that Schlake's reelection is due only to the mayor's energetic intercession in his behalf; he therefore should have been more considerate.</p>
