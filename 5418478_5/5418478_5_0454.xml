   <p>If anything in Bohemian-America should fill one's heart with a keen feeling of joy, and strong hopes for the successful future of the American branch of the Bohemian nation, it is primarily the surprising growth of benevolent societies, both brotherhoods and sisterhoods.</p>
   <p>While it is an undeniable fact that holding a membership in one of the benevolent societies is a duty to all those who want to provide for themselves and their families in cases of sickness, death, and other untoward events, it must be admitted that our benevolent societies have, in addition to their purely practical, material value, a far-reaching cultural and spiritual value--a value which cannot be appreciated highly enough. They give a willing and generous response to all that may prove of general benefit to the Bohemian element as a whole. The analysis of this phase of their activities will have to be left to some future historian of Bohemian America--if such a person is ever found....</p>

   <p>The credit for a lion's share of this work is due to our ladies. Their organizations grow in size and power from day to day, and must be considered the most important elements of our public life at this time. Only a few months ago, the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) celebrated in a most adequate manner the securing of its twenty-thousandth member, and a similarly significant event, the attainment of a membership of ten thousand, was celebrated by the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Mutual Benevolent Sisterhood) last night....</p>
   <p>....The Grand Lodge of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota, in co-operation with all its Chicago chapters celebrated this event by a special festive meeting which included a musical program arranged for this occasion and lasted during all of yesterday afternoon and most of the night. The hall of Sokol Chicago, where the celebration was held, was filled to capacity....</p>
   <p>The program began at 2:00 P. M. with an address by Mrs. Katerina Porak who, in her capacity as president (sic) of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois <pb facs="5418478_5_0456.jpg" n="3"/>welcomed those in attendance....</p>
   <p>After Mrs. Porak's talk and the following duet..Mrs. Anna Stolfa, chairman of the central committee of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota, delivered one of her most remarkable speeches....</p>
   <p>The success of yesterday's celebration was complete, and we do not doubt that its perfect arrangement has secured for the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota many new friends, many new sympathizers in its work. Since it now has ten thousand members, over eight thousand of whom are in Chicago, the organization may soon be expected to pass another milestone.</p>
