   <p>Associations, clubs, and other organizations must help carry the burden of the war just like everybody else. This burden will certainly not become lighter; on the contrary, it is bound to grow heavier.</p>
   <p>If the membership in our organizations is not actually on the decline, it certainly is not on the ascendancy. This is the first burden, and the second involves a constant rise in dues. The sad fact cannot be denied that the majority of our associations suffer from a gradual decrease in membership. The prospects for a change in these conditions are certainly slim. Before the end of this war, a return of prosperity for our associations is hardly to be expected. And even when peace is here again, a turn for the better is not likely to come. The rise in dues, or rather, the extra dues for the emergency fund, has become a necessity resulting from the war. Everybody should acknowledge this fact.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0219.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The crisis through which all of our organizations are passing now should be met with untiring efforts on the part of all sincere members. But the danger threatening our organizations has one good feature. It forces and teaches the individual members to think about ways and means of warding off the menace. This may be the reason for numerous calls for the unification of all Free Thought brotherhoods recently. The time for such a step is more opportune now than it has been at any other time.</p>
   <p>Formerly, there were many obstacles in the way of such a merger. They can be removed now that the demand for concerted action is growing imperative. We published the opinion of Dr. Joseph P. Pecival, president of the Czecho-Slavonic Union, sometime ago. He is an ardent advocate of the proposed combine. Numerous brotherhoods and individual members also favor this move, as is evidenced by articles in various letters and organs of brotherhoods. They reflect a willingness to promote the merger; they expatiate upon the present opportune conditions and express the conviction that the proposal will soon become a reality. The Cesko-Slovanska Podporující Spolecnost (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent <pb facs="5418478_5_0220.jpg" n="3"/>Society) is the only one to hold its plenary meeting this year, and it is expected that the question of a merger will be broached there and then. The discussion will be of vital importance to the very perpetuation of the system of Czech aid societies in the United States.</p>
   <p>The organ of the C. S. P. S. (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society) published its financial report for the past year, stating that the organization had 24,148 members on December 31, 1917. At that time, certificates representing $16,484,250 in insurance were on hand.</p>
   <p>The fire which burned the Czech-English school [the building of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society] caused many of our societies to lose their meeting places and at the same time suffer large financial setbacks. We assume that part of the property was insured. Nevertheless, some societies, especially the older ones, mourn not so much for material property value, as for old minutes, which are priceless documents as far as the history of our associations is concerned. Numerous precious paintings from various lodge rooms were also lost.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0221.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This month is significant for all associations, for they should not miss the opportunity to buy Liberty bonds to as great an extent as their treasuries will permit. Our Czech organizations did their duty when the first and the second war loans were floated. They will again lead those who do their duty.</p>
