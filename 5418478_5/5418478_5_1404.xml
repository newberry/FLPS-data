   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) announces that further contributions to the fund for the starving Russian children were made by individuals and organizations. [Names of contributors and the respective sums are omitted in translation.] The total is $574.90, which, added to the previously collected $634.18, makes a grand total $1,009.08. Thus, the first thousand dollars contributed by Bohemian Catholics to aid the children of Russia was collected in a relatively short time. This fact does honor to our name in our desire to be helpful to our Slavic brethren, particularly when we look around and compare our efforts with those of other Bohemian organizations. But let us keep up the good work.</p>
   <p>Reverend Prokop Neuzil, O. S. B. [order of Saint Benedict] sent us all the contributions he had received; the reverend gentleman agrees with us that all gifts ought to be concentrated in one organization--the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku--which then may proceed to act in the name of all the Bohemian <pb facs="5418478_5_1405.jpg" n="2"/>Catholics.</p>
   <p>We have [already] forwarded the third shipment [of money], $369.38, to the Right Reverend Dr. Stojan for which he mailed us a receipt for 21,028 Czechoslovak crowns. This sum was applied to aid the children of Russia. All in all we sent $920.03; our fourth shipment will be forwarded as soon as the contributions increase. Thus, everybody may see that our aid has really been immediate. We ask all those who possess a noble heart and are able to help the Russian children, to continue this noble work.</p>
