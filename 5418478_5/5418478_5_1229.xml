   <p>The central committee to collect funds for invalid Czechoslovak Legionnaires, operating in Chicago and vicinity, held a regular meeting last Tuesday, December 5, 1922. The meeting was well attended by the officers of district committees. The only committee not fully operating is that of Oak Park, Illinois; it will be organized today, and our treasurer, Mr. Josef Placek, will tell the members how to proceed.....All other committees are operating; some of them turned their collections over to our treasurer as follows: Bohemian California and Lawndale, $459.60; Merigold (Novy Tabor), $250; Town of Lake, $177.25. The Town of Lake committee also reported that a Bohemian coal and ice company gave $200 to the cause.</p>
   <p>Since this money-collecting activity has been misused by some individuals who have collected certain sums without any right to do so, and have, consequently, not issued any receipts to contributors, our daily newspapers are to be asked to publish a warning against these impostors. Should any unknown collector <pb facs="5418478_5_1230.jpg" n="2"/>call and make requests for contributions he should produce his credentials upon request, and issue the regularly approved receipt for each contribution. These receipts were approved by the national committee located in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
   <p>The report that our Bohemian dailies are willing to publish the names of contributors and the amounts contributed was gratefully received. By doing so the Czech dailies will save some expense for the organization. The district committees are hereby requested to return the filled collection booklets [lists] as soon as possible so that the newspapers may begin publishing the names of all contributors.</p>
