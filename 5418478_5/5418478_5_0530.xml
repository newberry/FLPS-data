   <p>A welcome revelation in our Bohemian life is the way Bohemians, who formerly joined the societies of other nationalities in such large numbers, are now withdrawing in crowds and becoming members of Bohemian societies. This is no more than right and it is beneficial to individuals and societies alike. It does not strike us to say that perhaps some of these societies do not offer their members such advantages as are offered by the Bohemian societies, but if there were no other reason, we fail to see why Bohemians should join the societies of other nationalities if they derive no material benefits thereby. On the other hand, we see many reasons why Bohemians should remain members of Bohemian benevolent societies. Of these, the most important is that the strengthening of the benevolent societies means <pb facs="5418478_5_0531.jpg" n="2"/>for us a strengthening of our national consciousness, and in that is our strength, in that is our future.</p>
