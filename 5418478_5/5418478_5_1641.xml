   <p>When Herbert Hoover issued his call for $33,000,000 to keep from starving three and a half million of children in Central Europe, there was an immediate response from Czechoslovaks in America. In Chicago, the publisher and editor of the Daily Svornost set to collect a Czechoslovak fund for Hoover by appeals through the columns of that influential newspaper.</p>
   <p>It was difficult to make a showing of distinctly Czechoslovak gifts, because on the one hand wealthy members contributed through trade organizations directly to state or city treasurers of the European Relief Council, and on the other hand the working men, who have been most generous in supporting their native land, have about reached the stage where they felt that they had given enough. Since the summer of 1914 one appeal after another was made to Bohemians and Slovaks in America for funds. Considerably more than one million dollars was collected to finance the campaign for the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic. Hundreds of thousands were spent by women on comforts for Czechoslovak legionaires in France and Siberia. Many millions of dollars have been forwarded to the new Republic since the armistice in money and supplies destined for relatives, <pb facs="5418478_5_1642.jpg" n="2"/>as well as for the Czechoslovak Red Cross, the Child Welfare, to poor of various cities etc. Thus after more than six years of constant giving the new appeal on behalf of hungry children was apparently doomed to meet with indifferent response. The farmers gave the excuse that they could not sell their crops, and the working men in the city blamed their lack of enthusiasm on depressed industrial conditions.</p>
   <p>But it was necessary to stir up the Czechoslovaks to one more effort. The campaign of the European Relief Council, the appeal to all American people to feed hungry children, among them many Czechoslovak children, could not be ignored by those who were kin to the little ones fed by Hoover. Czechoslovakia in particular owes Herbert Hoover a great debt of gratitude. In April 1919, when food supplies in the newly established Republic were low and there was grave danger of famine and possibly of internal convulsions, Hoover's American Relief Administration rushed shiploads of flour and fats from Trieste and Hamburg to Prague and other industrial centers and saved the day.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1643.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It was only natural that Mr. Hoover would expect the Czecho-Slovaks in America to liberally support his drive, the success of which meant so much to hungry little stomachs in Bohemia and Slovakia; besides, Mr. Hoover knew well what Bohemians and Slovaks had done in the past. One year ago, when his American Relief Administration asked for contributions to clothe children they contributed $63,000. Hoover expects fully as much in the present drive.</p>
   <p>Minister Stepanek sent to Chicago just before Christmas, Dr. Anton Sum, who until recently was in charge of the Prague office of Czecho-slovak Child Welfare (Pece o dite) and who is now Social Welfare attache to the Washington legation. Chicago is the great Bohemian centre of the United States, and here Dr. Sum was made acquainted with the heads of the principal organizations, editors of newspapers, bankers, leading women workers etc. A committee was promptly organized to take charge of collecting for the European Relief Council among Czechoslovaks of Chicago and neighboring states.....</p>
   <p>About 2500 letters were sent out and daily appeals, prepared by the committee, were given prominent space by three Bohemian dailies and one Slovak weekly <pb facs="5418478_5_1644.jpg" n="4"/>published in Chicago......</p>
   <p>Among the Bohemian papers special credit must be given to the Daily Hlasatel which contributed $500 to the cause and collected nearly ten times as much from its subscribers......</p>
   <p>The campaign is still on, and the financial results cannot be approximated. But it seems certain that in spite of the difficulties with which the Hoover drive among the Czechoslovaks in America must contend the sum contributed toward clothing for children a year ago will be overtopped by the amount to feed the hungry children of Europe.</p>
