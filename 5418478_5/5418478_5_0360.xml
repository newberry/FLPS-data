   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting, read by the secretary, were approved.</p>
   <p>The bills payable presented by Mr. Husak were ordered paid. One of these bills was for the salaries of forty-nine workmen at the cemetery, amounting to $2,475.17 for the month of January: the other account was for $15,000 paid for bonds, bought with the surplus cash on hand. They are the bonds of the Chicago Harbor and Improvements, and the purchase was approved by the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hribotova.</p>
