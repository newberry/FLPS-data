   <p>Yesterday evening there was held in the school on 18th Street, a meeting of the committees for the old people's home and the orphanage. According to the attendance at the meeting, it is evident that interest in the home and the orphanage appears to have reached all classes of our people. The meeting was attended not only by representatives of labor, but by representatives of our more well-to-do society, and all were filled with enthusiasm for this community enterprise.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Viska was elected permanent secretary, Judge Sabath gave the report of the committee of five. From this report it was evident that the committee really worked energetically. More than three hundred members were invited to attend the meeting; of these more than half arrived. Further the judge made a motion that some sort of business manager be appointed for these national undertakings, who would have charge of all details and be paid for his work. Finally the idea of Mr. Novak was accepted that some things, such as lots donated should be placed for raffle. 50,000 tickets are to be printed and these sold at one dollar each, thereby a large sum of money will certainly accrue.</p>
