  <body>
   <p>An important step has been taken toward the formation of a combine of all the Czech Free Thought brotherhoods in the United States. This was done in yesterday's conference of the C. S. P. S. (Cesko Slovansky Podporujici Spolek--Czecho-Slav Aid Society), which is holding its sixteenth annual rally in Chicago. The final resolutions are expected to be passed in today's session. The friendly reception accorded to delegates of other brotherhoods presages that the merger will become a reality. A final proof of the correctness of this prediction is furnished by the fact that a special committee was appointed which is to deal with the formalities of the transaction.</p>
   <p>Under ordinary circumstances a matter such as this would have been taken up by the regular committee on bylaws. The appointment of a special body, at the <pb facs="5418478_5_0180.jpg" n="2"/>very beginning of the session at that, shows that all the delegates favor the merger and view it as necessary. This sentiment was echoed in the report of the C. S. P. S. executives, from which it is evident that the merger is a foregone conclusion if it depends only upon the C. S. P. S. itself, representing over eighty per cent of the delegates in this rally [the rest belong to other fraternal orders also taking part in the sessions]. The special committee will have to investigate the financial situation of the various brotherhoods that are to join the combine. This is necessary, true enough. It is, however, only of secondary importance in comparison with the outstanding fact that the C. S. P. S., our largest and oldest organization, is promoting the merger on its own initiative, prompted by the sincere desire to benefit the entire fraternal community. The executive report mentioned is printed verbatim elsewhere in this paper.</p>
   <p>The plan for a merger originated some time ago but suffered disaster because it was not considered feasible, or it may not have been so pressing as at the <pb facs="5418478_5_0181.jpg" n="3"/>present time. There were misgivings in the minds of members of the C. S. P. S. itself in former times. This is of course a thing of the past, and there is no doubt that within a short time the Czech-American aid societies will be united, if no serious legal obstacles arise.</p>
   <p>The merger is not considered today merely as a fact of moral value and effect. It is a necessity dictated by the present war. There was no need of the merger in former times, either in regard to the financial standing of the fraternal orders or in regard to the number of members. Most of the brotherhoods rested on a sound financial basis and could thus exist as independent, individual organizations. Nor were the ranks of the members threatened with loss. Depleted membership was quickly replaced by newly arriving immigrants. These immigrants do not come today, and there is a slim chance to fill the gaps with our American-born adolescents. The membership gained from the latter lags behind our expectations.</p>
   <p>It is not easy to predict what conditions will prevail after the war. A new <pb facs="5418478_5_0182.jpg" n="4"/>stream of immigrants may come in, but it may not arrive in the first few years. If our hopes for the liberation of our old motherland are fulfilled, there will probably be not only fewer immigrants, but moreover, numerous Czechs here will gratify their desire to return to the old country, especially if economic conditions there are favorable. Also, there will be a dearth of young, able-bodied men, who will be badly needed in Europe after the war, and the various governments there may restrict emigration. Whether these conjectures are verified or not, it is certain that an influx of prospective members is not to be expected, and so the brotherhoods feel compelled to look to the strengthening of their organizations at home.</p>
   <p>The merger is, therefore, not a matter of a purely sentimental nature; it is an absolute necessity. All those favoring the merger agree that one large body can better withstand the strain of circumstances than several separate small lodges with forces divided. This opinion is shared by the delegates now in conference and advocating the unification. The initial, most important steps <pb facs="5418478_5_0183.jpg" n="5"/>in this direction have been taken, which indicates that the merger of our brotherhoods is near. The realization of the idea is not easy, true enough. Many formalities and requirements have to be complied with. The prospect of success, however, is encouraging.</p>
