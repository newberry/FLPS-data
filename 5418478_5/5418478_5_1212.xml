   <p>The article shows a reproduction of the original drawing of the building as it will appear at some future time when the organization's finances permit the completion of the building according to the plans finally adopted.</p>
   <p>This society was organized more than six years ago and the membership now consists of over two hundred men and eighty women. The plans for the new building were drawn up by the architect Mr. Novy and the estimate for its construction is $49,000. The society hesitated to contract so large a debt and it was decided to change the plans somewhat. Temporarily the right and left wings of the building will not be constructed. The cost of the building is thereby reduced to $35,000. The wings will be added when finances permit.</p>
   <p>The hall will measure 90 x 80 feet; the stage will be 38 feet wide and <pb facs="5418478_5_1213.jpg" n="2"/>20 feet deep. At the sides will be the cloak room, dressing room, toilets, barroom, kitchen, and living quarters for the caretaker. Everything will be modern.</p>
   <p>Contracts for the construction work were awarded as follows: masonry and brick work, to Frank Pitra for $12,800; carpenter work, Joseph Pastur for $6,300; iron work, M. J. Strnad &amp; Son for $4,912; plumbing, water and gas, to Frank J. Tichy for $2,830; cornice work, to John Eiselt for $1,475; painting and varnishing,to Joseph Hosna for $375.</p>
   <p>The article carries a long list of organizations and individuals who purchased bonds of the building.</p>
   <p>The building committee has the following assets to its credit: on deposit with the "Budovcnost" Building and Loan Association $3,106. Loan on note of the Building &amp; Loan Association $1,400. Cash on hand $626.25. Four lots on Lawndale Ave., $3,500. Private loan $3,350. Total $11,982.25.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1214.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Members of the Board of Directors are: Frank Vlach, president; Fr. Zeman, chairman building committee; R. Cermak, secretary building committee; J. Jakoubek, financial secretary; J. Matousek, treasurer; R. Krametbauer, J. Stech, J. Tuma, V. Velan, J. Raska, J. Smid, and F. Prochazka.</p>
