   <p>"Dear friends! To this financial report we need to add a summary of the so-called inner activity of this organization.</p>
   <p>"First it should be mentioned that we have gained many new friends in the year just ended, who showed their generosity by donating both money and many useful articles. It is to be desired that these friends bring with them others as interested in this philantropic undertaking as they are themselves.</p>
   <p>"One of our patrons is Mrs. Anna Zajicek who, following the initiative of Mrs. Rinn, nee Sadilek, furnished a bedroom for our grown-up girls.</p>
   <p>"During the year, and under the direction of Mr. Charvat, the building housing the restaurant was repaired.</p>
   <p>"The Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec received its State permit January 6, 1913, and the orphanage was divided into two schools, the Bohemian Industrial School for Girls, and the Bohemian Training School for Girls. This division makes it <pb facs="5418478_5_1092.jpg" n="3"/>possible to teach the children something useful during the time they are not occupied in the schoolrooms.</p>
   <p>"The books of our organization were audited by a public accountant, because application was made for membership in the Chicago Association of Commerce, and such an audit is required by the Association. Our books were found correct, and the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec became a member of the Chicago Association of Commerce, which is positive proof that our organization is recognized as useful and properly conducted.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Frank J. Jirka is our physician. He renders his services without remuneration.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Otto F. Dusek, our manager, thanks every one who in any way has helped our organization."</p>
