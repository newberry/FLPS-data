   <p>The reasons why it is absolutely necessary for us here in America to help the children in Czechoslovakia were explained by prominent eyewitnesses yesterday a at the meeting arranged by the Vcelky (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak National Alliance) and other ladies' organizations at the Sokol Chicago hall. The meeting itself was a significant part of the action inaugurated in behalf of the little sufferers in our old homeland. Judging from the enthusiastic audience which applauded the speakers, it was apparent that the meeting was not held in vain, but that the results of the meeting would produce evidence during the next few days of the increasing generosity of our people.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 8 P. M., Mrs. Novak, president of the Vcelky, introduced Dr. Anna Berkevec, a prominent social worker from Czechoslovakia, who explained at length why it is still necessary to help our old homeland and why our poor children, especially, should be remembered.</p>
   <p>She said: "In our new Republic, there are one million children for whom we <pb facs="5418478_5_1627.jpg" n="2"/>must provide food in order to save them from starvation. These children must be saved for our nation. The Republic herself, without outside help, can take care of 750,000 of these little sufferers. Two hundred and fifty thousand are dependent upon outside help."....</p>
   <p>During the course of the meeting a collection for the benefit of Mr. Hoover's fund was undertaken. The proceeds of the collection amounted to $92.21.</p>
