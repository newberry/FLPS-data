   <p>The board of representatives of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec [Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage] held their regular meeting last night at the usual place, the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Associations) on 18th Street. Mr. Suchy was the presiding officer. The meeting was fairly well attended.....</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the last meeting, Mr. Dolezal, representing the Sokol Slavsky [Gymnastic Association Sokol-Slavsky] was introduced. He presented the request of the Sokol Slavsky that the Utulna A Sirotcinec postpone the laying of the cornerstone of the new orphanage because May 22 and 23, the days selected for that celebration, marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Sokol Slavsky, and all preparations to celebrate this anniversary on those days had been made.....</p>
