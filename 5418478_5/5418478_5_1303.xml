   <p>On October 16, 1922 there will be a tag day for the benefit of orphanages which thus receive their support from the public. Among these institutions is our Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). Our Bohemian ladies have taken great pains on all previous occasions to make the receipts for our Sirotcinec as generous as possible, and they will undoubtedly be equally efficient this year. The committee announced that 150 ladies are needed to serve a cause so noble as that of giving of one's time and efforts for the benefit of the dispossessed and the motherless.</p>
   <p>.....All volunteers who are willing to take part in this tag day are requested to report to the Pilsen Sokol on Saturday, October 14, between 2 and 4 P. M. There the committee will assign them to their locations and they will receive all other necessary instructions and supplies. The volunteers may also report to the secretary of the Bohemian Orphanage, <pb facs="5418478_5_1304.jpg" n="2"/>Mrs. Bozena Krabec, 2027 South California Avenue, or telephone Rockwell 0477. The ladies who took part in the last tag day and desire to work at the same locations as before, will be able to do so by consulting the committee.</p>
