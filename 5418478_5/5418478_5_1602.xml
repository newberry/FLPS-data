   <p>The Pilsen Products Company, formerly known as the Pilsen Brewery Company, has again proved that it fully deserves to be looked upon as an enterprise which participated in the past, is participating at the present time, and will take part in the future in all the national and philanthropic activities of local Czechoslovaks. Although the company itself, with its board of directors, already contributed the sum of $190 for the benefit of suffering children in Czechoslovakia, these children were remembered again by its shareholders with a gift which is much larger.</p>
   <p>The shareholders of the Pilsen Products Company held their annual meeting Tuesday afternoon and evening in the Pilsen Park pavilion. After the execution of business matters, the elections followed. The following shareholders were elected officers of the company: Mr. John A. Cervenka, president; Mr. T. Seidl, vice-president; Mr. Roman Sedlacek, secretary; Mr. A. F. Jiruska, <pb facs="5418478_5_1603.jpg" n="2"/>treasurer. In the evening, an informal entertainment was held.</p>
   <p>In the course of the entertainment, Mr. John A. Cervenka, a willing and enthusiastic Bohemian-American national worker, spoke in behalf of Mr. Herbert Hoover's relief fund, which at present is being undertaken throughout the United States, and appealed to present shareholders to do something for the suffering children in Czechoslovakia. After having emphasized the fact that a great deed of mercy would be accomplished, he ordered envelopes distributed with a request that contributions be put into them.</p>
   <p>The envelopes, with money inserted, soon started coming in, and after these were cut open, it was found that the following shareholders contributed: [There follow the names and amounts.] Total, $256.75.</p>
   <p>This money was deposited in our office with the request to add this amount to our collection.....</p>
