   <p>On Tuesday January 10, 1922, the meeting of the Damsky Odbor of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Ladies Auxiliary of the Bohemian Charitable Association) was very well attended. The program included the annual report of committees and the installation of the newly elected officers for the year 1922.</p>
   <p>Mr. Josefa Beranek was re-elected to the office of president and was immediately installed. It took a great deal of persuasion to force her to accept this office which she so efficiently filled in the past, but the pressure of her co-workers finally compelled her to do it. Mrs. Antonie Cervenka was elected vice-president; Mrs. Kybic was re-elected secretary; Mrs. J. Zavrel became financial secretary, and Mrs. Emma Zeman accepted the office of <pb facs="5418478_5_1459.jpg" n="2"/>treasurer. The installation ceremony was conducted by Mrs. krupka.....The entertainment committee then gave the newly elected president a beautiful bouquet of crimson roses and white cowslips as a symbol of the work of our organization, whose motto is, "Our colors are white and red--our slogan is honesty and strength". The chairman of the entertainment committee, Mrs. Antonie Cermak, expressed her faith in the president and promised her that all of us will stand by her and help so that her second term of office will be as successful as the first.....The new chairman, Mrs. Josefa Beranek, was very touched, and in her response promised that in this, her second term, she would endeavor to devote all of her energy to the success of the work of the auxiliary in order that our indigent and unfortunate people might derive the greatest benefit from it.....</p>
   <p>The new board of directors consists of the same members as before: Mmes. Cervenka, Krupka, Spatny, Valha, Kybic, Zeman, Ourada, Heinlein, Zavrel, Hajicek, Kriha, Stepanek, Doumel, Pondelicek, Hajek, Loula, Kreml, Bursik, and Tupy. Our meetings during the past year were well attended and our members <pb facs="5418478_5_1460.jpg" n="3"/>proved again and again that they fully understand the aims of our ladies' auxiliary by giving freely of their substance to the enrichment of our treasury.</p>
   <p>During the past year the following entertainments were arranged: At the end of the month of February, there was a private party given by the Dobrocinna Spolecnost in which our ladies auxiliary participated by preparing a tasty dinner and homemade bakery goods.....Then there was a strawberry festival at which our ladies' orchestra played without any compensation. The proceeds of this festival were $564.23. There was also a special party in the Pilsen Park pavilion which netted us $427.50. Altogether these entertainments brought us $991.73. The total receipts for the year amount to $1,600, and this is the largest sum which the auxiliary has thus far been able to collect. The difference between the total amount received from entertainments and parties and the grand total came from dues and gifts which were of rather substantial proportions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1461.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At a ball which was arranged by the Dobrocinna Spolecnost and to which the members came dressed in national costumes, the entertainment committee also furnished the dinner and tasty bakery goods. For this latter work both Mrs. Josefa Beranke, as chairman, and the entertsinment committee are to be thanked...</p>
   <p>The knowledge that our work serves the unfortunate poor people shall be sufficient compensation for our efforts and should spur us to further activity. All our steps should be guided by a love for the poor and concern for their happiness.</p>
   <p>The following ladies were elected to the gentlemen's committee as members of the board for the year 1922: Mmes. Beranek, Cervenka, Kybic, and Kreml. In concluding this report we ask our people to continue to favor the ladies auxiliary in the future, since by the united effort of all of us, much good may be accomplished.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1462.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We also wish to express our gratitude to the newspapers Denni Hlasatel and Svornost for their co-operation in our work. We are indebted to Miss Helen Weiner for enriching our program during our annual meetings by furnishing and managing her little dancers and elocutionist.</p>
   <p>For the ladies' auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost:</p>
   <p>Josefa Beranek, chairman;</p>
   <p>Antonie Cervenka, corresponding secretary.</p>
