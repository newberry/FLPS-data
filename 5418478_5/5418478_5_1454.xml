   <p>The board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held a meeting last Friday in its offices at 2603 South Kedzie Avenue. The meeting was opened by the chairman of the ladies' auxiliary, Mrs. Josefa Beranek. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. The meeting was later attended by the first vice-president of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, Mr. John A. Sokol, who took the chair for the remainder of the meeting. It was decided to abandon the idea of having an independent tag day and instead to become a member of the Universal Tag Day Association. It was further decided that a campaign for contributions from the members of the Charitable Association should take place in June instead of in January. Upon a motion made by Mr. Anton J. Cermak, it was decided to make a regular card index of all members and contributors. The next annual meeting will take place on the third Friday in February. After listening to the reading of the annual report on the activities of the newly elected members of the board, an <pb facs="5418478_5_1455.jpg" n="2"/>announcement was made about a soiree to be given for all members.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Malecek, reported that the the disbursements of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost for the past year amounted to $10,000 in cash and $2,000 in gifts, totaling $12,000. Thus, the disbursements of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost average $1,000 per month. The chairman of the ladies' auxiliary, Mrs. Josefa Beranek, reported that the auxiliary will turn over its surplus from last year, amounting to $1,600, which will be deposited in the joint treasury. The president thanked the auxiliary for their exemplary work and for this monetary contribution. The ladies, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Beranek and with the co-operation of other officers, worked diligently throughout the year.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen were elected to the nominating committee: Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, Frank G. Hajicek, and Josef Bolek. Collections in this meeting amounted to seventeen dollars.</p>

   <p>annual dues. A motion was also made that Will <gap unit="words" extent="5" reason="illegible"/> be paid fifty dollars first the local treasury of the lodge. This was sent to him directly. Besides that, Brother Jaroslav <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, who is a dealer in musical instruments, donated a player-piano to the lodge, which meets the others of the lodge $450. Koukola will consequently receive five hundred dollars from this lodge... Koukola also personally informed as that the Svur Trocnov Cislo 15 Cesko-Amefrickych Lesiku (Court of Trocnov No. 15 of the Bohemian-American Foresters) cent him $30, directly.</p>
   <p>Detretire Sergeant Albert Mikes of the Lawndale at time visited Koukola last Thursday. He was accompanied by a countrymen, V. Derbek. No other they brought thirty-five founds of meat and lard to Konkol, for his family. During this visit Albert Mikes again witnessed the restaurant to which the family was exposed and the great which the aid renders to its members brought. Mikes also told as that he has a talk with laerian Anton J. Cermak, who also promised come help to Koukola's family in the <gap unit="words" extent="5" reason="illegible"/> of a new boiler to replace the one which exploded.

He will do so if Koukola decides to remain at his present place of residence.</p>
   <p>What Koukola himself is going to do in the future we are unable to say. He informed us that he is going to submit his plans to us very soon; but whatever his plans will be, he may be assured that the best wishes of his countrymen will accompany his attempts to be in life anew.</p>
