   <p>At the meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost v Chicagu (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago), held last Friday and presided over by the vice-chairman, Mr. Karel J. Novak, a number of applications for relief were approved. At this meeting the sum of $360.42 was appropriated for the assistance of poor Bohemian families. Mr. Karel J. Novak, chairman of the Tag Day committee, announced that, thanks to the efforts of the Alderman Anton J. Cermak, a special permit was issued to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, by the Chicago City Council authorizing the Spolecnost to hold its Tag Day on May 30, 1921. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, whose expenditures for the poor families grow higher month by month, is in need of at least 150 generous ladies who would be willing to offer their services on that day, and therefore asks them to call at the <pb facs="5418478_5_1520.jpg" n="2"/>office of the association.</p>
   <p>In this meeting, the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost reported that preparations for the strawberry party are in full swing, and that the party will be held on Wednesday May 18 at 2 P. M. in Pilsen Park pavilion. The program, which has been prepared for this occasion by the committee on arrangements, will surpass all the others by its richness. The strawberry party is an event well known to our ladies, and because of its success in past years it enjoys great popularity among our people.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Roman Sedlacek announced that they collected the sum of $242 as membership contributions from our countrymen. The names of the contributors will be announced later. The self-sacrificing work of Mr. and Mrs. Sedlacek should be appreciated and deserves the best of recognition.</p>
   <p>[Membership contributions reported in this meeting, including names and <pb facs="5418478_5_1521.jpg" n="3"/>addresses of donors and the amounts contributed by each, are omitted in translation.]</p>
