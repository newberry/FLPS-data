<title level="a">THE GRAND LODGE OF THE CESKO-SLOVANSKA JEDNOTA CELEBRATES ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The twentieth anniversary of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Society), one of our best societies, was celebrated in a truly dignified manner by its members. The program for the festive occasion was rich in talent. It began with the playing of an overture by Mr. Anton Konopasek's orchestra, following which Mr. Eugene Frydl, president of the National Grand Lodge, delivered the principal address of the evening. In a brief but pithy speech, the speaker referred to the origin of the society, to the work thus far accomplished, and to the many tireless workers to whom belongs chiefly the credit for the growth and success of the society. He gave thanks for the indefatigable work of these members, and expressed the wish that others also, expecially the younger members of the society, would work for its success.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0482.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota is one of those Bohemian fraternal benevolent societies which owes its present independent existence to a non-Bohemian society. It was the first to originate the idea of transferring Bohemian members from non-Bohemian societies to itself, and it still does that. It is the society which indicated to other Bohemian lodges, which were dissatisfied in English societies, how they should act to become independent Bohemian lodges. In the time of crisis in the "Independent Order of Foresters", the same methods were used, and for that reason we have an entirely Bohemian society, the Jednota Cesko-Americkych Lesniku A Lesnic (Bohemian-American Foresters). Then, when the medical examiner of the North American Union expressed himself in an unfavorable manner about Bohemians claiming that they lived under unhealthy conditions, the Bohemian lodges of that English organization resolved that they could be independent, and joined the recently organized Cesko-Americka Jednota (Bohemian-American Union).</p>
   <p>During the Eighties, the English speaking society "Knights and Ladies of <pb facs="5418478_5_0483.jpg" n="3"/>Honor" began an astonishing agitation among the Bohemian people. Although Bohemian lodges existed already at that time, and though they were successful, still as a result of the large rewards offered for the gaining of each new member many new Bohemian lodges were organized. The same methods were employed among other nationalities, with the result that the society could be seen to grow, so to speak. However, toward the end of the year 1890, disaster overtook it. The society's treasurer embezzled about $70,000 of the society's funds, which caused excitement among the members and the expression of unfavorable opinions about the management of the society. When, in the spring of 1891, three assessments were levied in one month, the dissatisfaction of the members reached its height, because such an occurrence was unusual. The representatives of Bohemian and non-Bohemian lodges asked the Grand Lodge officials for an explanation, but instead of an explanation they were told to pay up as soon as possible, and failure to do so would result in suspension. This ultimatum caused so much anger that many lodges <pb facs="5418478_5_0484.jpg" n="4"/>withdrew from the "Knights and Ladies of Honor" and organized a new society which carried the name "Independent Knights and Ladies of Honor". It was predicted that previous experiences would serve in guarding against all such mistakes as led to the division of the old society, and that the new organization would progress successfully. However this confidence was shattered when a certain widow, a countrywoman, was paid $550 insurance instead of $1,000, and this after long discussions.</p>
   <p>At that time good advice would have been welcome. To return to the old society was an impossibility, and the confidence which the members of the Bohemian lodges had in the new society was destroyed. Therefore, the delegates of the Bohemian lodges were called together, conferences were held, ways and means were sought by which it would be possible to emerge from the unpleasant situation. Finally it was decided that the Bohemian <pb facs="5418478_5_0485.jpg" n="5"/>lodges should create an independent society. The plan received ardent support, and on May 2, 1892, the Secretary of State of Illinois issued a permit for the organization of a society bearing the name of Jednota Cesko-Slovanskych Rytiru a Dam (Bohemian-Slavonic Knights and Ladies). The Bohemian society adopted this name as its own.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm with which the new society began its activities contributed to the fact that the progress of the society was satisfactory; everything went forward, and the expectations of the founders were the rosiest. However, these satisfactory conditions did not last long. In the course of a year, several deaths were reported which raised doubt, and this doubt was increased during the economic crisis of 1893-1896. That period is entered in the history of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota as the most critical. The successes gained by Bohemian tenacity, superhuman effort and unexampled sacrifice on the part of officials were great, and deserve general <pb facs="5418478_5_0486.jpg" n="6"/>recognition.</p>
   <p>With the improvement of economic conditions came improvement within the society; confidence returned and membership increased. During the years 1899 and 1900 several lodges from the former society were admitted to membership, and in the course of recent years this has been repeated many times; the society has become a refuge for Bohemian lodges whose existence was made difficult and finally impossible within English-speaking societies.</p>
   <p>This same condition applied not only to lodges in Chicago but to lodges outside of Chicago as well. In the society's convention held in Chicago in 1896, the last link to the English parent society was removed by changing the name to Cesko-Slovanska Jednota. From that date the progress of the society is evident. It now has just short of six thousand members, and has $33,000 in its reserve fund. The interest earnings of this fund are used <pb facs="5418478_5_0487.jpg" n="7"/>to pay the death benefit dues of those members who are unable to pay because of old age. The activity of this society in national and educational matters is great.</p>
   <p>We can boldly assert that the activities of the Free Thought School Association were made possible by a regular monthly contribution which the Grand Lodge turned over to that organization. At the present time there is a new Bohemian central body of representatives of Bohemian societies coming into existence. This group will have as its purpose to take notice of such laws as would be detrimental to the Bohemian societies, and to work against their passage in legislatures where its influence can be exerted. It will be a body which will be useful in national undertakings, and which will prepare the ground for the distant but possible unification of all Bohemian societies having a common goal. The idea of founding such an organization originated in the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota, where they are <pb facs="5418478_5_0488.jpg" n="8"/>working not only for their own benefit but also for the benefit of all fraternal lodges.</p>
