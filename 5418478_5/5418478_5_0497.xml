<title level="a">TENTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION BY JUBILEE LODGE NO. 95 CESKO-SLOVENSKE PODPORUJÍCÍ SPOLKY (CZECHO-SLOVAK BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES)</title></bibl>

   <p>Sunday's festival, given by Jubilee Lodge No. 95, Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Societies, in the Bohemian-American School Hall, in celebration of the tenth anniversary of its existence, was a brilliant affair and met with complete success in every respect. It was an evening which will be long remembered by the participants, because they received, not only earnest instruction and encouragement for continued work, but also enjoyed a refined entertainment which was provided by master musicians, experienced speakers, and excellent singers. The more serious part of the program consisted of a speech by Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, editor of the official journal of the Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society, whose theme was "A Bohemian-American belongs in a Czech Society," and speeches by Messrs. John Pech, president of the National Grand Lodge; E. Fridl, president of the Grand Lodge of Illinois; Brother Kozeny, president of the Jubilee Lodge. From the financial secretary's report, it <pb facs="5418478_5_0498.jpg" n="2"/>appears that the lodge is prospering satisfactorily and is performing its duties exemplarily not only toward its members and their families, but toward all national and cultural undertakings which are worthy and need support. The assets of Jubilee Lodge amount to almost one thousand dollars, and its membership consists of ninety-three brothers and three sisters. At the conclusion of the program, an informal entertainment followed, which continued until a late hour.</p>
