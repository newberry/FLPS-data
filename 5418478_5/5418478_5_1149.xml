   <p>Representatives of W. W. Kimball Co. met with a committee from the Old People's Home last night, to decide for the concert, which this firm wishes to arrange in behalf of the Old People's Home, could be assured the greatest success. As is known, the Kimball Co., is donating a beautiful piano to the Home and on the occasion of the drawing of lots wants to arrange a grand concert, the profits of which would go to the Home. Yesterday's meeting was concerned with placing the orders for the necessary printing it was further resolved that raffle-tickets be priced at $1.00; reserved seats at 75c; main floor seats at 50c and gallery seats at 35c. It was decided to invite the Bohemian Singing Societies to participate in the concert. The Kimball Company will arrange for the best piano artists. The Bohemian Zither Club is also to be invited to participate. At yesterday's meeting the Kimball Company was represented by Messrs. M. Rabinoff, Fr. Novotny and F. J. Jiracek. Further details of the concert will be arranged at tomorrow's meeting of the "Home".</p>
