   <p>There was nothing of much interest to the public during the morning session. After a short recess, pay of the secretaries was fixed at $150.00. There came the election of a Chairman of the National Grand Lodge. The following brothers were candidates for the office: Svojse, Bunata, and Jurka. The result on the third ballot was Svojse-29; Bunata-15.</p>
   <p>The results of the election of Treasurer were Klobassa-33; Vuch-10.</p>
   <p>Milwaukee was decided on as the next Convention site on the third ballot with the vote as follows: for Wisconsin 34 votes, for New York, 27.</p>
   <p>Therefore the next convention will be held in Milwaukee three years hence. Bro. A. Novak thanked the delegates in a short address in behalf of the Wisconsin Lodges.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session came to order at 1:20 P.M. and debate was started in reference to the designation of an official Organ. Bro. Popelik moves in favor of the "Dennice Novoveku" (Modern Morning star); Bro. Rosicky moves <pb facs="5418478_5_0612.jpg" n="2"/>that a special publication be organized and spoke at length in behalf of his motion. Bros. Zbornik, Kohn, Rychlik, Vytlacil, Sprosty, Sestak, Vojtisek and Jandus all spoke warmly in favor of the Morning Star, which was accepted unanimously. Therefore the Morning Star is the official organ of the "C.S.P.S." for the ensuing three years. The manager Bro. Snajdr thanked the convention and the proceedings advanced to the receiving of committee reports.</p>
   <p>1st committee: report on the duties of both Secretaries was accepted with a slight addition by Br. Novak.</p>
   <p>2nd Committee: Bohemian associations and lodges in existence prior to this convention, having in their midst members over 45 years of age, will be admitted to membership in this organization under the following regulations:</p>
   <p>(a) Members who have not passed fifty years in age and who were accepted before they were 45 years old into their respective lodges will receive full benefits as allowed by the union of the C.S.P.S.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0613.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>(b) Those members between 50 and 55 years of age who have been members for at least five years will be entitled to only one-half benefit in the event of death, but they are required to pay full assessments.</p>
   <p>(c) Members, over 55 years of age do not received any benefits whatever nor are they required to pay death-benefit assessments.</p>
   <p>(d) Members, who joined our organization, in accordance with previous regulations, since our last convention, and who have not yet passed 50 years in age are entitled to full benefits. Members between 50 and 55 years are entitled only to half benefits.</p>
   <p>(e) Members accepted in accordance with these resolutions are not entitled to such benefits as this organization pays to a deceased member's widow, even though they pay the required assessments. In order to avoid any confusion in this matter, such members should be required to sign a proper renunciation of these benefits.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0614.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>3rd Committee: (Degrees) Resolved on 3 degrees, and referred to the National Grand Lodge Committee to work out details.</p>
   <p>Individual delegates began to seek permission to leave for home.</p>
   <p>The convention was brought to a close with a motion that the delegates meet informally. There was about a half hours speechmaking after which the members dispersed to meet again to ratify the minutes of the last days session on Sunday at 10:00 A.M..</p>
   <p>In Sunday's meeting the minutes were accepted with a few minor corrections and the convention adjourned sine die.</p>
