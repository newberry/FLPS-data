   <p>P.1--The Old People's Home and Orphanage Association met yesterday in the Bohemian-English Liberal School hall. The meeting was well attended and was conducted with dignity and seriousness, as befits the Association and the purpose which it serves. The meeting was called to order by the retiring chairman, Eugene Frydl. Installation of the new officers followed.</p>
   <p>The new chairman of the association, Mr. Jan Pech, assumed his office with a hearty speech, urging all representatives, men and women, to aid him in his work and hand in hand to seek their goal, the early building of the home and orphanage.</p>
   <p>Various matters of minor significance were then dealt with. The meeting was pleased with the treasurer's report, announcing the receipts of the evening as $609. Disbursements amounted to $1,009, but these included $1,000 which the treasurer had deposited with the National Cemetery Association.</p>

   <p>A representative of the California Zobaks, Mr. Joseph Rus, was present in the meeting and applied for a charter membership, making a deposit of $100. The coming bazaar was discussed, and several auxiliary committees were elected to aid in organizing it.</p>
   <p>We will print more details on this matter soon.</p>
