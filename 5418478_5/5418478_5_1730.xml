   <p>Dear Friends:</p>
   <p>We are approaching you in the interest of a noble project, which, regardless of unsatisfactory and dull conditions, is fully comprehended by our Czechoslovak people of Chicago. We are not asking you for any contribution, but we ask and invite you to a co-operative and noble work which, if successfully accomplished, will benefit our poor invalid legionnaires and widows and orphans in Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>In the past World War and the struggle for world democracy, our Czechoslovak <pb facs="5418478_5_1731.jpg" n="2"/>Legion was exposed to the extreme terrors of western and eastern battlefields. Thousands of our heroic legionnaires died in this bloody struggle.</p>
   <p>Our hearts go out to all those who sacrificed their lives in this struggle, but it is our sacred duty to help those who returned home as invalids, to help surviving widows and orphans of our fallen legionnaires.</p>
   <p>During the past war many tens of thousands of legionnaires' families were deprived of their breadwinners; thousands of invalids, unable to support themselves, became a burden upon the Czechoslovak Republic. Unsettled and almost disastrous social and economic conditions are making it still worse for those who sacrificed and suffered the most for their nation.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak people of America, who proved generous benefactors of the <pb facs="5418478_5_1732.jpg" n="3"/>suffering nation in the past, must not permit our legionnaires, the best men of our nation, to suffer on account of these conditions, and our people must offer them substantial aid.</p>
   <p>The Bazar Svobody, arranged by the Druzina Ceskovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu (Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago), with the co-operation of our national organizations and societies, will be held from September 22-26 in the Pilsen Park pavilion. At this bazaar every Czechoslovak will have an opportunity to manifest his sympathy toward our legionnaires and the surviving families. The numerous friendly communications which are reaching us from everywhere prove that our people are deeply interested in this bazaar. The participation of our national organizations and of individuals in preliminary work is a guarantee of success.</p>
   <p>We invite you all to co-operate with us in this meritorious work. The arrangements <pb facs="5418478_5_1733.jpg" n="4"/>committee sent out invitations to all of our national and Sokol organizations. We also appeal to our prominent countrymen and countrywomen, who have always supported all our national projects so generously in the past, to contribute their rich experience to the success of the Bazar Svobody.</p>
   <p>Regular meetings of the bazaar arrangements committee are being held every Tuesday evening at the Sokol Havlicek Hall. A trophy donated by the Svaz Cesko-slovenskych Legionaru v Praze (Alliance of Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Prague) will be presented to the organization which participates most actively in this Bazar Svobody.</p>
   <p>The organizations and societies which have decided to participate are requested to send the names of their representatives to Mr. J. Vosatka, secretary of the arrangements committee, 2225 Dayton Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1734.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Na zdar! (good luck!)</p>
   <p>Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu</p>
