<title level="a">A MEETING OF THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY OF THE BOHEMIAN CHARITABLE ASSOCIATION</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Following are the minutes of a meeting held last Tuesday, October 10, by the Damsky Odbor (Women's Auxiliary) of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association):</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened punctually by the chairman, Mrs. Josefina Beranek, who returned from a trip to Bohemia just in time to resume her activity as chairman and to start the work of the organization for the winter season. The attendance at this meeting was large, and the mood almost festive; and, after all, why should it not be so? For during the three long summer months, it seemed that many a member of the auxiliary longed again to attend our regular afternoon meetings, and so every one of us who had some time to spare hurried to this meeting, which turned out to be such a pleasant affair that it will long be remembered by all of us. The work of the meeting progressed rapidly, for all the officers vied with each other in accomplishing the tasks assigned <pb facs="5418478_5_1299.jpg" n="2"/>to them during the absence of the chairman. One could hear nothing but praise and admiration for the work achieved by them. The entire board of directors of the auxiliary and all members generally deserve unstinted praise and thanks for the work performed by them, especially Mrs. Spathy, Mrs. Zeman, and Mrs. Antonie Cervenka for the publicity work which they did for the strawberry festival, and for selling tickets for that occasion.</p>
   <p>The business of the meeting ended and the festivities began. A gorgeous floral piece which had been purchased by the directors was now presented by the vice-chairman, Mrs. A. Cervenka, to the chairman. With touching words this symbol of our love was handed to Mrs. Beranek who, visibly moved by this expression of our affection, thanked all the ladies present, promising all to continue to work with undiminished zeal. She then gave a brief resume of her experiences in Czechoslovakia....and yielded the floor to Mrs. Sokol, who in a very trenchant and sincere manner described the impressions gained by her while visiting the old homeland. The speakers who followed were Mrs. Triner, Mrs. Zarobsky, Mrs. sistek, Mrs. Schnabl, and Mrs. Stejskal. All of them amused us very well. Last but not <pb facs="5418478_5_1300.jpg" n="3"/>least was a talk by the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, whose remarks really touched our hearts, especially when he admonished us to continue our work of charity. Everybody was welcomed back to this first meeting of the season with open arms, and we were all glad to be back home and in the circle of our own friends. And so, joyously partaking of some well-cooked Kolacky and doughnuts, we spent the afternoon so pleasantly indeed that we shall long remember it. [Translator's note: A Kolac or Kolacek (plural Kolace or Kolacky) is a special kind of Bohemian pastry typical of that country's baking methods.]</p>
   <p>It should be added that we had a pleasant visit on this occasion from Mrs. Kreml who, being one of our workers, was convalescing after a long siege of illness and on this occasion ventured to go out in the street for the first time. The board of directors missed her very much, but now we hope that she will rejoin us in our work. The meeting adjourned under the most pleasant circumstances.</p>
   <p>For the Damsky Odbor of the Spolecnost:</p>
   <p>Antonie Cervenka, recording secretary.</p>
