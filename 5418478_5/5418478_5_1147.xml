   <p>That the idea of building a home for our aged people and an orphanage for our orphans has at last been accepted everywhere was best demonstrated by yesterday's annual meeting of the representatives of that body, held in the lower hall of the Bohemian American Liberal School. In spite of yesterday's inclement weather, the meeting was numerously attended, more so than we are accustomed to seeing. In honor to the ladies, it must be said that they outnumbered the men, though the men were well represented.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to order by the chairman of the association, Mrs. Liska, at 8 o'clock in the evening. Nearly all the newly elected representatives were present at the meeting and immediately inducted into the association. Various gifts were then announced, some of which were really remarkable.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ant. Zahrobsky turned in a check for two hundred dollars from the Garden City: Brewing company.</p>
   <p>Officers for the coming year were then elected. Mr. Eugene Frydl was elected chairman; <pb facs="5418478_5_1148.jpg" n="2"/>Mrs. Liska, vice-chairman; Mr. Vaclav Klenka, secretary; Mr. Jos. Bozovsky, treasurer. The following were elected to the managing committee: Messrs. Jos. Smejkal. A. Charvat, Jan Pech, Ant. Zahrobsky, and Vojt. Suchy. The auditing committee is composed of Messrs. Matejka, Janda, and Skarda.</p>
   <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
