   <p>At the last meeting of the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor (Czechoslovak Aid Committee), it was decided to continue, with unceasing effort, the work thus far accomplished,because the task of the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor is not yet completed. It is still necessary to support the widows and orphans of our fallen Bohemian legionnaires, and it is still necessary to do something for the legionnaires returning from Siberia, and especially for their wives and children who are in need of many things which the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor would like to give them but which are not possible at the present time because of insufficient funds.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the committee is appealing to all men of good will to support its work. Every contribution will be gratefully acknowledged, and the entire amount will be used for the above-mentioned purpose, because the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor has practically no expenses. Services to this organization are rendered gratis. Anybody who contributes as much as one <pb facs="5418478_5_1725.jpg" n="2"/>dollar will receive a membership card which, of course, may always be a pleasant souvenir.</p>
   <p>Contributions will be received by Mr. Otto Vasak at the American State Bank. The members of the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor are hereby notified that future meetings of the committee will be held the first Tuesday of every month at the Pilsen Sokol hall. Everybody who is interested in the work of the committee is welcome.</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor, founded six years ago, was the first organization of its kind in Bohemian-America. It is very anxious to fulfill its duties honorably until the end, that is, until conditions in the Czechoslovak Republic are satisfactory and no more aid is needed. To accomplish that, the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor hopes to receive sincere co-operation from the Bohemian people in its endeavor.</p>
   <p>For the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor,</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1726.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>James F. Stepina, chairman;</p>
   <p>Dr. Karel Neumann, secretary</p>
