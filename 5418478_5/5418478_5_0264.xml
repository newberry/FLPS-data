   <p>The great rally of the Order of Czech-American Foresters concluded with a session at 2 P.M. yesterday afternoon.....Among the many letters of congratulation read was one from the committee for the Slovak bazaar. The delegates voted to support the bazaar whole heartedly.....</p>
   <p>Brother Saufl spoke in favor of extending aid to the Tabor, one of the Forester lodges. The latter lost all its money deposited in the Tuma Bank which failed recently. The grand lodge of the Order declared that it could not help substantially toward re-establishing the finances of the Tabor, but recommended that all the lodges combine to help the brother lodge.....</p>
   <p>The next rally will be held in 1922.</p>

   <p>Brother Marek recommended that a regular editor be employed for the organ of the Foresters. The editorial work was always done by the secretary, who attended to his official duties at the same time. A salary is to be paid to the editor henceforth.....A resolution was passed to extend support to the Czech National Alliance.....The annual salary of the Chief Forester was raised twenty-five dollars. The editor of the organ will receive one hundred dollars per year.....The treasurer's yearly salary was raised twenty-five dollars.</p>
   <p>The meeting, which was adjourned at 5:30 P.M., took place in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. The delegates were then honored at a banquet.</p>
