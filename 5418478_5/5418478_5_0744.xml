   <p>......You may well believe me when I say that it is a difficult task to control the comings and goings of our youngsters, there being different hours set for school attendance and different hours for their return from school. Thus there is a constant traffic between 8 A. M. and 5 P. M., and I shall endeavor to arrange things so that there might be better uniformity and regularity as regards the time for attending classes. The classes in Czech [language and history] are also in need of adjustments. Our youngsters are rather lackadaisical when it comes to attending those classes, and I have no end of trouble trying to impress them with the necessity of regular attendance. I believe, however, that the situation may be greatly improved and that a love for the Czech tongue and the Czech school may be inculcated....</p>
   <p>Gymnastic exercises are likewise being engaged in, and fifty-one pupils attend the Sokol Rozvoj (Development); the smaller children stay at home where they <pb facs="5418478_5_0745.jpg" n="2"/>also have an opportunity to drill. The classes in embroidery are also in progress, and there is hope that our girls will some day become proficient in that art. One may also hear the strains of music resounding through the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage); that department is being managed by Mr. Rubringer, Mr. Hnatek (clarinet), and Mr. Coufal (piano).</p>
   <p>I need not stress the fact that our children have time for play; much freedom is given them in that respect, and you may believe me when I say that in spite of my age I love to take part in their games. Singing, too, is practiced as is attested by the silvery voices of the children; oftentimes when I see a group of singing children I ask for the singing of a particular song, for it is their singing that brings back to me the memories of my own youth.</p>
   <p>Nine o'clock has struck; it is evening, and silence reigns, throughout. Only the ticking of the clock is audible. Everybody in the Utulna is in deep slumber. But to be sure I make the rounds through the dormitories; here and <pb facs="5418478_5_0746.jpg" n="3"/>there I inspect the pockets of the boys to see whether they conceal some forbidden article. From the Orphanage I pass into the Old People's Home and after ascertaining that all is well, I retire myself. By that time the hour of midnight has struck. I am up at 6 A. M. to rouse the sleepers. And thus passes the day and the routine is not greatly changed from day to day. When Sunday comes both the young and the old are on tenterhooks to greet their weekly visitors, to seek greater strength in their love.</p>
   <p>That our appeal voiced on October 14, 1922 was heeded is now manifest in the many gifts of fruit, mushrooms, etc., which we received. Also the Czech Globe-trotters Club came to our Utulna on November 12 to bring merriment to our oldsters, and by its dramatic play to instill an appreciation of the Czech language in our children.....</p>
   <p>I now assure you, my countrymen, that I shall continue to work for the benefits and well-being of the Utulna A Sirotcinec.....I greet you all, and <pb facs="5418478_5_0747.jpg" n="4"/>all our inmates and wards greet you and look forward to the American Thanksgiving Day.</p>
   <p>[Following are the names of contributors and their] gifts: Mr. Richard Velky, Clutier, Iowa, one-half gallon of honey; Mr. H. A. Vopat, 2107 59th Court, Cicero, Illinois, two winter overcoats; Mrs. Antonin Stuchlik, Algonquin, Illinois, one bushel of apples and one bushel of walnuts. Mr. P. Borek, 3028 West 26th Street, one cake....; Chicago Butchers and Packers, one barrel of sausages and wieners; Mrs. J. Schistek, one cake; Mrs. Josef Triner, one dozen bottles of the famous Triner's wine--this will be a fine remedy for our old people. The W. F. Severa Company made gifts of medicines, pills, salves, and other medical necessities; Mr. James Comohouz collected $6.60 in our behalf at a surprise party given in honor of Mr. Samuel Ukablik by the students of the Technical High School. Mr. Josef Dusek presented us with the sum of $150, this being the balance left from the Bohemian-American Commercial Expedition to Czechoslovakia. Other gifts will be announced later.</p>

   <p>Many thanks for all.</p>
