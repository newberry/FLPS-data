   <p>The regular meeting of the board of trustees of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) took place last night with a fair attendance. Current matters were attended to and preparations made for Friday's mass meeting, at which there will be a discussion concerning changes in several articles of the constitution. After the meeting had been called to order by the president, John A. Cervenka, and the minutes of the previous meeting had been read, there followed the transmission of greetings from the treasurer of the organization, Frank G. Hajicek, who is in London at the present time. Dr. Newman presented the directory committee's report, which was accepted. An outline of the motions proposing changes in the constitution, as compiled by Dr. Pavlik, was recommended for presentation at the mass meeting. Other reports were presented by the collection committees; these were joyfully received, because they indicated a fine collection for the benefit of the hospital. A total of $422.50 was collected.</p>
