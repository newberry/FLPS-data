   <p>On May 15, 1922 the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) will have its tag day....It is the only day in the year on which the Spolecnost is enabled to meet its obligations and aims fully--to help our indigent families as much as possible. To make the proceeds of the tag day as large as possible, we need the help of our Czechoslovak women to sell tags. We need about one hundred women for this work, and about ten substitutes in case of fatigue.</p>
   <p>The poets have extolled the heart of a woman as a noble organ; let us prove that this is not a mere empty phrase, and that our Czechoslovak women and girls besides harboring the most beautiful feeling--love--have another feeling besides--that of charity and compassion for their fellow countrymen whom they are willing to bring the most indispensable aid. Let us therefore prove our understanding for a holy cause and call or telephone to the chairwoman of the tag day committee of the Spolecnost. The telephone numbers are Lawndale 4501 and Rockwell 1787.</p>

   <p>Next Saturday, May 13, there will be a meeting of all volunteers to whom will be issued instructions and other necessary advice, and to whom places will be assigned for the said tag day....Let the number of voluntary workers surprise our Czechoslovak colony, and let our motto be: "Aid and more aid!" The committee obtained some charming prizes, and these will be awarded to those ladies who collect the largest amounts.</p>
   <p>For the Tag Day committee of the Spolecnost,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, chairwoman of the committee.</p>
