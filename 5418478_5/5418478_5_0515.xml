<title level="a">CZECH DELEGATES TO GRAND LODGE</title></bibl>

   <p>Mr. Joseph Fakan and Mr. Frank J. Petru will leave today for Crawfordsville, Indiana, to represent Czech lodges at a meeting of directors of the Grand Lodge of the Tribe of Ben Hur. (a benevolent society). This meeting will be held tomorrow in the offices of the Grand Lodge. There have been many complaints by our countrymen against the Tribe of Ben Hur during the past year concerning the great difficulties in the paying of death claims, and very often forcing claiments to resort to the courts. Recently, Czech doctors were denied the right of examining countrymen for membership, and Czech lodges were left without a doctor of their own nationality. In the case of death of some member, the officers of the lodge and the beneficiaries are forced to have the required statements made out by <pb facs="5418478_5_0516.jpg" n="2"/>a doctor with whom very often they can not make themselves understood, The Grand Lodge has gone so far in its opposition toward the Czechs that it no longer is accepting new Czech members in Chicago. In its last meeting, the local organization, Central Body of the Czech Lodges of the Tribe of Ben Hur, in which are represented thirty-four Czech lodges with a membership of 3,500, elected Messrs. Frank J. Petru and Joseph Fakan to attend the meeting of the Grand Lodge officers in Crawfordsville, Indiana. These delegates have as their task to find out why Chicago Czechs are banned, to request the appointment of a Czech medical examiner, and the appointment of a Czech representative to the Board of Directors of the Grand Lodge. The Grand Lodge will also be given an emphatic request to pay claims more promptly, without court proceedings, as had been done formerly. It also requests the Grand Lodge to cease treating Chicago Czechs as if <pb facs="5418478_5_0517.jpg" n="3"/>they were an undesirable element in its membership. Attention will be called to the dissatisfaction existing among the members of Czech lodges, and the results it might have if conditions are not corrected as soon as possible.</p>
