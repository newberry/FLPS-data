   <p>A number of members of the Board of Directors of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) met under the chairmanship of Mr. John A. Cervenka in the premises of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) yesterday in order to discuss the only important matter now under consideration by the Board. It is the question of the building purchased some time ago for the Hospital. This matter was to have been discussed in a meeting which was scheduled before but which could not be held because of unforeseen obstacles.</p>
   <p>Already in a previous meeting the Board had come to the conclusion that present conditions made it impossible to consider seriously any building activity in connection with the Hospital. Since the building which was purchased is vacant, and thus subject to deterioration, which, if continued for any length of time, would result in considerable depreciation, negotiations have been begun that should lead either to a sale or a lease of the property. Mr. Cervenka presented a report of the progress of these negotiations, which have resulted in a certain <pb facs="5418478_5_0662.jpg" n="2"/>offer. However, this offer could not be disposed of because of the lack of a quorum in the meeting. Hence it was decided that the matter should stay, for the time being, in the hands of the president and the treasurer, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, who have been authorized to bring the negotiations to a stage in which they could be submitted for the consideration of the Board.</p>
   <p>The decision to lease or sell the property does not mean that the Board is giving up the work that should result in the establishment of the Hospital. Neither does it mean an indefinite postponement of that work. The Board is just doing what it has found necessary to do under the present circumstances, without resigning itself to future inactivity. The Board is determined to continue its work and bring the idea of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice to realization at the first opportunity that presents itself.</p>
