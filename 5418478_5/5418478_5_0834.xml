   <p>Inspections of the Bohemian Orphanage and Old People's Home have become customary events. This year, however, the new building, which was erected and equipped exclusively for the orphans, was exhibited before the members of the sponsoring association. We may state at the outset that the visitors viewed the new edifice with pride, because it was the result of hard work on the part of the friends and protectors of the institution and members of the managing committee. Needy orphans of our community will be given a comfortable home and the proper care they have been wanting.</p>
   <p>The addition has placed a heavy burden upon the shoulders of the association, and the Chicago Czech public should help to pay off the debt by generous contributions. For if this burden is lightened, those warm friends who <pb facs="5418478_5_0835.jpg" n="2"/>work for the maintenance of the Orphanage will be in a better position to devote their time and energy to the humanitarian cause.</p>
   <p>There are eighty-one wards in the Orphanage now, and prospects indicate that this number will be considerably increased in the near future, for applications are arriving constantly. Almost every member of our community is acquainted with the origin and growth of the Orphanage, so that we may restrict our report to a description of the standards by which it is governed.</p>
   <p>The visitor is impressed at the very threshold by the friendly atmosphere created by the spaciousness, simplicity, and usefulness of the interior which promises to be a veritable treasure box of comfort for the poor little ones whom an untoward fate has driven into the children's asylum. Our impression was strengthened by the appearance of the boys and girls when they assembled in the main hall. They did not look at all like children from an <pb facs="5418478_5_0836.jpg" n="3"/>orphanage. They had ruddy cheeks and lustrous eyes in which youthful, impish joy sparkled. Their good looks and mirthful behavior gave vivid proof of the efficiency of the guardians who strive to make up for the lack of parental love by reasonable, gentle treatment. In the evenings the children are allowed to express their wishes or complaints to Mr. Otto Dusek, the warden, or Mrs. Augusta Dusek, the matron. The children take ample advantage of this house rule and never fail to get a hearing, no matter how manifold or trifling their desires may appear to be.</p>
   <p>The main floor of the new building houses the office, dining room, kitchen, boilerhouse, and refrigerating plant with equipment. On the second floor a dormitory for the boys is on one side and one for the girls on the other side of the main assembly hall. On the third floor there are additional bedrooms for boys and girls which are separated by the rooms of the industrial school.</p>
   <p>The visitors assembled in the big hall where they were welcomed by Mr. Vojtech <pb facs="5418478_5_0837.jpg" n="4"/>(Adalbert) Suchy, chairman of the board of representatives of the Orphanage Association. A little girl named Kuntova recited a Czech poem, and another girl, M. Nebozka, also a ward of the institute, recited a poem "Incident of the French Camp" in English. A one-act play was given in which Miss Klecka, assisted by senior wards, played the leading role. Perhaps the most lively interest was evoked by a tableau in which junior wards appeared, representing the months of the year. Boys and girls were dressed to correspond with the colors and moods prevailing in the various months, and they sang tunes befitting the seasons. Several comic scenes enacted by the juvenile members furnished an exhilarating background for the entertainment.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Liska implored the audience not to forget the Orphanage in these times which are, true enough, not particularly propitious for institutes like this one. It is, she declared, not merely an asylum for children, but a place where the latter are brought up to become true sons and daughters of the Czech people. Mrs. Liska also offered a suggestion which <pb facs="5418478_5_0838.jpg" n="5"/>deserves closer consideration: An association which sought to build a hospital for Czechs had to cease its activities because of the war. It has, however, a certain amount of money on hand which might well be used as a fund for a Czech hospital to be built upon some lots owned by the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Smrcek appealed to the ladies of the various women's organizations in behalf of the Orphanage. She pointed to a very efficient system adopted by the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Czech Ladies' Unit) which provides for the sale of five-cent stamps, which has netted $550 annually for the benefit of the eighty-one orphans and thirty aged men and women of the Bohemian Old People's Home.(The latter is located in the old building.)</p>
   <p>The proposals of the two ladies who excel as untiring workers found great favor with the audience. The visitors then inspected an exhibition of manual and industrial work wrought by the pupils. They proceeded to the <pb facs="5418478_5_0839.jpg" n="6"/>old building where an infirmary is located, but it was empty. The management is extremely proud of the fact that none of its wards are sick.</p>
   <p>A party at which coffee and cakes were served ended the pleasant excursion.</p>
