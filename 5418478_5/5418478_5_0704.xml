   <p>The board of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) held its regular weekly meeting last night....Dr. Chvatal called attention to an article in the newspaper Narod, according to which the Sdruzeni Katolickych Cechu V Chicagu (Association of Bohemian Catholics in Chicago) would be willing to support the hospital if it is convinced that the hospital will be a completely nonsectarian institution, devoted to the welfare of our countrymen. During the ensuing debate, Dr. Fisher pointed out that according to specific provisions of the constitution and bylaws of the hospital association, neither creed nor political convictions will have any bearing upon the admission of a fellow countryman. The hospital will be open to every good American Bohemian, and, therefore, it is the duty of all Bohemians to support the hospital as much as they can.....</p>
   <p>....It was agreed that an additional payment of $8,000 should be made to Mr. Hajicek who had loaned the board of trustees a sum of money to buy the <pb facs="5418478_5_0705.jpg" n="2"/>property.....Contributions reported at the meeting amounted to $1,981.50; cash in the treasury, $6,865.64; total on hand, $8,847.14. Out of this, $8,000 was paid to Mr. Hajicek, leaving a balance of $847.14.</p>
