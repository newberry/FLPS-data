   <p>The Damsky Pomocny Spolek (Ladies' Aid Society of the Bohemian Orphanage) in a meeting held in the new building of the orphanage on November 7, 1917, commemorated the first anniversary of its founding. Mrs. Wiesov, president, presented a report on that group's activities which was loudly acclaimed.</p>
   <p>The original idea conceived by Mrs. Wiesov and the late Mrs. Vavrinek was to create a smaller circle of women who would supply the wards with stockings and other necessary articles of clothing. The enthusiastic response to this undertaking on the part of Czech ladies prompted her to enlarge the scope of the charitable enterprise, for there were several hundred friends of the orphans who offered a helping hand. From the contributions of twenty-five cents per month paid by each member, it was possible to enlarge upon the donations, so that underwear and even articles of luxury could be procured. There was a great need for this work, according to Mr. and Mrs. Dusek, superintendent and matron of the institute.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0833.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the first year, the regular membership of the Ladies' Aid grew to 220. No expenses whatever accrue to the orphanage from the activities of the ladies, who meet at the institute once a month, bring some bakery goods along, and pay for the coffee served by the house. The entire income of the Ladies' Aid can, in this way, be devoted to the orphanage.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected at the annual meeting, for the statutes forbid an office to be held consecutively by one person.</p>
   <p>Membership in this organization is doubly recommended, for it seems that the entire attention of our community is now centered upon the care of the Czech volunteers in France and other countries, and so the interest for the orphanage is lagging. The creation of the Ladies' Aid has come as a timely remedy for this conditions.</p>
