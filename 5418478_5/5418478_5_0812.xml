   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Sbor Ceska Utulny a Sirotcinec v Chicagu (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage Association of Chicago) was held yesterday in the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. J. Suchy. The secretary, Mrs. Bozena Krabec, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved as read. The reading of communications followed. A letter with a check for $1,803.27 inclosed aroused the greatest interest. It was the share of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec from the collections of the last tag day. The check was sent by the Chicago Federation of Aged and Adult Charities of which the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec is a member.</p>
   <p>A letter was read in which Mrs. Anna Zarobsky, a member of the board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, announced her resignation. The resignation was not accepted and the board of directors was instructed to <pb facs="5418478_5_0813.jpg" n="2"/>induce Mrs. Zarobsky, who is one of the most ardent workers, to withdraw her resignation.....</p>
   <p>The reading of the minutes of the past meeting of the board of directors followed. The superintendent, Mr. Jaroslav Bukovsky, presented his report on an accident which occurred in the orphanage on June 1. A boy, Jan Nedobry, in spite of strict orders, entered the laundry where he proceeded to entertain himself by starting and stopping a piece of machinery called a mangle. While doing that his hand was caught in the machine. The injured boy was given first aid by a doctor who ordered him to be taken to the County Hospital, where, according to the announcement, he died June 3.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Janda, member of the board of directors, reported the result of negotiations with the board of directors of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) regarding the sale of a piece of land owned by the Ceska <pb facs="5418478_5_0814.jpg" n="3"/>Utulna a Sirotcinec. The board of directors of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov were not in favor of this purchase but they promised to present this matter, to be voted upon, at the next meeting of the Association. The report was approved and it was resolved that in case the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbibova (Board of Delegates to Bohemian National Cemetery) should vote down the purchase, to sell that piece of land to a buyer who was interested in it before. But it is not to be sold for less than $5,000.....</p>
   <p>Receipts for the month of May amounted to $2,929.92; expenditures totaled $2,791.23.</p>
