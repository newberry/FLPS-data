  <body>
   <p>There was a meeting of the board of delegates of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) which took place last evening at eight o'clock in the lower hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). It was very well attended. The meeting, which began promptly at 8 P. M., was opened by the president, Mr. Vojtech Suchy. [This meeting] marks the beginning of a new season for this charitable institution. After the minutes of the preceding meeting were read by the secretary, Mrs. Bozena Krabec, a motion was made and seconded that they be accepted as read. It appeared from the letters which were read that the Patronat Cesko-Americke Svobodne Skoly (Trustees of Bohemian-American Free Thought Schools) will discontinue the upkeep of its school due to an insufficient number of students; this organization has consequently divided its <pb facs="5418478_5_0968.jpg" n="2"/>capital, giving $288.50 to the Utulna A Sirotcinec and a similar amount to the Ceske Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Though Schools). The following societies and organizations have chosen their delegates to our board: [There follows a long list of lodges and their delegates.]</p>
   <p>All of these delegates were appropriately greeted by the president and asked to work for the good of the Utulna A Sirotcinec. Thereupon, all the incoming bills were presented and read. The bills, totaling $2454.06, were approved by the delegates [and payment was ordered]. Mr. Trnka, as secretary of the executive committee, then read the minutes of the meetings of that body. The minutes revealed the following:</p>
   <p>Mr. Bohumil Fiser was re-appointed managing director of the Utulna A Sirotcinec, and Mrs. Fiser was reappointed matron. Mr. Fiser, as the managing director of the institution, was also appointed by the Juvenile court to act as an assistant of that court.</p>
   <p>Applications for the acceptance of the following children by the institution <pb facs="5418478_5_0969.jpg" n="3"/>were made: Helena Hajek, aged 12 years; Katerina Hajek, aged 8 years; Libuse Hajek, aged 4 years. These children are now under the surveillance of the Probate Court, and a decision had to be made in this meeting whether they are to be accepted by the Utulna A Sirotcinec, and the said court was to be advised accordingly. Their mother is dead and their father is an inmate of the state hospital at Dunning. It was unanimously decided to accept these children and to inform the court about the action.</p>
   <p>A blank contract form was submitted [to the delegates for approval]. This document is a legal and binding contract between the board of directors of the Utulna A Sirotcinec and such persons who wish to make applications for the Utulna A Sirotcinec's acceptance of any aged person to whose support they could contribute as relatives or as children. In this document they agree to pay a certain sum of money every month. The document was composed by an experienced lawyer, and since it is of great advantage to us, the form was approved and five hundred copies were ordered printed.</p>
   <p>An insurance policy against theft for $1,500, covering the interior of [our] <pb facs="5418478_5_0970.jpg" n="4"/>building, and for $1,500, covering the outside of it, was approved. The annual premium for this will be $30. Mesdames Smolar, Gruenwald, and Krabec reported [an incident] relative to the Children's Benefit League. It appears that on the last tag day, an error occurred, and, as some of the members of the said league claim, some of our ladies who tagged the passers-by for the benefit of our Utulna A Sirotcinec, did so on a street corner which was allotted to the members of some other institution; our ladies' committee is now being urged to return the boxes with money collected on that corner. Our ladies assert that they had a full right to tag people on that corner, and that the misunderstanding is the fault of some of the officials of the Children's Benefit League who assigned places to taggers, but who now do not want to acknowledge their own error. Such errors and misunderstandings are said to be quite usual in the aforesaid league, and due to the large number of organizations which are represented in it, they are easily committed. It is necessary [therefore] that our board defend our legal rights with firmness; it was approved that the board take the necessary steps in this direction.</p>
   <p>For this year it will be our endeavor to secure as our representatives to <pb facs="5418478_5_0971.jpg" n="5"/>the said league such ladies who are well acquainted with the English language and who would thus be enabled to represent the Utulna A Sirotcinec.</p>
   <p>The managing director reported that all [our] children have been vaccinated; the medical services as well as the vaccines were furnished by Dr. Allan J. Hruby.....A letter was read from the principal of the school which our children attend. The letter praises the appearance of our children, saying that they are clean, both in their bodies and their wearing apparel, and that he is also satisfied with their progress at school.....The managing director reported our bank deposits, which amount to $13,197.67. As was decided in the previous meeting of the delegates, a reserve fund will be created from the sum of $20,000 and the money will be applied toward the purchase of gilt-edged securities which will bring earnings. These earnings, together with any bequests left us--if not utilized for any other definite purposes--should be deposited in the reserve fund until they reach the sum of $50,000. This matter is to be handled by the board of directors with the full approval of the board of delegates. Current gifts and contributions, however, as well as <pb facs="5418478_5_0972.jpg" n="6"/>any other income, may not be used for this proposed reserve fund. This fund, to distinquish it from other funds--such as the clothing fund for children, etc.--shall be known as the reserve fund, and the board of directors may draw upon it only with the full approval of two thirds of the members of the board of delegates who are present in a meeting.....This matter is to be worked out in greater detail by Messrs. Suchy and Charyat.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Urbanek reported on the matter of employing a registered nurse for our orphanage. This is also the wish of our Bohemian physicians.....The nurse, Miss Anna Lorenz, is well known by the recommending physicians.....</p>
   <p>The president thanked everyone present, all of our institutions and organizations, and the representatives of the Denni Hlasatel and Svornost for their impartial reporting of all matters relative to the Utulna A Sirotcinec. He asked everyone to work unselfishly and thus furnish an example to others in their work. With this address, the memorable meeting came to an end, and we are now on the threshold of a new season and new work for the benefit of our <pb facs="5418478_5_0973.jpg" n="7"/>most needy brothers of Czechoslovak origin--the helpless aged people of both sexes and the [unfortunate] orphans.</p>
