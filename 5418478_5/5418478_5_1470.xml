   <p>Mr. Vilem Koukola, who is a gardener living with his family at 108 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois, need not feel deserted. New contributions are reaching our offices daily; every day brings him some new friends who, by their actions, give ample evidence that they desire to help as their consciences dictate in behalf of a suffering countryman and human being. Mr. Vilem Koukola and his eldest daughter, Amalka, bless the donors. His daughter, although twelve years old, is unable to speak and is almost totally blind. But if she herself cannot express her gratitude orally, her little heart surely speaks for her by its heightened rhythm when witnessing the joy brought to her parents and the other members of her family by the generosity of these newly acquired friends. [There follow the names of contributors and the amounts contributed.]</p>
   <p>Whoever wishes to show that he is a sensitive and charitable human being in a case in which it is imperative that immediate help be given, should do so now, <pb facs="5418478_5_1471.jpg" n="2"/>at once. Every contributor's name, together with the amount given, will be published in the columns of this newspaper, and our thanks will go to those who remember the sorely stricken family.</p>
