   <p>The Czech Benevolent Society will hold a Tag Day in the Czech National Cemetery May 30. To further bolster its finances, it has arranged for an evening with an abundance of artistic numbers. This affair is scheduled for October 24. It will be held in the Assembly Hall of Carter H. Harrison High School. The permission for the use of the premises has been given by the School Board, although the latter heretofore was not considered as a particular friend of the Czechs. Two ladies from the Benevolent Society, Mrs. Princ and Mrs. Sokol, were instrumental in obtaining permission, which was exceptional in one respect. The Benevolent Society will be allowed to collect an admission of 25 cents. The school rooms have never before been placed at the disposal of organizations which charged an admission. It is to be hoped that a fair amount of money will be collected as it will be very much needed for the coming winter.</p>
