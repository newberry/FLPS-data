   <p>If any one should doubt the value of our aid societies as national organizations, he can rectify his erroneous notions by considering the munificent amount of money donated to the Czech National Association by the diverse units, orders, lodges, courts, and groups. All of these are combining their forces to make the proposed bazaar of the Czech National Association a brilliant success, and so contribute to the work done by us for the liberation of our old homeland. All of the brotherhoods and sisterhoods have for many years been giving their best efforts to patriotic enterprise. Most of the important national projects could not possibly have been carried on without their ardent cooperation.</p>
   <p>Suffice it to point to our liberal school whose maintenance depends solely upon the patriotic good will of the societies. In other words, there could not exist one Czech language school in Chicago without their support. Of <pb facs="5418478_5_0342.jpg" n="2"/>all our national institutions which have become necessities in these times, the Czech Liberal school is the most important. It has become an urgent need since immigration was restricted. Not much attention had been paid to the Czech school as long as great throngs of immigrants disembarked on our shores. The World War has materially changed these conditions. The Czech school here represents the only source from which to draw national consciousness sufficient for the building up and perpetuating of national associations. The latter, in turn, while maintaining the Czech school, work for their own preservation by securing the allegiance of the Czech-American adolescent.</p>
   <p>This refutes the contention frequently voiced that the Czech aid societies are nothing but insurance companies, and, therefore, not very different from the American mutual aid societies. Insurance is, of course, the essence of membership, even in our societies, but the concomitant of national obligation elevates our organizations above the level of mere economic ventures. This <pb facs="5418478_5_0343.jpg" n="3"/>fact also distinguishes our associations from the organizations of other nationalities, and should stimulate our fellow countrymen to join some Czech-American society. To be a member of our societies, means not only ownership of a security, but the performance of a duty toward our people as well.</p>
