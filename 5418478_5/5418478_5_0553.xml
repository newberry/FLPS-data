  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Old People's Home and Orphanage Association was called to order by Mr. Ant. Charvat. All members were present. A report on the number of inmates of the institution was then read. At the beginning of May, there were fourteen women and ten men in the Home. In the Orphanage, the number of inmates has not changed lately, there being twelve girls and twelve boys. Following the reading of the report, the minutes of the previous meeting were read and given close attention by the members of the Association. Likewise, the living quarters of Frantisek Eisanhamer, deceased, were given attention, and disinfected, so as to prevent other children being stricken with the infectious disease. The chairman then read the receipts of the day. (List of contributors given).</p>

   <p>Communications from persons wishing to enter the home were then read. The communications were accepted, and the requests will be taken care of according to a resolution adopted in the meeting.</p>
   <p>A motion was made that, in the future, there be a roll call of the membership and that those members absenting themselves from the meetings of the body be dropped, and new members elected. The meeting was then adjourned, and a special meeting called for next Wednesday.</p>
