   <p>P.9--The minutes of the meeting held on January 3, 1906 by the Sponsors of the Bohemian-Catholic hall. The meeting was brought to order by brother chairman V. Beranek at the regular time, with a prayer and in the presence of all officers and a large attendance of representatives. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved without change. The excuse of representative brother, Jos. Kalina, that he is ill and unable to attend, was accepted. The committee on arrangements for the sponsors' fair made a report, in which it announced, that it had everything duly arranged and provided for. The report was accepted. After that a sub-committee, for the fair, was elected. Those elected were: Mat. Tintera and Fr. Capek, to operate the wheels-of-fortune; Jos. Mrazek and V. Rezab, cashiers at the bar; Ant. Brychta and Vac. Lhotak, "Under the Green" Vac. Hessler, to assist at the wheel. The ladies accepted to represent the committee for candy and sweets. Other committees are to be selected from the members of the society. Vac. Beranek and Vac. Krizek were appointed as representatives of the Sponsors, to attend a meeting of St. Oldrich, court of Catholic Foresters, because the court desired some form of oral explanation.</p>
