   <p>A meeting was held yesterday afternoon in the hall of the Bohemian American Sokol, for the purpose of organizing a society for the protection of Bohemian immigrants. Forty-five citizens were present. Mr. Fr. Kaspar called the meeting to order and Mr. Ed. Uhlir was elected chairman; Mr. Kralovec Jr. was elected secretary.</p>
   <p>After several motions, which did not reach a vote, citizen L.W. Kadlec, moved that the chairman appoint nine Chicago citizens as a committee, this committee to take charge of the matter as it now stands, organize themselves into a solid body and make plans for future development; then call a public meeting where steps would be taken for their fulfillment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chairman Uhlir is to exercize care in naming men who are capable and familiar with the matter, and who have the confidence of the public. Mr. Kralovec added that other nationalities, having such societies in existence should investigate and our committee of nine make a report on their activities. Let our society be patterned along the lines of whichever one of the various organizations is recognized a the most suitable. The motion being accepted, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
