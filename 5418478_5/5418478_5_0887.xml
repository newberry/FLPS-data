   <p>p. 1.--The treasury of the Bohemian Orphanage Asylum and the Old Peoples' Home will derive some financial benefit from the profits of the picnic held last Friday by the delegates of the"Jednota Ceskych Dam"(Bohemian Ladies Unity) who have returned from the convention held in Cleveland, Ohio recently.</p>
   <p>This picnic was held on the grounds owned by the Bohemian National Cemetery. The use of the grounds was free of charge, as this picnic was held for the benefit of the Orphanage and Old Peoples' Home.</p>
   <p>The picnic started at 10:00 o'clock in the morning. The delegates were discussing the convention; a speech followed and then the picnic was opened to the public for enjoyment.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0888.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was decided to turn over the profits of this picnic to the secretary of the institution. The officials of the Orphanage and of the Old Peoples' Home expressed their thanks and appreciation to both the Bohemian National Cemetery and the Bohemian Ladies Unity for their kind donations.</p>
   <p>Whatever affairs are held, the Orphanage and Old Peoples' Home are always remembered in the way of contributions for these institutions. Thanks to those delegates for arranging this picnic.</p>
