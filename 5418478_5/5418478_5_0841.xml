   <p>The subsidy granted regularly by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County was one of the main subjects under discussion in the meeting held last night. The disbursement of the money has been stopped by the court. The state law forbids monetary support to be loaned by the Board to organizations classified as "sectarian". The Czech Old People's Home and the Orphanage seem to have been looked upon as such.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Antoni Charvat and Frank J. Petru reported to the meeting in this matter. Both, as representatives of the two charitable organizations, had appeared before the Finance Committee of the Board and explained that no religion was taught in the Orphanage and no rites of any church are tolerated. Their statement was acknowledged by the Committee. There is good hope for the subvention for the organizations to be continued.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0842.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A resolution was passed allowing children from the Orphanage to take part in theatrical performances providing they will return before 6 P. M.</p>
   <p>A call from the Chicago Federation for the Aged was read, in which Czech women are invited to take active part as solicitors on Tag Day, May 14. They are promised advantageous locations and good results for their endeavor.</p>
   <p>The report on finances shows receipts of $22,439.01, and disbursements of $21,945.98. The total assets are computed at $116,496.78.</p>
   <p>Of the expenses for administration, $300 each was paid to the building manager and the governess; $322 to the cook and to the housegirls; $56 to the assistant female guard; $105 to the janitor, etc. These wages were paid for one half year's service.</p>

   <p>There were thirty-nine inmates in the Orphanage in the year of 1916, twenty-five boys and fourteen girls. An additional fourteen boys and five girls were given into the care of that institution by guardians, and thirteen boys and eleven girls by the Juvenile Court so that there were eighty-two wards in the institution. Eleven were taken out, and there were seventy-one left at the end of 1916.</p>
   <p>Twelve men and ten women were in the Old People's Home; two men and six women were recently accepted, so that thirty inmates were there at one time; two men left and two died during the year. Fifty-four applications were received during the year. Of these thirty-six were accepted upon recommendation of either the court or members of the reception committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0844.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Both institutions since 1912 have been under state inspection, as a result of which industrial instruction was introduced in the Orphanage. The County Board granted a regular subvention for the children sent by the Juvenile Court; the money received from that source amounted to $2,613 for the past year.</p>
   <p>The Damsky Dobrocinny Krouzek v Ceskem Sirocinci (Ladies Charity Circle in the Czech Orphanage) was founded on November 1. It has two hundred members now, each of whom pays twenty-five cents per month. A similar ladies' organization works for the benefit of the Old People's Home.</p>
