   <p>....The assistant secretary of the convention, Sister Pokorny, read the minutes of the fourth session which were approved, and we correct in accordance with them, our yesterday's report to the effect that the new rate table was adopted by a vote of 36 against 19 delegates.....</p>
   <p>....The resolutions committee recommended a change in Article II of the constitution dealing with new members so that it would read, "Membership in a member lodge is open to any man or woman of good reputation, able to speak the Czechoslovak (sic) language and sixteen years of age or older....." It was adopted.....</p>
   <p>....The next convention of the Ceskoamericti Lesnici a Lesnice (Czech-American [Men and Women] Foresters), will be held in the year 1925.....</p>

   <p>The election of officers of the Grand Lodge was then taken up. It was decided that all those who acted as delegates to this convention are eligible for election to offices of the Grand Lodge. As remuneration for the officers, it was agreed that the president of the Grand Lodge should receive $220 instead the former $150 a year; the vice-president, $100 instead of $35; the secretary, who is simultaneously the editor of the official organ (and as such gets $100), $800 instead of $600; the treasurer $200 instead of $150; and each member of the board of directors, $30 instead of $25 a year. The doorkeepers (there are two of them) will be getting $10 a year.....</p>
