   <p>A regular meeting of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage) was held in the usual place yesterday.....</p>
   <p>The minutes of the last meeting dealt with the distribution of functions among the officers on the occasion of the 26th Street Businessmen's Carnival, when a portion of the receipts of the wheels of fortune were to go to the Utulna a Sirotcinec.....</p>
   <p>Mr. [John A.] Sokol reported that $38.20 was collected for the institution at an entertainment given by the Klub Svobodnych Zednaru "Dobrovsky" (Dobrovsky Free Masons' Club). Similarly, Mr. Frank Petru reported a collection for the Utulna a Sirotcinec of $21 at the convention of benevolent societies in Champaign, Illinois.....</p>
   <p>Among the reports of the officers was also that of Mr. Freiler, dealing with the <pb facs="5418478_5_1062.jpg" n="2"/>sale of chances on the lot. The report shows a net profit of $787.35, and also accounts due of $74.75, and $45.50 receivable from individuals and organizations for chances.....</p>
   <p>The financial report disclosed the fact that the share of the Utulna a Sirotcinec of the profit of the 26th Street Carnival amounted to $62.43.....</p>
   <p>More encouraging was the outcome of the tag day of the Children's Benefit League in which the Utulna a Sirotcinec participated. The report showed an income of $719.98, to which $2 collected by Miss Smolar must be added.....</p>
   <p>Another gratifying report was that of Mr. Tichy, according to which the Tesarsko-Truhlarska Unie (Carpenters' and Cabinetmakers' Union) No. 54 donated $500 and decided to donate the promised work, free of charge....Consequently the motion to make that union an honorary member of the Utulna a Sirotcinec was unanimously adopted.....</p>

   <p>Manager Dusek reported an income of $5,092.11, and an expenditure of $3,384.78.....</p>
