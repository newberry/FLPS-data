<title level="a">ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF THE CESKO-SLOVANSKA JEDNOTA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The annual festival of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Union) held January 1 at Pilsen Sokol hall attracted so many of our countrymen that the spacious auditorium was filled to capacity. Dr. Karel Neumann, president of the grand lodge, opened the program at 2 P. M. with a brief speech. The speaker was rewarded with a storm of applause. Mrs. Otilie Splavec then entertained the audience with a humorous act, for which she also reaped spontaneous applause.....</p>
   <p>Brother Turek then presented the financial report, from which it appears that the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota is in sound financial condition. The report shows that there are 63 lodges in the Jednota with 5,826 members. For the mortuary fund, the sum of $75,439.58 was received from subordinate lodges. From this amount, $71,600 was paid out in death claims. During the past year 85 members passed away. The agitation fund amounts to $2,310.08; the reserve fund, $94,419.91. The total assets of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota are $109,703.52.</p>
