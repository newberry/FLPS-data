   <p>Our hearts were filled with joy when we in America were given an opportunity to assist in the struggle for the liberation of our Czech and Slovak lands. We made willing contributions to the cause of liberation, and our wishes for a speedy success of our action were sincere. In the meantime our countrymen beyond the seas suffered. All loyal Czechs and Slovaks suffered because of material want, because of political oppression, and because of fear of the future.</p>
   <p>But now the time has come when it is necessary to have more than an understanding of and a sympathy for an oppressed people. Our participation in the cause [of liberty] had to be augmented by acts requiring greater sacrifice--our own blood. And again our hearts were filled with joy when hundreds of our [Bohemian-American] boys answered the call, boys who were willing to sacrifice their health and give their lives. And while we kept up our recruiting <pb facs="5418478_5_1256.jpg" n="2"/>activities at home our boys were already fighting in bloody battles and spending their days and nights in the madness of war. They were surrounded by untold miseries.</p>
   <p>Our cause was successful, and what we so ardently desired became a fact. With joyous pride do we now accept the thanks of a liberated nation, both Czech and Slovak. It was only recently that another proof of their gratitude was manifested to us by their sending us an urn containing the sacred soil of our native land. That renewed assurance of their deep appreciation was received by the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada (Czechoslovak National Council), the central office of which is located in Chicago. This last act [of the liberated people] was utilized by the National Council here in Chicago in bringing to our attention the necessity of finishing the cause of liberation by taking care of those who sacrificed their lives and the comforts of their families that Czechoslovakia might exist. Almost one hundred of our Bohemian-American boys died in battle...and many more of them returned crippled from the battlefields of <pb facs="5418478_5_1257.jpg" n="3"/>France and Hungary. The Czechoslovak Legionnaires' Aid Society of Cleveland asks aid for hundreds of suffering invalids, widows, and orphans.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Rada, after satisfying its members about the indispensability and urgency of that aid, now asks all Czechoslovaks of Chicago and vicinity to do their duty towards our legionnaires. It has launched a campaign to collect contributions among the Czechoslovaks of Chicago and vicinity for the creation of a fund to aid the invalid legionnaires and the widows and orphans of fallen legionnaires. That campaign begins today. Our joy at having liberated our native lands will be unalloyed after this, our last duty, is done.</p>
