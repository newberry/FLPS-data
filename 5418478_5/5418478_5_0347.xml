<title level="a">OLDEST CZECH BROTHERHOOD CELEBRATES</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The spacious hall could hardly accommodate the large crowd in festive mood that surged into the home of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society to celebrate New Year's eve. This society is the oldest and most widespread Czech brotherhood in the United States. The attendance was much larger than the one at our recent jubilee festival. If there is a deeper sense to be attached to this increase, it may mean an augmented grasp of the brotherhood's value for our public life, and a manifestation of willingness to extend aid to the association, so prosperous for many years, in order to make it grow bigger still.</p>
   <p>The managing committee, consisting of brethren J. Janda, V. Cerny, Mejdrich, Rusin, and Soukup had prepared a program full of variety and artistic values which, though it comprised eighteen numbers, held the attention of <pb facs="5418478_5_0348.jpg" n="2"/>the crowds to the very end. One of the high points of the affair was the festival oration delivered by brother Vaclav Svarc, of Cleveland, who took the floor after the rendition by Mr. and Mrs. Arno Hess of the national anthem "Kde Domov Muj?" (Where Is My Homeland?), and referred to the song by pointing to its beauty and patriotic spirit, which should, particularly in this momentous era, pervade every Czech soul and stimulate them to patriotic sacrifice. The speaker said that he belonged to twenty different societies, but that he would not hesitate to belong to the C. S. P. S. if he had the choice of one only. The reason for this, he proclaimed is not only because the society guarantees so many benefits, but because it represents a link between the people and the nation, and has contributed in great measure to our prosperity in America and to the sustenance of patriotic feeling in our new homeland. This country, he <pb facs="5418478_5_0349.jpg" n="3"/>admonished the gathering, has not only great fortunes, but many temptations as well in store, which fact should urge us to combine all our strength to properly fulfill our national duties. He continued: "We Czech-Americans are a mere reflex of the Czechs of the old country, but must be mindful of the precious heritage from our forefathers and our great men, and we must fearlessly proclaim our allegiance to our nationality, just as the pioneers and the founders of this association have done. We ought to look up with reverence to our national association help them into prosperity, and finally get rid of the ugly habit of thinking that the foreign associations are better than ours. It is a notion, painful to mention, of some of the parents that they are neglecting their duty when they raise their children in the Czech spirit, and when they do not suppress Czech feeling, as if life were more worth living without it.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0350.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>True enough, it seems difficult to prevent our children from becoming denationalized while they are in constant contact with those who speak English, but with some good will we can make them remain loyal to the mother tongue. If the Americans show eagerness to learn foreign tongues, as for instance Russian, it is much more our duty to save our children for the Czech nation. It is to you, Czechs of Chicago, that we look up as the most numerous and prosperous branch of the people; this implies the admonition that you should not forget to use the opportunity given by your riches to do your duty for the welfare of the nation. Just as the poor man is duty bound to his nation, so is the rich man, only to a greater extent. The C. S. P. S. has always done its duty, and its growth shall guarantee the welfare of the great Czech-American family."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0351.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After these words in the Czech language, Mr. Svarz addressed the adolescent, who were strongly represented in the English language; he gave them a sincere talk which was frequently interrupted by salvos of applause as was his main speech.</p>
   <p>The brilliant success of yesterday's celebration will be an inspiration to further national activities for all of us.</p>
