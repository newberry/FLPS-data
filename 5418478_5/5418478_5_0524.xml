   <p>Prior to four weeks ago we were preparing for the gigantic celebration of Havlicek. [The Karel Havlicek monument unveiling ceremonies.] We awaited it with expectancy, we all worked so that it might be completely successful. Liberal-minded Czechs of Chicago are again making preparations, again they are filled with hopeful expectation and again they are zealously working for the success of the celebration which takes place today and by which the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society celebrates its thirty-fifth anniversary. The Czech-Slovanic Benevolent Society was founded more than fifty-seven years ago, in March 1854, in St. Louis, Missouri. At that time, our communities in Illinois, and first of all in Chicago, were small; there were no newspapers to spread reports about the successful activities of the Czech undertakings, there were no active contacts <pb facs="5418478_5_0525.jpg" n="2"/>between separate Czech-American communities and as a result the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Societies developed very slowly. It was not until September 18, 1875 that the first Chicago lodge of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society was organized. This lodge was named Vernost and was number eight; afterwards, in the next year, June 1876, the Illinois Grand Lodge was formed. After this followed rapidly the organization of Lodges Praha, Rovnost, Jungman, Jiri Podebradsky and Osveta. These are the oldest members of the powerful order of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society in Chicago. New lodges were added rapidly after that and today about 7,000 enlightened Czech men and women come under the banner of the society. About one third of all the membership of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society is in Chicago.</p>
   <p>When the Grand Lodge, the central body of the Society in the State, celebrates the anniversary of its founding, the entire local membership celebrates with it and the whole Czech public should be interested in such a celebration. It is certain that it will be a demonstration of gigantic <pb facs="5418478_5_0526.jpg" n="3"/>proportions, that it will be a genuine exhibition of the strength of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society lodges, and that the fraternity which made the lodges what they are today, will ensue. Czechs who look upon the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society as their most important organization will celebrate their holiday today. This will be evident even before the parade which will leave at 9:30 A. M. from the Society's hall on Eighteenth Street.....The program in the Pilsen Brewery Company's park on Twenty-sixth Street will begin at 2 P. M. and will consist of the following numbers.....</p>
