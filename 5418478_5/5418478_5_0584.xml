   <p>Much has been said and written about how beneficial it would be if we were not broken up into so many small organizations, but create one large unit; efforts have been made, but until recently it seemed that all efforts were useless. However, it is now evident that the idea has gained ground among the membership of four of our units, and is hastening rapidly to an early realization, if on unforseen obstacles crop up.</p>
   <p>The organizations, which are earnestly considering plans for uniting, are Cesko-Americti Lesnici, (Bohemian American Foresters) Cesko-Slovansti Rytiri A Damy, (Czecho-Slovak Knights and Ladies) Cesko-Slovanka Bratrska Podporujici Jednoth, (Czecho Slovak Fraternal Benefit Association) and Taboriti (Laborites). Recently each of these organizations appointed three members to form a committee to consider, such a program of unification, <pb facs="5418478_5_0585.jpg" n="2"/>This committee worked earnestly, held several meetings, considered various motions, and adopted a plan for the formation of a union of their respective organizations. The chief points of the plan are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Every member of the united organizations can be insured in the same amount as he now is.</p>
   <p>2. Every member now, insured can continue to carry the same amount as his present total of insurance, in all of the said organizations. A joint Convention of the uniting organizations would determine the maximum amount of insurance permissible, and the member could then insure himself in several of the organizations in such sums as would approximate his previous insurance.</p>
   <p>3. The joint convention would determine in what manner death were to be provided for. Either an assessment would be levied for each deceased member according to the amount of insurance carried, or would be levied according to need.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0586.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>4. Every member would enter into the same age classification as the one on the books of his present organization.</p>
   <p>5. If the insured member belongs to more organizations, the age upon which be formerly paid would be taken as a guide for the scale: by averaging the assessments of the various organizations, and placing him into a new scale, which would come nearest to those he had been paying.</p>
   <p>6. A member belonging to more than one organization can choose into which one he wishes to pay his assesments.</p>
   <p>The benefits of such a union have been pointed out in our paper many times, all the members of the participating organization know them and are convinced.</p>
   <p>Now it rests with the individual organizations to express themselves clearly regarding the work of the committee, and the plan they have developed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0587.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If the plan receives recognition and approval and we have no doubt it will, a joint meeting of the participating organizations will be called as soon as possible and every effort made to realize the creation of this union as speedily as possible.</p>
   <p>This important work is being followed with the greatest interest, not only by the members of the participating units, but by the entire Bohemian public.</p>
