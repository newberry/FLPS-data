   <p>Bids have been submitted for the construction of the Old People's Home. We have been waiting for this for twelve years, and we welcome this step with great satisfaction. But at the same time we express the hope that we shall not have to wait another twelve years for the actual construction or furnishing of the Home. Nevertheless we must not reproach the Association in any way, for its representatives have always done their duty. Rather it is our fault, the fault of all of us, because we were not generous enough, were not energetic enough in seeing to the establishment of an Old People's Home and an Orphanage. This noble, truly necessary undertaking should have been the goal of all Bohemians; we should all have done our duty, and then it would have been completed long ago. Thus far we have not done so. We depended upon one another, and the majority of us left all the work for the minority. The Old People's Home was not sufficient for us; we immediately started a dozen other projects and tried to work on all of them at once.</p>
   <p>Yes, we started; but when shall we finish? We speak beautifully and <pb facs="5418478_5_1138.jpg" n="2"/>enthusiastically, but at the same time we divide our strength and then complain that we are weak, that we shall not accomplish anything. We had one objective, and we should have dedicated ourselves industriously to it. Then, after we had brought it to a successful conclusion, we could have worked with eager energy on another. Why don't we do it that way?</p>
