   <p>The regular meeting of the delegates of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association was held last night in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporující Spolecnost (Czecho-Slovac Benevolent Association), at 18th and May Streets. Candidates for the various committees were nominated. From the results it appears that members will be almost the same as last year. Mr. Jan recha, the resent president of the Association, and Mr. Joseph Ringl, vice-president, were nominated unanimously and without debate. Mr. B. Vacek, secretary, and Mr. Victor H. Filip, treasurer, were also nominated to succeed themselves. Messrs. Joseph Jurka and Joseph A. Smejkal accepted nomination as members of the executive committee, whose terms are for two years. Messrs. Fr. Boucek, Frydl, and Spevak will be candidates for the one year term on that committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0290.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Messrs. Jan Klaus, Jos. Kriz, and Albert Machacek were nominated for the auditing committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Tuma, manager, submitted the financial report, in the absence of the regular bookkeeper, Mr. Husak who was sick. There were forty-eight workmen employed last month, who received a total of $3,226.76 in wages.</p>
   <p>A letter from the County committee of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Czech National Alliance) was read. It informed the meeting that Mr. Laler, a member of the County committee, was sent to plead for another contribution, such as has been granted annually by the Cemetery Association to the Alliance. Mr. Laler emphasized the need of necessary funds for the maintenance of the Czechoslovak Army in France [originated and sponsored by the Alliance]. lively debate ensued, after which it was resolved that the Cemetery executive committee should adhere to the original agreement [which is not stated in this <pb facs="5418478_5_0291.jpg" n="3"/>article], and that the matter should be postponed until a final decision on the amount of the contribution could be reached. The Cemetery committee declared, however, that it intends to grant the highest amount possible.</p>
   <p>Routine business was then disposed of.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Smejkal pointed out that the operating costs of the crematory are high, and that the plant is not being used as frequently as it was at first expected. The reason for this appears to be, he said, that the public is not sufficiently informed nor acquainted with the building. The latter contains one large hall, which may be rented to visitors for as little an amount as $5, while another, a smaller one, is placed at the disposal of mourning guests free of charge. Proper advertising and agitation among our people will induce them to make better use of the Cemetery's facilities.....</p>

   <p>The treasury report of the Cemetery [period not stated] was: income, $11,865.85; loss from last account, $151.03; expenses, $6,899.61; and, the balance in the treasury, $4,815.21. This report was also acknowledged.</p>
