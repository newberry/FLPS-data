   <p>The Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Czech-American Hospital) trustees held their annual meeting yesterday evening at the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association); there was a large attendance. Mr. Jan A. Cervenka presided.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Then letters were read, the first of which was from Mr. Linke, the bookbinder, who referred to the sale of directories. Mr. Linke is sending a check for the number of directories sold; according to the contents of the letter, Mr. Linke considers his account closed with the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice.Because there was more important business to be transacted, this letter was turned over to the directory committee.</p>
   <p>The next letter was from the Pilsen Brewing Company which is sending a contribution of $50. The Spolek Ceskych Lekarek (Society of Czech Women <pb facs="5418478_5_0658.jpg" n="2"/>Physicians) is sending one dollar for one admission to a ball held long ago. It was ordered that this one dollar be turned over to the treasurer.</p>
   <p>Velkorad Cesko-Americke Jednoty (The Grand Lodge of the Czech-American Association) is announcing the temporary recall of its representative, Mr. Josef F. Bolek, from the board of directors, but he will resume his duties as soon as conditions permit.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hajicek, the treasurer, was requested by the chairman to present his annual report. This report shows cash on hand of $914.28. The net profit from the sale of directories is $3,649.19; thus after making the last payment on the hospital property, the cashier has on hand $1,563.47. Of the accounts collectible there is one of $233 for advertisements in the directory; Mr. Cervenka expects to collect a large part of this account.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loula and Mr. Cervenka submitted a report referring to the renting of the building and the submitting of the contract, and announcing the <pb facs="5418478_5_0659.jpg" n="3"/>expenditure of over $500 for needed repairs on the building.</p>
   <p>The building was rented to a club whose members agreed to keep the building in repair, with an option to buy. Election of officers then followed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cervenka was re-elected chairman by unanimous vote. Dr. Pecival was named vice-chairman; Dr. Neumann secretary, and Mr. Frantisek G. Hajicek treasurer.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. F. Bolek was chosen to fill one of the two vacancies on the board of directors. The other vacancy will be filled at the next regular meeting.</p>
   <p>According to a motion made and passed at this meeting, the board of directors will keep on meeting in the rooms of the Lawndale National Bank, on 26th Street.</p>
   <p>A motion was made and passed to arrange for a ball to be held for the benefit of the hospital, under the auspices of the societies of Czech physicians and <pb facs="5418478_5_0660.jpg" n="4"/>Czech women doctors.</p>
   <p>There were many discussions concerning the arrangements for this ball. The following doctors took part in the discussions: Dr. Ring, Dr. Zelezny, Dr. Chvatal, and Dr. Patera. It was agreed that a committee be named comprising nine members--three laymen, three male physicians, and three women physicans.</p>
   <p>The physicians will be named later, but the laymen were selected at this meeting by Mr. Cervenka, who named Mr. Loula, Mr. Kvidera, and himself. The chairman then ordered the meeting adjourned.</p>
