   <p>The Lipany Lodge No. 169 of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies of America celebrated its thirtieth anniversary on January 15. The celebration was held at the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' hall. The program of the celebration was opened by an orchestra, under the direction of Brother Simandl, which played selections from the opera, "The Bartered Bride". The president of the Lodge, Brother F. Had, then welcomed the audience. Brother Horlivy, a member of the Frantisek Ludvik Dramatic Association, recited the poem, "Zde Domov Muj" (Here Is My Home). Brother Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, the principal speaker was then introduced. The audience rewarded the speaker with applause for his beautiful and interesting speech. The next speaker was Brother O. Pergler, president of the Illinois grand lodge, who deserves thanks and recognition for his speeches delivered in the English and Bohemian languages. The financial secretary, Brother J. Zeman, then presented a brief report on activities of the Lodge during the past thirty years, whereupon fifteen charter members were called upon the stage. They were introduced to <pb facs="5418478_5_0083.jpg" n="2"/>the audience, and Brother F. Suchy, chairman of the arrangements committee, gave each of them a little souvenir gift.</p>
   <p>Members and their wives who attended this celebration did not regret it because it was really a beautiful, fraternal entertainment. In the course of the celebration, Brother F. Suchy undertook a collection for the benefit of the Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage, and obtained the sum of twenty dollars.</p>
