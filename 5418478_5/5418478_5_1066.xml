   <p>A regular meeting of the board of representatives of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was held--the streetcar strike being ended--in the usual place.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Velisek of the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society) visited the meeting in order to present a report concerning the outcome of the concert in which the Oratorio "John Huss" was presented by his Spolecnost. His report was most gratifying as the concert brought to the Utulna a Sirotcinec the amount of $340.30. The report shows that Orchestra Hall, in which the concert took place, has 2,334 seats, that passes worth $44 were issued, that tickets worth $648.75 remained unsold, that the sale of tickets brought $1,641.25, the sale of programs, $331.60, so that the total income amounted to <pb facs="5418478_5_1067.jpg" n="2"/>$1,972.85. The expenses were $1,292.26. The net proceeds, $680.59, was divided into two equal parts, and $340.29 was kept by the Spolecnost and $340.30 presented to the Utulna a Sirotcinec. The report was received with a great deal of satisfaction. The presiding officer expressed to Mr. Velisek the thanks of the board and, upon motion offered by the secretary and adopted by the meeting, the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana was elected a founder member of the Utulna a Sirotcinec. The Spolecnost will be issued a diploma and will be requested to delegate a representative to the board of the Utulna a Sirotcinec.....</p>
