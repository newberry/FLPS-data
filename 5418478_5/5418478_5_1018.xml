   <p>The regular meeting of the board of delegates to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec was held yesterday evening in the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' hall, 18th and May Streets. The meeting was well attended. Mr. Vojtech Suchy, chairman, called the meeting to order at 8 P. M. sharp, and Mrs. Bozena Krabec, secretary, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved as read. Then followed the reading of communications received from various societies which reported their annual contributions. Worthy of mention is the communication from the Illinois grand lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky v Americe (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies of America), in which the grand lodge is informing the institution that they appropriated the sum of four hundred dollars for the benefit of the Sirotcinec. This sum will be used to purchase equipment for one room of the Sirotcinec.....</p>
