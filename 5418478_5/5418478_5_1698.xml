   <p>At the past meeting of the Klub Letem-Svetem (By Wings--Through The World Club), our honorable chairman took the floor and said: "I have always heard that the people in our Czechoslovak Republic are not willing to work, but that is not so. During my brief stay in Prague, Czechoslovakia, I was invited to visit an institution where I saw about three hundred invalids working. Some were minus a leg, others an arm, and in many cases parts of their ribs. Even the foreman was armless. All these men, with the aid of artificial limbs, manufactured artificial limbs for their crippled comrades."</p>
   <p>Because we have plenty of World War legionnaires in our ranks, a motion was made to remember these crippled, unfortunate men with a Christmas present; and immediately the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars was appropriated for this purpose. Other clubs and societies should follow this example.....</p>
