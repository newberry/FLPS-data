   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost of the city of Chicago is meeting today, in its twelfth annual meeting, for the purpose of reporting on its past year's activity. Since its founding in February, 1910, it has paid out a total of $64,429.19. The cash remaining in the treasury of the association at the end of 1921 was $7,059.82. It has, therefore, collected $71,489.01 during the twelve years of its existence. During the annual meeting held on February 23, 1921, a board of directors, consisting of twenty-four members, was organized as follows:</p>
   <p>Directors whose turn of office will end in 1924: Reverend Vaclav Vanek, Karel Janovsky, Anton Beranek, Jan Krupka, John A. Sokol, Anton Zeman, Dr. F. L. Fortelka, Anton V. Stepanek.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Directors whose term of office will terminate in 1923: Frank G. Hajicek, Frank J. Petru, Roman Sedlacek, Anton Laadt, J. F. Bolek, Stanislav Loula, Anton J. Cermak, Josef Malecek.</p>
   <p>Directors whose term will end in 1922: Otto Kerner, John A. Cervenka, Edward Kvidera, V. Cihak, Louis Solar, Dr. F. E. Dostal, Charles J. Novak, William K. Pflaum.</p>
   <p>For the ladies' auxiliary, the following members were elected to the board of directors: Mrs. Antonie Kybic, Mrs. Sophie Kreml, Mrs. Marie Sokol. The representative of the newspaper Svornost is Miss Adela Fiala; for the Denni Hlasatel, Mr. Albert Havranek; for the Narod, Mr. Tomas Kraus.</p>
   <p>During the annual meeting, a propaganda committee, consisting of twelve members, was also appointed. [There follows a list of committee members.] Their duties will be to secure new members for the association.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1417.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At the meeting of the board of directors on the first Friday of the month in March, 1921, there was an election of new officers, with the following results: Stanislav J. Loula, president; John A. Sokol, vice-president for the Bohemian "California" district; Karel J. Novak, vice-president for the Pilsen district; Mrs. Josef Beranek vice-president for the Tabor district; Karel V. Janorsky, for the Town of Lake district; Jan Krupka, vice-president for the out-of-town districts; Reverend Vaclav Vanek, secretary; Josef Malecek, financial secretary; Louis Solar, treasurer; Miss Marie J. Huttner, office manager; Mrs. Antonie Kybic, special investigator.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the meeting of the board of directors, there was a meeting of the propaganda committee. Mr. Vladimir Spatny was elected president; Mrs. Frantiska Stejskal received the secretaryship; and Mrs. Tomas Kallal became the treasurer.</p>
   <p>Other committees appointed by the president were: [There follows a long list of committees and their members.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1418.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The meetings of the board of directors took place twice every month, except during the summer months of July and August. The members of the board participated actively in these meetings.</p>
   <p>The membership drive, under the leadership of Vladimir Spatny, was launched on March 21, 1921, and lasted six weeks. It brought $1,750 in membership dues. When one considers that the total proceeds from membership dues for the year 1921 was $2,048, it becomes evident that the committee appointed for the drive did a fine piece of work. Mr. Tomas Kallal was treasurer, Mrs. Frantiska Stejskal was secretary, and the propaganda work through the medium of the press was headed by the secretary of the Spolecnost, Reverend Vaclav Vanek.</p>
   <p>The tag day was held on Decoration Day, that is, on May 30, 1921. The City Council of Chicago gave a special permit to the Spolecnost to tag on that day, thanks to the work of Alderman Anton J. Cermak. Sixty-five ladies took part in it, and the proceeds from this source were $1,202.16. The entire <pb facs="5418478_5_1419.jpg" n="5"/>undertaking was directed by the chairman of the committee, Mr. Charles J. Novak, and by the secretary, Mrs. Marie J. Huetter.</p>
   <p>On Thanksgiving Day, the Harrison High School, through our intervention, donated twenty-three baskets to families recommended by us.</p>
   <p>The annual ball was given on November 16 in the pavilion of Pilsen Park. It was fashioned after entertainments given in our old homeland. [In other words] Czechoslovak national costumes were worn. The group dances were performed by the Slovacky Vzdelavaci Klub (Slovak Educational Club); the originality of the decorations in the ballroom surprised everybody. The musical program, under the direction of the band leader, Mr. Rudolf Rubringer, satisfied both the older and the younger generations.</p>
   <p>A tasty evening meal was served in a true, festive manner by the self-sacrificing members of the ladies' auxiliary. Contributions to the evening meal were made by the following: Hruska and Company donated one crate of cranberries; <pb facs="5418478_5_1420.jpg" n="6"/>Mr. Komarek gave a sack of potatoes; Mr. Vizensky, six dozen eggs; the J. J. Dusek Company, ten pounds of butter; Mr. A. W. Stepanek, 75 pounds of flour; Mr. Mikulas, five quarts of cream; Mr. Emil Petru, twenty-five pounds of coffee; Novak Company, ten pounds of coffee; the firm of Bieler Brothers donated sauerkraut. The attendance at this ball was tremendous, and the net proceeds amounted to $2,304.13. Five prizes for the ladies and five for the gentlemen were given to those countrymen who were attired in the most beautiful national costumes. The first prize for the ladies was a diamond ring valued at $100 and donated by the firm of goldsmiths, F. Kohout; it was given to Miss Berta Stupka. The second prize was a bridge lamp valued at $40, donated by the Tabor Supply Company; this prize went to Miss Slavka Kosner; the third prize, a rocking chair valued at $37 and donated by the Sekera Company, was won by Miss Terezie Sokol; the fourth prize, a woman's dress valued at $35 and donated by the Central Clothing Company, was awarded to Miss S.

   <pb facs="5418478_5_1421.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The first prize for the gentlemen was a suit of clothes valued at $75, donatad by the firm of Jedlicka Brothers. This prize went to Frank Konecny. The second prize, a winter overcoat valued at $50 and donated by the firm of Masek Brothers, went to Karel Jes; the third prize, a winter overcoat, also valued at $50 and donated by the Trembacz Company, was given to Eduard Fladr; the fourth prize, a box of cigars valued at $10 and donated by Tomas Chvala, went to Mr. Cernocky; the fifth prize, a bedspread valued at $10, donated by T. Kallal, went to Mr. Lukas.</p>
   <p>The officials of the charity ball were: L. Solar, chairman; Charles J. Novak, secretary; Dr. F. L. Fortelka, treasurer. The gingerbread cottage, which brought in $30.50, was donated by Miss Kamila Nepil.</p>
   <p>The Christmas gift party was given on December 24, 1921, in the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, and was reported by the Denni Hlasatel one day later as follows: "Yesterday, on Christmas Eve, a Christmas gift party was given at ten o'clock in the morning by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The <pb facs="5418478_5_1422.jpg" n="8"/>party was arranged for the benefit of those poor families of Bohemians who are supported by that society and who applied for Christmas aid. Each case was conscientiously investigated by a special committee, and there were enough gifts to go around, so that everybody was satisfied. Those who do not believe in charity should have visited the party to witness the shining faces of both the old and the young; to see the poor mothers, laden with gifts, who went away filled with gratitude. They carried great baskets of food, poultry, and other edibles worth ten dollars a basket, gifts of happiness which would be indispensable on Christmas. Were it not for these gifts, the holidays would be a hollow mockery of tears and sighs. In its Friday meeting, the committee also sanctioned gifts of ready cash totaling $1,000, which were included in the Christmas baskets for those people who suffered most and who were the poorest, so that they could purchase coal or buy some underwear, shoes, and clothing for the children.</p>
   <p>Our deep gratitude is extended to the three hundred benefactors and philanthropists who responded to the touching proclamation of the Christmas gift <pb facs="5418478_5_1423.jpg" n="9"/>committee.</p>
   <p>Besides such monetary contributions, which are fully reported in another part of this annual report, the following gifts were received [by the Christmas gift committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost]: [There follows a list of contributors and their gifts.]</p>
   <p>A concise report of activities in our offices as given by the office manager is as follows: [There follows a list of the number of telephone calls made, the amount of mail sent out, etc.]</p>
   <p>The following physicians furnished free medical services, and in some cases performed surgical operations without charge: Dr. C. S. Pavlik at the Wesley Hospital and in cases sent to him by us, Dr. F. E. Dostal, Dr. F. L. Fortelka, Dr. Frank J. Jirka, Dr. Leopold Wedeles, Dr. Antonin Mueller, Dr. Allan Hruby, Dr. F. Franke, Dr. Funkhauser, Dr. G. Dvorak-Theobald. Medicines were furnished gratis to poor patients by the following pharmacists: James Honzik, Otto J. Pelikan, Louis Karel, E. Koller, and Mr. Liska of Racine Avenue. Dr. I. J. Jirka, <pb facs="5418478_5_1424.jpg" n="10"/>a dentist, gave his services freely in several cases.</p>
   <p>Legal aid was furnished free of charge to poor people by the following Bohemian attorneys: Otto Kerner, Anton Pecival, J. A. Pisa, and Anton Zeman.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost paid for the living expenses of two girls whose mother was confined to the hospital for a period of five months. It also furnished clothing and shoes to a great number of children. In one case, it furnished clothing to three children in order to make it possible for them to attend the funeral of their mother. [There follows a long list of the various kinds of aid extended to indigent families.]</p>

The husband died on Christmas Eve.

   <pb facs="5418478_5_1426.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>Our associations is in contact with all the charitable institutions and associations in the City of Chicago through the medium of the registration bureau of the United Charities. It is endorsed by the Chicago Association of Commerce and recommended by this association. It is a Bohemian institution which serves the poorest and the most indigent people of our nationality, and as such, it has the right to expect help from our well-to-do and more fortunate countrymen.</p>
   <p>Anyone who pays an annual fee of $5 or more may become a member of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. There are no limits to charity. Twelve thousand dollars a year is necessary for the upkeep of the philanthropic activities of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, and to secure such an amount ought to be the pleasurable duty of the Bohemians of Chicago.</p>
