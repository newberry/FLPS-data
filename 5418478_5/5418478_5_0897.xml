   <p>p. 1, col. 3.. A committee representing this institution, and also several prominent Bohemian personages interested in it, made a tour of the newly constructed building which this institution will occupy. This group was to act as an inspection committee and to report anything which they thought should be changed or added so as to make the building more suitable for its purpose. The contractor was present so that he could explain anything which might be questioned by the committee.</p>
   <p>First they inspected the fine building which they found very modern and practical, except that it seemed to be small, so they immediately planned how it could be enlarged in the future should it be necessary. The main floor of the building is to accommodate the office of the building and rooms for daily use by the inmates. Most of the second floor is to serve as the sleeping quarters, separated for male and for the female inmates. It will also comprise the kitchen and the dining rooms. If an addition (annex) should be built in the future it will accommodate the old people and serve as their separate quarters.</p>

   <p>The committee also inspected the grounds of the institution and made several suggestions which would improve the appearance. All findings or suggestions of this committee will be discussed at the next regular meeting.</p>
   <p>After overcoming various obstacles the Bohemian people of Chicago can proudly say that they now have their own institution for old people and orphans. This has been made possible by the untiring effort and the determination of our people. The financial support and cooperation was also remarkable.</p>
