   <p>The gardener, Vilem Koukola, whose business was totally ruined when the heating plant in his hothouse exploded during a very cold night two weeks ago, thus causing the delicate rosebushes nursed in the hothouse to freeze, will now have an opportunity to thank the noble and generous people who sent him their help so that he could start out anew. They did so chiefly to prevent him from becoming despondent. There were compassionate people in all parts of our city and country who remembered him, and every contribution was given willingly and gladly. This attitude was manifested in the many letters we received.....and the knowledge of this fact surely must gladden Koukola's heart. He need not mind the few drops of bitterness which some people mixed into his otherwise unalloyed happiness. This will bring him more courage to work and to live. It must be remembered that he did not ask aid for himself, but for those who are dear to him--his family.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was particularly fruitful in the way of contributions received.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1464.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>[There follows a long list of names of contributors and the amounts contributed.] The total amount of contributions received on the fifth day was $187.30, which we shall forward to Koukola today. Yesterday we mailed him a check for $129.75.</p>
