   <p>A magnificent pavillion for our Old People's Home, in the beautiful neighborhood of the National Cemetery, a favorite place visited mostly by Bohemians, and therefore the most suitable, is already assured. The National Cemetery Association, in Wednesday's meeting, took such action as was expected by all reasonable countrymen. It resolved, by an overwhelming majority, to loan to the Home the necessary sum, to enable it to pay Mr. Pregler the purchase price of his property. In this manner relieving the Home of the necessity of seeking a loan from a bank or other financial institution, spending money while doing so and paying high interest rates. The National Cemetery will lose nothing by this, but will gain, because the increased favor of the public will be significant compensation for the slight difference in interest rates.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1158.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The money, which will be loaned, will be secured in safety by the property of the Home. The property of Mr. Pregler, which the Home will acquire, has a value of at least $60,000, and the National Cemetery Association will receive a first mortgage on this valuable property, for making the loan. It now remains for our public to earnestly endeavor to reduce the indebtedness of the Home, in order that our old people may in a few years be accommodated in a refuge, satisfying all human needs, in the healthful, cheerful and beautiful neighborhood, surrounding the National Cemetery. They should work toward this end as societies and as individuals. Every society among us ought to send a representative to the Home Board, it should be remembered to take up collections for the benefit of the Home, at all entertainments and picnics, the clear receipts of all entertainments should be donated in whole or in part to the treasury of the Home. In this manner we will <pb facs="5418478_5_1159.jpg" n="3"/>benefit not only our aged and worn countrymen, but the entire nationality. We will have the respect of all reasoning people, when we shall have proven that we care for our aged people, and that we practice a true interest in, and a love for our fellowman.</p>
   <p>Whoever honors himself, receives honor from others. This applies to individuals as well as nationalities.</p>
