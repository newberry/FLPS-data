   <p>The Brotherhood of Czech Foresters was founded seventeen years ago as a body independent of the main organization, to which it had belonged as a branch of the foreign section. At first its members were separated into a male and a female division, but they soon joined into a single organization.....</p>
   <p>One of the first measures taken was to promise to pay the full death benefit to surviving members of families; the separation from the main body of the Order of Foresters had deprived them of compensation from the funds of the mother organization. The newly founded order was able, after a few years, to point to all their obligations as having been properly met.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0325.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The anniversary of the creation of the independent brotherhood will be celebrated today. The order is one of the strongest and soundest Czech-American organizations. It has set a goal for itself with a twofold purpose: Charity and national activities.....</p>
   <p>The Pilsen Brewery Park, on 26th Street and Albany Avenue, will be the scene of festive activities tonight.....</p>
