   <p>Christmas donations of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) were given away Friday, December 24, from 10 A. M. until 3 P. M. A letter was sent to each family recommended for relief to call in person and get these donations at the specified time. They all received generous gifts according to the size and financial conditions of this or that family. Each family received a large Christmas basket and a monetary gift ranging from five to twenty-five dollars, according to the number of children in the family. The orphans, in particular, were not forgotten.</p>
   <p>The Christmas baskets were provided through the efforts of Alderman Anton J. Cermak. Two hundred and twenty-five of them were donated by the Chicago Herald Examiner. These were baskets of smaller size, and from them one hundred and twelve large baskets were made. The Elks' Chicago Lodge No. 4 <pb facs="5418478_5_1654.jpg" n="2"/>sent us twenty-one large baskets, worth about ten dollars apiece, which were given to the largest families. The Chicago Herald Examiner, besides the above-mentioned baskets, also sent seven barrels of dressed chickens--altogether three hundred and eighty-five chickens--and four hundred and fifty cakes, which were also distributed among the most needy families. Some of the largest families received as many as four chickens in order that a good Christmas dinner might be provided for them and in order that they might have enough left over for supper.</p>
   <p>Dr. F. L. Fortelka and Dr. C. J. Fortelka informed us that a club, consisting of ten gentlemen, offered to take care of ten families recommended by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The club has appropriated the sum of one hundred dollars for this purpose. The members themselves investigated the recommended families and furnished Christmas baskets for them......</p>
   <p>In conclusion we report the names of philanthropists who during the last three days, have contributed toward the Christmas fund: Mr. Eddie Tancl, $100; <pb facs="5418478_5_1655.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. W. A. Wiebold, $50; The National Printing and Publishing Company, $50. [There follow the names of contributors of smaller amounts.] Total of the last three days, $318; previously collected, $1,210; total amount collected for the Christmas donations, $1,528.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost donated two barrels of poultry to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage in order that a good Christmas dinner might be provided for the inmates.</p>
