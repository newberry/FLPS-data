<title level="a">MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN HOSPITAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Sbor Duverniku Cesko-Americke Nemocnice (Board of Trustees of the Bohemian-American Hospital) which was held yesterday evening in the offices of the Bohemian Charitable Association, was fairly well attended, and some of the more important business was transacted.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting, the correspondence from societies which have sent their dues and from others explaining why they have not, was examined. The next business on the agenda was the presentation of committee reports.</p>
   <p>Dr. Neuman, representing the committee that has charge of the printing of the [Bohemian] directory, stated that they are making arrangements to accept bids for printing in the near future. Not including the solicitors' percentages, $2,656 is the total amount which has been collected for the insertion of small advertisements, names, and addresses; and more than a <pb facs="5418478_5_0694.jpg" n="2"/>thousand dollars has been pledged for the larger advertisements. The work of the committee is so directed that it is expected that the directory will be ready for the printer this month.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, announced that about the first of May he will leave for Europe, and he asked that a temporary financial secretary be named or a permanent one be appointed. Mr. Stanislaus Loula moved that this business be deferred until the next meeting, and that the next one be announced as very important.</p>
   <p>The next discussion was about the collection of subscribed amounts which up-to-date are still outstanding. Certain members of this committee who had taken up this work at the last meeting presented their reports, which were not very encouraging. It is imperative that these amounts be collected and turned in to the financial secretary as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Sbor Duverniku is anxious to arrange the purchase of the property for the hospital and to pay the amount which is still due. Up to the present <pb facs="5418478_5_0695.jpg" n="3"/>time, $18,000 has been paid to Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, but a balance of $5,000 is still due. This is equal to the amount subscribed.</p>
   <p>The sooner this sum is turned over to the Sbor Duverniku, the sooner the hospital will be ready for occupancy. It is evident that the subscribers are indifferent to the urgent calls for money; they do not seem to care whether the money is paid now or later.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. John A. Cervenka, expressed the opinion that it would be possible to collect the money needed before the opening of the hospital. It was finally agreed that every individual member of the Sbor Duverniku perform the work assigned to him, and at the next meeting some action will be taken to determine how to proceed in the future. The meeting was adjourned after the financial secretary announced the total receipts, thirty-four dollars.</p>
