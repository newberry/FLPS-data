   <p>The Cesko-Slovenska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Society) during the period of its existence has accomplished much good and, therefore, it is no wonder that our people manifest their recognition of that fact whenever the opportunity presents itself. The celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its existence by one of the most active lodges of the Cesko-Slovenska Jednota, Lodge Cech 25, offered our people a really suitable opportunity for such a manifestation.</p>
   <p>This significant jubilee celebration was divided into two parts, of which the first was a really fine musical and literary entertainment which took place in the afternoon; in the evening a dance was held and a supper was served during the intermission. Both parts of the celebration were held in the large hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street.</p>
   <p>The afternoon entertainment began at three o'clock with a fair attendance.</p>

   <p>However, the number of people participating would have been much larger had it not been for the excessively warm weather. In addition to an instrumental and vocal musical program there were recitations and humorous numbers, all of which were received with thunderous applause; some of the performers were forced to render encores. The gathering was welcomed by the lodge president, Mr. Matej Hanus, every word of whose speech came from the heart. Another speaker was the president of the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovenska Jednota, Mr. E. Frydl, who called attention to the good and meritorious work of the Society. In the name of the Grand Lodge he expressed sincerest good wishes. This was heard with interest by all who were present, and was greeted with a storm of lasting applause. The last speaker on the program was Dr. Joseph P. Pecival, who addressed the gathering with a few sincerely meant words which concerned our social life. He called attention not only to the good but to the dark side of our social life; especially to the fact that we like very much to squander large sums of money on funerals but that we do little or nothing for people while they live. At the same time he pointed out ways and means on the basis <pb facs="5418478_5_0422.jpg" n="3"/>of which, in his opinion, some sort of improvement could be made in that direction. In addition he laid no little emphasis on the fact that it is really necessary for us to preserve for our further social life a certain amount of national self-consciousness, and in that way to work for the continued expansion of our Bohemian societies and organizations. Our people belong among our people, and we as Bohemians should always and everywhere join only Bohemian societies and organizations, especially when we are offered as advantageous an opportunity as anyone will find when we apply for membership in a society as tried as the Cesko-Slovenska Jednota. His speech was excellent and was rewarded according to its merits by applause.</p>
   <p>The orchestra under the direction of Frank Kaspar rendered several very successful selections whereby it ingratiated itself with the entire gathering. Others who took part in the program were: Mrs. Cervenka, Miss Kasalicky, Mr. and Mrs. Suva, Mr. and Mrs. Solar, Jr. They were all rewarded with praise for their efforts.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0423.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Of the twenty-five charter members, all but about four were present and they received souvenirs of the occasion.</p>
   <p>In the evening there was a grand ball and supper. The entertainment was really friendly and animated, the participants carrying on until past midnight. It is fitting to add that Lodge Cech at present has 130 members and its present officers are: Matej Hanus, president; Albert Hora, vice-president; Joseph Pichacka, treasurer; Joseph Perina, financial secretary; and, Anna Prchova, secretary.</p>
