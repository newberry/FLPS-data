   <p>Leaving out such items as are read in the regular meetings of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and therefore known to our readers, we report only such items as may be found interesting....</p>
   <p>The balance from the preceeding half year, was $1,025.23; income during the present half year, $26,891.40; total, $27,916.63; disbursements during the present half year, $13,266.50....</p>
   <p>The assets are as follows: buildings, grounds, and equipment, $153,608.55; musical instruments, $201.37 various bonds, $3,346.79; money receivable from various debtors, $2,109.43; loan to building and loan association, $8,000; balance in treasury, $14,650.13; total assets, $181,916.27.</p>

   <p>At the present time there are ninety-one inmates in the Orphanage and thirty-five in the Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>To the financial [and other] report we add the following:The aims of every working member of the Utulna are beautiful and exalted. To lose one's home and parents, to become an orphan is a painful experience which could be recited by many a child who found shelter in our institution....Had they not found such shelter here, the chances are that these children would be buffetted by fate in the cold outside world, suffering and bewailing their sad state. Not so in our Sirotcinec; here all these children are treated alike, each has his allotted place, and all of them live in love and harmony. The youngsters attend an American public school, and on Saturdays and Sundays they attend the Ceska <pb facs="5418478_5_0788.jpg" n="3"/>Svobodomyslna Skola F. B. Zdrubek (Bohemian Free Thought School, F. B. Zdrubek) in which, under the guidance of Mrs. Raeck, they learn Bohemian and study the history of Bohemia, thus having implanted in their hearts a love for their mother tongue. In addition, the girls who live in our institution devote some definite portion of their....time to home industries such as embroidering and all kinds of handiwork. A music school was organized for them in which they are able to devote some of their time to the study of music....</p>
