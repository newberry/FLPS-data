   <p>In spite of the rain, which last night so copiously drenched the thirsting earth, the meeting of the joint-committee of the home and orphanage was attended by almost all of the members. The meeting was called to order by the chairman Mr. Ant. Charvat,and Mr. Jan Viska was elected secretary. A letter was read from Mr. Frant Haut, who resigned from membership on the committee. In his place Mr. Jaromir Psenka, editor of Svornost was elected, so that all three daily papers would have their own representatives on the committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Vopicka sent a letter to Wednesday's meeting of the Home Association, which was also read at the meeting of the committee. Mr. Vopicka is for the effort to provide an old people's home minus an orphanage for the present. He points out that this could be accomplished on the present premises. He also suggested the arrangement of some kind of lottery for the benefit of the undertaking. If there were 30,000 chances at one dollar each, there would be gathered a sum with which something could be accomplished. The communication was accepted and will be made use of by the committee in further activity. Financial and publicity committees were chosen.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1153.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Psenka turned in a check for fifty dollars, Which was sent by our celebrated singer, Mr. Boza Umirov, and which was accepted with pleasure. The same reception was accorded to Judge Sabath when he turned in a check for seventy-five dollars to complete payment of a pledge of one hundred dollars, and at the same time announcing that he would place a lot valued at from three hundred to four hundred dollars on raffle, the proceeds of which are to go to the home.</p>
