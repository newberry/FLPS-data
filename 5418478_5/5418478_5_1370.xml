   <p>Next Monday will be the annual tag day for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association). All the charitable associations of Chicago are united into one organization and our Bohemian charity is represented in that body which, together with the City Council, also gives permission to our charitable institutions to organize tag days. Our general Czechoslovak public will, therefore, have an opportunity on Monday to show its sympathies to our most important institutions. The Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) is likewise represented in these charities. It is the only day in the year which affords an opportunity for these charitable bodies to appear before the general public asking for aid to which they are undoubtedly fully entitled, and which should be given to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1371.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To make this tag day a success it is necessary for a large number of ladies to volunteer as tag day workers. Their work will be hard but deserving of merit, and they should endeavor to secure as large contributions as possible. It is for this reason that the board of directors of the Utulna asks that ladies who have not yet volunteered come to the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) on Saturday morning, and receive full instructions as to their duties and the locality to which each will be assigned.</p>
   <p>The Spolecnost made a similar appeal to our self-sacrificing women and girls who are to get in touch either with the chairwoman of the tag day committee, Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, by calling Lawndale 4501, or directly with the office of the Spolecnost whose telephone is Rockwell 1787. Next Saturday there will be a meeting of all the volunteer workers who will likewise receive their instructions. It is desirable in the interest of this good cause that there be as many applicants as possible.</p>
