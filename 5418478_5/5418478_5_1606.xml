   <p>Many times in our appeals published in this newspaper have we emphasized the fact that Mr. Herbert Hoover's relief campaign is rapidly nearing its conclusion. Before we know it, the day will arrive when it will be decided to which of the many foreign language groups shall go the palm of humanity. The Poles are silent, but they do work. As we have learned, the Poles are working hard to realize their boast, expressed publicly sometime ago, that they will take first place, and that they will prove to Mr. Herbert Hoover that they were and still are the most generous group among the foreign language groups in Chicago. And they intend to take first place not only in Chicago, but in the whole State of Illinois. Our information is correct. We can truthfully say that the Poles, especially during the last couple of days, have set forth their best efforts and have been working feverishly not only in their great organizations, but also among individuals in order to make their own collection, undertaken in behalf of Mr. Hoover's relief fund for the benefit of suffering <pb facs="5418478_5_1607.jpg" n="2"/>children in Central and Eastern Europe, the largest among the foreign language groups in America.</p>
   <p>In regard to this fact, it will be of interest to notice what the Czechoslovaks of Chicago have done and what they are still doing in behalf of Mr. Hoover's relief work. Do you wish to know how far the collections by Chicago Czechoslovaks have progressed? We must tell you that we are ashamed of the results so far achieved, in spite of the fact that a few individuals and several of our corporations have proved their great generosity. The proceeds of the collections undertaken by them have not yet reached the height of a single gift contributed by one Slovak of Scranton, Pennsylvania. And we do not exaggerate, nor do we try to scare you a bit. But we can say that it would be humiliating for the Bohemians of Chicago if they permit an individual to defeat a settlement which is the largest in America and which, on various occasions, likes to boast that it is the most enlightened and the most active settlement in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1608.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But where is the large group of our really wealthy people? Where is the large group of our corporations and businessmen who quite often boast about their wealth? Where is their share in this great human action, the slogan of which should be "Everything for the child"?</p>
   <p>It is really a shame to look over the list of contributions which have already been deposited. What does the collection list reveal? Only the names of people who represent the poor and working classes. Our wealthy countrymen, with very few exceptions, remain deaf to our appeals, which are primarily addressed to them. Their pockets remain closed when it comes to humanitarian work, and they act as if they were not concerned.</p>
   <p>These people are mistaken. They are hostile to themselves. People, or at least the great mass of the people, are not stupid. They can see very well, and they do notice everything. They will point the finger of scorn at these wealthy people at the earliest opportunity when these people try to force themselves upon others as prominent Czechoslovaks and unselfish and generous <pb facs="5418478_5_1609.jpg" n="4"/>patriots. The people will then tell these hypocrites that we do not care for leaders who only wish to appear and shine before the public, but who never do anything for the benefit of public or national causes in order to prove that they are also people with generous hearts.</p>
   <p>These rich people would do well if they meditated upon the possibility of their own children's finding themselves in circumstances similar to those of hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovakian children in the old homeland. Nobody should think of his property and his wealth too highly. Something may happen and the wealth, no matter how great, may be wiped out in one day. It is a satisfaction for a man to know that he has never missed an opportunity to do his duties, whether they be national or purely human.</p>
   <p>Our wealthy Czechoslovak countrymen! You are facing the danger of being condemned by hundreds of thousands of children who are suffering in Czechoslovakia. Remember, therefore, while there is still time, the future of the Czechoslovak <pb facs="5418478_5_1610.jpg" n="5"/>Republic; remember the Bohemian and Slovak children, afflicted with white plague and hunger. Do your duty toward these children so that they may bless their friends overseas.</p>
