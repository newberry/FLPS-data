   <p>The Liga Ceskych Vypomocnych Spolku (League of Bohemian Benevolent Associations) held one of its special meetings in the Pilsen Auditorium yesterday afternoon. The meeting, which was well attended, was presided over by Mr. J. Novak who welcomed the delegates and explained the reasons that prompted the officers of the Liga to call this meeting. The principal reason was to discuss the problem of publicizing our benevolent associations so that our Bohemian countrymen may become more fully aware of the fact that it is only by joining one or more of our benevolent associations are our countrymen able to buy and own homes, and to continue to better their economic positions.</p>
   <p>Another reason for calling the meeting was to elect delegates to the convention of the National League of Benevolent Associations, which will be held this summer in San Francisco during the World's Fair. It did not take those present very long to elect President Novak as delegate, and as alternate, Mr. Voborsky, secretary of the Liga.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0395.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So far as publicizing Liga is concerned, many opinions were offered. All of them centered on the necessity of informing the Bohemian public of the advantages to be derived from the benevolent associations, and of the need of joining them instead of putting their money in banks.</p>
   <p>This matter was brought before the Liga because the National League had invited the Liga Ceskych Vypomocnych Spolku to co-operate in the publication of a periodical; some of the officers felt that such co-operation would be of practically no benefit to the Bohemian associations. All the proposals offered by the representatives advocated some sort of advertising, but only in the Bohemian language. The consensus of opinion favored advertising in Bohemian newspapers. Finally a committee of four members was appointed and charged with the duty to prepare a definite plan for a publicity campaign, including the cost of advertisements of various sizes, for the use of the Liga, as well as individual benevolent associations. The plan is to be submitted to the next meeting of the Liga, which will be held the first Sunday in May.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0396.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The chairman then recalled that invitations to join the Liga had been sent sometime ago to benevolent associations which are not yet its members, and as a result, three such associations have joined. In speaking of this achievement, the chairman reviewed the fine work of the Liga, which is absolutely unselfish. All the officers of the Liga give their time and efforts without receiving any compensation. Their work is by no means trivial or simple.</p>
   <p>The meeting heard a report on the work done by the Liga in legislative matters. The Liga's officers have presented a proposal to the state legislature in Springfield containing provisions to prevent the organization of many small benevolent associations upon the instigation of just a few individuals. The state secretary [sic] has confirmed the receipt of the proposal and assured the Liga that it will be passed on to the legislative committee for study and recommendations. In his letter, the secretary suggested that Congressman Hruby, who is a member of that committee, be contacted, and that the various provisions of the proposal be discussed with him.</p>
   <p>According to the proposal, no benevolent association could receive a charter <pb facs="5418478_5_0397.jpg" n="4"/>unless it indicated that a specified number of its shares had been subscribed for, the number varying according to the population of the community. Thus, for instance, an association seeking a charter in Chicago would need to have two thousand shares subscribed for. In smaller cities the necessary number would be correspondingly smaller, but the least would be five hundred shares. Mr. Ricker explained that this action is just another effort to induce the legislature to pass a similar proposal which had been submitted two years ago. That proposal, Mr. Ricker said, was not passed because of some personal difficulties [which arose] among the interested parties. Thereafter the meeting adopted Mr. Janovsky's motion that a resolution favoring the adoption of the legislative proposal be prepared by the officers of the Liga, and that a copy of said resolution be sent to all Cook County members of the Springfield legislature.</p>
   <p>After the adoption of the financial report the meeting was adjourned.</p>
