  <body>
   <p>Yesterday's session of the thirteenth annual convention of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporující Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Fraternal Benevolent Society) was opened in the hall of the Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) shortly after nine o'clock in the morning....</p>
   <p>Several important proposals were discussed, among them being the establishment of a central hospitalization fund.....The final vote on this proposal was deferred until the afternoon session, when it was defeated by forty-nine to thirty-two votes.....</p>
   <p>Another important question was suggested by Mr. Vladimir A. Geringer and dealt with the publication of a periodical. It was pointed out that societies with as few as fifteen hundred members have their own periodicals, and that the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporující Jednota, with its four thousand members, <pb facs="5418478_5_0412.jpg" n="2"/>should be able to publish one to great advantage. After a number of reasons against the publication of an organ had been offered, including one to the effect that it would unduly burden the treasury, the proposal was adopted by seventy-three votes against eleven.....</p>
   <p>[The meeting was adjourned at 5 P. M., after a number of other proposals had been discussed without any action having been taken.]</p>
