   <p>A week ago we carried an excerpt of a letter from an officer of a non-Bohemian association in which he complained about a large decrease in membership due to voluntary resignations and losses because of noncompliance with statutory provisions, nonpayment of dues, etc. Such conditions seem to prevail in all non-Bohemian organizations, some of which are losing an abnormally large percentage, which may be explained by their methods in acquiring new members. In many cases membership drives are staged and members are forced into the association almost against their own will. It is only natural that such members soon lose interest in the organization and either resign or stop paying their dues and are expelled. This is not surprising when we consider the kind of high-powered propaganda and pressure by which some associations go after new members.</p>
   <p>Since such methods are never employed by our fraternal organizations, their losses--which are also far above normal--are that much more significant. This question is discussed in the recent issue of the organ of the Zapadni Ceska <pb facs="5418478_5_0460.jpg" n="2"/>Bratrska Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Unity). The article points out that the Zapadni Ceska Bratrska Jednota had an increase of 1,057 new members last year, 121 members died, and 469 resigned or lost their membership for nonpayment of dues. During the last three months, the Jednota took in 159 new members and lost 141, including 30 losses by death. In other Bohemian fraternal organizations, the article says, conditions are very similar. So, during the past year, the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity) had 702 new members, 36 resignations or expulsions, and 66 deaths. In the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), conditions are probably very much the same if we consider that according to their report, 52 members were expelled or resigned and 21 died during the past month, against an increase of 162 new members. The Taborites had 36 new members and lost 25 in a month, and other societies have had similar experiences.</p>
   <p>Of course, this does not say that it is a new phenomenon. We should rather believe that this condition has prevailed for years and by many it is considered something quite normal, something that cannot be changed or avoided.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0461.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In non-Bohemian organizations, these conditions are much worse. Many show losses amounting to more than fifty per cent of gains. The Modern Woodsmen can be used as a fair example. This society lost 246,783 [members] and took in only 33,144 last year. This, of course, was due to severe crises caused by a sharp increase in dues. But even under conditions considered normal, there is a large decrease in the membership of fraternal bodies, and it should be decidedly worth the effort to study and find possible means by which this situation could be remedied.</p>
   <p>One frequently hears that organizers and old members take in or propose anybody, without regard for any expectation as to his or her ability or inclination to keep the membership--just for the sake of bonuses or other advantages. Where this is being done, large losses are natural. But this is not the case in our groups, and the reason for abnormally large losses must be sought elsewhere. Naturally, losses by resignations and expulsion cannot be avoided entirely. But if they could be cut in half, it should be very much worth a serious effort in analyzing the situation and finding means of averting any preventable loss.</p>
