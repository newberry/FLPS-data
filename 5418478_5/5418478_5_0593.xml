  <body>
   <p>We take the privilege of announcing to the honorable public and especially to the familes and members of the "C.S.P.S." (Czechoslovak Benevolent Society) that there is being organized a new club, which will become a part of C.S.P.S. Members are being accepted between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years for a one dollar initiation fee. Sons of members of C.S.P.S. are admitted without initiation fees. Members may insure for either $500.00 or $1000.00.</p>
   <p>The death benefit assessment on $500.00 is four cents, on $1000.00 it is eight cents.</p>
   <p>We recognize the need for the organization of such a youth order for young members do not like to become members among older people, because they feel lost among them.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0594.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>No well behaved youth should miss this opportunity to become a member of such a strong organization as the tried and proven Union of Czechoslovak Benevolent Societies. This Union is the boast of Bohemian-Americans. It is the best and most reasonably managed. It has proven itself for the past forty-eight years to be the most honorable.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope the members of the C.S.P.S. will bring their sons to this club.</p>
   <p>The first club meeting will be held on Jan. 4, 1903, in the Bohemian-English Liberal School, at 400 West 18th. street.</p>
