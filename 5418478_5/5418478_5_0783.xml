  <body>
   <p>Thanks to the well-known Bohemian merchant, Mr. Karel Mrizek, owner of the Atlas Baking Company [a Bohemian business concern], the inmates of the Orphanage of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) now have a most excellent radio....Its reception is such that it may be comfortably heard by two hundred people, which is the capacity of our playroom. By his gift, Mr. Mrizek earned our undying gratitude, and we hope to be able to show that gratitude to him when an opportunity arises....The children, who never heard a radio performance before, stood around open-mouthed, wondering from whence the sounds issued. In spite of my explanation, it was hard for them to understand the principles of [this kind of] device; but they were satisfied with the fact that it "sings and plays nicely"....The larger boys now come to me with their requests to listen to it; they want to know the baseball scores particularly. This very fact is of great value to our little sportsmen. Our Sirotcinec has <pb facs="5418478_5_0784.jpg" n="2"/>its own Sox baseball team in honor of the Chicago White Sox.....</p>
   <p>Another very heartening piece of news is the completion of the children's playground which was well equipped with up-to-date apparatus such as trapeze, climbing pole, circular ring, tennis court, and a space reserved for baseball. There are three swings and a toboggan for the use of our tots. The playground was projected and put into use by our expert countryman, Mr. Miles Havlicek, who is the athletic director of the Hamilton Club and a former instructor at the Carl Schurz High School. The cost of the installation, etc., was borne by the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Sirotcinec. These ladies work tirelessly for the welfare of our inmates. Their activities cannot be disposed of by a few well chosen words, and those who have had a chance to watch their work knows their exemplary self-sacrificing efforts. The inmates will get new clothing on Memorial Day, thanks again to these ladies....</p>

   <p>In the name of our orphans, I thank you, ladies.....</p>
   <p>Bohumil Fiser, business manager of the Utulna a Sirotcinec.</p>
