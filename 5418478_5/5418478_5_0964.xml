   <p>Due to an unusual amount of work it was impossible for the manager of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) to make a report on incoming contributions and gifts at an earlier date; it is for this reason the present report reaches you one month later. [Translator's note: The names of contributors and other benefactors with amounts contributed are omitted in translation. The list is almost two columns long and totals $1741.67.]</p>
   <p>Besides these money gifts, articles of clothing and shoes, medicaments, toys, blankets, and other necessaries were also given to the Utulna A Sirotcinec.</p>
   <p>It is quite possible that in publishing the names of contributors, errors may have occurred, in which case it is requested that the party or parties whose names do not appear in this report communicate with me at once so that any possible error may be corrected in time. I render my warmest thanks to all <pb facs="5418478_5_0965.jpg" n="2"/>the generous people who have remembered our institution in whatever form their gifts may have been. The number of our benefactors grows from day to day which is the best proof that our Bohemian people do their duty. It also serves as a stimulus for a continued effort in this direction.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Bohumil Fiser.</p>
