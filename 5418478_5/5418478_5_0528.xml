   <p>The sacrificing work of our ladies bore fruit of which our noble workers may be proud, and from which our poor will derive great benefit. The distribution of prizes, donated by a group of well-known business men for those who make the largest collection, took place last night at the Pilsen pavilion. The containers were opened by the Rev. Vaclav Vanek. A total of ninety-five containers were returned, and of these fourteen were empty. In eighty-one, a total of $1086.10 was found.</p>
   <p>Sixteen prizes were awarded to the following named ladies:</p>
   <p>The ladies and the generous donors were warmly thanked by Mr. J. Cervenka. For entertainment, a fine band furnished the music gratis, and last night's <pb facs="5418478_5_0529.jpg" n="2"/>party was a joyful affair in every respect.</p>
   <p>Because of lack of space in today's issue, we will publish the complete list of names of the sacrificing collectors tomorrow.</p>
   <p>It should be mentioned that the entire group of ladies who received prizes gave them up for the benefit of the Charitable Association. They are Mmes. Cervenka, Mendl, Benes, Sedlacek, Miss Turek, Mmes. Roubik, Kalbach, Miss Sistka and Miss Petru.</p>
