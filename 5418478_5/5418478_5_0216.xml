   <p>Lively interest has been evidenced in the erection of a new building on West 18th and May Streets, where the old Skola (School) burned recently. Czech businessmen of the neighborhood, in particular, are taking up the question very vigorously. This was obvious at the meeting held by the trustees of the old Skola.</p>
   <p>It is almost certain that before next winter, a new building will be ready for the Freethinkers, our fellow citizens, from the Pilsen district, the oldest large Czech settlement in Chicago. The Prvni Narodni Uhelna Spolecnost (First Czech National Coal Company), fully aware of the importance of the building, was one of the first to appropriate twenty-five dollars for the building fund. The trustees of the school have received a communication from the taxpayers of the Tenth Ward. It reads:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The hall of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society) <pb facs="5418478_5_0217.jpg" n="2"/>has for many years been the only, and most desirable gathering place for our associations in this part of the city;</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It was a memorial to our national efforts, entertainments, meetings, and educational endeavors;</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It was the only center of this large community and its Czech population, regardless of creed, political affiliations; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we commend that the Aid Society promote the erection of a new edifice on the same site where the old one was recently destroyed by fire. Our taxpayers' association will support the Aid Society in its effort with every means, moral or financial, so that this oldest Czech community center may be preserved for future generations."</p>
   <p>For the committee on resolutions: Jos. Belousek, 1811 May Street; Frank Riha, 1324 West 18th Street; Edward Hovorka, 1800 Fisk Street.</p>
