   <p>The news spread over all Czechoslovak America last year that the French government permitted the creation of the Czechoslovak Army to fight on the side of the Allies. This meant that Czechs and Slovaks who had been forced to fight on the side of the Central powers and had been taken prisoners by the Allies were released if they joined the Czechoslovak Army. They stand on French soil now, determined to fight for the freedom of our old homeland.</p>
   <p>This was the signal for every Czech-American woman to ask herself: "What can I do to help?" The most natural answer was that she should do what the American Red Cross is doing during wartime.</p>
   <p>We worked for the American Red Cross in those times and labeled our products as coming from the Czech National Alliance. Therefore, the American Red Cross knows us. We saw, however, that the products of our work had to be delivered to our boys <pb facs="5418478_5_0194.jpg" n="2"/>in France, that the latter are those to whom the care of the Czech women should be devoted. We acted accordingly. Friends of our boys, particularly all of our associations, supported us in our activities. The bulk of the contributions came to the "Czech California" branch of the Vcelky (Little Bees), at their workshop in the building of the Vojta Naprstek school. At that place the gifts of raw material are distributed among the individual workers.</p>
   <p>Numerous entertainments and theatrical performances have been arranged, the proceeds of which are used for the purchase of wool which the Vcelky turn into useful articles for our soldiers.....Our work has gradually been winning recognition. The American Red Cross knows what we are doing for the Czechoslovak Army, and it also knows that we are meeting our obligations to the Red Cross itself.</p>
   <p>The work has assumed great proportions, so that the activity of the Little Bees <pb facs="5418478_5_0195.jpg" n="3"/>is now subordinate to the auxiliary department of the Czech National Council Branch in New York, which is in contact with the American Red Cross. For this reason, we request all our members to build up a great organization for our sacred cause and to enter the ranks of the auxiliary of the Red Cross. This will place us in the front ranks with our boys in France.</p>
   <p>Our "Daddy," Professor Masaryk, the "Grand Old Man," leads us all. Thousands of Czech and Slovak lads followed his call by joining the Czechoslovak Army. We women are doing the same by performing the work which those heroes expect of us.</p>
