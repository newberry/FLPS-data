<title level="a">THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE BUILDING OF THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME AND THE ORPHANAGE HOLDS ANNUAL MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday the association which has for its aim to provide for the building of the Old People's Home and the Orphanage met in the lower hall of the Bohemian English Liberal School on Eighteenth Street. The meeting was well attended, and its results were really satisfactory. It is evident that in this last year much effective work has been done to advance the undertaking, and it cannot be denied because of these activities the goal is almost attained. This must surely please every sincerely charitable Bohemian.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Mr. Frydl, the chairman of the Association. As has been said above, there was a large attendance of the delegates [of the societies which form the Association]. After the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting by the secretary, Mr. Karel Musil, communications received were read. In these communications the names were announced of the <pb facs="5418478_5_1142.jpg" n="2"/>newly elected delegates. We observed that the lodges and the corporations had selected intelligent and capable representatives, who will be able to do much for the good of the Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Suchy, secretary of the executive committee, read the notes of the executive committee's meeting held last Sunday. The meeting then proceeded with the election of officers. Mr. Jan Pech was unanimously chosen president. Mrs. Liskova was unanimously elected vice-president. The election of a secretary was a bit more difficult because many of those nominated hesitated to accept this thankless office. However, Mr. R. Svacha finally did accept the nomination and was unanimously elected. Mr. O. Stybr was elected financial secretary, and Mr. Antonin Zahrobsky treasurer. The managing committee of five members was chosen as follows: Messrs. Psenka, Tokstein, Charvat, and Haisman and Mrs. Pech. Messrs. Novak, Musil, and Tucek were elected to the auditing committee. The entertainment committee will be named at the next meeting by the newly elected president.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1143.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Association can only congratulate itself upon the result of this election. There is no doubt that the general public will also be pleased with the results and will show its approval by generous gifts to the Home and the Orphanage. Several proposals for the good of the Association were offered after the election of officers had been completed. Those which were recognized as beneficial to the Association were accepted.</p>
   <p>Receipts of the evening amounted to the substantial sum of $1,059.10; disbursements, none. [After this had been announced], the meeting was adjourned.</p>
