   <p>Twenty-three members of the Cesko-Slovenska Jednota (Czechoslovak Union) have volunteered for service in the United States Army. There is no clause in the statutes of the Union which deprives enlisted men of their membership. In order to remove possible doubt in regard to the membership of enlisted men, the organization inquired at the Illinois insurance commissioner's office. The answer read: "Court decisions in cases of retroactive bylaws clearly show that your enlisted men are entitled to membership. You are, however, at liberty to interpolate a clause into your statutes which defines military service as 'an impermissible occupation'. This article would have validity in the cases where men became members after its enactment. For protection <pb facs="5418478_5_0329.jpg" n="2"/>against excessive financial losses on account of emergency cases of men already enlisted, we would suggest special assessments; briefly, these men should pay higher dues while they remain in the military service. We do not know what attitude the state and the federal governments are going to take in cases of abnormal mortality among members as a result of the war. We feel, however, that this matter is well within the jurisdiction of this department, and we shall be glad to advise you in each individual emergency."</p>
   <p>After taking cognizance of the letter, the directors resolved to leave the final decisions to the plenum.</p>
