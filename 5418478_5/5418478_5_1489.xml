   <p>The managing committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held a meeting last Thursday in its offices located on 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Mr. A. J. Sokol presided. The purpose of this meeting was to audit the disbursements and receipts for this year. The treasurer of the ball committee, Dr. F. L. Fortelka, submitted a detailed financial report on the last ball given by the society, and turned over to the treasury the net proceeds of that entertainment, amounting to $2,303.18. The ball committee consisted of the chairman, Alois Solar; Chas. J. Novak, secretary; and Dr. F. L. Fortelka, treasurer. The efforts of the ladies' committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost were praiseworthy. These ladies took care of all the work in the kitchen. The Reverend Vaclav Vanek, who is the treasurer of the Christmas Gift Fund, reported that this fund amounts to $3,512, and that 324 individuals contributed sums ranging from $1 to $100. Those families which were in need were given Christmas baskets and ready cash in amounts ranging <pb facs="5418478_5_1490.jpg" n="2"/>from $5 to $35.</p>
   <p>After the payment of all the bills, the balance was turned over to the treasurer of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. This balance will be used for the regular fund and will go toward the support of needy families during the winter months. Mr. Anton J. Cermak is chairman of the gift committee.</p>
   <p>Belated and additional contributions to the Christmas fund were received from the following: The Hub Company, State Street and Jackson Boulevard, $10; Frank J. Petru, 1443 West 18th Street, $5; August Patera, 2025 South Crawford Avenue, $5; J. A. Budilovsky, 2230 South Kedzie Avenue, $5. Two dollars were received from each of the following: Joseph Pelc, 3443 West 26th Street; Josef Cicovsky, 1942 West 51st Street; Robert B. Zika, 2934 Lexington Avenue; Charles Chvalovsky, 4139 Colorado Avenue. All of the contributors were given appropriate mention in the daily papers and will also be mentioned in a special annual report of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1491.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We should also like to mention that Mr. August Geringer took care of three needy families recommended by us. Miss Helen Cermak and Messrs. Sachs, Sr. and Jr., distributed the Christmas baskets from morning to night, using their own automobiles for that purpose. During the Thursday meeting of the board of directors, the following membership dues and contributions were also received: John Tancl, 1921 Blue Island Avenue, $5; J. Illich 2059 18th Place, $5; Albin B. Holecek, 1402 Hartford Building, $5; Vaclav Jelinek, 2610 South Millard Avenue, $10; the editor, Robert J. Psenka, $10; John J. Boehm, 1901 Halsted Street, Adams' State Bank, $25. Miss Cimburek contributed hats, the combined value of which was $25. The board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost wishes to express its thanks to all benefactors who remembered the needy Bohemian families of Chicago during the past year with gifts and contributions; the board is also grateful to our Bohemian daily press for its great moral support in offering free space in the newspapers.</p>
