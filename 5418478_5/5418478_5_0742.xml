   <p>Mr. T. V. Vilim of 1620 West 22nd St. the well known pharmacist and graduate optician, who operates a first class drug-store, an Eye and Ear clinic, perfectly equiped with Roentgen Ray machines, is leaving with his wife on the 23rd of April for the old country, so as to attend the Eye and Ear clinic in Prague, for further studies. On his return to America he will again endeavor to serve our countrymen to the best of his ability in the cure of Eye and Ear troubles. After he completes the studies at Prague he expects to travel through Italy and will stop in Paris for a time, where he wishes to become acquainted with the French methods of treating the Eyes and Ears. During his absence the entire business will be conducted by an experienced pharmacist Mr. Ant. J. Jehlik with the assistance of Mr. J. Vlck and N. Stach.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jehlik will also conduct the Eye and Ear Clinic under the supervision of professor Reigl and Dr. J. Vasumpaur experienced ouclists and aurists. Any of our countrymen who would like to obtain medicines or curative herbs from Bohemia, which cannot be obtained here, should let Mr. Vilim know before his departure and he will gladly take care of such transactions.</p>
