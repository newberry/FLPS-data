   <p>At the memorable meeting in the pavilion of Pilsen Park held on April 11, the Bohemian Hospital Association was organized and a board of fifteen directors was elected to whose hands the project was entrusted. Now it has become their duty to bring the action to a successful conclusion and to see that the desire of all Bohemians in America for a hospital of their own will be fulfilled at the earliest possible date; and to take over the management of the hospital after it is built and established. The board consists of six physicians and nine laymen.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the now discontinued organization committee and member of the newly appointed board of trustees, Mr. Karel J. Vopicka, called a board meeting last Thursday at which the election of officers took place. Two candidates were nominated for the office of president, Mr. Vopicka and Mr. John A. Cervenka. Mr. Vopicka expressed his thanks for the confidence shown him by <pb facs="5418478_5_0731.jpg" n="2"/>the nomination. He asked, however, that his nomination be dropped, because at the present time he is more than fully occupied by other affairs and could not accept as important a position as that of the president, which requires a large amount of time. However, he promised to extend his full co-operation to the Association, and asked those present to elect Mr. Cervenka as president. Mr. Cervenka was unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>The following men were also elected: Dr. Jos. Zabokrtsky, vice-president; Dr. Ludvik Fisher, secretary; Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, treasurer.</p>
   <p>In the next few days the board of trustees will hold a meeting in which a plan for a systematic conduct of collections and securing of additional supporters will be worked out.</p>
