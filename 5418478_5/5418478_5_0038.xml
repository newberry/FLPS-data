  <body>
   <p>A rare opportunity is offered to our brother Odd Fellows to become charter members of a new encampment. Those men who are not yet members of an encampment should seize this opportunity and learn about the rites and ceremonies of the three highest degrees of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. These three degrees form a higher school of important and perfect mystical knowledge which is open to any member of this world-wide organization.</p>
   <p>Its characteristics shall be Bohemian as much as possible so that it can courageously stand shoulder to shoulder with our other lodges which bear that high-sounding name [Bohemian]. It will be the endeavor of our members to have each lodge actively represented in the new organization. Of especial significance is the fact that this will be the first and only <pb facs="5418478_5_0039.jpg" n="2"/>Czech encampment and, as far as we know, the only one of its kind in the world.</p>
   <p>The first meeting will take place on Sunday afternoon, March 19, 1922, at three o'clock, in the hall of the Ceskoslovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) located on 18th and May Streets. The regular meetings will take place every first and third Fridays of every month in the same hall. Detailed information may be obtained from the members.</p>
