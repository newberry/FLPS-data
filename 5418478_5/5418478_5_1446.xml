   <p>Since last week we have received more contribations for the starving Russian children. [There follows a list of names of the people who contributed and the amounts.] Last week's receipts were $64. Today we received $1<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>5.75.</p>
   <p>Among the letters accompanying the contributions, there was one was one [which we shall publish here] from <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, Alaska:....</p>
   <p>"Enclosed find $100....for the poor Russian children.</p>
   <p>"Signed: A. Šlechta."</p>
   <p>This is indeed a concise letter, but behind it there is a generous heart. We are of the opinion that the donor does not wish to disclose his identity and [that Šlechta] is not his real name. [Translator's note: The word Šlechta denotes generosity]. Were we to investigate, we would surely find that he is <pb facs="5418478_5_1447.jpg" n="2"/>one of our Catholic countrymen working for our common good in the Far North-west....and since he does not wish to be known we bow our heads and obey. But Mr. Šlechta has a generous heart nevertheless!</p>
   <p>Whoever is able to make a contribution should help the poor, suffering Russian children. Let us be compassionate; we have in the past been able to stand all kinds of charitable activities and one more or less ought to be easy. To feed the hungry children is more meritorious than to contribute to causes which are not pressing. Hunger does not wait, and hundreds of the pitiful children of our Slavonic brothers are perishing. The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) was the first and foremost among our nationalistic organizations to start this aid; it was our knowledge of our duty both as Slavs and as Christians to send help as speedily as possible to those who so innocently suffer. Therefore, let us continue, this work! Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku, 3207 West 32nd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
