   <p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) took place yesterday in the offices of the Association, located on Kedzie Avenue near 26th Street. Mr. John A. Sokol presided. The reason for this meeting was the election of officers for the ensuing year. Reverend Vaclav Vanek, who is the secretary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were approved..... A new member of the board of directors, Mr. Tomas Chval, was introduced. Mrs. Marie H. Krizan, the office manager of the association, read a letter from the Chicago Federation of the Aged and Adult Charities, in which the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is informed that the membership fee for the year 1922 is five dollars. This amount was paid to the Federation. At this point, there was an election of representatives of the Spolecnost to the Chicago Federation. Three ladies were chosen for this appointment. They are Mesdames Sophie Kremba, Antonie Kybic, and Marie Krizan. Thereupon, the president declared that election of officers for the <pb facs="5418478_5_1408.jpg" n="2"/>fiscal year were in order.
