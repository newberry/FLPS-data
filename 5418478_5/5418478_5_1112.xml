<title level="a">A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE CESKA UTULNA A SIROTCINEC</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) held a special meeting Tuesday to consider proposals for improvements on a part of its property called the "Point". The meeting, which was attended by twenty-five representatives, was called to receive the proposals that were expected to result from an invitation that had been issued, but only one came in--that of the Pilsen Brewing Company. The Company proposes to lease the "Point" for twenty-five years and erect on it a building suitable for a restaurant for $12,000 and spend $5,000 for landscaping. If the landscaping should cost more, the difference would be paid by the Utulna.... [Translator's note: There follows a detailed description of the contract offered by the Pilsen Brewing Company.]</p>
   <p>After a long debate the proposal was accepted, nineteen representatives voting for the proposal, one against, and four representatives of women's organizations abstaining from voting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1113.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As we have pointed out several times in our previous issues, the matter of improving the property had been taken up only in order to insure a permanent and reliable source of revenue for the Utulna. It certainly is to be regretted that a majority of women's organizations have been against this proposal, and that they had caused a rift in the body by having recalled their representatives from the two most recent meetings.....</p>
   <p>The whole affair could have been brought to an end a long time ago if all representatives had cared to consider it from a practical point of view.....</p>
