   <p>The official acknowledgment of receipt of contributions collected and sent by us to Czechoslovakia for the benefit of the Dr. Alice Masaryk Fund for orphans in Czechoslovakia, was received by us yesterday. The communication, signed by Dr. Alice G. Masaryk, chairwoman of the Czechoslovak Red Cross, reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"I hereby acknowledge the receipt of 5,045 Czechoslovakian kronen, which sum was paid to us on February 23, 1921, through the Bohemian Union Bank of Prague, Czechoslovakia, and which sum was added to the Dr. Alice Masaryk Fund. May I ask you to convey our cordial thanks to all your readers who participated in this collection. We would like to let them all know that we are greatly encouraged by the knowledge that our work is understood by you and that you endeavor to support us. Although your gifts are still needed, more than <pb facs="5418478_5_1535.jpg" n="2"/>anything else we appreciate the love which induced you to make this collection.</p>
