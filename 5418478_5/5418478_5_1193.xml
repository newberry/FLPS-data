   <p>The celebration of the opening of the Bohemian Settlement Building at 18th Street and Center Avenue will take place next week. The festivities will be held next Thursday and Sunday, both afternoon and evening. The Thursday afternoon program includes a talk by Professor J. J. Zmrhal and presentations by Miss Helen I. Duncan, Mrs. A. G. Beebe, and the Austin Choral Society. For the evening, speeches by Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir, Mr. C. D. B. Howell, and Miss McDowell are scheduled. These will be followed by musical selections. Sunday night the Bohemian ceremony will take place with Reverend V. Vanek as the main speaker.</p>
   <p>The cost of the new Settlement Building is $31,000. In addition to this, $11,000 has been spent for the adjoining three lots which are used as a playground. The equipment for the latter will cost another $1,500. To meet these costs there is already an amount of $34,677 available, so that the establishment will start its functions with a comparatively small indebtedness which <pb facs="5418478_5_1194.jpg" n="2"/>no doubt will soon be paid up. Perhaps it is also of interest to know that the running expenses will amount to $8,000 a year.</p>
