   <p>It will surely please all the generous benefactors and friends of our institution [St. Benedict's Home for the Aged in Chicago] if we give a brief survey of our annual meeting which was held on January 9, 1922 in the parish hall of the Saint Vitus Church. The meeting was opened with a prayer by Reverend Prokop Neuzil, O.S.B. [Order of Saint Benedict], who then gave a survey of the activities during 1921. The committee appointed to serve in 1921 was particularly busy with the drafting and sanctioning of our constitution, the incorporation of our institution, and the thorough repairs of the whole building.....We now own an up-to-date edifice that is well fitted to shelter our aged men and women and the destitute girls of the Chicago [area].</p>
   <p>Reverend P. Neuzil on this occasion spoke very flatteringly about the <pb facs="5418478_5_0953.jpg" n="2"/>Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (District Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of Chicago), which, by its arrangement of the Svatovaclavska Pout (Festival of Saint Wenceslaus), removed those financial difficulties with which our institution was threatened. Ours is the only institution of its kind among the Bohemian Catholics in America.....</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Vaclav Radous, submitted a detailed financial report for the year: The total income for the year was $10,283.19; the expenses amounted to $15,976.47, including expenses connected with the repair of the building--$15,546.82. To cover the expenses, it was necessary to borrow $8,000; but $3,000 of this amount has already been repaid according to the report of the last meeting on March 7, 1922. This is [also] a proof of how well we manage our money.</p>
   <p>Reverend Eduard Sladek, who is a temporary manager of the institution, <pb facs="5418478_5_0954.jpg" n="3"/>reported that all of our inmates receive truly humane and Christian treatment..... At the moment there are thirteen aged men and ten aged women sheltered by us.</p>
   <p>Reverend Martin Krizka reported for the investigating committee and announced that seventeen new cases have been investigated, of which only three have been accepted by the institution; the [committee] is now investigating two other cases.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rosalie Nedved reported on the interior conditions of the Home and said that improvements and renovations of the living quarters continue; several rooms have been completely fitted out, and, among other things, new bed covers have been purchased.</p>
   <p>The next item on the program was the election of new members of the board of <pb facs="5418478_5_0955.jpg" n="4"/>directors of the Domov Svateho Benedikta Pro Starce A Stareny. Following the wish of the Archbishop of Chicago, the number of directors was reduced from fifteen to nine.</p>
   <p>The following were elected: Reverend Innocent Kestl and Mrs. Antonie Serpan for three years; Reverend Eduard Sladek and Mrs. Rosalie Nedved for two years; Reverend Prokop Neuzil and Messrs. Antonin Hynous and Jan Ouska for one year. Besides these, two auxiliary members retained their offices. They are Reverend Frantisek Bozenek and Reverend Martin Krizka; the former is to continue his work as a reporter, the latter as an investigator of cases which are to be committed to the institution.....</p>
   <p>We submit this brief report to our people in the hope that it will gain new supporters and friends for our Domov Svateho Benedikta Pro Starce A Stareny. Please send all contributions to the editors of this newspaper or directly <pb facs="5418478_5_0956.jpg" n="5"/>to the Saint Benedict's Home, 1718 West 18th Place, Chicago, Illinois. We thank all our generous givers beforehand, and may God Almighty repay them for their generosity!</p>
   <p>With a countryman's greeting to all,</p>
   <p>Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, reporter</p>
