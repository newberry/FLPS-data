   <p>The National Slovak Court, which comprises almost all the Slovak organizations of Chicago and a long list of individual workers from the circles of our brothers from the Tatra districts, met in the Pilsen Auditorium last night for its annual gathering. The initial foundations were laid there for a project which promises far-reaching results for the further development of social life of the Slovak colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The main point of discussion was the proposed purchase of the Pilsen Auditorium building, which is being offered to the Slovak united societies <pb facs="5418478_5_1176.jpg" n="2"/>at favorable terms. The negotiations are making rapid progress, so that the Slovaks will soon possess their own home and social center, the lack of which they have keenly felt, up to the present time.</p>
   <p>Most of the Slovak organizations, as for instance, the Slovak National Association, Union of Slovaks from the Tatra [mountains], Slovak Evangelical Society, various Slovak Sokol groups, and Slovak singing societies belong to the Slovak National Court. The founders of these are accredited Slovak patriotic workers throughout.</p>
   <p>Cultural and social activities play an extensive part in Slovak life. Our Slovak brothers have repeatedly given proof of this by their impressive demonstrations and by enthusiastic co-operation with the Czechs since the <pb facs="5418478_5_1177.jpg" n="3"/>beginning of the war. What the Slovaks needed was a regular community center, their own national home.</p>
   <p>The National Slovak Court owns valuable property on Union and Canalport Avenues, which, however, does not fill the demand. It is more of a private house, merely a good investment. The project finally centered on the Pilsen Auditorium where a Czech bazaar was once held. The aid society, Borivoj, its owner, is offering it at fifty-five thousand dollars, a reasonable price, and the society is willing to take the Slovak Court's property on Union Avenue as part payment to the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, at which it is appraised.</p>
   <p>As far as the delegates are concerned, the idea of purchasing the Pilsen Auditorium is accepted with much favor. The transaction itself depends upon <pb facs="5418478_5_1178.jpg" n="4"/>the vote of all the members.....</p>
