<title level="a">THE TAG DAY OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The annual tag day of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost v Chicagu (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago) was held yesterday, and according to the report received from the tag day committee the sum of about twelve hundred dollars was collected. The tag day, as it is generally known, is held every year on Memorial Day, and a special permit for it was issued by the City Council. By issuing this permit, the City Council recognizes the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost as one of the institutions which needs all the support of the public. The hot weather prevailing yesterday was in no way a help to the collection. Another unfavorable circumstance was the fact that numerous people left the city to spend two-day vacations in the country. But in spite of all these obstacles the proceeds of the collection were fair, thanks to the ladies who willingly and self-denyingly worked for the task of mercy.</p>
