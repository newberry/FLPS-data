<title level="a">CZECH CHARITABLE ASSOCIATION'S STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL A BEAUTIFUL AFFAIR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A party was given yesterday afternoon by the Ladies' Section of the Bohemian Charitable Association in the hall of Sokol Chicago, on South Kedzie Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets. It was called a strawberry festival and served to replenish the purse of the Association--in other words, it was for the benefit of the poor and destitute in our settlement. The ladies are tireless, willing, and self-sacrificing workers, and thanks to their zeal the entertainment was a remarkable success. The spacious hall was crowded with people from all strata of our Czech society, which showed that it is not indifferent to the welfare of the poor.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee deserves credit for having made up a program which was satisfactory in every respect. After an address by Mrs. Marie Sokol, chairman of the Ladies' Section, a piano solo, "Loreley," was rendered by Mrs. Olga Svoboda. A children's duet followed, and then Miss May Hajicek sang <pb facs="5418478_5_0210.jpg" n="2"/>Friml's "Empty Promises," Salter's "A Proposal," and Hue's "Je Plains En Reve". The songs brought out the young lady's talent very advantageously. There were also pieces for the violin and the piano. Hasler's group of soldier songs, "Muj Kamarad" (My Comrade), were presented by our well-known artiste Mrs. Slavka Svoboda. A number of pieces followed, until the formal part of the entertainment closed, and the guests repaired to the tables to enjoy a cup of excellent coffee with cakes and to indulge in the gift of springtime--strawberries.</p>
   <p>For the sake of the completeness of this report we point to the appeal for support made by Mr. Stanley J. Loula, chairman of the Association. His glowing words were addressed especially to our ladies.</p>
