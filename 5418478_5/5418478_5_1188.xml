   <p>Yesterday at half past 3 o'clock the new Bohemian Settlement on Center Avenue in our Bohemian Pilsen district was opened to the public. It is a beautiful structure built at a cost of $46,000 which includes the real estate, furniture, and equipment. The building occupies two lots, totaling 50 by 100 feet. The third adjoining lot is reserved for a children's playground to be equipped at a cost of $1,500. The Settlement was built by the ladies of Presbyterian churches of Chicago who are united in the Women's Presbyterial Society. The principal credit for the erection of the Settlement belongs to Mr. and Mrs. C. D. B. Howell of Evanston, who devoted a great deal of energy to the solicitation of contributions and devoted much care to the furnishings of the Settlement. The building has two stories. The basement contains a gymnasium covering an area of 50 by 100 feet, and an electric washing machine which will be available to the neighborhood women. The first floor contains a large assembly hall, a dispensary, a reading room, and an office. The second floor is divided into several schoolrooms, a kindergarten, a sewing room, cooking <pb facs="5418478_5_1189.jpg" n="2"/>school, and two music rooms. On the third floor are living quarters for those who will work in the Settlement, and there is room for eleven employees. The rooms are modern throughout, tastefully furnished, and electrically lighted, and all those present agreed that the new Bohemian Settlement House surpasses all buildings of its kind in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The afternoon ceremonies were opened by the Rubenstein Ladies' Singing Society of Austin. The Society has sixteen members and Miss Ida Belle Freeman is its director. The speakers included Mrs. A. G. Beebe, Miss Helen I. Duncan, who is in charge of the Settlement work, and Professor J. J. Zmrhal. Mrs. C.D.B. Howell of Evanston acted as chairman of the afternoon ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The evening meeting was opened at 8 o'clock by the chairman, Reverend G. B. Safford. Among the speakers were the well-known director of the University of Chicago Settlement, Miss Mary McDowell; Mr. Howell; and Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir, all of whom presented spirited, enthusiastic talks. Miss McDowell spoke about her impressions of Prague and experiences during her visit to <pb facs="5418478_5_1190.jpg" n="3"/>Bohemia. A large part of her talk was devoted to such famous Bohemians as Jan Amos Komensky and Jan Hus; and she stressed the fact that these men do not belong to the Bohemian nation alone, but to all humanity, to the whole world, and should be held in the highest esteem and honored by all people, no matter to what nationality they may belong--just as much as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not belong to the American people, but to the entire human race. Further she pointed out that the rights of immigrants should always be respected; otherwise this country will have to pay a heavy penalty. Chicago is a great cosmopolitan city, and we should always bear in mind the fact that we are one great family. She concluded her talk by urging the Bohemian youth to respect Bohemian history, the language of their parents, the achievements of Bohemian people in musical and creative arts; and to realize that all these advantages now belong to Chicago, since Chicago is now the home of our youth.</p>
   <p>In his speech Judge Uhlir discussed the value of the work which is being done by various settlements in Chicago and paid a merited tribute to their <pb facs="5418478_5_1191.jpg" n="4"/>workers who gladly give any kind of assistance to our youth, help them in getting an education, and promote their well-being and happiness, no matter to what political party, religious group, or nationality they may belong. Such settlements are located throughout the city, but this is the first Bohemian Settlement in America and deserves full support for its humanitarian work.</p>
   <p>The Judge showed no mercy in his criticism of large department stores for requiring their employees, particularly young girls, to work twelve or more hours a day for starvation wages; and he enlarged upon the desirability of establishing a large farm where men who are incorrigible in the neglect of their families would be put to work. Those assembled showed their agreement with the speaker by frequent applause.</p>
   <p>The musical selections on the program were presented by Miss Edith Jones and Mr. Wm. F. Hypes. Both the afternoon and evening meetings had a large <pb facs="5418478_5_1192.jpg" n="5"/>attendance. There were guests present from all parts of the city, many of whom came in their own automobiles.</p>
   <p>Today there will be a concert in the Settlement with free admission to which the Bohemian public is cordially invited.</p>
   <p>The official dedication of the building will take place on Sunday in an appropriate ceremony. In the afternoon there will be a meeting for the English-speaking people with Dr. John Timothy Stone, Dr. J. B. Shaw, and Dr. Edgar P. Hill as speakers. The evening is reserved for a Bohemian meeting at which Dr. Barta of Dubuque, Iowa, will be the principal speaker.</p>
   <p>The Austrian consul of Baltimore sent a telegram to Reverend V. Vanek on the occasion of the opening of the Settlement, reading: "Accept my congratulations on the opening of the Bohemian Settlement. May the House render most useful service and crown your work with complete success."</p>
