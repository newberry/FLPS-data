  <body>
   <p>A ladies' association, which has taken for its purpose the task of working in the interest of children of the Bohemian Orphanage, has for a long time been performing meritorious work which should be fully appreciated by all classes of our people. At the past meeting of this organization, the retiring president, Mrs. Marie J. Novak, presented her annual report, which shows the broad range of the activities engaged in by this organization of our generous ladies. The report states that during the month of December no entertainments were arranged for the orphans because other organizations had taken care of this, but the orphans were remembered with three hundred dollars' worth of underwear and stockings.</p>
   <p>During the whole year, various tasks were performed for the benefit of orphans, and to meet these great expenses, a bunco party was arranged with the following result: Received for tickets and gifts, $541.60; for a picture donated by Mr. J. H. Novak, $107.25; for an umbrella donated by Mr. M. H. Jelinek, $20.50; <pb facs="5418478_5_0821.jpg" n="2"/>for a cake donated by Mrs. J. R. Psenka, $8. The total receipts amounted to $677.35. The total expenses were only $13, leaving a net profit of $664.35. Altogether, the orphans have received one thousand and twenty-five dollars' worth of underwear, stockings, and other clothing, plus the sum of $164 which was spent for various delicacies and necessities.</p>
   <p>Also a great deal of good work has been accomplished in the sewing circle, and various committees and individual members have striven to perform many good deeds for our little orphans. At the present time, meetings of this organization are held in Shedd Park's recreation building, and the next meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 1, at two o'clock in the afternoon. The organization now has three hundred and fifty members, and considering the important work which is being performed by this group, the membership should be still greater. Newly elected officers of this organization are: Mrs. Alma E. Marek, president; Mrs. Karolina Jelinek, first vice-president; Mrs. Albina Chvatal, second vice-president; Mrs. Tessie Sindelar, secretary; Mrs. Antonie Urbanek, financial secretary; and Mrs. Houska, treasurer.</p>
