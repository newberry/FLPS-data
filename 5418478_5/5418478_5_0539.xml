   <p>We have several Bohemian national undertakings in Chicago at present, of which we can be and are proud of by every right. Our National Cemetery which is hardly equaled by any other cemetery in Chicago; our Old People's Home and Orphanage; and our Bohemian Charitable Association. We are now taking care of the living and the dead, and no one can any longer censure us, as happened not so long ago, when we took care of the dead only. True, this is not yet all that we should or could have, but let us hope, that with good will and a little sacrifice, we will live to see it come to pass.</p>
   <p>First of all, we should look to the education of our youth. It is understood that education of the youth along nationalistic trends is meant.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0540.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Let us raise our sons and daughters to be good, conscientious Bohemians. Let us teach them to love all things Bohemian, and then we need have no apprehension that we will die out, or that our language will be forgotten here. All that is necessary is to work with a will. The founding of the Bohemian National Council was a good start in the right direction.</p>
