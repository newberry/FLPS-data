   <p>One of the organs of our brotherhoods publishes a letter from a member wherein the advisability of child insurance is questioned. "Why should I insure my boy? Is it that he will not have to work? Let him shift for himself, just as I had to do. Let him go through the mill." Thus reads the letter.</p>
   <p>It is one of the ways people answer when they are asked to take out insurance. If a man has a fortune, and a panic is not expected, then his child may not have to work. How many so situated are there among us? And how many who are just able to support their families decently, but who are not in a position to acquire a house, and own their own home? If not enough is left, the children frequently become beggars or vagrants.</p>
   <p>In order to get along today, a man must be well prepared for the vicissitudes <pb facs="5418478_5_0192.jpg" n="2"/>of life, and the untrained man must give way to the trained, to the virile and vigorous. The immature, undeveloped child will succumb if exposed to hard work.</p>
   <p>Every father owes a training to his children, a solid preparation for life. The securest way toward that end is to take out an insurance before death comes. As it may come suddenly, the step should be taken without delay.</p>
   <p>According to the latest report of the Cesko Slovenska Jednota (Czecho-Slovak Union), 130 members are in the United States military service. Of these, 35 are insured for $1000, 57 for $500, and 38 for $250, so that their total insurance amounts to $73,000. This is, however, not a complete report, since a considerable number of members have been recruited recently.</p>
