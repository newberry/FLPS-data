<title level="a">A BAZAAR OF THE PATRONAT CESKO-SLOVANSKYCH PODPORUJÍCÍCH SPOLKU</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Patronat Budovy Cesko-Slovanskych Podporujících Spolku (Board of Trustees of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall), at 18th and May Streets, is arranging a bazaar which should be attended by all patrons of this lifelong center of our public life. This, our historic national building, has been a landmark for our old settlers almost from the beginning of the growth of our Pilsen settlement, and for a long period of years entertainments, theatrical productions, concerts, and meetings of a great number of organizations have been held there. Therefore, its significance should not be forgotten.</p>
   <p>The Patronat has always been very careful to see that the building fulfills the requirements of our organizations, and such efforts should be rewarded. Old friends, and among them even those who have already left our Pilsen settlement, should remain loyal to this national hall to which they are connected by many recollections of national work, the center of which was the Czecho-Slavonic <pb facs="5418478_5_0092.jpg" n="2"/>Benevolent Societies' Hall.</p>
   <p>Friendship can be manifested at this bazaar, which is interesting in every respect, and which by its attractive program draws the attention of every visitor. The bazaar will be of short duration, and therefore everyone should hasten to visit it one of these days. Only a few days are left--that is, today and tomorrow; on Saturday a brilliant dance will bring the bazaar to a festive conclusion. Today and tomorrow the admission is free, and for Saturday's dance, only thirty-five cents will be the charge. Numerous friends of the Patronat surely will not forget to manifest their good will toward our old national hall by visiting this bazaar.</p>
