<title level="a">DR. A. SUMA ARRIVES WITH MESSAGE FROM CZECHOSLOVAK AMBASSADOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>On the occasion of the arrival of Dr. A. Suma of Washington, D.C., an interesting meeting was held yesterday afternoon in the office of the Czechoslovak Consulate, 108 South LaSalle Street, to which representatives of the local Bohemian newspapers were invited.</p>
   <p>Dr. Suma has been assigned to the Czechoslovak Embassy as charge d'affaires for matters dealing with the protection and care of Czechoslovak children. He came to Chicago for the purpose of starting action among the Chicago Czechoslovaks in behalf of a nation-wide campaign for funds to aid the poor and suffering children of Central Europe. The drive is headed by Mr. Rerbert Hoover, who is known to almost every Czechoslovak.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoover has concluded that at least thirty-three million dollars must be raised in the United States to meet the needs of Central European children. Of this amount, twenty-three millions are to be used to provide food, and <pb facs="5418478_5_1666.jpg" n="2"/>ten millions for medical and other supplies which are now very scarce in Europe.</p>
   <p>Also invited to attend the meeting, which was of an informative nature, were.... a number of prominent Americans who are enthusiastically supporting the Hoover program. Of these latter, Mr. Nels M. Hokanson, assistant cashier of the Great Lakes Trust Company, and Mr. Nicolay A. Crevstad aroused particularly sympathetic interest.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, local Czechoslovakian consul, introduced all those present, Mr. Hokanson, who personally represented Mr. Hoover, then delivered a speech. He explained the importance of this campaign, and also told how the work had been divided among members of the American committee, consisting of prominent people in American financial, philanthropic, and national circles. The committee, in asking American-Czechoslovaks for co-operation, is anxious to ascertain what Chicago Czechoslovaks, who have a good reputation with respect to national and philanthropic co-operation in the past, will do in behalf of this really good cause in which their help is now needed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1667.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Grevstad then spoke a few words. He was followed by Dr. Suma, who briefly outlined the purpose for which he came to Chicago. He announced that through the efforts of Dr. J. F. Smetanka, local Czechoslovakian consul, a temporary Czechoslovak committee had been appointed to co-operate with the American committee. He described his own ideas of co-operation. He spoke at length about the good work accomplished by the American mission in Czechoslovakia, then told of how intensively the Ceskoslovenska Pece o Dite (Czechoslovak Children Protective Society of Prague) is working in our old homeland. He explained, finally, how much more aid will be needed, not only from the American committee, but also from the Czechoslovakian committee. These two, of course, will be expected to work together hand in hand from now on.</p>
   <p>The American mission is taking care of about one hundred thousand poor children, but there are many more who need aid. The Ceskoslovenska Pece o Dite itself is taking care of six thousand children, but the number should be much greater. The Czechoslovak Government takes care of the transportation of supplies from the harbor to the place of destination, in addition to insurance, customs, and all necessary administrative work.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_1668.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>After giving a detailed explanation of the activities of both these organizations, the speaker declared that he is sure that the Czechoslovak committee will willingly co-operate with the American committee and will report to the latter all of its activities and accomplishments.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the speaker expressed a hope that, in this work, most gratifying results will be attained by the Czechoslovaks of America.</p>
   <p>Following this speech, most of the American guests departed, and only the representatives of Bohemian newspapers remained. To them Dr. Suma then said that Dr. Bedrich Stepanek, Czechoslovak ambassador, sends his sincere and cordial good wishes to the Czechoslovak community of Chicago. The ambassador would have liked to come to Chicago but it was impossible for him to do so at this time. In his stead he sent Dr. Suma with a request that local Czechoslovaks, and all Czechoslovaks in America, do everything possible, not only in their own interest but in the interest of the whole Czechoslovak Republic, to aid the Hoover relief campaign. The drive, headed by this great American, has been undertaken throughout the entire United States for the <pb facs="5418478_5_1669.jpg" n="5"/>benefit of suffering children of Europe, especially Central Europe. Dr. Suma mentioned the great love and gratitude which Mr. Hoover enjoys in all Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia where he has accomplished a great deal in behalf of suffering people of all ages. Many thousands of human lives have been saved by his efforts.</p>
   <p>At this Christmas time Mr. Hoover has undertaken a program designed to continue the work which he has already accomplished in Europe. Mr. Hoover, while willing to devote himself to the task at hand, would like to have tangible evidence that the Czechoslovaks of America are themselves interested in the welfare of Czechoslovakia. If he is convinced that local Czechoslovaks are supporting his program to the best of their ability, then he, in proportion to the results achieved by Czechoslovaks, will do everything possible to aid suffering children in Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>Dr. Suma announced that Dr. Stepanek is in direct touch with Mr. Hoover, and therefore it is of real importance to him that the Czechoslovak people of America give Mr. Hoover the greatest possible aid. They will be judged <pb facs="5418478_5_1670.jpg" n="6"/>according to the results achieved; similarly, American campaign authorities will judge results in the Czechoslovak Republic on the same basis.</p>
   <p>In order to take care of one hundred thousand children in Czechoslovakia, Mr. Hoover is presenting one million dollars to the Republic. For the upkeep of one child ten dollars (one-third of the required total) is paid out of the American fund, and the other two-thirds, or twenty dollars, is provided by the Czechoslovak Government. It is hoped that the American mission can take care of at least two hundred and fifty thousand children; this would mean that the Czechoslovak Government would receive a gift of two and one-half million dollars from America. This objective is possible of attainment providing American Czechoslovaks give proper financial support to Mr. Hoover's present drive.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Dr. Suma told the representatives of Bohemian newspapers that, at a meeting held Monday, he and Dr. Smetanka, Czechoslovakian consul, succeeded in appointing a temporary Czechoslovak committee, which will be strictly non-sectarian and nonpolitical. Czechoslovak America can make no political or religious distinctions in this charitable work. From her nothing is wanted <pb facs="5418478_5_1671.jpg" n="7"/>but immediate aid, because "he who gives promptly gives twice". The drive will begin about Christmas time and will continue until about January 15. During that period local Czechoslovaks must, in the interest of their honor and their good name, and in the interest of humanity, show what they can and will do. How the work should progress and other detailed information will be announced as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the following countrymen have been appointed as members of the Czechoslovak Temporary Committee of the Hoover Relief Administration: Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, secretary of the Czechoslovak Bankers' Association; Mr. St. Huska, secretary of the Chicago District Committee of the Slovak League; Mr. Frana Klepal, president of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago; Dr. Joseph F. Pecival, president of the Czechoslovak National Alliance of America; Mr. Joseph Placek, president of the American Sokol Union; Mr. Ondrej Schustek, president of the Chicago District of the Slovak League; Mr. James F. Stepina, president of the Czechoslovak Bankers Association; Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, editor of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason); and Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, Czechoslovakian consul, who will act as temporary secretary of the Committee. The Czechoslovak Socialist party has not yet appointed its representative.</p>
