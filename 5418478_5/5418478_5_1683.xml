   <p>Just recently we informed our Bohemian-American people about the sorrowful plight of our countrymen in Vienna, Austria. This report had been received by us from a private source--from a person holding a prominent position among Bohemians of that place. The heart of every countryman must have been touched with emotion by this report, and he must have wondered how to provide immediate help.....</p>
   <p>These people in Vienna live under pitiful circumstances. And they are brothers of our blood! It may easily be said, as many of the contributors to the Svatovaclavska Dan have remarked: For those beyond the ocean I will not contribute a penny, because we ourselves are in need. All that is necessary is to read only a few lines written in the hand of a common Bohemian workingman of Vienna who begs for his children who are suffering the most.</p>
   <p>But the prayers of these poor people were not in vain. The Narodni Sdruzeni <pb facs="5418478_5_1684.jpg" n="2"/>Ceskych Katoliku resolved that the first aid from the St. Wenceslaus collection should go to these Bohemians, and therefore the Sdruzeni appropriated the sum of one hundred thousand Austrian kronen toward this purpose. The Narodni Sdruzeni Ceskych Katoliku governed itself by the saying that "he that gives quickly gives twice". It is only to be hoped that the sum which has already been sent will be received by them before the Christmas holidays, so that their eyes may sparkle with joy--that at least on that day when everybody rejoices, the children of our Vienna countrymen will also be rejoicing and happy.....</p>
