   <p>The delegates of the Czechoslovak Union are making fast and smooth progress in their conferences. The second session was opened by Dr. Joseph Pecival in the Vojta Naprstek Czech school, Saturday Sept. 1st,with sixty-two delegates in attendance. Debates on changes of bylaws occupied most of their time.</p>
   <p>An address which expressed our loyalty to the United States was sent to President Wilson; the respective motion was made by Dr. Anton Mueller.</p>
   <p>A new schedule of fees and insurance was issued.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fridl urged close co-operation or even unification of all Czech aid societies in order that they might put up necessary resistance to the attacks made by big insurance companies.</p>
