   <p>The ladies' auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) has proved on numerous occasions that it is able to swell the receipts of the Spolecnost by its industry and activity. The ladies of this auxiliary have made extensive preparations for a bazaar to be given by them on November 17, 1922. The bazaar will be held in the Hubbard Memorial Church [a Czech Brethren church], which is located on Lawndale Avenue near West 25th Street. The affair will take place in the basement of the Church. The purpose of it is the securing of funds with which to aid the needy families during this coming winter. Every one of the ladies has donated some useful object, chiefly household wear such as aprons. Various delicacies have also been donated and will be served, with coffee, to all the visitors who favor the bazaar by their presence.</p>
   <p>This will be the first bazaar of its kind given by the auxiliary, and we hope <pb facs="5418478_5_1273.jpg" n="2"/>that many of our friends will come to purchase useful articles at pre-war prices. The purchasers will thus save money by these bargain prices and the poor will be helped by the receipts. Therefore do not forget the date--November 17, 1922, at 8 P. M. Let there be more customers than goods at this bazaar. Let this bazaar become a rendezvous for all gentle-minded people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>For the Damsky Odbor (ladies auxiliary) of the Spolecnost,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Josefina Beranek, chairwoman;</p>
   <p>Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, secretary.</p>
