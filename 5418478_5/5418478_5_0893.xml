   <p>p. 1--This is the way it should be always, at every opportunity to bear in our minds the Old Peoples' Home; and we should not be just satisfied, but should strive to make it a bigger, better and more convenient home for our aged men and women folks, and also for our orphans.</p>
   <p>That is why we take notice of every contribution made from any source and appreciate these contributions.</p>
   <p>The following donation was made by Jubilee Lodge, No. 35 C. S. B. S. (Czecho-Slovakian Benevolent Society), $7.35, and the money was left at the office of this newspaper for the proper official to take it to the secretary of the Old Peoples' Home.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Kral took it upon herself to take up a collection and brought in $12.35 according to the collection list, showing the names and addresses of those who made contributions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_5_0894.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These make a total of $19.70 to be divided equally between the Old Peoples' Home and the Orphanage. This money is also at the office of this newspaper to be turned over to the secretary of the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Thanks were expressed for these timely contributions.</p>
