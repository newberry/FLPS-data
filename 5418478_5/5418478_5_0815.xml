<title level="a">THE MEETING OF THE SBOR CESKE UTULNY A SIROTCINCE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Wednesday the delegates to the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage Association) held their regular meeting in the hall of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies, 18th and May Streets. The meeting was well attended. The chairman, Mr. Vojtech Suchy, called the meeting to order at 8 P.M., and the secretary, Mrs. Bozena Krabec, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved as read. Then came the reading of communciations received from various organizations which reported contributions appropriated by them for the benefit of this institution. Special mention should be made of a communciation received from the executive committee of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) in which the attention of the delegates is called to the fact that inmates of the Orphanage do not attend Bohemian schools regularly. The children of the Orphanage attend the F. B. Zdrubek School on Crawford Avenue, near the Orphanage. The management of the said school also complained that children of the Orphanage <pb facs="5418478_5_0816.jpg" n="2"/>do not handle the school property carefully, intentionally destroying it. The matter was referred to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The Jan Kollar Lodge No. 59 of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies of America), of Columbus, Ohio, appeals to the Association to accept three children of one of its deceased members. The mother of these children, at the present time, is an inmate of an insane asylum of that city. The matter was referred to the managing and investigation committees which will recommend to the board of delegates under what financial condition the children will be accepted. All other communciations, such as requests for the postponements for maintenance fees and others, were referred to the managing committee.....</p>
   <p>Mr. F. J. Petru, treasurer, announced that he received two thousand dollars worth of bonds issued by the West Side Hospital. These bonds were donated to the institution by Mr. and Mrs. Frantisek Fucik. The chairman explained to the <pb facs="5418478_5_0817.jpg" n="3"/>delegates the purpose of this gift and was joined in his thanks by the assembled delegates. This noble gift was made by Mr. and Mrs. Fucik on the occasion of their golden wedding anniversary, held about four weeks ago, and deserves wide commendation.</p>
   <p>The committee which undertook the task of providing musical instruments for the institution's orchestra, announced that there were few generous donors to be found but, in spite of that, the instruments are being given. Following the announcement of the chairman that the Association has eight thousand dollars cash on hand, a lengthy debate ensued. Finally it was resolved to lend this money to various building and loan associations.</p>
   <p>The board of directors then announced that an offer of three hundred and fifty dollars was received for a dilapidated frame building which used to be a saloon. The party making this offer will tear down the frame building, and they also agree to wreck the dance hall ajoining it, making no charge whatsoever. From <pb facs="5418478_5_0818.jpg" n="4"/>the building material thus obtained, and if the board of directors wishes it, they agree to build locker rooms for the use of children who use the swimming pool. The matter was referred to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The program of the meeting being exhausted, the reading of receipts and disbursements followed. The receipts for the past month amounted to $4,247.86; disbursements during the same period amounted to $3,258.71. The meeting then was adjourned by the chairman.</p>
