   <p>A farewell festival was held last Friday evening at the Svithiod Sangarklubb Hall on Wrightwood Avenue in honor of the secretary and clerk-in-chancery at the Swedish Consulate, Mr. C. G. Normelli, who is soon to leave for Sweden. Besides a dozen or so of his nearest friends and acquaintances, both of his chiefs were present, and proof of the esteem and attachment in which he is held was shown the ever obliging and gallant officer of the consulate during the course of the evening. General Consul, S. T. de Goes, thanked Mr. Normelli for what he had accomplished in the interest of the Swedish people during the five years he had been a member of the consulate here, and wished him success and prosperity at any post with which he would be entrusted, in the event that he does not return to Chicago. Mr. Theophilus Wessen, closest friend of the General Consul here, read a poem, which he had composed in honor of Mr. Normelli in which he, among other things, expressed his thanks for good comradeship that existed between them. Short talks were given by others present among them were:</p>

   <p>Vice-Consul J. Bernh Anderson, Engineer Axell, Congressman Chindblom, Engineer Hagelthorn, City Clerk Einar F. Soderwall, who (to speak parenthetically, of his talk put so much humor into the festival), Dr. Axel Bernhard, and others. After Mr. Normelli's response, he was carried about the hall a number of times in the golden chair, while following the traditional Upsala custom, all joined in singing "Sjung Om Studentens Lyckliga Dagar" ("Sing of the Happy Student Days"). The "shower," which, also according to the Upsala tradition, was to follow, was taken "within ship." (internally). The festival which had both its stateliness and camarderie, ended at twelve midnight.</p>
