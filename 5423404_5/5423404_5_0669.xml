   <p>During the past few years our countryman (compatriot) Adolf F. Meisner, 1432 North Talman Avenue, has been accorded the most flattering words of praise for his garden, designed and planted by himself around his house. Thousands of people who have visited the place to view the garden have called it the work of a master, an opinion coincided in even by some prominent professionals in gardening.</p>
   <p>On account of the frequent call for Mr. Meisner's advice and service in matters of gardening, he has decided to devote his time exclusively to work of this type in the future.</p>
   <p>Undoubtly his great knowledge and ability in gardening will make him one of the outstanding men in our group and beyond.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0670.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Swedes in and about Chicago will find it worth-while to get in touch with Mr. Meisner.</p>
   <p>To house owners it will cost but a small amount to get a beautiful garden plot planted around their dwellings.</p>
