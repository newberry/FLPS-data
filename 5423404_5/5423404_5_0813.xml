   <p>EDITORIAL. Last Sunday morning a useful and outstanding life ended in Swedish-American circles. It was that of Colonel Hans Mattson who, only at the age of sixty, passed away.</p>
   <p>Hans Mattson was born in Onnestad, Skane, Dec. 23, 1832; his parents were farmers. After studies he entered the Army but resigned 1851 and emigrated to America, where he started to work in industries, as immigrants often do. When his parents arrived in America he went with them to Minnesota, where they took land and settled at Vasa.</p>
   <p>Here Mattson became interested in community life and real estate. He also graduated from a law school and became an "attorney-at-law." He was soon elected city clerk; and in 1860 county auditor, the most responsible office any <pb facs="5423404_5_0814.jpg" n="2"/>Swede had had at that time in the United States. But other events came around. The war broke out. Captain Mattson and his company of Nordic men was attached to the Third Minnesota Regiment; and he became major after eight months of service, and colonel in 1864. He resigned in September 1865 and went back to his home as an attorney. He became editor of "Svenska Americanarca" in Chicago for a short time and later on secretary and manager of the Immigrant Bureau for the State of Minnesota. He worked hard to promote the immigration.</p>
   <p>He was elected Secretary of State in Minnesota, January 1, 1870, but was still busy with the problems of immigration. He went to Sweden with his family(1871) for further study of the problem and stayed there four years.</p>
   <p>He went back to Minnesota and renewed his political work and became interested in newspapers too at this time.</p>

   <p>President Garfield appointed Colonel Mattson as American Consul-General in Calcutta, India, July 2, 1881, and his credentials were signed by the dying President, who suffered from the bullet of an assassin. Mattson did not stay very long in India. He returned to his family July 8, 1883. Then he engaged in commercial and commerce pursuits with firms in New Mexico, London and Amsterdam.</p>
   <p>Mattson was elected Secretary of State in Minnesota 1886 for a second term and re-elected 1888 for the third time.</p>
   <p>Colonel Mattson was appointed to deliver the address of welcome to the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish Military Officers at the time of their official visit to Minneapolis in 1871. On September 14, 1880 he delivered an address in the same city at the 250th anniversary of the Swedish colonists' landing in America, attended by some 15,000 celebrants.</p>

   <p>After his resignation as Secretary of State he became chief editor of The North in Minneapolis. He is survived by his widow and five children.</p>
