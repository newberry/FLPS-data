  <body>
   <p>One of the most eminent men of the Middle West in the field of Banking, our countryman John A. Nylin, has been elected vice-president of The Peoples Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 30 N. Michigan Ave.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nylin began his bank career over 30 years age with the National Live Stock Bank, from which he went to the Peoples Stock Yards Bank. He remained with this bank for 15 years. In 1921 he became vice-president and cashier of the Fidelity Trust &amp; Savings Bank. At about the same time he was elected President of the Chicago and Cook County Bankers' Association, with which 110 banks in the Chicago area were affiliated. His brilliant banking record and achievements are perhaps more outstandingly so when one considers that he was but 36 years of age at the time. For a while he was also vice-president of the Union Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Union Avenue Swedish Methodist Church.</p>
