   <p>EDITORIAL. The newspapers in Sweden do not like the emigration to America, because it is, in their opinion, an economic loss to Sweden, and nothing but a profit to America. It may be, but the loss Sweden is supposed to suffer is not so enormous, nor is the profit for America as large as they think it is in our old country.</p>
   <p>During these times, when America is prospering and Sweden is economically pressed, the Swedes in America are sending more money home than they brought over here as immigrants.</p>
   <p>Some years ago, or in 1877, when the working wages were low in America and many , could only make a scant living, Sweden received about two million Swedish kronen annually from her children in America. Since that time the amount of money sent over to the old country has steadily increased. Our Scandinavian bankers inform us, that their banking business with Sweden has never been so lively as it is now, and that Swedish-Americans have sent homethis year six or seven times as <pb facs="5423404_5_0208.jpg" n="2"/>much as they did in 1877.</p>
   <p>Sweden may, therefore, count on twelve to fifteen million Swedish kronen sent from here this year, which is not to be despised as a sort of financial income for a small country.</p>
   <p>A large number of Swedes receive "free tickets" sent from here for their journey to America. The amount of this in aggregate is at least two million dollars.</p>
