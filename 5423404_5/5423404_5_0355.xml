   <p>p.11...On his trip around the world, Dr. V. Hugo Wickstrom, Publisher of Jamtlands Posten (Jamtlands Post), and well-known travel lecturer, has honored Chicago with a week's sojourn. During this time he has seen a large portion of greater Chicago - he had time, only for the greatest. He has visited the smelting works and foundries in South Chicago, the Pullman Company works and environs, the stock yards and other industrial establishments, our larger parks, libraries, universities, and the more note-worthy buildings; also, he became acquainted with our community establishments and local conditions as a whole.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday he was guest of honor, of the Chicago Swedish press at a supper given at the Sherman House, at which about thirty persons were present. They assembled in one of the hotel's spacious salons and passed later to the festival hall, where a brief time was spent at a "Smorgasbord" (Sandwich luncheon) which the hotel had succeeded in making quite Swedish. After the <pb facs="5423404_5_0356.jpg" n="2"/>appetite-provoking food, there was heard a number of skoal-talks (toasts) all referring to the purpose Dr. Weckstrom's tour through our country could serve.</p>
   <p>The President of the Civil Service Commission, Mr. Robert Lindblom, had volunteered to act as master of ceremonies for the evening. He presented the different speakers worthily, and carefully, but somewhat too low-toned. The first was Jacob Bonggren, editor of the Svenska Amerikanaren; the second editor, Ernst W. Olson, of Svenska Tribunen, and Fosterlandet; the third editor, John A. Enander of Hamlandet, and G. Bernhard Anderson, last. Dr. Weckstrom was then called upon to speak and he answered with warm tokens of thanks for the homage shown him, and gave a speech which throughout bore witness to the open-mindedness, the warm heartedness, and the strong desire on the part of the speaker to understand our country as a whole, and peculiar circumstances of Swedish-Americans in particular. After the speech a triple hurrah for Dr. Wickstrom was given. Now the master of ceremonies left the floor free, and various short talks were given. A quartette from the Swedish Glee Club added to the evening's pleasures, and the heightening of sentiment of the <pb facs="5423404_5_0357.jpg" n="3"/>festival by singing "Vartland" (Our Land) "Kor i Vlind" (America) "Chorus in the Winds" "Du Gamla,du Friska" (Thou Old, than Sound), and others.</p>
   <p>It would perhaps be proper hereto sketch in the greatest possible brevity, the life and work of the guest of honor. Victor Hugo Wickstrom was born in Hedemora in 1856, studied at Upsala, Lund, Paris and Berlin. In 1883 he received the degree, Ph.D. at the university of Lund. He served for a number of years as substitute teacher at Lund, Hernosand, and Ostersund, but saw, no future in this course, so he went into journalism, and in 1886 became editor of Jamtlands Posten, and this newspaper, with its building, he became the owner a few years later. While he was still in the gymnasium, he appeared as an independent author of a volume of poetry called "Hvitsipper," "White Anemones," which was followed by about thirty literary works, poems, novels, stories, plays, learned treatises, and above all, lectures on his former travels, sixteen in number in Europe. His present round-the-world sailing is his seventeenth tour. He delineates his present tour in travelletters, under the title of, "As a Newspaperman around the world," in no <pb facs="5423404_5_0358.jpg" n="4"/>less than twelve newspapers in Sweden, and his judgment of our country will have its own special interest. A number of Swedes, newspaper men and others, have made public obligue, one-sided, and for the most part, unfortunate delineations of American life. After knowing Dr. Wickstrom we feel certain that he will do right by our country and its Swedish people.</p>
