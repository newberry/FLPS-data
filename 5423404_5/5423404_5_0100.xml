   <p>The Swedish Government in Stockholm,has appointed a Royal Commission to find out the causes of the emigration from Sweden to America.</p>
   <p>The commission has sent out letters to be published in American and Swedish-American newspapers in the United States. The Swedish immigrants in America are asked to cooperate and to communicate with the Royal Commission. They are urged to send in to the Commission, letters explaining the reasons why they emigrated, and how they are now situated in America. "It would be advisable," says the Commission, "if the immigrants themselves would write the suggested notices, in the form of a biography, and mail it to the Swedish Consulate, New York, before Oct. 1."</p>
   <p>The Commission has already started to gather such material on board the <pb facs="5423404_5_0101.jpg" n="2"/>emigrant vessels. The emigrants, generally have met the problem with sympathy and understanding. The biography, mentioned, is supposed to contain facts concerning the immigrant's childhood, his relatives, his working conditions in Sweden, as well as in the United States, wages, and etc. If he was born on a farm in Sweden he should tell about the conditions there, especially if it was difficult to be an owner of his own farm. If he was born in a city, the Commission wants to know about the financial situation in his home and working conditions in the community. He is asked to reveal if the compulsory military training in Sweden, or the political situation had something to do with his decision to emigrate. Finally he should tell of his present working conditions, in America.</p>
   <p>For its own part, the Commission is of the opinion that the emigration from Sweden to America is due to the unemployment situation in the home <pb facs="5423404_5_0102.jpg" n="3"/>country. The difficulty in obtaining an independent position and of owning one's home, in Sweden, in ones younger years, is also blamed. Bad conditions in Sweden must be eliminated in order to prevent this emigration, the Commission declares in its letter.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Kuriren, in publishing this letter today is not going to do anything either for or against the emigration.</p>
   <p>But, it will continue to print notices based on true conditions, as they are in America and in Sweden. Then it is up to the readers to judge for themselves, whether, they ought to go back to Sweden or still stay here. Furthermore, the effect of the Commission's letter is going to be negligible, for only a very few are going to send in their biographies, except those, who are dissatisfied with the conditions in the United States. No, the real <pb facs="5423404_5_0103.jpg" n="4"/>reason for the emigration is mentioned by the Commission itself in the last paragraph in the letter: unemployment, the difficulty of becoming independent and a home owner in younger years. These conditions still exist and have, since the beginning of the emigration. The only practical view in this matter, is for Sweden to correct the bad conditions herself, and to satisfy its people at home. Then they will stay home!</p>
   <p>But the conditions there must then be just as good as they are here, concerning the social life, wages and work, which leads to independence and to home ownership in a short time. And until that time exists in Sweden, nothing will stop the emigration, and nothing will tempt the immigrants to go back home!</p>
