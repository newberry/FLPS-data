   <p>The United States Immigration Bureau has now reported on the last fiscal year, and the figures show that 751,756 immigrants entered the country during the year. Of these more than one fourth settled in the State of New York, mostly in New York City, while another one fourth of the total went on to Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, and the large cities of these states, such as Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Thus more than one half of the large number of newcomers settled within six states, and the majority of them in the large cities, while the other half scattered over forty states where opportunities still are plentiful for farming and the raising of fruits and vegetables.</p>
   <p>This great concentration of immigrants in the cities contains elements of danger, and cities as well as states are making efforts to direct the stream <pb facs="5423404_5_0069.jpg" n="2"/>of newcomers to less densely populated areas, where particularly those who know something about farming and like it have a good chance of getting a piece of land sufficient to support them and their families.</p>
   <p>We believe that in the long run, and taken as a whole, those immigrants who settle on farms are better off than the majority of those who go to the large cities, where they are helplessly thrown about in the giant whirlpools of humanity, living from hand to mouth, not knowing what the next day has in store for them.</p>
