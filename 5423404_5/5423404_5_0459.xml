   <p>p.11......As U.S.District Attorney in Chicago, after Edwin A. Olson, who resigned a short time ago, another of our countrymen has been chosen. George E.Q. Johnson is the new administrator of Federal Law here. Mr. Johnson was born near Harcourt, Iowa, July 11, 1874. His father was a prosperous farmer, and the son remained with his parents until the age of twenty, when he began his studies at Tobin College, Fort Dodge, Ia. After graduating from this school, he continued his studies of jurisprudence at Lake Forest University, graduating in 1900, whereupon, he opened his own law office the same year. His practice grew fast, and during later years he has also held the office of Master in Chancery of the Circuit Court. Mr. Johnson is much interested in local politics, and is known as an ardent supporter of Senator Deneen, whose interests he is watching in his home ward, the 18th.</p>
   <p>Our new District Attorney was married in 1906 to Miss Elizabeth Swanstrom of <pb facs="5423404_5_0460.jpg" n="2"/>Lindsborg, Kans.</p>
   <p>Their home is at 7327 Crandon Ave., and Mr. Johnson has his office in the Temple Building, 77 W. Washington St.</p>
