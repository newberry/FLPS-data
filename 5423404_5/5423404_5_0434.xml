   <p>Olef Alfred Tofften, Ph. D., passes away after a lingering illness of nearly two years. Olof A. Tofften, Ph. D., died last Thursday, Feb. 14th, in his residence at 5140 N. Ashland, Avenue, at an age of sixty-six.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tofften enjoyed a world-wide reputation as an authority on ancient and Semitic languages and ancient history, on which subjects he has written many books.</p>
   <p>Already as a young man he attracted great attention for his amazinga ability to grasp the very efficient subjects.</p>
   <p>In the town of Visby, Sweden, near which he was born, he finished a 9-year course in one-half of the required time and graduated cum laude approbatur. Later he studied the Semitic languages at the University of Upsala, Sweden.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0435.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In 1888 he emigrated to the United States, where he continued his studies at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., and later at the University of Chicago. At this latter institution of learning he took his degree of Ph. D. magna cum laude and become a Fellow on its faculty. Shortly afterward he was called to accept the professor's chair in Semitic languages and ancient history at the Western Theological Seminary in Chicago. In 1910-11 he traveled extensively in the Old World, at this time, particularly enriching his education in Egyptology preparatory to the completion of some of his writings.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tofften is the author of the following standard works of learning: Researches in Assyrian and Babylonian Geography; Ancient Chronology; The Historic Exodus; Breasted's Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol.V; Researches in Biblical Archaelogy, in 3 volumes; Myths and the Bible; The Corner-stone, and The Church of our Fathers. He was a member of the American Oriental Society and the Deutsche Orientalische Gesellschaft.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0436.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For his Swedish people in Chicago he founded an accredited school, The Scandia Academy which later was reorganized into the Academic Institute and of which he was Rector until his death. He carried on wide activity as a lecturer on various subjects in the Swedish, English, French and German languages, in addition to being an authority on the so-called "dead" on ancient languages.</p>
   <p>Dr.Tofften survied his wife, the late Mrs. Nittilia Tofften, by only three months. Funeral services were held last Monday, with interment at the Rosehill Cemetery.</p>
