   <p>Last week, Attorney C. Hjalmar Lundquist was appointed assistant corporation counsel for the city of Chicago by Mayor William E. Dever. It is, of course, unnecessary to explain here who Mr. Lundquist is. Every Chicago Swede who has been here for any length of time knows him as a leader, full of initiative, within several Swedish societies of this city, especially within singing circles.</p>
   <p>Lundquist graduated from college in Sweden, and upon his arrival in America, he became a newspaper man, working for Swedish-American publications. While he was editor of Svenska Posten in Rockford, Illinois, he was instrumental in establishing the Swedish Hospital Society of that city, and he played an important role in the building of the Swedish hospital in Rockford.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0541.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later, he began to study law, and even as a student he showed an unusual aptitude for the legal profession.</p>
