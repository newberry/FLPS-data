   <p>Ex-Alderman Chas. E. Hallstrom invited some of his many friends to attend a lawn party Saturday evening at his elegant home, 663 Marianna Avenue, Maplewood. It was a sort of farewell party, for Mr. Hallstrom intends to undertake a tour to Europe, principally to visit his native place in Sweden. He will, however, also make business trips to Berlin, London, Paris, and several other places, for Mr. Hallstrom is the president of the tailoring firm, The Hallstrom Tailoring Company, 164 E. Randolph Street, which for many years has done a large business.</p>
   <p>The farewell party was as pleasant as could be imagined. A splendid supper was served, and there was singing by the renowned Bellevue quartet. Those present also had the opportunity to listen to the famous solist, Mrs. <pb facs="5423404_5_0760.jpg" n="2"/>Smulski, the wife of State's Attorney John Smulski. Miss Hanley also added to the pleasure of the evening with her singing. Many speeches were made, and many toasts were drunk in honor of the party bound for Europe. Svenska Nyheter wishes Mr. Hallstrom a happy voyage and a sincere "Welcome back."</p>
