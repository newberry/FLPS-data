   <p>Norway is independent now, and Sweden is free from its burden.</p>
   <p>On October 9, the Norwegian parliament, on the recommendation of the special committee, adopted Sweden's offer, 101 members voting in favor, 16 against. A motion had been made for popular referendum in the matter, but the conviction was so strong that the people would not confirm the vote of the parliament. As a result, 109 members voted against the referendum, and only eight in favor. The special session of the parliament was dissolved the following day by Premier Michelsen, who, on October 12, two days later convened the parliament for its ordinary session. The problem now is to decide the form <pb facs="5423404_5_0315.jpg" n="2"/>of government for the country. A few leaders are leaning toward the republican form, that is,they would send all Kings and royalty to the land of the pepper, wanting a President for Norway. But the majority is in favor of the monarchial form of government. It appears most likely now that Prince Carl of Denmark will have the good (or the ill) fortune of being chosen. His candidacy is strongly favored by England.</p>
   <p>The Swedish parliament, too, has adopted the Karlstad Agreement, and the War Department has called home the soldiers on guard at the border.</p>
