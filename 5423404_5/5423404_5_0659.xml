   <p>Mr. Charles S. Peterson,</p>
   <p>President, Loyalist League, of Swedish Extraction,</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I wish it were possible for me to be with you, and I wish that you could have heard the speech in Minneapolis of one of our Swedish-American friends. He is a blacksmith and preached a type of Americanism that every citizen might well be proud of. I have just completed a four day trip with Judge Harry Olson an American of Swedish extraction who has for a long time past impressed me as having the type of qualifications an American citizen ought to possess.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0660.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In Minneapolis, I was introduced by Governor J.A.A.Burnquist, an American of Swedish parents, who in this crisis stands for all of the best which is traditionally American; he seriously admonished us to remember our international duty, without consideration of cost or risk. It is extremely necessary that such an American doctrine be voiced - at this particular time. I wish to congratulate you my fellow Americans heartily on having in your midst speakers of this kind - they speak to me just as much as I to them. They speak to all of us who are good Americans without considering the fact whether our parents were born in America, or abroad.</p>
   <p>Your friend,</p>
   <p>Theodore Roosevelt."</p>
  </body>
