   <p>The subject of this week's Foreground article is a man who, more than any other Swedish-American, is noted for his knowledge of world literature, and whose name is held in high esteem by booklovers throughout the country. His name is Aksel G. S. Josephson, and for the last twenty-seven years he has been the head of the cataloguing department of the John Crerar Library of this city.</p>
   <p>Josephson was born in the "City of Eternal Youth," Uppsala, on October 2, 1860, the son of the noted musician and composer, J. A. Josephson. After having graduated from college, young Josephson began to prepare for a business career, and since he had already become a regular booklover, not to say a bookworm, it was only natural that he should enter the book trade. He operated a bookstore in the university town of Uppsala for several years, <pb facs="5423404_5_0546.jpg" n="2"/>until he decided to emigrate to America. He came to New York in 1893. Hoping to find employment in some library, and in order to prepare himself for library work, he took a course in the New York State Library School In Albany during the winter of 1893-94. He then became an assistant in the cataloguing department of the Lenox Library of New York, where he worked for about two years. In March, 1896, he was offered the position which he still holds, that of directing the cataloguing work in the Crerar Library of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We cannot here give an extensive account of all that Josephson has done in that library. For one thing, it would be too technical. But we can mention some phases of his work. He has edited the Library's bibliographical publications; in 1905, he compiled A List of Union Lists of Serials; in 1911, A List of Books on the History of Science, and, in 1917, a supplement to the latter; in 1914 he published A List of Books on the History of Industry. The last two publications are noteworthy because they mark the first attempt at a bigliographical treatment of the subjects mentioned. The material had to be dug out from the library catalogues, where the titles were distributed <pb facs="5423404_5_0547.jpg" n="3"/>under a variety of headings. The Library's collections are, of course, growing from year to year. During the last few years, Josephson has been working on the cataloguing of the Library's large collection of bulletins, pamphlets, etc. dealing with social, economic, and political questions.</p>
   <p>Josephson became a member of the Chicago Library Club in 1896, and was its president in 1901 and 1902. At the time when the question of a new charter for Chicago came up, a charter committee was formed at Josephson's suggestion, and he served as its chairman from 1904 to 1906. He has been a member of the American Library Association since 1898, and from 1912 to 1916 he was chairman of the committee appointed by it to study the "cost and method of cataloguing". He supervised the collection and tabulating of all the data obtained in connection with this survey. The material is now in the custody of the New York State Library School in Albany. He has also from time to time been a member of other committees engaged in similar activities.</p>
   <p>In 1899, Josephson took the initiative in founding the Bibliographical Society of Chicago, serving as its secretary until 1903. In 1903-04 he was its <pb facs="5423404_5_0548.jpg" n="4"/>president. Later, he took the initiative in enlarging the scope of this organization so that it embraced the entire country, its name being changed to the "Bigliographical Society of America". Ever since its inception he has been active within the Society. From 1909-1912, he was its secretary; from 1914-1916, chairman of its Committee and Publications; and from 1917-1919 he was chief editor of all its publications.</p>
   <p>As a member of the Committee on Public Education of the Chicago City Club from 1908-1912, Josephson compiled statistics on American libraries derived from their annual reports. In 1918 he was elected a Fellow of the American Library Institute. He is among the founders of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study, and of the Swedish Historical Society of America, of whose Board of Directors he was a member from 1905 to 1920.</p>
   <p>Josephson has from time to time been a contributor to The Nation and The Dial, as well as to other periodicals; and has also written numerous articles for the daily press. His Bibliographical Notes on Some Books on Reconstruction was first published in Swedish in Arbetaren (The Worker), Nordstjernan (The <pb facs="5423404_5_0549.jpg" n="5"/>North Star), and Svenska Socialisten (The Swedish Socialist); later, it appeared in English in the City Club's Bulletin and in the Publishers Weekly. Still later, it was published, with a supplement, by the Law School of Northwestern University.</p>
   <p>He is a book reviewer of note, and the many articles which he has written for this newspaper on books and authors have always been received with great interest.</p>
   <p>From 1910 to 1914 he was a member of the Committee for Library and Museum Extension, serving for one year as its secretary.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, it should not be forgotten that Josephson has been and still is the driving spirit within the Swedish Study League. He was president of the League for several years.</p>
   <p>In 1899 he married Lucia Engberg, daughter of the late Jonas Engberg of this city.</p>
