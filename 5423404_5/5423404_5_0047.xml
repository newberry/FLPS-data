   <p>The attitude of certain self-righteous Americans toward immigrant foreigners, supposedly much inferior to them, is rather ridiculous when seen in the proper light. This is quite a strong statement which one might expect to hear from the lips of some flaming red agitator. But, strange to say, such is not the case. On the contrary, it is the gist of a speech delivered last Tuesday by J. A. Hiller before the Americanization Institute, held in the Sherman Hotel, and sponsored by the Y. M. C. A. of Chicago. The address was received with keen interest by Mr. Hill's colleagues in the Americanization work.</p>
   <p>The speaker declared that in reality the immigrant loses many of his good and desirable traits in the Americanization process, that is to say, through his association with native Americans. His Americanization causes a far-reaching change in his character, and a reshuffling of his moral ideas. The following <pb facs="5423404_5_0048.jpg" n="2"/>is a summary of Mr. Hill's speech:</p>
   <p>Many people insist that foreign-born agitators are responsible for the unrest among our workers. But the fact is that most labor agitators are Americans, and that does not mean naturalized immigrants, but natives whose parents were also born in this country.</p>
   <p>The speaker cited crime statistics for Chicago, which show that among immigrants and their children, born in America, fifteen out of a thousand break the law, while fifty-six out of each thousand native Americans become lawbreakers. Tables provided by city authorities give comparative figures showing the prevalence of crime among various nationalities in Chicago. The figures refer to the number of offenders per thousand of population, thus: Canadians, 5; Germans, 5; British, 7; Greeks, 7; Austrians, 8; Hungarians, 9; Russians, 30; Irish, 40; Americans, 56. The speaker pointed out that for the purpose of this table the term "American" refers to native-born citizens, whose parents were also native born.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that lack of loyalty during the last war was not found <pb facs="5423404_5_0049.jpg" n="3"/>exclusively among foreigners. The proportion of disloyal Americans during those critical days was great enough to cause us to hang our heads in shame. What we need most in this country is the Americanization of Americans.</p>
   <p>A strange propaganda against foreigners has been set in motion in this land, with the result that the friendly relations between that group and native Americans have been endangered. As already mentioned, the immigrant loses something valuable when he tries to absorb our American brand of culture, and in the following we shall look at some of the causes of that phenomenon.</p>
   <p>Some ward politician is often among the first to demonstrate the American way for the newcomer, and the America which he learns to know is a country where money and profit are more important than anything else. To be sure, our Constitution and Government are based on the principle that all men are born equal, not financially, but with the same right to take advantage of opportunities. It is, however, difficult for the present-day immigrant to see that this equality is anything more than a beautiful theory, far removed from the <pb facs="5423404_5_0050.jpg" n="4"/>hard facts. He is kept in the poorly lighted background, isolated from the best in American life. Consequently he becomes an easy mark for propaganda which, in most cases, is conducted by native Americans.</p>
   <p>The term "Americanization" is much used and abused. We are confronted by a problem that requires sound reasoning and unprejudiced approach. We should remember that our educational system is partly responsible for the undesirable type of citizenship, and also that strikes and other labor trouble are American phenomena that have been with us for generations, and were not introduced here by foreigners. And above all, we must cultivate an attitude of fairness if we are ever to solve this vital problem in a satisfactory manner.</p>
   <p>Thus spoke Mr. Hiller, and his words should provide food for thought for a lot of people.</p>
