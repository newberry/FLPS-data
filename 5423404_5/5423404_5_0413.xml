   <p>Charles T. Green, noted builder, well known among the older generation of Chicago Swedes, died suddenly last Sunday from a stroke.</p>
   <p>Green was born in Vireda parish, Smaland, Sweden, August 21, 1860, and attended the local public school. In addition, he studied for three years under a private tutor and later also attended school in the city of Jonkoping.</p>
   <p>He came to America and to Chicago in the spring of 1881, and made his home here ever since. For a number of years he was engaged in miscellaneous work, until he, in 1896, founded the building firm of Green &amp; Carlson, with offices at 133 West Washington Street.</p>
   <p>Green's standing among his colleagues is indicated by the fact that he served <pb facs="5423404_5_0414.jpg" n="2"/>as president of the Carpenter Contractor's Association of Chicago, and was on its board of directors for a number of years. He was also a director of the Swedish Club, and an Odd Fellow and a Freemason. In 1902, he married Signe Katrina Carlson, of Motala, Sweden. She survives.</p>
