   <p>Professor A. Nyblaus Lund, Sweden, tried to answer this question, "Is it right to emigrate " in one of his lectures at the University of Lund. He came to the conclusion that only the worst circumstances should force people to emigrate, such circumstances as political or religious compulsion or overcrowded population and so forth.</p>
   <p>There are no such reasons at present for emigration from Sweden in the professor's opinion. If one is not a genius, for instance like John Ericsson, it is everyone's duty to stay in his or her native country.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Tribune, Chicago, holds a contrary opinion..... If Prof. Nyblaus is right then it is the patriotic duty of every Swede to suffer both need and poverty in his native land rather than seek more lucrative employment abroad.</p>
   <p>What are our prosperous Swedish farmers in the Middle West telling us, or our Swedish workers in Boston, New York, Brooklyn,Chicago, and other cities, in regard to Prof. Myblaus' opinion?</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0173.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Here is a Swedish-American, who lived with his wife and six children for about ten years in a little house out in the country in Smaland. He worked hard, early and late, and so did his wife and the older children. But the bad economic conditions they had been fighting against for years and years became too hard for them. They could not bear the heavy burdens any longer. The family decided to emigrate to America, and they are now located in Kansas.</p>
   <p>They now have a cozy house on their 160 acre farm, where they are living in peace. Everything shows prosperity. The three oldest children are happily married and have their own houses and when their parents die they will leave something for the children to inherit.</p>
   <p>Political and religious liberty are greater here. The vote of the common worker is equal to the vote of the millionaire.</p>
   <p>This example is only one of many thousands in regard both to farmers and workers. When better times, socially as well as financially arrive in Sweden, then the <pb facs="5423404_5_0174.jpg" n="3"/>emigration will stop.</p>
   <p>We know very well what it is to love one's old country. But when a new world opens its arms inviting people to come and make a better living here, then there are all the reasons in the world why we should respond and come and make it better here.</p>
