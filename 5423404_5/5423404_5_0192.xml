   <p>Editorial: A couple of years ago, when "bad times" in the United States persuaded a couple of hundred Swedes in America to return to their native land. Some of them are merely going for a visit but others intend to remain there. The papers in Sweden published articles and stories about "the misery in America" and the foolishness of emigrating.</p>
   <p>Yes, when everything was turned upside down in the Great Republic, it was then natural that our fellow-editors in Sweden tried to make adverse criticism about the returning immigrants and their circumstances. These newspaper men thought that America could never have achieved what is now evident. They did not understand the conditions here. They imagined that America now was powerless and lay as a dead giant, who had fallen trying to do a miracle.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0193.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One of the latest newspapers from Stockholm prints a curious article concerning recently returned immigrants. All of them have advised people not to emigrate according to this paper. One said that he had been away a year, and returned poor, with broken health.</p>
   <p>Finnish man, who had been in America ten years, could not save more than $350 in spite of very careful living.</p>
   <p>It is sad, of course, to return poor and with broken health, but what had our man expected in America? People with good health usually do not become sick here, but if some one has bad health before he emigrated he cannot expect a change for the better through emigration, and nobody should expect prosperity in one year. This man ought not to be any detering example.</p>
   <p>But the Finnish man! He could not save more than $350 in ten years. That was not much, that is true. But how much would he have been able to save by staying <pb facs="5423404_5_0194.jpg" n="3"/>in Finland during the same period? Three Hundred Fifty Dollars are about 1,800 Finnish Marks. He would need at least twenty years in his native land to save up such a sum as a farm hand; especially when, if he has a family, as this man had.</p>
   <p>We do not critise the Stockholm paper because it was not familiar with American affairs. But two Swedish-American papers, one in New York, and one in Chicago have re-printed the stories without corrections or explanations. In view of the fact that this comes from American papers the articles ought to present this country in a favorable light; that the Swedish-American press should be commanded to give correct information regarding the United States.</p>
   <p>Thousands read our Swedish-American papers, both here and in Sweden.</p>
   <p>When a paper here re-prints misguided reports from papers in Sweden, without correcting them, it feels guilty.</p>
