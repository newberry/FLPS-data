   <p>John Richard Lindgren, formerly Swedish-Consul and Bank Director, died in Evanston on April 29, after a long period of illness.</p>
   <p>Until about five years ago, when disease overtook him, forcing him to retire, Lindgren occupied one of the most important positions within our group. He was born in Chicago. He was the son of Captain C. M. Lindgren, one of the Swedish pioneers. Already at the age of twenty-four he founded in 1879, together with the Norwegian Helge A. Haugan the banking firm, Haugan and Lindgren. From an inauspicious beginning this firm grew to be one of the leading banks in Chicago, so that now, under the name State Bank of Chicago, it commands an undisputed rank among the great financial undertakings of the West......Mr. Lindgren was a very conscientious man and to him the call of duty overshadowed everything else.....He was a very benevolent man and managed in this respect to follow the rule of <pb facs="5423404_5_0679.jpg" n="2"/>of the Scriptures, not to let the left hand know what the right hand be doing. His wife and daughters are the chief mourners. The fortune left by the deceased is somewhat in excess of one million dollars, a large part of which is willed to benevolent causes.</p>
