   <p>The prominent Norwegian, Ole A. Thorp, a member of the firm O. A. Thorp and Company, died last Wednesday at St. Mary's hospital, Haddon and Leavitt Streets, at an age of forty-eight years. He had been ill since December last, and recently had undergone an operation. The deceased was born at Eidsberg, near Christiania, in 1865. In 1880, he arrived in Chicago, and became the founder of the firm O. A. Thorp and Company, a wholesale export firm in commodities, and at the same time importer of all kinds of sea foods. The firm is now rated one of the very largest in the United States.</p>
   <p>In 1892, Mr. Thorp had a steamer, the "Wergeland" carry a cargo of herring directly from Norway to Chicago, and then sent the steamer back to Norway with a full cargo of flour. Twice during the weeks following did Mr. Thorp send <pb facs="5423404_5_0767.jpg" n="2"/>ships directly to Norway from Chicago, and with good success. When the World's Fair in Chicago was on, Mr. Thorp was appointed member of the Commission for the Norwegian exhibition by the Norwegian government. In 1899, he was selected by King Oscar II, a Knight of the Order of St. Olaf, First Class, in recognition of his services to the land of his birth. The following year, he was selected by Mayor Harrison as a member of the school board to fill a vacancy. Two years later, he was appointed to the board of education for a full term, and for a time, he was also chairman of the city's building commission. He was a member of the board of trade, and besides, held many other positions of trust. Whenever occasion arose, he would assist his countrymen with advice or by action, and he was ever strongly interested in the welfare of the country he and they had left.</p>
   <p>His passing away deprives the Norwegians in Chicago of one of their ablest and most popular men.</p>
