   <p>Mr. Charles J. Forsberg tendered his resignation as City Collector of Customs to Mayor William Hale Thompson, who in turn, appointed him Business Manager of the School Board to succeed Percy B. Coffin. His new position pays him a salary of $10,000. His successor will not be appointed, as the vacancy will be filled by Mr. Forsberg's "righthand man," George Lehman.</p>
   <p>Charles J. Forsberg was born in Norrkoping, Sweden, September 2, 1862, the son of Wilhelm Forsberg and wife, Marie, nee Skold. He came to America in 1880, when he followed the painting trade. Later, he engaged in the dry-goods business, until he entered in the service of the City. He married Sigrid Holberg from Kristianstad, in 1900, and has six children. Their home is at 4856 West Huron Street. Mr. Forsberg belongs to several Swedish societies: Free Masons, Odd Fellows, and Royal League. He is a Republican and a Lutheran.</p>
