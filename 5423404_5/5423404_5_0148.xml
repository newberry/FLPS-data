   <p>The Swedish Tribune reprints an editorial from Nerikes Allehanda, Sweden, in regard to emigration.</p>
   <p>The emigration from Norway to America was very large in 1885, when nearly 14,000 Norwegians emigrated, and the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang stated "that people at the best time of life think they ought to leave their native land for America to make a better living. Should there not be a remedy for this, or, have we really done everything possible to help keep our people at home."</p>
   <p>Then the Swedish paper made the following statement: "Like Verdens Gang, we may find the emigration sad, if we look at it as a result of discontent at home. It robs the country of 'fresh blood'. We may also agree with the paper's question as to whether we have done what we ought to do in helping the people at home. We can say that in some instances the emigration is caused by a desire for personal liberty. The prospects of a life free from care and with a better and more solid existence is, and will, be the chief force behind the emigration, because the old world in its present form, cannot take up the race with the new world in this respect.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0149.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The soil of Europe is high-priced, while in America it is comparatively cheap and unusually fertile.</p>
   <p>"The common man must fight with sweat and hard work in his native land for a scanty living without a chance for financial independence. In American he can, as experiences show, soon be self-supporting.</p>
   <p>"The immigrant was somewhat isolated many years ago out there in the strange land, but now he will find, wherever he goes, either countrymen or relatives. In combination with these facts, a better existence and greater personal liberty, the immigrant will find himself right at home. The emigration will, therefore, go on as long as there are places for new masses and as long as American soil can be bought easier and cheaper than European.</p>
   <p>"When America is 'filled up' when the price of land is high, then, but only then, will the emigration stop of itself. But it is a long, long time before this will happen, if ever!"</p>
