   <p>Charles J. Stromberg was born in Karlshouse, Sweden, Feb. 12, 1838. He received his education in the public schools of that country, and came with his parents to America in 1854. After a short time in Winchester, Pa., the family moved to Missouri. In 1856 they moved to Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the outbreak of the Civil War, young Stromberg enlisted in the Union Army. After completing his service he entered the stationery printing business in Chicago with J. M. W. Jones. He later formed his own firm under the name of The Stromberg Allen and Company (Railroad and Commercial Printers.) Because of his friendly and helping nature, he has built up his business so that it is now a very large concern. His son Charles J. Stromberg Jr. is now engaged in mastering his father's business. When "Svea" was first organized Stromberg was elected its first president.</p>
   <p>He also was president of the company which organized and edited the first issue of the Swedish - American.</p>

   <p>Stromberg has been married since 1865 to Augusta Anderson.</p>
   <p>Their two daughters died in infancy, so he has but his one son left. Mr. Stromberg is one of the foremost Swedes in Chicago and entertains extensively at his residence on Wolfram St. He, Consul Charles Sundell, and Captain Stenbeck constituted a very fine Swedish - American trio for a great many years who attempted to keep alive Swedish speech and culture in Chicago. With the passing of Consul Sundell and Captain Stenbeck, Stromberg is left to carry on alone. He spends his winters in Florida, but comes back each spring.</p>
