<title level="a">SUMMER VISITS TO SWEDEN</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>When the mild spring breezes begin to fill the air the Swede who is living far from home is overtaken by a desire to see the old country.</p>
   <p>This year the number of Swedish-Americans who are going to spend the summer in Sweden is larger than usual, because of the added attraction afforded by the Stockholm Exposition and the great song festival in connection with it, at which Swedish and Swedish-American singers will meet. There will be many joyous reunions back home this summer, not only in the capital, but throughout the entire country wherever Swedes from far-away America go to visit the old home. And next fall, when these voyagers return to America we shall hear wonderful narratives of their experiences. No wonder that those who are forced by circumstances to postpone their visit to the fatherland feel a touch of envy as they watch the more fortunate depart. They would so much <pb facs="5423404_5_0219.jpg" n="2"/>like to go, but for some reason or other they cannot manage to do so right now.</p>
   <p>Those who are embarking on the great adventure will do well to remember the wise words of the old Norse scribe, "Good sense is needed by him who travels far, and a careful man seldom gets hurt." When a man returns to his child- hood home after having lived for many years in foreign lands his feelings are likely to overflow, and his excitement may get the best of him, and while he is in that condition he is in danger of saying and doing things which place him in an unfavorable light. He may even make himself ridiculous. Even though Sweden is his homeland, he should remember that many things have changed while he has been gone, and when he now returns, he comes as a visitor. It behooves him, therefore, to maintain a certain reserve, which is often difficult to do when one's heart is so full, and when feelings which have, perhaps, been suppressed through years of association with strangers, demand an outlet.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0220.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>While visiting the homeland a Swedish-American should be careful not to picture America in too enthusiastic terms. Even though he may not at all be guilty of exaggeration he may so easily be misunderstood by the home folks. It is no secret that a good many of them are somewhat skeptical in regard to things American. The visitor will have a better time if he talks and acts in such a manner as to make his listeners forget the fact that he comes from America. Unfortunately, there are some who act in the opposite manner, and seem unable to talk of anything but America, and they are delighted if some newspaper reporter wants to interview them.</p>
   <p>And, in conclusion, a word to the Swedes at home: Do not be surprised if the "uncle from America" acts somewhat strange. Maybe you would do the same if you finally managed to visit the land of your dreams after having spent years in a far-away country. You may be inclined to consider him more or less as a stranger, thought there is nothing he wants more than to be accepted as one of you. For Sweden is, and will always remain, his fatherland. Mutual understanding and consideration are needed. If the visitor and those he visits <pb facs="5423404_5_0221.jpg" n="4"/>will try to understand one another the visit and the association will be pleasant and fruitful for both parties, and will aid in strengthening the friendly ties between our two nations, bringing their people closer together. In that case the Swedish-American's journey becomes truly "a handshake across the ocean".</p>
