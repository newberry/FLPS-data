  <body>
   <p>Among the more prominent members of the Swedish-American Republican League of Illinois is John Kjellander of Chicago.</p>
   <p>He was born in the city of Kristianstad, Sweden, in 1863, and immigrated to America in 1885. His first stop was Paxton, Illinois, but after having graduated as a pharmacist he came to Chicago, and managed a drugstore in Lake View for five years. In 1893 he was appointed pharmacist at the state institution for the insane at Dunning. Later he served as chief clerk in the office of the state inspector of weights and measures. Two years ago he was appointed City Sealer for Chicago, and has handled this job better than any of his predecessors.</p>
   <p>We wish him continued success.</p>
