   <p>The Swedish-Americans are a strange tribe. Think how extraordinarily well they have succeeded here in America. Think, too, how poor the majority of them were when they came here.</p>
   <p>Have you, dear reader, seen the streams of immigrants during the fifties, sixties, and seventies? Those who were familiar with Castle Garden, and with the great railway stations in Chicago, St. Paul, and Minneapolis, could tell a lot about this matter.</p>
   <p>How often it happened that the immigrant had borrowed money for his steamship ticket, and on arrival did not possess more than fifty cents or a dollar in ready money. There he stood, with two empty hands, in a foreign country, the language of which he did not understand.</p>
   <p>The first months--yes, sometimes the first years--were troublesome enough.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0342.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later it became better. The borrowed ticket money was repaid. The rest of the family was sent for.</p>
   <p>What a day of joy when father, who had come here before, could receive wife and children and lead them to the little home he had made ready for them. That day such a family will never forget.</p>
   <p>Afterwards they kept on, worked, drudged, and saved, then worked, saved, and drudged a few years more.</p>
   <p>God blessed their work, and suddenly they had paid for the whole farm, or for the whole house in the city, and father and mother looked joyfully at each other, with a deep meaning in that look. They were now finally their own masters.</p>
   <p>Thereafter, the time came for many when farm was added to farm, and when <pb facs="5423404_5_0343.jpg" n="3"/>the first house in the city was followed by others. Success continued; he who had received little, soon received more. The Swedes in America have made, on the whole, a very good showing.</p>
   <p>They send millions of kroner home yearly to Sweden, to relatives and friends, as Christmas gifts, birthday presents, and direct help. They do this year after year, decade after decade, regardless of the fact that many of them were born here and have never seen Sweden, or their relatives there. In spite of this, Professor Waldenstrom and others have stated that we have forgotten Sweden and no longer think upon our ancestry, no longer are thankful for our origin. Each year, thousands of Swedes go home to Sweden on summer or jubilee visits. They never tire of these home-goings; they are always speaking of going "home to old Sweden". Altogether, the Swedish-Americans spend millions of kroner annually to see old Sweden once again, and each summer Sweden becomes richer, millions of kroner richer, because of these summer visits and the love of Sweden among Svea's children in <pb facs="5423404_5_0344.jpg" n="4"/>Uncle Sam's realm.</p>
   <p>I was led today into these thoughts by reason of three countrymen,who, each in his way, stimulated my thoughts.</p>
   <p>My thought first was concerned with the Swedish-American farmer, Ture Wohlfart, in Scandia, Kansas. I was his guest last Monday evening and night. Wohlfart came here poor, like other Swedes. Now he owns a thousand acres of land, and lives in a five-thousand-dollar home, built of cut stone, with a furnace, a piano, paintings, engravings, books,et cetera. He has the means to give his children a good rearing, to raise them to be their own masters and to enjoy life. In Arvika it would have been long before Ture Wohlfart owned a thousand acres of good land and such a home. But Wohlfart is Swedish-minded still, and can tolerate no one who disdains the Swedes.</p>
   <p>The second one I thought of was the banker, Abel Anderson, in Sioux City, <pb facs="5423404_5_0345.jpg" n="5"/>Iowa. Twenty years ago he came as a poor immigrant to Sioux City. He had to be content with the meanest kind of work at first, but he was sober, industrious, and loyal. Now he is the president of a large national bank, has a part in many other enterprises, and is recognized as one of Sioux City's most active and intelligent businessmen. In spite of this great success he is still Swedish, is the leading member in the Lutheran congregation, and in the Iowa Conference. Next Saturday he leaves with his family for-- what country do you think?--of course, old Sweden. This time it will not be by steerage, but with the cabin-passenger's every convenience, on board the splendid Saxonia.</p>
   <p>The third example I thought of was the Ph. D. and engineer, P. T. Berg, in Munhall, Pennsylvania. More than twenty years ago he came from Sweden, a well-reared but poor young man. Today, the countrys' foremost newspapers point him out as an example of how a young man in this country may become successful. Today the poor, unknown immigrant is the Carnegie[Steel] Company's highest-ranking mechanical engineer, has an elegant home, a fine <pb facs="5423404_5_0346.jpg" n="6"/>fortune, a splendid salary, and a large circle of friends. Yet, for all that he is still Swedish at heart. He will leave on July first for no other place than old Sweden, to visit there a few months. On the eve of his departure, he still thinks philanthropic thoughts about "the good Swedes" in America.</p>
