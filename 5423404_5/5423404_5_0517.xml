   <p>In a news item on another page of this issue, it is reported that the well-known building contractor, Axel W. Anderson, has bought a building lot at Elmdale and Greenview Avenues, and is going to erect a large apartment building containing sixty apartments. Because of its attractive location, the lot cost $75,000.</p>
   <p>We shall now give a few biographical data on this able countryman, who is among the most noted Swedish builders in Chicago. He was born in Svartorp parish, Smaland, Sweden, September 9, 1871, and thus is now in the prime of life. He came to America in the early nineties, and immediately upon his arrival here, went to work as a bricklayer. He continued in this trade until 1894, when he went into business for himself as a contractor. Three years later, his brother, Fred A. Anderson, joined him as a partner, and since then <pb facs="5423404_5_0518.jpg" n="2"/>they have been very active in the contracting and real-estate business here, and have earned a reputation for dependability and fair dealing.</p>
   <p>Anderson is devoted to missionary work, and earlier was a member of the Tabernakel Congregation on the South Side, in which he served as a deacon for seventeen years. At present, he belongs to the Mission Congregation in Edgewater, and is much interested in the activities of the Mission League. At one time he was one of the directors of its publishing business. He lives with his family at 1436 Elmdale Avenue.</p>
