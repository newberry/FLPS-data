   <p>At the meeting of the Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago held January 27 in the Society's new clubhouse at 503 Wrightwood Avenue, the new officers, who were elected last December, took office. Among them was the president, Axel A. Monson, head of the Universal Stamping and Manufacturing Company.</p>
   <p>Monson was born in Karlskoga, Varmland, Sweden on April 20, 1883, and is thus not yet forty years old. When he had finished his technical studies he went to work in the Bofors armament plant, where his father was among his immediate superiors. He subsequently became a technical expert on fortification projects on the east coast of Sweden, near Stockholm.</p>
   <p>In 1902, Monson decided to emigrate, and on August 25 of that year he <pb facs="5423404_5_0559.jpg" n="2"/>landed in Boston, Shortly afterwards, he moved to Chicago, and he has lived here ever since. He found employment in the tool department of the McCormick plant, and remained with that company for several years, during which time he rose rapidly, becoming foreman and, later, superintendent. Seven years ago, he resigned this post and organized the Universal Stamping and Manufacturing Company, of which he is both the president and the managing director.</p>
   <p>Monson joined the Swedish Engineering Society in 1915, and during 1921 he served on the so-called house committee. Last year, he was vice-president, and for the last few years he has been one of the Society's most active members.</p>
   <p>Besides the Engineering Society, Monson belongs to the following organizations: The Swedish Club, Medinah Temple, Myrtle Lodge No. 795 of the A. F. &amp; A. M., Theodosia Chapter No. 182, Irving Park Chapter No. 195, <pb facs="5423404_5_0560.jpg" n="3"/>Siloan Council No. 53, and St. Elmo Commandry No. 65. He is also a 32 degree Mason.</p>
   <p>In 1904, Monson married Anna Elizabeth Rydin, also of Karlskoga. They live at 4519 Virginia Avenue.</p>
