   <p>Even those who undertake the impractical and almost impossible task of making an American out of the newly arrived immigrant, will admit that it is to the advantage of both the immigrant and his new country that he preserve the best of his native qualities. By "American", as we have just used the word, we refer to a person who, so to speak, has been created artificially in the one-track minds of certain fanatics, whose ideas of the process of Americanization are rather narrow-minded. They demand that a newcomer automatically change his customs and manner of life as soon as he sets his foot on American soil, and that he immediately adopt the thoughts and habits which are ready-made for him. It is too bad if he is simple-minded enough to point out certain conditions in this country which might be improved. If he does, the most common retort is, "Well, if you don't like it here, why don't you pack up and go back where you came from?"</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0041.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To learn English is, of course, among the immigrant's first duties. But the foreign born themselves, and the nation as a whole, are the richer if they preserve the language and the best of the traditions which they brought with them from the old fatherland. The stimulating effect on our national life of this introduction of certain phases of older cultures are more far-reaching than many people realize. On the other hand, there are certain adjustments which are necessary for the immigrant to make, and the sooner he makes them the better. The ability to adapt himself to a new environment is one of the distinguishing marks of an intelligent individual. The old admonition "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", is still good advice; but it should not be followed to the extreme, or one's individuality is bound to suffer.</p>
   <p>In a recent article, Frances Kellar presents a picture of the average immigrant and his relationship to his own national group that is true to life, and we quote from it:</p>
   <p>"It is remarkable to what extent foreign-speaking organizations influence the <!-- 5423404_5_0041 omitted, duplicate of 5423404_5_0042 --> <pb facs="5423404_5_0043.jpg" n="3"/>life and, one might also say, the death of their nationals. The immigrant is met at Ellis Island by a missionary who talks his language and immediately becomes his friend. He goes to live in a neighborhood which has an old country' atmosphere, and becomes acquainted with a person of his own nationality who helps him get a job, and quite often the boss is also of his own nationality. In the little foreign colony he has access to news-papers printed in his own language and through them he finds his way to stores, banks, and institutions where his language is also spoken.</p>
   <p>"The immigrant is thus from the beginning in close touch with his own people. If he decides to return to the old country, his countrymen follow him to the train or to the pier, wishing him a happy journey in the language of his forefathers. If it is his fate to die in this country, the undertaker who embalms his body as well as the minister officiating at his funeral are of his own nationality. Countrymen follow him to his last resting place, and finally his surviving family receives a check from a sick benefit and funeral aid society, the membership of which consists exclusively of his own nationals."</p>
