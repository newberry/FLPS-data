   <p>Diamantina, Brazil has been visited by H. P. Anderson and Johan Sundt. Mr. Anderson was one of the earliest and most successful gold diggers in Nome, Alaska,...where he acquired great wealth. He is widely known as a capable and keen gold miner, and for this reason he was selected by the Brazil Diamond, Gold, and Developing Company to inspect the property owned by the Company in Diamantina with respect to finding of gold there. Mr. Sundt, who had obtained option on the land in question, accompanied Mr. Anderson on the trip...The two have now returned to Chicago. Mr. Sundt declared himself completely satisfied with the results of their investigations. Mr. Anderson said that the trip had been very interesting, and that he is much pleased with what he has seen. He added: "The Scandinavians obtained the best in Klondike and in Nome, and now it seems as if they are to get the best also in Diamantina."</p>
