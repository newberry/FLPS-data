   <p>Dr. Sven Hedin, the famous Swedish explorer, was feted by his countrymen in Chicago at a banquet given in his honor in the Gold Room of the Congress Hotel last Tuesday night.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements was headed by C. S. Peterson, who also served as master of ceremonies, discharging his task in the most skillful manner.</p>
   <p>When everybody was seated, the Swedish Glee Club sang "America" and "Sverige" (Sweden). All through the evening, between speeches, the singers rendered numerous other fine compositions. In passing, it should be noted that they seemed to be in exceptionally fine form that evening. They were complemented by the guest of honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peterson introduced the Swedish consul. Carl O. De Dardel, who welcomed the distinguished guest to Chicago, expressing the pleasure of all his <pb facs="5423404_5_0230.jpg" n="2"/>countrymen at having him here, and their hope that he would enjoy his stay in our city. The consuls of Norway and Denmark also spoke, expressing the high esteem in which the world-famous explorer is held by their respective peoples.</p>
   <p>They were followed by a number of representative Swedish-Americans, among whom were Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, Congressman Carl A. Chindblom, and Judge Harry Olson. The Judge expressed regret that Theodore Roosevelt was no longer living, for Roosevelt and Dr. Hedin would have had so much in common.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor then addressed the gathering, thanking them for the friendly reception which had been given him. He told of how happy he had been to see what Swedes had accomplished in America, and of his visit in Minnesota. He was especially impressed by what he saw in Minnesota because the country there reminded him so much of certain parts of Sweden. At the end of the speech he was given a hearty ovation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0231.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The banquet ended with the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner " by the Glee Club. It was a successful and dignified affair, worthy of the Swedish residents of Chicago and their distinguished guest.</p>
