   <p>Our fellow countryman, Attorney Edwin A. Olson, is a Republican candidate for prosecuting attorney in Circuit Court of Chicago. He has well earned his countrymen's trust, and we hope that he will be nominated. There follows a brief account of his life history. Edwin A. Olson was born on a farm near Cambridge, Illinois, on February 16, 1868. He graduated from elementary school and the Cambridge high school. He graduated from Elliott's Business College, of Burlington, Iowa. As soon as Mr. Olson came to Chicago, in 1890, he commenced studying law, and he began practicing in 1892. Since then he has progressed in his practice here.</p>
   <p>For several years Mr. Olson has been attorney for Scandia Life Insurance Company as well as for other large Companies. He has a splendid income from his practice and is highly regarded in the Chicago Bar Association. Mr. Olson is Republican and we all have hopes that he will be nominated to the important office he is seeking.</p>
