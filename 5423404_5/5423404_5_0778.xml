   <p>Today we will present a young surveyor who doesn't make much noise about himself but who, nevertheless, has reached the top in his profession.</p>
   <p>Mr. Norlin was born in Sodermanland, Sweden, March 4, 1865. After receiving his education in Sweden, he came to Chicago in 1881, where he began as a common laborer. After some time he got a position with Greeley Carlson and Company, one of the larger surveying firms in Chicago. So well did he do his job that he remained with the firm for more than eight years. Mr. Norlin helped in the plans of the town of Pullman and many other places. In 1894 he went into business for himself, opening his own office at 711 Chicago Opera House Block.</p>
   <p>In the course of his professional activities during the last few years, Mr. Norlin has surveyed Indiana Harbor, a fast-growing town, East Chicago, another suburb, has seen much of Mr. Norlin and his land-measuring instruments.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0779.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Norlin is a member of the Illinois Society of Civil Engineers and the Chicago Surveyors Club. Recently he was elected treasurer of the Scandinavian Engineers Club. He is a member of the Swedish Glee Club, Svithiod Singing Club, and Swedish Business Men's Club. In 1889 Mr. Norlin was married to Miss Dorothea Knast and is the happy father of two sturdy boys and one daughter.</p>
