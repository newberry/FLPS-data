  <body>
   <p>The City Engineer, John Ericson, has accepted a call from Sweden to be Building Chief in Stockholm with a salary of 20,000 Swedish Kronen ($5,000) a year. "What Chicago loses, Stockholm wins."</p>
   <p>Mr. Ericson was educated in Sweden, and in 1881 came to America, where he became a railroad and canal builder in 1882. Two years later, we find him in Chicago, working under the Creigier administration, but after some time, he was appointed assistant Chief Engineer to make investigations and plans for the new water-works in Seattle, Washington. Again he was re-appointed to affiliate with the city administration by Mayor Washburne as city engineer in 1895, working faithfully under four administrations, thereby honoring both himself and his countrymen.</p>
