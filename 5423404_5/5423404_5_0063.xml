  <body>
   <p>The United States' Congress has changed the immigration law which, of course, will affect all immigrants, even those who arrive here from Sweden.</p>
   <p>All immigrants must now be able to read their own language at least, except wives, widows, and young girls. Every immigrant must have at least five dollars cash in his or her possession, except those who come from Canada or Mexico. Doctors, nurses, and inspectors appointed by the United States Government, must be aboard every immigrant boat. Steamship companies that carry ineligible immigrants, will be fined two hundred dollars instead of one hundred dollars as before. If the companies try to land insane persons they will be fined and will be compelled to return them to their home countries. Persons who arrive here and are found guilty of immorality will be [deported]. Foreign seamen who have escaped from foreign countries will be arrested, tried and deported, and stowaways will also be deported.</p>
