   <p>At the luncheon of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce last week, the Chamber expressed itself relative to the tour of this country which has been arranged by Upsala students' chorus, "Orphei Drangars" ("The Followers of Orpheus"). An overture was made that such a tour might be realized, and as to the best time, the Chamber recommended the spring of 1921.</p>
   <p>Per Hugo, B. A., who is in this country in the interests of this chorus, made it known at this time that a workers' chorus of one hundred voices had also strongly considered making a trip over here for a concert tour. He requested that the Chamber should express its views on the prospects of the success of such a chorus in this country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0244.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Chamber decided that it wished first to see how the enterprise of the Orphei Drangars would succeed before making any further recommendations.</p>
   <p>The director of the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Denver, Dr. C. G. Nelson, who was a guest at the meeting, gave a short discourse about the sanatorium at the invitation of the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Doctor Nelson took the opportunity to appeal to those present for donations to the hospital, and as a result Mr. Max Hedman forthwith wrote a check for $500, which was handed to the doctor, who also received many promises of further contributions.</p>
