   <p>There seems to be some worries in our dear home country at present, not so much concerning the bad times, but in regard to the expected emigration from the United States of Swedes going back to their old country, which the authorities there think is coming. The newspapers in Sweden are writing about this matter almost every day. The Secretaries of State and Interior have been interviewed, explaining that this matter is under consideration and observation by the Swedish Cabinet. There is talk of building new railroads and of dividing large estates in various counties into "own homes" in order to accommodate the expected immigrants. But we do not think that there will be any danger for Sweden with this expected movement. Those Swedish-Americans who are now visiting Sweden, are settled here for good and do not intend to stay in the old country. It might be possible that they will do so if the bad times here are going to be worse <pb facs="5423404_5_0099.jpg" n="2"/>and if at the same time, better opportunities for work and good wages occur in Sweden. But this is out of the question. We rather suppose that conditions in America will soon turn for the better before the European countries will recover from the crisis spread all over the world at present.</p>
