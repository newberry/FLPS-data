   <p>Dr. William Henschen, one of the most widely known leaders of the Swedish Methodist Church circles of the Middle-West and West, passed away last Monday at his home, 5014 N. Paulina Street.</p>
   <p>He was born in Uppsala, Sweden, April 115h, 1842, and graduated from the university there, later receiving the degree of D. Ph., and still later studying medicine and natural science at the University of Berlin, Germany. For some years he devoted his time to teaching and in 1870 he imigrated to America.</p>
   <p>Since coming here, he has edited several weekly Swedish papers and Church publications, besides being a teacher at Methodist colleges and the Pastor of congregations. The greater portion of his time was spent in Chicago and Evanston.</p>
   <p>He is survived by six children, one of whom Henry S. Henschen is the President of the Union Bank of Chicago.</p>
