   <p>A well known Swedish-American in Chicago, P. A. Sundelius, died yesterday, at fifty-six years of age. He was born in Uddevalla, Sweden, where he received his education, but went abroad when he was twenty-four. He arrived in America in 1864 and was enrolled in the Union Army. Sundelius was wounded in Petersburg, Fla. and was bedridden for one and one-half years. He recovered and came to Chicago in the fall of 1866, where he became a teacher. He attended Augustana College, Paxton, Ill., later on, but became a newspaperman in 1869. Sundelius was appointed to a position in the Customs House in Chicago in 1873 and later on in the Recorders Office, which position he held until his death.</p>
   <p>Sundelius became interested in politics and was three times elected on the Republican ticket to the Legislature of the State of Illinois. He once more became a newspaperman in 1884. He is survived by his wife and two sons.</p>
