   <p>p.11.....Our countryman, Robert Sundeen, who was especially well-known in Swedish organizations, died at his home on the sixteenth of March from "galloping" tuberculosis. He was a native of Stockholm and came to America seventeen years ago. He was thirty-three years old at the time of his death. He was a member of Three Links Lodge, I.O.O.F. and Frithiof Lodge, No. 6, I.O.V., where he was also secretary. He was in addition, Secretary of the lodge newspaper Vikingen (The Viking), and a member of the Editorial Committee.</p>
   <p>He is mourned by his wife and two children and a brother in Sweden. The funeral was held last Wednesday and services were held by Pastor Herman Lindskog.</p>
