<title level="a">WHO OUGHT TO EMIGRATE?</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>EDITORIAL: This question has been the object of discussion both in America and in Sweden, where the newspapers have been very outspoken in the matter. We in America have had very little to say: we have defended emigration generally and taken a nationalistic point of view whenever an American has-been critised concerning the matter.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Tribune has upheld this point of view to the best of its ability and defended the cause of emigration against its enemies in the old country. However, the best judges of the whole matter are those who are familiar with life in both Sweden and America.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if we should state our opinion regarding: "Who ought to emigrate," it would be thus:</p>
   <p>America is a splendid land, but that does not mean that everybody ought to come here; not even all poor people, who through hard work make their <pb facs="5423404_5_0176.jpg" n="2"/>living in this world, either as mechanics or farmers." When the question of emigration comes up, we ought to view it from three angles: Age, profession and prospects. We believe in general, that a person who is middle-aged should not come here, unless he finds it entirely impossible to make a living in his native country.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, it is our opinion, that the Swedish man who owes and cultivates enough fertile land to earn his living, even if it causes sweat and hard work, ought not to leave it to seek a better living here. The same is true of the industrial worker. Finally, nobody who has a good living in his own country ought to leave a place where he is firmly and deeply routed because he thinks he can accumulate more wealth here than in Sweden; for there peace is more valuable than so much wealth. Easily won wealth is not always worth its weight in gold. It is better to feel completely at home on a small plot than to feel like a stranger and to be homesick and worried on a 160 acre farm in the American West. There is more joy in living on the soil of your own little farm than achieving great wealth and owning a luxurious home in America, where one feels like a stranger.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0177.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is a fact that most middle-aged immigrants never really feel at home here. Is it not then better that they stay where they are, if they don't suffer real need or have grown sons and daughters in America upon whom they can depend.</p>
   <p>But young men,who will,and can work and can grasp the new ideas of life in the New World, have nothing to lose and everything to gain in coming to America. Nevertheless this class Sweden advises to keep within her own portals. No other country can offer the strong young farmer or mechanic, who has nothing but his working ability such splendid opportunities as America. A Swedish farm hand can never gain as much as one acre good soil with his work but he can own his own farm in a few years in America.</p>
   <p>There are very few hired mechanics in Sweden who can build their own little home and make it comfortable; but in America every skilful and regular worker can save his wages in a. short time, live under his own roof; in short, America is <pb facs="5423404_5_0178.jpg" n="4"/>a splendid land for young and strong men and women, who cannot secure a livelihood very easily in their native country because it is an excellent and open field where their own straight, virtue and merit takes the first prize.</p>
