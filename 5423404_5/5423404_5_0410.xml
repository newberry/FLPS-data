  <body>
   <p>Professor Algoth Ohlson, rector of North Park College, observed his fiftieth birthday last Sunday, July 20.</p>
   <p>Ohlson is a native of Hvena, Kalmar County, Sweden, and came to America at the age of twenty. After having stopped in Peoria, Illinois, for some time, he went to Bloomington, where he joined the local Swedish Mission Congregation. In 1901, we find him in Chicago, and a couple of years later he entered Valparaiso College, in Indiana. Having finished his course there he went to the Chicago Theological Seminary, from which he was graduated in 1907. Shortly afterwards he took over the Swedish Mission Congregation in Danbury, Connecticut, where he remained until 1910, when he was called to the Mission Church of Bridgeport, in the same state. He served that congregation until 1913.</p>
   <p>During his sojourn in the East, Ohlson energetically pursued studies at Yale and <pb facs="5423404_5_0411.jpg" n="2"/>Harvard Universities, and received his degree from the Yale Divinity College in 1915.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago in 1916, as pastor of the Swedish Mission Congregation in Austin, and in 1924, he took the post as rector of North Park College.</p>
   <p>In 1911, he married Ruth E. Carlson, a native of Washington, Connecticut.</p>
