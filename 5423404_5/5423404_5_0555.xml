   <p>Editor Aron Edstrom, Nestor of Swedish-American newspapermen died last Friday, February 2, at his home in this city, at the age of seventy-six. His health had been declining for some time, and Friday morning he was found dead in bed.</p>
   <p>Edstrom was born in Edstorp, in the province of Dalsland, Sweden, on January 6, 1847. As a boy he showed an unusual interest in books and in learning. Through self-study he learned English and German, and by the time he was fifteen he had advanced so far in mathematics that his teacher was unable to follow him. However, circumstances did not permit further formal schooling, and at the age of sixteen he went to work in a lumbermill.</p>
   <p>In 1869, Edstrom came to America, and settled near Marine, Minnesota, where <pb facs="5423404_5_0556.jpg" n="2"/>he had some relatives. For three years, he worked hard on jobs in lumbermills, railroad construction gangs, etc. He finally decided to try farming, and took a homestead in Polk County, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>In August, 1872, he had an accident causing the loss of his left hand while working in a sawmill. This marked a turning point in his life. His old desire to study was still strong within him, and he entered St. Ansgar Academy at Carver, Minnesota, the forerunner of the present Gustavas Adolphus College in St. Peter. In 1875, he was admitted to the freshmen class of Augustana College in Rock Island, and he graduated from that school in 1879. The following year, he got on the staff of the Skaffaren in St. Paul, which is now being published under the name the Minnesota Stats Tidning. Eventually, he became its editor.</p>
   <p>In 1883 he became associate editor of Hemlandet, of Chicago, and, except for <pb facs="5423404_5_0557.jpg" n="3"/>a short period in 1890 when he was editor of Nordens Medborgare of Manistee, Michigan, he was on the editorial staff of Hemlandet until that paper was consolidated with Svenska Amerikanaren.</p>
   <p>In 1882, Edstrom married Anna C. Greek of Trade Lake, Wisconsin, who died in 1898. They had seven children.</p>
   <p>During his more than thirty years as a newspaperman, routine work consumed most of Edstrom's time. But he did find time to write numerous sketches and short stories, which were published in Hemlandet and in Prarieblomman.</p>
   <p>He was a religious man, good-humored and tolerant. All who came to know him well are certain to remember him as a faithful friend and a good man.</p>
