   <p>As reported in a previous issue, Joshua Oden, pastor of the Irving Park Swedish Lutheran congregation, will shortly start on a trip to the Holy Land and a number of European countries. His itinerary also includes old Sweden, a country which the pastor has not yet seen. Carl Christenson, pastor of the Saron Swedish Lutheran Church, will be his traveling companion. They are planning to leave Chicago early in February.</p>
   <p>Oden belongs to the younger generation of pastors within the Augustana Synod. He is full of energy and enthusiasm for his chosen profession, is very active in all phases of religious work, and takes a healthy interest in activities outside of the church. He possesses a mature judgment and a clear understanding of the problems of our day, and one may be sure that he will return from this <pb facs="5423404_5_0595.jpg" n="2"/>long trip with many interesting observations and impressions that will be of future benefit both to himself and to his colleagues and co-workers.</p>
   <p>He was born in Muskegon, Michigan, June 19, 1880, the son of Dr. M. P. Oden, who died last August, after having served as pastor in the Augustana Synod for forty-two years. Young Oden graduated from Bethania College in 1902, and continued his studies at that institution for some time, taking special courses in the normal college and business school.</p>
   <p>In 1904-05, he served as superintendent of the public schools of Wausa, Nebraska, but he left that post to enter the Lutheran Theological Seminary here in Chicago, from which he later transferred to the Theological Seminary of the Augustana Synod in Rock Island. He graduated in 1908, and was ordained as a pastor that same year at the Synod's annual convention. Shortly afterwards, he took over the duties as pastor of the Irving Park Swedish Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>Pastor Oden has for several years been president of the Augustana League of <pb facs="5423404_5_0596.jpg" n="3"/>Chicago, as well as treasurer and member of the Board of the Chicago Lutheran Home Mission Society. During the last few years he has also been president both of the Swedish Lutheran Pastors' Association and of the Luther League of the Illinois Conference. He is now on the Board of Directors of the Lutheran Bible School, and last year he served as president of the Lutheran Ministers' Association of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1909, he married Helga Soderberg, of Ludington, Michigan. They have one boy, Joshua Oden, Jr.</p>
