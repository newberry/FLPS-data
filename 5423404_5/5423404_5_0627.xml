<title level="a">MRS. OTHELIA MYHRMAN DECORATED BY KING GUSTAF</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday afternoon a pleasant happening occurred to our highly esteemed Mrs. Othelia Myhrman. S. T. De Goes, consul general, invited her to come to his home on Saturday afternoon at 3 P. M. Thinking that the consul general wished to take counsel with her about an important matter in which she was well versed, Mrs. Myhrman accepted the invitation, and promised to come on time. Arriving at the specified time, Mrs. Myhrman found the house filled with gentlemen in formal dress. Rather surprised to find that she was the only woman present, she sat down at the table and partook of the delicacies offered. While coffee was served, the host informed the guests, to their surprise, that Mrs. Myhrman had been granted the Gold Court Medal of the Eighth Degree by King Gustaf. After a few words, the consul general presented this award, together with the official letter, to the astonished Mrs. Myhrman. Deeply moved, she thanked him for the honor which had been bestowed on her.</p>
   <p>The letter from the King reads as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0628.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"His Majesty, the King, in His Grace is pleased to confer upon Mrs. Othelia Myhrman the Gold Medal of the Eighth Degree, bearing the Royal Crown, to be worn on a deep blue band upon the chest. This, may I, in gracious command, hereby communicate.</p>
   <p>"Stockholm Castle, October 1, 1919.</p>
   <p>(Signed) "Otto Printzskold."</p>
   <p>The medal is the size of one crown, with the bust of the King on the obverse. The only inscription appearing on the reverse side is: "Othelia Myhrman". We have been informed by Consul General De Goes that, at first, it was the intention [of the King] to grant to Mrs. Myhrman the large labor medal, "Illis, quorum mervere labores". But when this question came up, King Gustaf was forced to take cognizance of the fact that this medal could not be granted to a foreigner. <pb facs="5423404_5_0629.jpg" n="3"/>Because Mrs. Myhrman lived in America it was impossible to award this medal to her, although she is much more Swedish-minded than many native Swedish patriots. As far as we know, Mrs. Myhrman is the only person in America who has been granted this medal, sharing this honor with nobody in the United States.</p>
   <p>The reason why Mrs. Myhrman was decorated in this manner is quite obvious. Her brilliant work among the Swedes in Chicago during the past thirty years, and her extensive relief work during this same period are sufficient reasons why the sun of grace has spread its bright ray from Sweden in this direction. One thing is certain: Mrs. Myhrman has honestly earned the distinction bestowed upon her.</p>
   <p>The Sevenska Kuriren takes this opportunity to offer its very best wishes to Mrs. Myhrman.</p>
