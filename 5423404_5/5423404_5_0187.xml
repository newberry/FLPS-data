   <p>EDITORIAL: Swedes are worried about the enormous emigration from Sweden to America. The latest Swedish papers tell us that the King himself has taken a hand in the matter. He has called his Governorstogether for the purpose of concerning the matter. Each Governor has called prominent men into conference in his state to discuss the best way of managing the emigration of so many young Swedish working men.</p>
   <p>At a farmers meeting in Vexio, Smaland, Sweden, a speaker mentioned the emigration question and said frankly that it is very easy to acquire land in America. This is reason enough for poor farm workers to emigrate. Another speaker said that it is every person's right and duty to go where there are better opportunities to make a good living. The emigration would decrease if wealthy land owners would let people rent land cheap and for a long period. Other speakers said that the free tickets sent home to relatives and friends encouraged the emigration; that political <pb facs="5423404_5_0188.jpg" n="2"/>reasons were connected with the emigration, that the taxes were too high and that small farmers and farm hands should be given better opportunities. The Governor then spoke. "If the strong young men really knew the conditions in America, the emigration would not be so lively," he said.</p>
   <p>It should be very gratifying to know what the Governor really meant by this statement. "The real conditions," Yes, if Sweden knew about them the emigration would increase much more and to such dimensions that the King would be forced to call together his Parliament in extra session.</p>
   <p>The Swedes in America are, with a few exceptions, really happy when they compare their present situation with the one they had in their native country.</p>
   <p>The statistics in Sweden show that the people who emigrate are farm-hands and servants, young men and women. How much is the wage of a common Swedish farm-hand? Perhaps 150 Swedish knonen a year. Here he has $300.00 a year. And a maid in Sweden? Maybe 60 to 75 Swedish kronen a year and here $150.00 to $200.00 or more. The same proportions exist between the Swedish and the American worker.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0189.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The farmers make up 1/5 of the emigrants. How do they fare? Ask to see the history of the states of Illinois, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa. Swedes, who came here with two empty hands twenty years ago are now owners of prospering farms of 200, 300, 400, 500 and in some cases up to 1,000 acres. The Swedes possess in the State of Illinois 400,000 acres at least.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen are now very well acquainted with these conditions, and the knowledge of it is one of the causes for the emigration.</p>
   <p>There are also other reasons. The Nordic masses are now aroused by the knowledge of their own power and value. They feel the need of more air and light. The tunes of the American liberty song have been heard in old Sweden touching the hearts of many, who only have been listening to mystical Swedish Folk songs and the Swedish hero poems.</p>
   <p>The emigration can not be regulated with wrong pictures of America. It can only be stopped by modern reforms in Sweden, political, as well as social reforms, which can ease the people's burden, ease the caste situation, caused by extreme wealth and poverty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0190.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the meeting mentioned in this editorial, it was suggested to set up some competition with America. However, competition between the big and wealthy America and the comparatively poor Sweden is inconceivable.</p>
   <p>But Sweden can and ought to be just as good as America in one way and that is in the field of liberty, and healthy, political reforms.</p>
