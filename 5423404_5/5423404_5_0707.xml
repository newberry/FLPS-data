   <p>Olof Leopold Svenson, a countryman well known in Chicago newspaper circles and also among the singing fraternity here, died last Tuesday in Rockford, Illinois from a kidney and liver ailment. His health had been declining for some time, but his sudden death was unexpected.</p>
   <p>Svenson was born in Malilla, Smaland province, Sweden, April 30, 1861. He graduated from the Lund Cathedral School and attended the Technical Institute of Stockholm before coming to America.</p>
   <p>He worked first for the Central Furniture Company of Rockford, and in 1882 he became manager of the American Express Company's branch in that city.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1888 he came to Chicago and was employed by the Boysen Land Company for a couple of years. Later he became advertising manager successively of Svenska Tribunen, Svenska Kuriren, and Humoristen, and was also associated</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0708.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>with the Swedish Importing Company from 1903 to 1905. He then moved to Milwaukee, where he lived until last fall, when he returned to Rockford to collaborate with Frank Westfelt in publishing the book, Svenskarne I Rockford (The Swedes in Rockford).</p>
   <p>Svenson was an enthusiastic singer and possessed an excellent tenor voice. In 1891 he was elected president of the Scandinavian Singers' League, and consequently became one of the founders of the Swedish Singers' League of America. He also served as president of the Swedish Glee Club.</p>
   <p>He is survived by his wife, who was Miss Lillian Fenning, and a thirteen-year-old daughter.</p>
