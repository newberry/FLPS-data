   <p>Mr. Bendix was born in Moline, Ill., in 1881, but received his education in Chicago; where his
    father, John Bendix, was a Swedish methodist pastor. Later he studied law and mechanical
    engineering, only soon to give up his law studies in order to devote all his time to technology.
    As time went on he specialized in the construction of automobiles and motors, and in that way he
    developed an interest which was to become of such magnitude that he not only founded a motor
    industry but is ranked as an outstanding industrialist.</p>
   <p>His greatest contribution to the auto-motive industry is the invention of the Bendix drive or,
    as it is most commonly called, the "Bendix self-starter." The mechanism is a standard equipment
    on all automobiles today. Four-wheel brakes is another of Mr. Bendix's inventions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0421.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Bendix is the president of a number of large business organizations, among others the
    Bendix Corporation, the Bendix Brake Company, Germandt Motor Corporation, Motor Industries,
    Inc., and the Bendix Aviation Corporation.</p>
   <p>At the present time Mr. Bendix is on the high seas abroad the S/S Majestic enroute to Sweden,
    where he will be received by the Swedish monarch.</p>
