   <p>This institution, which has been mentioned in previous issues, and which is located at 1346 North La Salle Street, was officially opened last Friday with a festive ceremony that was attended by many church and religious leaders within Swedish-American circles in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this undertaking is to provide a good home for unattached Scandinavians who come as strangers to the big city, and fine facilities for such a haven have been provided. The building contains a large dining room, sitting room, library and airy bedrooms, all homelike and nicely furnished.</p>
   <p>The Home,which is now ready to receive guests, reflects credit on the Swedish congregations and their leaders who have made it possible. Reverend V. Tengwald, who has been in charge of the work thus far, will also be superintendent of the home.</p>
