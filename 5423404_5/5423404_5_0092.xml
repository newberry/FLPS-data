   <p>The National Society in Sweden has published a proclamation to "Swedish Americans visiting Sweden" that they ought to consider the possibility of residing permanently in Sweden before they re-enter America. In the proclamation published by the Swedish press, it is stated that Sweden is not the same now as it was when the emigrant left his country many years ago. Sweden has grown considerably in regard to financial strength during the last ten to fifteen years, and the conditions for the working class have been improved considerably. The wages have increased, and are now just as good as in America.</p>
   <p>The Society will now advise persons how to win a good living in Sweden, <pb facs="5423404_5_0093.jpg" n="2"/>both for skillful workers in different branches, and for those who would like to own farms,located in various places in Sweden, and also to assist when help is needed to buy or to rent farms, or to get home-owners loans from the Government. Several Swedish-Americans have settled in Sweden during the last years.</p>
   <p>It seems to us, says the editor of Svenska Kuriren, that this proclamation is aimed not only for these visiting Swedish-Americans, but also for those who intend to visit Sweden, and for those who do not know about the good opportunities Sweden now offers them. That is why Svenska Kuriren re-prints the proclamation for its Swedish readers in America. Another article has been published in Swedish papers under the headline: "The Truth about America." It is a correspondent from America who writes to the Society. He says that the Swedish-Americans are attempting to persuade their relatives to come over to America by boasting about that country, and by sending over prepaid steamship tickets, that works up an "American fever." But this ticket has to be paid many times over <pb facs="5423404_5_0094.jpg" n="3"/>by hard work on the farm, or in the factory. Those who have won success in the United States like to boast about it, and others who are suffering, or can hardly and barely exist are playing the same melody, which seems very peculiar. The reason for this lays in false pride.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Kuriren is of the opinion that it is a real false pride if many Swedes here are suffering in secret rather than write home for money. The hardship helping them to go through their hard times, and thus to help them to better conditions. The question is are there really better times in Sweden now? There is some talk about a general strike in Sweden. We would advise that the truth should be told in regard to America and Sweden.</p>
