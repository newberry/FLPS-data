<title level="a">CANDIDATE FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Carl R. Chindblom is a candidate for county commissioner on the Republican ticket. He was elected to the County Board two years ago, and has taken an active part in all the Commission's undertakings. During his term, the new County Building has been finished and is now occupied at Clark and Washington Streets. The building for the Juvenile Court has been conducted like a well ordered home where Juveniles are kept until they are tried and their future decided. The Honorable C. R. Chindblom is chairman of the committee in charge of the management of the Juvenile Home. He has been chairman on the Law Enforcement committee; also the City Relations Committee. Besides these, he has been chairman of various committees of importance, such as the finance, judiciary, and the Dunning Institution. He was a member of the special committee that supervised the erection of the new Poorhouse, built near Blue Island Illinois. At the spring election, the County Board was given the right <pb facs="5423404_5_0750.jpg" n="2"/>to sell bonds to the amount of two million dollars to construct new buildings to house the poor, tuberculosis and other sick persons. It is, therefore, important that as many as possible of the present commissioners be re-elected so that they may complete the work they have started so well.</p>
   <p>Carl R. Chindblom was born in Chicago, November 21, 1870. He graduated from the public schools, and took courses in the Swedish language. He went to Augustana College in 1884, and was graduated in 1890. He then became a professor at Martin Luther College in Chicago. In January 1897, he entered Kent Law College, completing the course in two years, and was admitted to the bar. The Honorable Chindblom is a splendid speaker, both in the Swedish and English language. He has been the speaker at many Chicago affairs and has made himself popular. In the fall of 1894, the Republican State committee of Michigan invited him to give a series of lectures on the party principles. On this tour <pb facs="5423404_5_0751.jpg" n="3"/>he made such a splendid impression upon his audiences that the Illinois National Committee engaged him as speaker during the spirited campaigns of 1896-1898- and 1900.</p>
   <p>In 1903, he was elected president of the Swedish-American Republican League of Illinois. Besides these he has held other positions of trust, as well as in church affairs. He has been a member of the board of directors of Augustana College, and a member of a special committee that organized the Scandia Life Insurance Company. In the spring of 1906, he was appointed State's attorney by Governor Deneen. During this season, he was elected as member of the County Board.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Chindblom has just recently married. On April 27, 1907, he married Miss Christina M. Nilsson, daughter of Dr. Hjalmar Nilsson of Minneapolis.</p>
