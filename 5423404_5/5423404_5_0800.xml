   <p>p.11......Last week the case against A.M.Unger, M.D., F. Wayland Brown, and Frank Smiley was taken up in Judge Tuley's court. They are defendants in assurance swindles, on a larger scale. The accused are said to have been in conspiracy with Marie D. Efenbach, deceased, and together with her had made plans to swindle various life assurance companies, in which the young woman had taken out life insurance. The conspirators' agreement is said to have been that the woman was to be pronounced dead, and the assurance money collected by the partners in crime. In the meantime, she died in reality, and it is still a mystery whether she was given the wrong medicine by mistake or if murder was involved.</p>
   <p>Smiley has made a complete confession and will be called as a witness against his former brothers in crime, who declare themselves not guilty. As prosecut for the people, States Attorney, Harry Olson,is in charge and he conducts <pb facs="5423404_5_0801.jpg" n="2"/>himself as a real man. The questioning takes place daily and some disposition in the case is expected before the end of the week.</p>
