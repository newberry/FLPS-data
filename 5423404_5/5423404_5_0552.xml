   <p>As the subject of this week's Foreground article we have selected a man whose name is well known to thousands of our countrymen throughout America, especially here in Chicago. For many years he has played an important role in the activities of Swedish organizations in this city. His name is Carl Festin, former Grand Master of the Vasa Order, the largest Swedish-American sick benefit and burial association.</p>
   <p>He was born in Jamtland, Sweden, on June 14, 1870. After having completed the general public school course, he began to learn the painter's trade; he finished his apprenticeship at the early age of eighteen. In 1889, he went to Stockholm, where he attended a technical school for three years. Soon thereafter, in 1893, he decided to go to America. He came to Chicago, where he <pb facs="5423404_5_0553.jpg" n="2"/>has made his home ever since.</p>
   <p>Festin began work in Chicago as a wagon painter and later became a sign painter. In the spring of 1894, he obtained employment as a card writer in the men's furnishings store of A. F. Erickson, where he remained until 1902, when he opened his own men's furnishing store. He continued in this business until 1904, when he was made manager of the real-estate department of the Cottage Grove Bank. The following year he established himself as a real-estate broker, with offices at 610 East 75th Street. He is still there, and during the years has seen his business steadily expand.</p>
   <p>For many years, Festin was an active member of the Svithiod Singing Club, and he was among the first members of the Salem Swedish-Lutheran Church, the oldest Swedish congregation on the South Side.</p>
   <p>He joined the Vasa Order when the Framat Lodge, No. 133, was organized, of which he became the first president. Since then he has held various offices <pb facs="5423404_5_0554.jpg" n="3"/>within the lodge, and is at present its treasurer. He has also been a member of the Illinois District Lodge, No. 8 since its inception, serving as district treasurer for four years, and as district master for three years. In the latter capacity he organized fourteen local lodges within the district. At the Grand Lodge Convention of the Vasa Order, held in Brooklyn in 1917, he was named Grand Master and served in that capacity until 1919, when the convention was held here in Chicago. At present, he is a member of the Order's executive council.</p>
   <p>Festin is also a Free Mason. His political affiliations are Republican. Swedish culture and traditions are close to his heart, and his pleasant and helpful disposition makes him well liked by all his associates.</p>
