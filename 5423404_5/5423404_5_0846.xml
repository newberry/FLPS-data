   <p>Psychology is a ticklish science, and those who are deeply engrossed in the study of it may expect to meet with adventure. Such has been the experience of Professor Luther E. Widen, psychologist of Swedish ancestry, formerly of Iowa State University, and selected as a member of the North Pole expedition, planned by Vilhjalmur Stefanson, for the purpose of studying the life of the Eskimo tribes of the far north.</p>
   <p>In order to gain deeper insight into the peculiarities of the human mind, Professor Widen has, at times, permitted himself to be interned in various asylums for brief periods, under assumed name. Last Tuesday he went to the Psychopatic Hospital as a place offering a wide field for the study of man's folly from whatever angle studied. While studying the behavior of a certain patient, he was arrested at the request of a woman, L. Wetlamson, connected with the Chicago Society for Mental Hygiene. Professor Widen, by the way, has been doing psychological studies for this society. The lady insisted that Professor Widen was unbalanced and needed treatment. Upon this Professor Widen was put into a padded cell and denied any communication with the outside world, <pb facs="5423404_5_0847.jpg" n="2"/>in spite of his claims that he was as fully a rational person as any in the hospital, with the possible exception of certain patients. In some manner, not reported, he got in touch with a friend, and this friend applied to the appropriate court for habeas corpus, and Professor Widen has hope of gaining an early release. He is attributing his troubles to enmity against him by certain members of the Society of Mental Hygiene, among them the lady who caused his arrest.</p>
