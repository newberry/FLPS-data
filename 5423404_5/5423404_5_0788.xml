   <p>The Rev. Gustaf Unonius, one of the most prominent pioneers in the Swedish-American church field, died in Sweden. Oct. 14, at the age ninety-two. He was educated in Sweden, where he studied both law and medicine. He immigrated to America in 1841, and settled as a farmer in Wisconsin. Later on he entered Nashotah Seminary, where he was graduated and ordained priest in the Epicopal Church in 1848. He founded the St. Ansgarius Swedish Episcopal Church of Chicago in 1849, and functioned as its Rector until 1858, when he went back to Sweden. A service in his memory will be held this coming Sunday, All Saints Day, 8 P.M. at St. Ansgarius Church, Sedgwick Street; the Rev. Herman Lindskog, Rector of the church, officiating.</p>
