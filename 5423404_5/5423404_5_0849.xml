   <p>A group of enterprising Scandinavians have gained possession of an extensive diamond field in Brazil. "The Brazilian Diamond, Gold, and Development Company" is the name of the company which owns the diamond field. It is organized in Chicago, and incorporated in South Dakota. The majority of the members of the company are Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The undertaking was started in the following manner: About a year ago, Chicago was visited by a Norwegian-American, John Sundt, who had spent nearly fifteen years in South Africa where he held a position in connection with diamond mining for a while, and also was employed as a railroad contractor. When the War was declared, he was suspected by the British of being a spy for the Boers and was arrested in Durban. He was kept imprisoned for more than one year, and during this period suffered heavy losses. After being released, he demanded compensation, but he had lost his American <pb facs="5423404_5_0850.jpg" n="2"/>citizenship papers, and therefore, came to this country to obtain a copy. On this trip he stopped in Chicago, and later, after his arrival in Washington, D. C., received from the English Ambassador a part of the damage amount he had claimed. Before leaving Chicago, he had revealed his intention to go to Diamantina, Brazil, to look for diamonds and gold. He also spoke to some Norwegians that in the event he made worth-while finds, he would give Scandinavians the first chance to participate, and that he intended to return to Chicago to organize a company here. After his arrival at Diamantina, he wrote a letter to the newspaper, Skandinaven, which created interest in wide circles. Last Fall, he returned to Chicago, bringing with him a large number of samples of diamonds, gold, and other minerals, and also contracts for four options on diamond fields, aggregating about 400,000 acres, in the district of Diamantina, and the state Minas Geraes. The matter caused considerable interest, and some of those interested decided to investigate Mr. Sundt's claims, getting in touch with the authorities in Diamantina by means of letters and telegrams. ....The information received from the authorities was fully satisfactory, and on the basis of this it was decided to organize a company with a capital <pb facs="5423404_5_0851.jpg" n="3"/>of $3,000,000 under the laws of South Dakota, for the taking over and developing the mining field in question.</p>
   <p>The directorate of the Company consists of the following: Nicoloy Grevstad, president; Anton Peterson, vice-president; Nils F. Olson, treasurer; Olaf E. Ray, secretary; all of Chicago. Other directors are: Hon. O. C. Berg, Secretary of State, South Dakota; Hon E. N. Graves, Assistant Secretary of State, South Dakota; E. R. Berg, Spink Company, South Dakota; Safus J. Christensen, Chicago; Hans Finstad, Chicago.</p>
