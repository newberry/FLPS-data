   <p>John A. Kohler, one of the Swedes who arrived in Chicago before the Great Fire, died last Sunday after a brief illness. He was eighty-one years old.</p>
   <p>Kohler was born near Norrkoping, January 15, 1844. As a young man, he attended the technical school in his home city, and the education he thus obtained became of great value to him when he landed in America in 1865. After remaining for some time in Philadelphia and in New York, he set out for Chicago in 1869.</p>
   <p>Shortly after his arrival here, he began to interest himself in politics and soon became very active in that field. He served for some time as president of the Scandinavian Club in the old Town of Lake and also as secretary of the Swedish-American Central Republican Club of Chicago. He was one of the directors of the <pb facs="5423404_5_0491.jpg" n="2"/>Linne Monument Association, and took an active part in the campaign for funds which made it possible to place the Linne monument in Lincoln Park. In 1887, he helped organize the Linnea Society, and became its first president.</p>
   <p>For some time, Kohler was the secretary of the Parkside Loan and Savings Bank, which was founded in 1885 and dissolved a few years ago, For a number of years, he engaged in the real-estate and insurance business, maintaining offices at 5205 Wentworth Avenue. He retired only a short time ago.</p>
   <p>Realizing that a knowledge of law would be very useful for a man in his line of business, Kohler entered the Chicago College of Law, and graduated from that institution in 1899.</p>
   <p>He is survived by a son, Dr. Ernest A. Kohler, 108 East Garfield Boulevard.</p>
