   <p>The Pressed Steel Car Company, whose enormous shops for the building of steel cars are located chiefly at McKee's Rocks, Pittsburg, Pa., and at Woods' Run, Allegheny, Pa., wishes to recruit its force of workers from the hosts of sober, law-abiding Swedish workers. About one thousand workers are required.</p>
   <p>Swedish foremen are ready to instruct their compatriots. Men with families are preferred, and these may find lodging in the houses erected by the company, if they desire. There is not now, and there has not been a strike at the plants. Steady work and good pay are promised. The chief engineer of the Company is Swedish, and it is at his initiative that the Company has decided to replace its present Hungarian working force with Swedes.</p>
