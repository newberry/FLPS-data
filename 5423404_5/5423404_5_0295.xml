   <p>The services in memory of King Oscar the Second's death were wonderfully carried cut. The churches were draped in black and several ministers officiated in various churches. Particularly impressive ceremonies were carried out in the following churches: Immanuel Church, Gethsema, Salem, and Saron; in the last named Dr. M. C. Ranseen, Dr. A. P. Fors, Pastor Johnston and Christenson followed one another in the pulpit. Dr. Fors read a poem in memory of the King,written for this paper by J. Bonggren and O. E. Linder. Songs were sung by the church choir. The following cablegram was sent to the queen by Dr. M. C. Ranseen, C. A. Evald, L. G. Abrahamson and M. Wahlstrom.</p>
   <p>"Chicago Swedish Lutherans deeply mourn the loss of King Oscar and today we assemble in our churches in memorial services to offer prayer for your Majesty Trust in God. We offer our deepest sympathy."</p>
   <p>Even in the Norwegian churches memorial services are being held in honor of the <pb facs="5423404_5_0296.jpg" n="2"/>deceased King. In "Our Savior's Church", Pastor B. E. Bergesen spoke of the King's splendid character and rightness. King Oscar will stand out in history as one of the monarchs most highly thought of. He said these were the sentiments also of his brethren. And how anyone could be of different opinion no Norseman will understand. The King's attitude toward the Norwegian people was to seek their confidence and to warrant their kindly feeling.</p>
   <p>When Norway's history is written there will not be a bitter word spoken, but the pages will speak of him kindly and eloquently.</p>
   <p>Pastor Alfred Johnson said King Oscar was loved and honored in Norway as well as any king who may ever be on Norway's throne.</p>
