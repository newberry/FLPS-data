   <p>A short time ago, we reported that Reverend Gottfred Nelson, of the Trinity Lutheran Church in this city, had received a hearty ovation on the occasion of his twentieth anniversary as pastor of that church.</p>
   <p>Nelson was born in the old Swedish community of Knoxville, Illinois, July 8, 1875. His parents moved to Kansas in 1878, where his mother died shortly after her arrival there.</p>
   <p>He received his early education in the public schools near his home. Later, he attended Bethany College in Lindsborg, from which he graduated with the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1898. While he was still attending school, he served as <pb facs="5423404_5_0523.jpg" n="2"/>pastor of the Lutheran Congregations in Jamestown, Falconer, and Frewsburg in New York, and also as pastor of the First Lutheran Congregation of Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
   <p>In 1899 Nelson became a student at the Augustona Theological Seminary in Rock Island. The following year he attended the Lutheran Seminary in Chicago, and then returned to the Rock Island school, from which he graduated as Bachelor of Divinity in the spring of 1902. At the synodal convention of that year, which took place in Ishpeming, Michigan, he was ordained as a minister and immediately thereafter was called to the ministry of the Bethesda Swedish Lutheran Congregation in Chicago. He remained there until October of the following year, when he took over his present position as pastor of the Trinity Church in Lake View.</p>
   <p>Much could be written about Nelson's activities as a pastor, but our space is limited. Suffice it to say that under his leadership the Trinity congregation has prospered and has become one of the largest and most influential Lutheran congregations in the city. He is a man of action, on the go all the time. The <pb facs="5423404_5_0524.jpg" n="3"/>administration of his large congregation takes much of his time; he makes it a point to become personally acquainted with every member, and to know and understand the conditions under which each is living. And he takes just as sincere an interest in many Swedish families which do not belong to his church. The result is that people love him, and that he is undoubtedly one of the most popular Swedish pastors in the city.</p>
   <p>Another notable trait of Pastor Nelson's is his deep interest in everything Swedish. This is one of the sources of strength of his great congregation. It is all the more remarkable in view of the fact that he himself was born and raised in this country.</p>
   <p>He has been much interested in the activities of the Synod, and has served it in various capacities,.Thus, for a number of years he has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Augustona Hospital.</p>
   <p>In 1904 he married Anna Almquist, of Butte, Montana.</p>
