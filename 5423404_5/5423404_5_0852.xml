   <p>p.6... Two Swedes were plantiff and defendant in a lesser court case, at the Maxwell Street Police Court, in Chicago. The case concerned an unpaid board bill. It was not a very interesting case to the public; but to presiding Judge Dooley the matter was significant. For while he fined the Scandinavians, he did not fail to take that opportunity as one in which to acknowledge them as being a law abiding people.</p>
   <p>"The Scandinavians," said the Judge, "are famous for their peace loving disposition. Fewer arrests are made among them than any other nationality. In this District court's jurisdiction there are about 10,000 Scandinavians, but this is the first case in this court wherein any of them have been involved to the extent of a year or more.The present case is here more because <pb facs="5423404_5_0853.jpg" n="2"/>of the misinterpretation of the law than anything else.</p>
   <p>These words of acknowledgement are perhaps less welcome to those of our countrymen, who consider the Irish their inherited enemies, for how can a righteous acknowledgement of Swedes come from one whose name is Dooley, especially now when no election is in sight for a long time? Well, then, we only give the facts, each may interpret the Judge in his own way.</p>
