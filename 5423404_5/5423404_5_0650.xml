   <p>Mr. Axel L. Ericson, swung himself over the half century mark Friday, August 30. On this occasion, about 100 of his friends had arranged a stylish birthday party at Svithiod Club in his honor. Delicious food was served followed by a program of instrumental music, song, and speeches. City Building Commissioner Charles Bostrom, was very successful in his roll of toastmaster. Letters and telegrams of congratulations were read.</p>
   <p>The speakers were: C. A Strom, Charles Strondell, Editor Alex J. Johnson, Frithiof Malmquist, John E. Ericsson, Gustaf Lindell, Carl Anderson, Edwin A.</p>

   <p>Olson and many others. One of the speakers was August West, who presented the honor guest with a gold watch as a memento of his fiftieth birthday, whereupon Mr. Ericson thanked those present for the consideration always shown him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ericson is a building contractor. He was born in Vermland and came to America and Chicago at the age of 19.</p>
   <p>He lives with his family at 5505 Glenwood Avenue.</p>
