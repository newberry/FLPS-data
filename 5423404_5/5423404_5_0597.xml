<title level="a">SWEDEN HONORS SWEDISH-AMERICAN WOMAN</title>

   <p>Mrs. Emmy Ewald, our nationally known countrywoman, has been awarded the VASA medal of gold, by the order of King Gustaf V of Sweden.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ewald can look back on more than thirty years of fruitful work among Swedes in America, and the list of philanthropic and useful undertakings which she has either established herself or to which she has given her influential support is a long one. It is no exaggeration to say that she ranks among the most prominent Swedish women in America today.</p>
   <p>She is the widow of the noted Lutheran pastor, C. A. Ewald, and was born in Geneva, Illinois. Her father was the well-known pioneer of the Lutheran church in America, Dr. Erland Carlson. She received a fine education, attending schools both in this country and in Sweden. On May 24, 1883, she married Pastor Ewald, and since then she has devoted most of her time to <pb facs="5423404_5_0598.jpg" n="2"/>useful work among Swedish-Americans beginning with the Immanuel congregation, of which her husband was the pastor, and later extending her activities to the Lutheran church in general until she finally became a nationally known figure. It would require too much space and time to give a detailed account here of her various activities during the last decades, but we shall mention a few.</p>
   <p>Thirty years ago, she took the initiative in organizing the Women's Home and Foreign Mission Society of the Augustana Synod. Thanks to her energetic leadership, the organization has been able to do much good.</p>
   <p>She was a prominent figure at the World Parliament of Religions, which was held here in 1893 in connection with the great exposition, and she served as president of the Lutheran Women's Congress. This Congress resulted in the formation of the Lutheran Women's International League, of which she became the president.</p>
   <p>Along with her other activities, Mrs. Ewald has always been a champion of <pb facs="5423404_5_0599.jpg" n="3"/>the women's cause, and she belongs to many women's clubs and societies. On several occasions she has acted as their spokesman before local and state authorities as well as before Congress.</p>
   <p>She is still president of the Women's Mission Society of the Augustana Synod, with its fifty thousand members. A high school for girls in China, which is operated by the Society, is named after her.</p>
   <p>The Immanuel Women's Home was established on her initiative, as was the first Swedish-American women's club. Lately, she has been energetically at work in the campaign which is being conducted for the purpose of raising funds for a women's building at Augustana College, and she is also actively supporting the work of the Wilamowitz Children's Relief Society, which has made her honorary Chairman.</p>
   <p>The VASA medal was conferred upon her by the Swedish Consul, Carl O. Von Dardel, who represented King Gustaf, at a banquet in the Auditorium Hotel.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ewald lives at 1453 Berwyn Avenue.</p>
