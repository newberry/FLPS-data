   <p>We Swedish journalists are guilty of at least two mistakes in picturing America in an effort to have our sons and daughters remain in Sweden. We have painted America in the darkest of colors.</p>
   <p>Words about this have reached America, and our countrymen have been filled with wrath when realizing how they have been lied about. The Swedish-American press has only been right and just, when it contradicted the charge implied or made. Hard words were in turn spoken by the Swedish press. The Swedish people in America wrote direct to Sweden stating the facts, so that the recipient of the letters may be the judge. Our immigrants are much less interested in Charles XII, than in the fact that a great power station is about to be built at the Falls near the old church. No one in particular cares what Gustof X did for "Sjalland," if instead he is informed that automobiles are now traversing the highway, where he as a boy attempted to drive his yoke of Oxen.</p>
