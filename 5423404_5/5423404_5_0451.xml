   <p>The most notable Swede in Chicago, City Engineer, John E. Ericson, passed away, last Saturday, April 16th, at the age of 68. He was born in Stockholm, Sweden, where he graduated from the Royal Institute of Technology. He came to Chicago in 1884.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ericson's engineering skill has created international attention. The Chicago Water Works, one of his creations, has been studied and copied by other municipalities. Drainage, sewage, water systems, bridges and city planning were problems that had been confronting Mr. Ericson in his capacity of City Engineer of Chicago ever since 1897, in which year he was appointed by Mayor Carter Harrison. The unanimous opinion is that these problems have been solved in a manner that merits admiration and gratitude.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ericson, was one of the founders of the American Association of Engineers. In 1914 he was decorated by the Swedish King.</p>
