   <p>One of our "Before-the-fire-Veterans" is eighty years old today, May 21st. He is Gustaf Johnson, hardware man and inventor at 420 W. Chicago Avenue. Mr. Johnson came to Chicago in 1868 and started his own hardware store in 1883. He is still taking an active part in the store and in the factory, where his specialties are being manufactured. Mr. Johnson is inventor of The Pitner Gas Iron, The Gem Electric Iron, and the Day-Lite Lamp. The business is now run by his son, Frank K. Johnson.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson is very spry for his age and still attends to his Lodge and social duties. He has been a member of the Odd Fellows for over fifty years and is a past-president of the Three Links Lodge. He is also a member of Frithiof Lodge of I.O.S. and the "Svithiod Singing Society," in which long ago he was treasurer four consecutive years.</p>
