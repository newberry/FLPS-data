   <p>Charles J. Erickson, one of the most prominent members of the Swedish colony on the North side died suddenly on the Street. He was on his way to his wallpaper and furniture store.</p>
   <p>Mr. Erickson was born in Sweden in 1859, and came to America in 1888. He was a member of Svithiod, and was for twenty years a member of the Swedish National Society, where he was functioning as its chairman at the time of his death. His funeral was conducted by the Rev. Herman Lindskog yesterday, with the Svithiod Singing Club taking part in the rites.</p>
