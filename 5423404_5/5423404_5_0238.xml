   <p>The Swedish consul general of Chicago, Carl Von Dardel, has announced that it has pleased King Gustaf of Sweden to make Dr. Anders Frick a Knight of the Royal North Star Order, and banker Charles Erik Schlytern and Robert Olson Knights of the Royal Vasa Order.</p>
   <p>Dr. Anders Frick, the new Knight of the North Star, was born in Malmo, January 12, 1868, and has for many years been a popular and esteemed member of Chicago's Swedish-American community. He went to school in his home city, and attended the University of Lund for some time. Later, he entered the Karolinian Institute of Stockholm, from which he graduated in 1896. Shortly thereafter he embarked for America, and settled in Chicago, where he has lived ever since.</p>
   <p>Dr. Frick has been a teacher at Rush Medical College and is on the staff of the Augustana Hospital. He has an extensive private practice and is a member of several medical societies. The doctor also belongs to several Swedish-American <pb facs="5423404_5_0239.jpg" n="2"/>organizations, among them the Swedish Club. He is much interested in Swedish-American activities.</p>
   <p>Charles E. Schlytern, president of the Union Bank of Chicago, was born in Svartla, in upper Lulea Parish, January 17, 1853. He went to school in Lulea, and graduated from college in 1871. That same year he arrived in America, and worked on farms and railroads from 1871 to 1873. In the fall of the latter year, he came to Chicago and obtained employment as a bookkeeper. Later he worked as a credit man and as a bank cashier until he went into business for himself in 1901 as a real-estate broker. He remained in that business until 1905, when he became associated with the Union Bank of Chicago, which was established in that year.</p>
   <p>As a banker, Mr. Schlytern has come in contact with a great many Swedes, and has won many friends because of his likeable personality and fair dealings in business matters.</p>
   <p>Robert Olson has been president of the Central Paving Company since 1909.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_5_0240.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He is a member of the Swedish Club and the Illinois Athletic Club.</p>
