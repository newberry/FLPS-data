   <p>The new Swedish consul in Chicago, S. M. Lagerberg, was welcomed to the city by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce at a luncheon,last Tuesday in the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>C. S. Peterson, the president, who acted as host, made the welcoming speech, in which he stated that this organization is always ready to support any measures that tend to strengthen and promote the cordial relations between the United States and Sweden.</p>
   <p>He was followed by the Reverend E. K. Johnson, pastor of the Ebenezer congregation, who expressed the hope that the consul would find Chicago Swedes no different from their brothers and fathers in the old country, especially as to character and conduct.</p>

   <p>The consuls of the other two Scandinavian countries were present: Consul Bernts of Norway, the Danish consul, and the Norwegian vice-consul. All [these men] spoke, and in hearty terms welcomed their Swedish colleague to Chicago. Mr. Lagerberg thanked his countrymen and his Scandinavian friends for the warm welcome which they had given him, and stated that it was his highest wish to be on friendly terms with all Swedes in Chicago, and to be of service to them.</p>
   <p>About seventy persons attended the luncheon.</p>
