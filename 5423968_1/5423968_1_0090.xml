   <p>The following letter was forwarded to the Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy. The framers of this statement were the Polish students attending the State University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
   <p>"Attention Students!</p>
   <p>"Students intending to participate in higher education should take the various qualities of Michigan University into consideration. The school excels in the departments of law, medicine, dentistry, liberal arts and forestry. The University of Michigan is becoming the center of Polish students in America. There are twenty Poles now attending that institution. The undersigned will gladly give any further information concerning same.</p>
   <p>"Professor S. Zwierzchowski, Ann Arbor, Michigan,</p>
   <p>Mr. Arthur Koscinski, Detroit, Michigan,</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Walkowiak, Duluth, Minn."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0091.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Additional mention is also made by the Dziennik Zwiazkowy [of the fact] that there are several sons of members of the Polish National Alliance now attending the University of Michigan. These are students receiving financial aid from the Alliance. They make great progress in their studies and leave this university as accomplished people. The educational department of the Polish National Alliance, in disbursing the stipends, favors this university because it is one of the best in the United States. Many Polish students have already completed their courses at this educational institution and are now occupying important civic positions and public offices.</p>
