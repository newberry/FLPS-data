<title level="a">POLISH AND OTHER SLAVIC DELEGATES ATTEND SCHOOL BOARD MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Delegates of various Slavic nations, including Polish, were present at yesterday's meeting of the School Board held in the Tribune Building. The question raised by Anton Czarnecki, of whether or not the name of the Bismarck School should be changed, was discussed.</p>
   <p>Czarnecki, a member of the School Board, was the first to speak on the subject of why the name "Bismarck" should be changed to something more appropriate. He said that it was not right for a public school in America to be named after the "Iron Chancellor," since Bismarck was responsible for the present war; he was an exponent of the Prussian militarism against which the United States is now fighting.</p>
   <p>Others to speak against the name were: Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary general of the Polish Women's Alliance; Mrs. M. Sakowski, a director of the <pb facs="5423968_1_0058.jpg" n="2"/>Women's Division of the Polish National Alliance; W. Geringer, publisher of the Bohemian newspaper Svornost; and J. R. Pallendech, editor of the Serbian paper. Czarnecki then spoke again, demanding that Superintendent of Schools Shoop express his opinion on the subject. The superintendent seemed not to have heard these words, for he left the room. When he returned, he pointed out that the name "Bismarck" was originally given without asking his advice, and so he was being unnecessarily involved in this argument. Thus the superintendent's reply was evasive, while the "solid six" of the School Board decided that the matter had not been discussed enough during the past year. On a motion by the chairman, Edwin S. Davis, further discussion was postponed until the next meeting. It should be added here, however, that Superintendent Shoop admitted that the name "Bismarck" is not at all proper for a school here.</p>
   <p>Among the delegates present at the meeting, besides those mentioned above, were: Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance; <pb facs="5423968_1_0059.jpg" n="3"/>F. Szczerbowski, city editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy; Stanislaus Pitera, representing the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Thomas Lasecki, city editor of Dziennik Chicagoski; J. F. Smetanka, representing the Bohemian National Alliance; Dr. Anton Biankini, representing the Croatian societies; Charles Krasny, representing the Bohemian Falcons; Joseph Niemiec, and Stephen Ratkowicz.</p>
