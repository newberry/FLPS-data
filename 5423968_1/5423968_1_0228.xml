   <p>The department of education of the Polish National Alliance granted this week over one thousand dollars in loans, without interest, to young student members of the organization attending secondary schools and universities. Because of this aid, more young men will be able to get an education, and a position in society.</p>
   <p>One of the good deeds of the P.N.A. is to grant loans to Polish youths who are eager to obtain an education. It proves conclusively that Mr. Paryski of Toledo lies when he writes in his paper that the P.N.A. does not fulfill its obligations.</p>
   <p>Such persons, enriched at the expense of the Polish people, should set the good example and help these needy youths, and not criticize with idle talk.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is necessary to state that the department of education of the P.N.A., considers only first class colleges such as Johns Hopkins University, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Chicago; Ann Arbor University, the Academy of Fine Arts, the Polish Seminary of Detroit, Michigan; the Detroit College of Law, the Jefferson Medical College, the University of Missouri, and the University of Illinois.</p>
   <p>There is the assurance that students who graduate from those schools, do not waste their time and money, but acquire an education which enables them to secure a higher position in life.</p>
