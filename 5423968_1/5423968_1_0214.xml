   <p>Let us study the Polish language, the school and the church. "All should strive for an education and should highly value all knowledge derived there-from, thereby rendering a great service to your country, to your nation and to all humanity." These few words have great significance and were placed after the proclamation issued by the students of the University of New Jersey, which appeared in the August issue of Zgoda last year. "Never shall the living lose hope - they should lead the nation with a torch light."</p>
   <p>The foregoing poetical axiom appeared in Zgoda on the sixteenth day of January, 1908. Therefore, I ask: "Who dares deny the necessity of a Polish High School in America?" Where shall we, all of us, without any exception, obtain the great treasure, that priceless gem - the torch light with which we are to serve our nation, our country, and humanity? And here is the answer: We <pb facs="5423968_1_0215.jpg" n="2"/>have no high schools - we are without them because we are poor and lack the necessary funds. But, I will say, we have many churches, which look like sparkling gems on a beggar; and according to a statement made by Dr. Juliuz Szymanski, were built with the aid of our hard earned money. There you will find beautiful lecture halls for our audiences, in the hands of wretched preachers who believe only in commercialism.</p>
   <p>They collect pennies continually; they always need money for something, and we always pay, not knowing for what. The churches we built, however are not ours, they belong to the Irish or German bishops; we Poles have nothing. We need schools more than anything else. This land of Washington and Kosciuszko, is a land of freedom. No one shall deprive us of our language, therefore, we should use it to our advantage.</p>
   <p>There are many Poles in America who have been great but -- they do not know <pb facs="5423968_1_0216.jpg" n="3"/>the English language, and lack the courage to continue their studies because of this. Therefore, we need a Polish high school in which we can take up higher studies. We wish to call your attention to the fact that to study a subject in the language with which we are not familiar would be impractical. Therefore, in the name of the "torch light," let us build a Polish high school, where we may obtain a higher education.</p>
