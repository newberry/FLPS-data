   <p>More than thirty students have registered in the Polish language class at the Murray F. Tuley High School. The organizer of the Polish class was Miss Sophia Keller, a senior at this school. Nevertheless, a Polish language course cannot be given until the beginning of the next semester because we have no one who has all the necessary qualifications for a high school teacher, and who could also teach Polish. We do have, however, qualified candidates and after the examinations in the Polish language, which will be given in December or January, the high schools will have Polish language courses.</p>
   <p>We ask the young people of the Murray F. Tuley High School not to become discouraged by the delay, but rather to get together an even greater number of students who want to take advantage of the teaching of their mother tongue.</p>
   <p>We know for certain that still another high school, namely, Lake View High School, has a large number of Polish students. Could not one energetic, intelligent, and truly patriotic girl be found in this school who would take <pb facs="5423968_1_0191.jpg" n="2"/>upon herself the task of organizing such a Polish class?</p>
   <p>We believe that one can be found, and we hope that in the Murray F. Tuley High School and Lake View High School, Polish language courses will begin simultaneously next semester.</p>
   <p>Students of these high schools are urged to write or call personally at the office of the Zgoda at any time of the day.</p>
