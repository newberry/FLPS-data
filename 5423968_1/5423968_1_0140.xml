   <p>Today is the eighth day since teachers have been absent from public school in Chicago. Because of a misunderstanding between the School Board and the teachers, more than half of Chicago's school children are home. The number of children absent every day during the past week was estimated to be at least 10,360 pupils. The greatest per cent of those absent were Polish. The parents of these school children are compelled to keep their children at home; there is a lack of unity between the School Board and teachers. Thus, who suffers by this? None other than the students. Do you call this educational justice?</p>
   <p>Monday 148 teachers were absent. Substitute teachers were placed in their classes, still seventy-two rooms were empty; Tuesday, 88 teachers were absent; 63 class rooms were empty; Wednesday, 80 teachers were absent, 52 class rooms were empty; Thursday, 67 teachers absent, 28 class rooms empty; Friday, 65 teachers absent, 43 class rooms empty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0141.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The future does not predict any increase in teachers for schools; then, why doesn't the School Board take this matter up seriously? Can't something be done to keep the children off our city streets?</p>
