   <p>The Polish settlements in America, especially those in Chicago, are becoming more interested in better education of youth of Polish descent or Poles who entered United States a short time ago. The need of a University education to the Polish youth is becoming more apparent in order to create larger numbers of the higher educated intelligent, professional, representatives.</p>
   <p>The participitation taken by the Chicago Society of this program, for the past several years has been met with great success. Consideration has been given this matter as a very important activity. Many of its introductory activities to the public is principally for the purpose of raising ample funds which shall be used in providing worthy students with scholarships to leading Universities of the United States.</p>
   <p>The committee of the "Polish Day" in Chicago is participating in the program of the Chicago Society by donating the proceeds of the Polish Day for welfare and education. This worthy cause is close to the heart of all members of the committee of the Polish Day and Chicago Society who in the past as in the future will make every effort to add many Polish names to the roster of American Universities.</p>
