   <p>The management of the St. Stanislaus Kosta Parish School was assigned to the Sisters of Nazareth, of Milwaukee, on February 2, 1874. First three nuns arrived, Sister Regerya, Sister Melarya, and a sister aspirant [Translator's note: One who has not taken her final vows]. There were then 150 children attending. On the first day after the arrival of the teaching sisters 89 more children were enrolled; the number increased daily, so that by the next fall 350 pupils were receiving their elementary education in this school. As the number of pupils increased, so did that of the teaching sisters, and the result of it was the problem of housing the nuns. By October 15, 1874, the construction of a brick house for the sisters had begun; the house was completed six months later, but only a year thereafter, the Parish was compelled to enlarge the nuns' quarters and to provide new <pb facs="5423968_1_0252.jpg" n="2"/>premises for the ever-increasing number of children. The first Holy Communion of the children under the supervision of nuns was held on the holiday of SS. Peter and Paul; the first confirmation occurred on March 25 of the same year. About seventy children received both sacraments. Between the years 1882 and 1909 there were also secular male teachers for the higher classes for boys: the late S. Zahajkiewicz, the late S. Szwajkart, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, Dr. B. Klarkowski, the well-known physician, Messrs. J. Domek, A. Czajor, I. Kowalski, and L. Burda; and a few other Polish and American teachers.</p>
   <p>In 1906, at the suggestion of the Resurrectionist Fathers, a series of popular lectures was given at this school for the young people of the parish. These lectures, like the People's University lectures, covered various branches of human knowledge, such as history, civics, politics, Polish literature, and the natural sciences. The lecturers were the Reverend Ladislas Zapala, C. R., the present general of the Resurrectionist order, the late Reverend Felix Ladon, C. R., the late Reverend John Kruszynski, C. R., who was then president <pb facs="5423968_1_0253.jpg" n="3"/>of St. Stanislaus' College, the late Mr. Casimir Neuman, once editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, Mr. Charles Wachtel, present editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, and Dr. Boleslas Klarkowski. In the year 1906, in the night of December 21 and December 22, St. Stanislaus Parish sustained a severe loss. Fire completely destroyed the school building, erected at so great an expense. All the school equipment, the library, and the furnishings of the nuns' lodgings, which were then located on the fifth floor of the school building, were lost. Another result of the fire was the complete loss of the school records, since all books and documents were consumed.</p>
   <p>The present five-story school building is fireproof and constructed according to the latest city building requirements. It contains fifty-four commodious classrooms, of which forty-eight are used for the instruction of children. In the school year 1916-1917 three thousand children attended this school, but there have been years in which St. Stanislaus School has had more than four thousand pupils. Every year more than five hundred pupils of the school receive <pb facs="5423968_1_0254.jpg" n="4"/>their first Holy Communion and the Sacrament of confirmation. At present sixty-four Nazarene Sisters teach in the school. The school has the full eight grades, and the instruction given is equal in every respect to that of the public schools, and this fact is verified by the statement of the superintendent of public schools himself. Children graduating from our school are admitted without entrance examination to public high schools.</p>
   <p>Under the enlightened supervision of the Resurrectionist Fathers the teaching sisters for more than half a century have been giving of their best, laboring quietly in the field of religious and patriotic instruction. Thousands of graduates from this school, animated with the true Polish Catholic spirit, honorably performing their duties and bringing honor and glory to God and to the Polish name, acknowledge their debt of gratitude to our school. Besides this a great number of the elect of these thousands, obeying the call of God, have chosen the better part and with complete self-abnegation are following <pb facs="5423968_1_0255.jpg" n="5"/>the high calling of secular or monastic priesthood.</p>
   <p>All these people, wherever they are, and whatever they do, are following the path shown to them in our parish school, the path of truth and duty under the banner held high by the school: For God, Church, and Country.</p>
