<title level="a">THE APPROACHING POLISH NATIONAL ALLIANCE CONVENTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>After the matters of the Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily), the Immigration Home, and colonization are disposed of, the approaching Polish National Alliance convention will take up the business of "propounding measures for the continued spread of education among the Poles in America."</p>
   <p>The farther one goes into a forest, the more trees one encounters; the more projects [one undertakes], the less familiarity one has with the conditions of our real life and the true meaning of the word "education".</p>
   <p>What is the foundation of education? The elementary school. What is the foundation of the education of the Polish people? The Polish elementary school. Is it the thought of the Polish National Alliance's censor to <pb facs="5423968_1_0157.jpg" n="2"/>establish [additional elementary] schools in the Polish colonies? This must be admitted to be the fact; there is no doubt about it, for the censor as well as the officers of the Polish National Alliance say that there already exist Polish parochial schools in all the Polish colonies. They are under the supervision of priests, and in them nuns or secular teachers with high-school education are in charge of the teaching. Some of these schools do not enjoy the approval of the patriots of the Polish National Alliance, especially those in which the teachers are qualified [to teach], for their system of teaching, [according to the patriots], is false. The aim of their methods is erroneous because it is one that confuses the Polish youth and overburdens the mental faculties with religious formulas at the expense of information and the enlightenment of the youth's mind.</p>
   <p>As to the principles of the censor or those of the Alliance members, no copy is going to be wasted on them. Attention, however, is called to the <pb facs="5423968_1_0158.jpg" n="3"/>fact that we do not know of a priest who considers our [parochial] schools as the ultimate in education. And yet how much money do our schools consume each year despite the fact that only nuns teach in them, who are content with a small remuneration for their efforts, since only a small number of our schools have capable and qualified secular instructors!</p>
   <p>If we estimate the value of our two hundred schools at five thousand dollars each, this comes to one million dollars. Let the upkeep of each school be placed at six hundred dollars a year. This alone amounts to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Such are the schools which Polish Roman Catholic children are practically forced to attend. Thank God that thus far only a small percentage of the Poles have followed in the footsteps of the liberals who have freed themselves from the influence of the priests and send their children to non-catholic schools, that is, to public schools, or are awaiting the further development of education by the Polish National Alliance!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0159.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Let us assume that the Polish National Alliance is going to compete with the Polish Roman Catholic priests. Two hundred schools are to be erected at an estimated cost of two million dollars, and qualified instructors will be employed at a cost of two hundred and forty thousand dollars. Who is going to help in collecting these funds, and whose children are going to attend these schools?</p>
   <p>Too often have we wandered in the forest of nonsense, dear censor, to waste any more time in it. Can there be any further discussion about Polish education, since therefore, [we know that] the Polish Roman Catholic schools cannot be replaced by Polish liberal schools?</p>
   <p>The censor will probably not go so far as to say that traveling libraries, liberal newspapers, and roving professors will spread education among our people who have been taken away from Polish parishes and parochial schools after they have been persuaded to sever their connections from the Roman <pb facs="5423968_1_0160.jpg" n="5"/>Catholic Church. Thanks to your perverse teachings, the children of this befuddled portion of the people have not attended any Polish school and therefore are unfit to receive any kind of Polish education. Their plight makes them a total loss to the Poles.</p>
   <p>"Further spread of education" by you gentlemen among the Polish people in America is therefore nothing more than the spread of Polish ignorance, the corruption of Polish customs, and the promotion of the rapid Americanization of the Polish people. If you call this sort of patriotism worthy of an institution which carries the name of a Polish national organization, permit us to quote a progressive from Bucharest whose correspondence was recently published in the Dziennik Chicagoski. He said to you plainly that the Poles of the fatherland "expectorate upon such patriotism".......why do they do this? He explained this clearly; so let us avoid further argument.</p>
