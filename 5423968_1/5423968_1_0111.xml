   <p>In a short while the school doors will close for our children and our youth. Vacation time is nearing - a time of rest yearned for by students as well as teachers.</p>
   <p>One part of our children will leave forever their seats in school; the other, the greater portion, will return again to continue or complete the studies they have begun.</p>
   <p>It is customary in America, especially among the Poles, that after finishing school, the parents lengthen the boys' trousers, accommodate them with brand new shiny "dinner pails," and send them as quick as they can to the factory for profit, because our Polish parents are mainly concerned that their children should earn as much as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0112.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A boy can have talent and ability, he can have even a keen desire for further study, and can present his desire to his parents in most imploring words, but they, due to the "pay check" that is smiling at them, will not permit their boys to dream about books. "And do you see," cries the mother in excitement to the father, "look what he is longing for. He wants to go to school; wants to be a big man. What do we do?"</p>
   <p>Father also had to work hard and today he owns three buildings, even if he is not educated. Therefore, the boy can also go to the shop.</p>
   <p>Perplexed by the arguments of his mother, the boy keeps silent, and abiding by the order of his mother, who is more anxious about the good of the pocket book than that of the child, the boy takes the shiny little dinner pail and moves on with other friends to work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0113.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And so talent is destroyed and ability is lost, which could give to our society priceless service, were it not for the greed of the parents. And most certainly there is no place in the world where an education can be acquired more easily than in America. Other nationalities take advantage of these opportunities, but our Poles do not know how to benefit by them - as if they were born to a shovel or a spade.</p>
   <p>You can count the Polish students endeavoring to educate themselves in higher Polish educational institutions on the fingers of your hands; the American schools then are filled to capacity by young people of different nationalities, and only rarely you will come across a Pole here and there. Our Polish people, who are otherwise upright and liberal, cannot grasp the fact that today one must seek the gold and treasures of this world not only by a spade or shovel, but with the help of knowledge and that with the help of it you gain importance, influence, power and well being.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0114.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Various higher offices in politics and higher salaried positions in trade and commerce are held by representatives of other nationalities because their parents had picked for them the real path of life. Our young people then, even if capable and talented, do not seek their "bread" through a book or by a book, but instead around factories and underground canals (mines) - because our kind can only see this kind of a future for their children. This is sad but nevertheless true.</p>
   <p>The parents imagine that for money they can buy anything and for this money they deprive themselves of the most noble feeling, they lose their conscience, heart and soul, unmindful that the destinies of our Fatherland relied upon knowledge and not upon a pick-axe and shovel.</p>
   <p>Our entire educated group consists of numerous Polish doctors, lawyers, dentists and druggists. Not one of us ever touches upon the field of <pb facs="5423968_1_0115.jpg" n="5"/>mechanics, engineering, electrotechnics and commerce, and these are the fields where the Poles ought to test their abilities.</p>
   <p>The doors to every occupation remain open to us; talent is not lacking among us, but we lack good will, a healthy and practical outlook on the world and its life, and a lack of devotion. Let us not, then, destroy our talents, but give them an opportunity to develop. Let our able youth go forward to further studies; let them work their way to success and bring fame to the Fatherland.</p>
