   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy received a telegram today from Mr. M. B. Steczynski, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance, bearing the good news for all the members of the Alliance that at the special convention of the Advisory Board, the Board of Directors, and the School Commission, held in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, it was voted to purchase a splendid building known as the Vanadium Hotel, which is appropriate for the Alliance's College as well as for a Home for the Aged and Crippled.</p>
   <p>After having inspected the property, the members attending the convention threw aside all prejudices and unanimously voted to purchase the building, together with its two-hundred-acre grounds. The contract of purchase is to be signed today.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the Polish press present at the convention voted to support the school zealously and, to make a beginning themselves, voted $1,500 for <pb facs="5423968_1_0077.jpg" n="2"/>scholarships for the first six poor students who will attend the Alliance's College. Other matters which are to be settled at this convention will be taken up today.</p>
   <p>This is an epochal fact in the life of our national organization; it will gladden the heart of every true member of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Details will be given in the following issues of Dziennik Zwiazkowy and the weekly Zgoda.</p>
