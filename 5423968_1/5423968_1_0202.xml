   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy received a copy of a German newspaper, Staats-Zeitung, edited in New York, containing an interesting article entitled "Poles! Why Not Germans?" The title is really interesting; the matter in question is one that is very unpleasant to Germans, namely, the rapidly increasing influence of Poles in the United States. The editor of the Staats-Zeitung used the information on the deliberations of the Board of Education on the already popularly known resolution of the Polish National Alliance's central administration as a pretext for writing his article. The matter in question concerns the introduction of the Polish language into the curriculum of Chicago's public schools. That this information obtained wide notice throughout the nation is evident from numerous clippings forwarded to us by our brother member of the Alliance, even from very distant regions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0203.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is known that the Chicago Board of Education is not exceptionally willing to allow the teaching of the Polish language in the elementary schools. It proposes that the Poles establish courses in Polish in high schools. At the same time it intends to eliminate the teaching of German in elementary schools. The Polish National Alliance made no request for such action and it is not their fault that the Board of Education considers the German language useless in the lower grades of the public schools. We Poles are not in the least opposed to having Chicago's German children taught the language of their forefathers in the local public schools, as long as children of Polish parentage also have the opportunity to be taught the Polish language. But events took such an unfortunate turn that the German language fell into disfavor at the same time that the civic right of Poles to have the Polish language taught in high schools was recognized. The German-Americans find a relationship between these two changes. Thus, we find the New York Staats-Zeitung making the following comments:</p>
   <p>"Danger looms over Germanic people even in Chicago, where they have always been so strong. The situation appears still more grave in view of the fact that <pb facs="5423968_1_0204.jpg" n="3"/>in other cities such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, and even in Buffalo, the Poles are developing power and demanding their rights as a considerable part of American society. These Poles, persecuted in Germany and fighting so doggedly for the retention of their native language in their own country, are so strong politically in America, so co-operative, and so aware of their goal, that Americans are forced to give them concessions--at the cost of the Germans, who allow themselves to be shoved down to another level."</p>
   <p>It is absurd to say that the Poles grow here at the expense of the Germans. It is true that they grow. It is also true that if the Germans did not oppress the Poles in their own country, there would be considerably fewer of them leaving for America, and hence they could not grow here to such power and meaning.</p>
   <p>But the Staats-Zeitung does not lose hope completely; it relies on the fact that we Germans here know how to further their interests. We quote further from this article:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0205.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"We do not wish to believe that in Chicago, under the already famous rule of "our Fritz, the German Busse, mayor of the city, it will come to the point that the Polish dialect will replace such a great, international language as the German simply because the Poles grow here numerically and the Germans decrease."</p>
   <p>But, our dear colleague! Why do you persist in continually relating these two distinct facts to each other. We repeat, we do not in the least debase your "Weltsprache"! We only demand rights for our "dialect"--as you so graciously call the language of Sobieski, Kosciuszko, and Mickiewicz--equal to those of the language of your Frederich the Second, Goethe, Schiller, and Mr. Busse. That the city of Chicago considers the teaching of this international language in its schools inadvisable is no concern of ours. Make your demands in that matter to your Fritz, or to whomever you wish, and leave us in peace. What we do pertains only to our people, and the result of our action on others does not interest us in the least.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0206.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>But most interesting is the paragraph in which the aforementioned German newspaper illustrates the strength of the Polish-Americans. "Several months past we witnessed what a magnificent demonstration the Poles were capable of organizing at Washington on the occasion of the unveiling of two statues for two Polish national heroes. Such things are impressive, such things attract. They show that the Poles know how to use their strength and are capable of making use of a weapon that rests in numbers and in dignity."</p>
   <p>Observe! Poles, after reading several idiotic criticisms and debasing attacks on our ceremonies at Washington, might possibly have imagined that little was gained by these ceremonies. In the meantime we find that a respectable German newspaper, six months after the ceremonies, uses them to prove the strength of the Poles in this country. The newspaper reasons that because of this incident the doors of public high schools are being opened for the Polish language.</p>
   <p>So it is; the Staats-Zeitung is correct on that score. The Poles in America <pb facs="5423968_1_0207.jpg" n="6"/>do grow in strength and in dignity, and they grow thus because of the efforts of the Polish National Alliance, which has organized them and leads them. If the work of only part of the Polish people standing under the banner of the Polish National Alliance already bears such fruit that they are beginning to interest the German gentlemen, what would happen if our people attained the knowledge of their civic obligations and hastened under this national banner, the banner of the Polish National Alliance? But that also will come. The Alliance grows, and with it grows the significance and influence of Poles in the United States. Today we find that the Polish National Alliance works for all. In return, more and more brethren notice this work, appreciate it, and hasten into the lines of the Alliance that they too may have a part in this great field of endeavor.</p>
