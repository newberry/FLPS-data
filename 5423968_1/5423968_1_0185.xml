   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, a publication of the Resurrection Fathers in Chicago, is violently angry because, despite its attacks and intrigues, the Polish National Alliance has succeeded in establishing the study of the Polish language in public high schools. Yesterday's issue carried a three-column article in which Miss Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of the Chicago public schools, was derided for having expressed her opinion in the American press on the benefits Polish youth could derive from the teaching of Polish in the public schools. It abused parents who are registering their children for this course. It accused Dziennik Zwiazkowy of perfidy in publishing the list of students who have registered for this course, stating that these students were forced to register. Finally, with utter abandon, it launched an attack on the Polish teacher who lectures on Polish literature and history at the Carl Schurz High School, declaring that "some of the children who are objects of this experiment have a better knowledge of Polish grammar, literature, and history than their teacher".....</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0186.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These attacks are calculated by Dziennik Chicagoski to antagonize the superintendent of public schools against the Poles, so that eventually she will discontinue the Polish classes in the public schools; to antagonize the parents so that they will not send their children to these schools; to frighten Dziennik Zwiazkowy into stopping the publication of the lists of students registering for this course, and finally to discourage the teacher to such an extent that she will give up these classes rather than be dragged into print.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, despite these calculations, Dziennik Chicagoski and its publishers are doomed to disappointment, because no one pays any attention any longer to their caterwaulings. The more enlightened members of our community, once having established Polish in the public high schools, will not only keep it there, but will continue to try to secure the establishment of the Polish language in the American universities, and even the elementary schools, regardless of whether Dziennik Chicagoski likes it or not.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_1_0187.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This does not mean that we are disparaging our Polish parochial schools, and are trying to draw children away from them--not in the least. Recently some of these schools raised their standards considerably. Let him who wants to, send his children there, because there the children will learn Polish and the history of their motherland. But because many Polish children attend the public schools, where Polish is not taught, and their parents either do not want to, or are unable to send them to the parochial schools, therefore, we should try to have the Polish language taught in the public schools, which thousands of Polish children attend, and for which we are taxed.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski is making unfounded accusations in alleging that we are drawing Polish children away from Polish schools and are impelling them toward American schools where they will lose their national identity. Where and when, kind neighbor and "friend," have we ever said that Polish children should go not to the Polish schools but to the American schools where Polish is not taught? If we have criticized some of the parochial schools for having no scholastic standing, even you must admit that that was true and is still true in <pb facs="5423968_1_0188.jpg" n="4"/>many parishes. It was, indeed, our criticism which caused the improvement in the standards of many of the parochial schools, and for which you owe us your gratitude.....</p>
