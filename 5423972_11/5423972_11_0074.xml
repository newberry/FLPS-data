   <p>It is rumored that Mr. Albert Fishel who for the past twenty five years has been an honored citizen of Pittsfield, Illinois, is about to cast his future lot with Chicago and bring his family to permanently live here. Mr. Fishel is general manager of the U. S. Credit System Company, and has his office in the Insurance Exchange Building. Very few are better and more favorably known in Central Illinois than Albert Fishel and certainly no man enjoyed the good will and esteem of the community in which he lived to a greater extent than Mr. Fishel.</p>
   <p>He has been County Commissioner, President of the Board of Education, City Treasurer, of Pittsfield, and President of the Pittsfield Library. In the midst of all this work, he has not been idle in the cause of Judaism and humanity. Mr. Fishel was the founder of the Pittsfield Hebrew Sunday School; and acted in the capacity of superintendent of same, teaching the young the beauty of Judaism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_11_0075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He had the pleasure of personally officiating at three different confirmations and his confirmants are now teachers in the Sunday School, there being a weekly attendance of more than twenty children.</p>
