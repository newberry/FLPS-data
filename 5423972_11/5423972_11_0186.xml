   <p>Whereas the Almighty in heaven saw fit to take away our Grand Secretary Leonard Laiserson, and whereas our deceased Grand Secretary with his great personality made himself beloved to all his friends, by performing, so many good deeds, be it, therefore, declared by the 27 A.B. Lodges of Chicago to assemble in a special convention called by the A.B.A. cemetery association for Thursday October 15th to express our feeling of mourning on our great loss.</p>
   <p>Resolved that our Grand secretary Leonard Laiserson was one person of whom our great America could be proud. His life was an example for others and we urge others to follow in his footsteps. God in His wisdom took him away from us in the prime of his years. To his family he was extremely devoted and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to our assistant Grand Secretary George Laiserson, his son and to the other members of the family. We pray God to give them strength and courage in their hours of sorrow.</p>
   <p>It is resolved that a copy of these resolutions be sent to George Laiserson, also to our Grand Master Samuel Forff and to all Jewish and English newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_11_0187.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These resolutions shall be written in the minutes of our organization.</p>
   <p>Max F. Witele, Pres.</p>
   <p>Chas. Barrus, Sec.</p>
