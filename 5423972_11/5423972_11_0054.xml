   <p>The Hebrew Institute, where the Russian-American Hebrew Association hold its meetings, was the scene of a reception for the celebrated Hebrew poet and essayist, M.M. Dolitzky.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dolitzky was driven to our shores by Russian cruelty. He came here with his family, and well may his conduct serve as a reply against those who accuse the Jew of antipathy for labor, for, although poet and writer, he accepted employment as a laborer.</p>
   <p>Dolitzky is a young man but he has already attained a high position in our modern Hebrew Literature and he is ranked among the great living poets. He entertained the public by reciting several of his Hebrew poems, all of which were glowing with a fiery sympathy for his oppressed brethren. This quality was especially evident in his poem entitled "The Farmer and the Feather."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_11_0055.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In honor of the poet, Dr. Raden, the chairman of the Association, translated a few of his verses into German and the Talmudist and poet, Mr. G. Rosenzweig, delivered one of his poems in Hebrew.</p>
