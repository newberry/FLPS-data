   <p>Joseph Frank, one of the most widely known and respected business men of Chicago, died Thursday, after three days' sickness. Mr. Frank was born in Affhausen, Wurtemburg, June 30, 1838. He came to Chicago when about 14 years old. After the death of his father, the boy took charge of the family. Engaging in the Dry-goods business, he was successful and amassed a considerable fortune. The panic of 1857 left him bankrupt. He compromised with his creditors and in 1865 paid compound interest. Again in 1871 he met with disaster. The great fire of that year swept away his possessions. He then embarked in the cattle business and was successful from the start. After recovering part of his lost fortune, he went to all his former creditors, and, though not legally obligated, he paid them in full, with accrued interest, for every dollar, a fact in which he took great pride.</p>
   <p>Apart from his business life, Mr. Frank was eminent in all that contributes to make a good parent and citizen. He was charitable to the poor., and through <pb facs="5423972_11_0062.jpg" n="2"/>his energies, to a large extent, is due the Michael Reese Hospital. He was a nephew of Michael Reese. Mr. Frank was a member of the Standard and Union League Clubs. Up to the time of his death, he was secretary and treasurer of the Ogalalla Cattle Company. During the recent trouble in Wyoming, he was in Cheyenne and gave to the press the most lucid account of the situation from the cattle growers' standpoint, that has, up to the present, been published.</p>
