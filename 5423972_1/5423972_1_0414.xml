   <p>A Hebrew Theological College is being built in Chicago at the present time. We have a right to expect it to become a great Jewish cultural center. In Chicago, the foundations for the creation of new Jewish educational institutions and for the development and extension of the activity of the existing educational institutions are being laid, although among the great Jewish masses, there is still a lack of interest and understanding of Jewish educational problems. Of course, Jewish life in a city like Chicago cannot remain static because the leaders and prominent citizens do not do their duty, or because the public at large pays little attention to the important, local Jewish problems. There are always a few people who will not give up, who will not rest, who are always active. Thus it has come about that almost by itself, Jewish education in Chicago has grown and developed. Of course, it has grown slowly, very slowly, but just the same, it keeps moving.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In connection with this, it is necessary that there should be created a central body to regulate and co-ordinate Jewish education in Chicago. Because the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities spends a large part of its income for Jewish education, its first duty is to help create a Board of Education to control and watch over the Jewish educational work in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The leader of the Federated, Mr. James Davis, a conscientious and practical civic worker, has understood for a long time that the Federated ought to do something about this matter. About three months ago, a sort of an educational committee was set up, consisting of seven leading members of the Federated. This committee had a twofold task: first, to consider the general condition of Jewish education in Chicago, and second, to do everything possible to improve, develop, and broaden our educational work because, after all, there are at least thirty-five thousand Jewish children in Chicago who do not receive any Jewish education at all.</p>
   <p>For the last three months, we have had, on paper, a Jewish Board of Education in Chicago. So far as we know, the members of this Board of Education <pb facs="5423972_1_0416.jpg" n="3"/>created by Mr. Davis have never met. So far as we know, this Board has never held a single meeting.</p>
   <p>This proves that "something is rotten in the state of Denmark". Are the members of the Board of Education indifferent to the whole problem, If so, why did they accept membership in such a body? Are they, perhaps too busy? If so, why don't they say so?</p>
   <p>There is another question of a minor nature, concerning the personnel of the Board. So far as we know, General Abel Davis is chairman of the Board, and Judge Henry Horner and other men of his class, are members of the Board. So far as we know, only two of the members of the Board are men who have had a Hebrew education, and who understand the whole problem of Jewish education in general, and of Jewish education in America and in Chicago in particular. These two men are Rabbi Saul Silber and Mr. Meyer Abrhms; one is an Orthodox rabbi with a modern outlook upon life, the other--a former Hebrew teacher and a professional pedagogue. The other members of the Board are worthy, educated, and capable men, but men who know nothing, absolutely nothing, about Jewish <pb facs="5423972_1_0417.jpg" n="4"/>education and the problems of an Orthodox Jewish education, because they do not know any Hebrew. A person who does not know Hebrew cannot even consider the problem of Jewish education.</p>
   <p>We do not have to assure our readers that we have the greatest respect and admiration for such capable and sincere men as General Abel Davis and Judge Horner, but what have they to do with Jewish education? What do they know about Jewish educational problems? Even if they wanted to be active members of the Board of Education, they could accomplish very little, unless they were in the capacity of advisers in purely organizational and financial matters.</p>
   <p>So far as we know, the Board consists of seven members, and out of the seven, there are only two who understand Jewish education and have something to say about it. The others have nothing to say about Jewish education not only because they have no training in Hebrew, but also because their entire religious background, their Reform background, makes it impossible for them to understand the problems of Jewish education.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0418.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>So far as we know, the Federated is a purely Orthodox organization, although it has several non-Orthodox Jews as members. This fact, we think, is also well known to Mr. Davis. That is why we wonder not only at the "paper" character of the Board, that it exists in name only, but also at the personnel of the Board. What can a body, the majority of whose members do not know anything about Jewish education, do for Jewish education?</p>
   <p>The Federated is an organization of Orthodox Jews and, therefore, the members of the Federated have a right to demand that if the president of the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities appoints a Board of Education, it should consist of men who are intellectually capable of handling the problems that require solution, and that the Board should not be a paper one but an active and serious body.</p>
   <p>It is time to be serious.</p>
