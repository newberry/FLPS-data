   <p>Five professors at the University of Illinois were cleared from the accusation of not being loyal, and remained on their jobs. However, their lectures were designated as "indecent and silly".</p>
   <p>This action is helping to abolish completely free speech at the University of Illinois. It is still certain that the professors were as patriotic as their accusers. Otherwise, they certainly would have been discharged from their positions, and, perhaps, given over to the courts. The fact that the trustees were contented with merely calling the lectures of these professors "indecent and silly", shows clearly that the words of the professors were harmless, critical remarks which offended only the sentiments of the wealthy trustees. The ideals of our country were not impugned.</p>
   <p>In labeling the speeches of the professors "indecent and silly", and in warning <pb facs="5423972_1_0185.jpg" n="2"/>them that they should never again dare to express such opinions, [the trustees] took away every possibility of free speech and free discussion from the universities.</p>
   <p>How can the students have faith in the teachings of a professor when they are aware of the fact that he no longer can say what he means? How can the students conduct debates on social problems if academic freedom is destroyed, and everyone must express himself according to the dictates of the trustees?</p>
   <p>Such a condition forces the university to become a mechanized, technical institution where people learn facts only, but do not learn to think. American students have previously distinguished themselves for their thoughtlessness. They are capable of fighting, and playing baseball, but they have no more intelligence than the average streetcar conductor.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to this generalization. The University of Chicago has had such liberal professors as Hoaxey, and other state <pb facs="5423972_1_0186.jpg" n="3"/>[universities] have had similar liberal thinkers who have stimulated their students to think, and who have impressed upon them the fact there is something else in the world besides sports. These professors called the attention of their students to the economic conditions in our country, and outlined for them the significant aspects of the social problems of the modern world.</p>
   <p>The same professors are now being called down by the wealthy, conservative trustees for delivering lectures that are "indecent and silly". The small measure of enlightenment possessed by American universities is being excluded and the universities are assuming the appearance of workshops where trades are taught but not the learned professions.</p>
   <p>Experience has, however, shown that even in those universities where free thinking is prohibited students seek the truth, and place art and knowledge above sports. Furthermore, they are also interested in social problems, and in making their country a better place in which to live.</p>
