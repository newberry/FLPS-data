   <p>All Hebrew Schools on the South Side have consolidated for the purpose of promoting Jewish educational work in that part of the city. Of the 60,000 Jewish children of school age in Chicago, more than 90 per cent are not getting any kind of Jewish training.</p>
   <p>For the past five years, only about 200 Jewish children on the south side have been receiving Hebrew instruction daily. The existing Hebrew Schools have amalgamated, forming the Jewish Educational Centre of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Educational Centre is temporarily located at the Sinai Social Centre, and is under the management of its own Board of Directors. The instruction committee consists of Dr. A. B. Yudelson, Chairman, Rabbis B. A. Daskal, E. R. Muskin, and Messrs. B. Friedman, and M. Goldberg.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0411.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The South Side Jewry has thus made a good beginning in solving the question of Jewish education in that part of the city.</p>
   <p>It is planned to place buses at the various public schools at 3:30 in the afternoon. The buses will then take the children to the Hebrew school after their dismissal from the public school.</p>
