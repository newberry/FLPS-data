   <p>The Hebrew Theological College of Chicago, an institution of phenomenal growth, owes its rapid rise to the underlying principle of Judaism, which is the basis of culture, spirit, and soul of every Jew. The reform Jew or the orthodox Jew feels that an institution of this nature safeguards the future of Judaism. Upon the life of the Torah and the Hebraic laws depend the life of Israel. To help perpetuate the Torah, to train Rabbis and Hebrew teachers, to be a center of Hebrew learning, to be a source of Hebrew culture, to be a Hebrew inspiration to young Jewry, this institution has been both dedicated and consecrated.</p>
   <p>Fifteen learned scholars comprise the faculty and it is the hope of the Directorate to add to these two more of Europe's learned Talmudists. These teachers offer to the student body the study of the Bible, Hebrew language, Jewish history, Talmud, Codes, Rabbinic literature, Midrash, and Homoletics. The institution is divided into three departments. The Yeshivath Etz Chaim or Preparatory School is composed of eight classes and has a staff of eight <pb facs="5423972_1_0407.jpg" n="2"/>teachers. The Beth Medrash Lamorim or Teachers' College comprises two classes, one for boys and one for girls, with a force of three teachers. Beth Medrash Larabonim or Rabbinical College is divided into five classes. In order to graduate from this department, a student must first acquire a university degree, necessitating his attending one of Chicago's universities.</p>
   <p>Thus many of the students are not able to earn while learning because of the fact that they must spend their time in study. So, to foster Jewish learning, the institutions find it necessary to give financial aid to many of its students so that they may pursue their studies properly. This financial aid requires as much as $2,000 per month.</p>
   <p>The monthly budget amounts to about $7,000 per month. To meet this, several methods have been found feasible. First are the voluntary contributions, endowments, donations, subscriptions, and presentations. Second is the drive for memberships.</p>
   <p>At present the institution is conducting a drive for new members. Three-thousand contributing members are enrolled upon the College's books. It is the aim of the present campaign to increase this number to 5,000 or more.</p>
