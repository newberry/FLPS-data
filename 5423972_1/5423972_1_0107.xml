   <p>William McAndrew, Chicago's new School Superintendent, ordered a thorough investigation yesterday on the conduct of Miss Mary Tobin, principal of the Kregier school, who is accused of being too cruel with the children. McAndrew turned the case over to the district superintendent, Clark, who will carry on the investigation. Meanwhile, Miss Tobin claims that she is not to blame, but that the parents are all 'greenhorns', understanding neither the purpose of American institutions, nor the meaning of American freedom, this being the reason why they dislike her.</p>
   <p>The few hundred parents, who have presented a petition to Mayor Dever, demanding that Miss Tobin should be immediately removed and someone <pb facs="5423972_1_0108.jpg" n="2"/>else appointed in her place, have very interesting stories to tell regarding her conduct. Rumors charge her with hitting the children, with restraining them from promotion, and with punishing them with orders to stay out of school.</p>
   <p>When the parents came to school to inquire why she did things like that, they were driven out.</p>
   <p>But Miss Tobin does not care to listen to such rumors. She claims not to be guilty of these acts. She defends herself saying, "It is just a question of Americanization."</p>
   <p>"In our school district," she said, there are many 'greenhorns' and it is hard for them to understand our rules and regulations. They <pb facs="5423972_1_0109.jpg" n="3"/>heard that America is a land of freedom, so they are under the impression that they may do as they please."</p>
   <p>The parents, of which the majority are Jewish, claim that if immediate action is not taken against her, a strike will be necessary and their children will cease going to school. They are also planning on taking out an injunction against her.</p>
   <p>It is being pointed out that Miss Tobin is Irish and that she received her education in a parochial school, and that she is adverse to Jews. She denies all this and claims she is working towards Americanization.</p>
