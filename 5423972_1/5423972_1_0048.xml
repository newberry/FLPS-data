   <p>The school of commerce has made practically no progress during the last year, although our equipment is of the best and our instruction is one of efficiency. The student body has not grown, but has been stationary, and at times has been even at a lower figure than in the peak reached last year about this time. The causes are, perhaps, difficult of analysis. In the first place, there seems to be a general falling off of the students who take up commercial work in the neighborhood. One of the neighborhood schools has closed its doors altogether.</p>
   <p>The number of students in our high school who take commercial school work, is very small and less in proportion than perhaps should be the case. This may be due to a reaction on the part of the students to the general demand for commercially trained people in the fields of stenography, typewriting and bookkeeping when positions are difficult to obtain because of an oversupply of those seeking employment in the field. Then again, the present day commercial school practice is, of late, not conducive of growth in numbers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0049.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Too many persons, instead of attending a specified course lasting over a period of time suchas one must do in taking high school work or in obtaining instruction in music or in other branches of study, try nowadays to get into the business world in the shortest time possible. Believing that a few months of instruction is sufficient to get some kind of position. A student will, without proper preparation, go out and seek employment. Sometimes the student comes back for more instruction.</p>
   <p>At other times the student makes her way through various odd jobs until the business world itself has perfected her knowledge sufficiently to enable her to hold a position. The tendency of shortening the time of attendance at the commercial school is, therefore, very marked of late. Coming for a period of a few months to acquire some knowledge and to hurry off into the commercial world is not wise conduct, of course, but it seems to be the vogue nevertheless.</p>
