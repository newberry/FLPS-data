   <p>The North-West Side Talmud Torah had its yearly director's meeting last Wednesday evening. The attendance at the meeting was very poor and not at all in the manner deserving of the fine work accomplished by the Talmud Torah, the fine work of the teachers and students.</p>
   <p>Since the Marks Nathan Orphanage has decided to sell its old building, many interested parties have concluded that it would be a good policy to buy the building for the use of the North-West Side Talmud Torah and Hebrew Institute. They feel that the present structure housing the Talmud Torah has already proven to be inadequate in that many students were turned away for lack of space. The buying of the old orphan home structure would make up the deficiency and also allow for the activities of the Hebrew Institute, thus creating an active center of Jewish activities for young and old.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0263.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They are now pursuing an active campaign to raise necessary funds for the purchase of the building. We feel that if the business men of the North-West Side were properly approached, this joint project of the Hebrew Institute and the Talmud Torah would receive their hearty financial endorsement.</p>
   <p>Such an institution is needed, let us make it a reality. It should begin to function as an organization immediately.</p>
