<title level="a">LOEB DEMANDS NEW ADMINISTRATION HOME FOR THE HEBREW INSTITUTE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute had a deficit last year of almost twenty thousand dollars, and to prevent a similar situation in the coming year, it was decided yesterday at the annual meeting of the directors of this great institution to start immediately a campaign for more members.</p>
   <p>Every member of the Institute will be asked to get a new member, and in this way prevent the Institute from accruing any deficit. Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, president of the Institute, in his annual message, spoke at length about this problem and also recommended the erection of a new administration building in place of the present one which served its usefulness long ago and which is far too small for the various activities of this institution.</p>
   <p>"A building adequately large fifty years ago is not adequate now," Mr. Loeb said. We haven't enough assembly halls, studio rooms and other places which we need, <pb facs="5423972_1_0426.jpg" n="2"/>and therefore I recommend to you the undertaking of the task of erecting a new building large enough to house all our public and social activities."</p>
   <p>Mr. Loeb also stressed the good patriotic work of the Institute pointing out that two hundred boys of the different departments of the Institute are in the service of Uncle Sam's Army and Navy. He also pointed to the platform of the Institute declaring that there is no place in this institution for those who preach disloyalty and treason.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Loeb's address, which was received enthusiastically by the gathering, and in which he also greeted Mr. Abel Davis in honor of his promotion to the rank of Colonel, Mr. Gustav Hochschtadter, chairman of the nominating Committee presented the names of thirteen persons who were nominated as directors for the three year term and who were unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Dr. Joseph Schtoltz and Dr. Tobias Schoenfarber were elected as honorary directors with only one dissenting vote.</p>
   <p>The annual meeting was opened with "The Star-Spangled Banner", played by the <pb facs="5423972_1_0427.jpg" n="3"/>Hebrew Institute Band.</p>
   <p>Mr. Philip Seman, superintendent, outlined briefly the activities for the coming year, after which the Institute Players Club presented Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one-act play "Waterloo".</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the play, very interesting moving pictures of the Institute's activities were shown: gymnastic drills under the direction of Mr. Harry Berkman, and at the close of the gathering inspected the grounds, where the children were playing and amusing themselves.</p>
   <p>The elected directors are: Israel Cowen, Abel Davis, A. L. Stone, I. B. Lipson, Jacob M. Loeb, Samuel Philipson, Dr. A. B. Udelson, Mrs. Julius Stone, Clarence Colman, Theodore Regensteiner, Edward Friedlander, Joseph Michaels and Aaron Yonker.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loeb was re-elected president; the other elected officers are: Julius Rosenwald, first vice-president; Charles Schaffner, second vice-president; <pb facs="5423972_1_0428.jpg" n="4"/>Samuel Philipson, treasurer; Benjamin J. Schiff, financial secretary; Mrs. Julius Stone, secretary and Philip Seman, superintendent.</p>
