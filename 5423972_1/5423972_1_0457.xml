   <p>Sabbath School.</p>
   <p>We conducted in this department, seven classes with a total registration for the year of 579, against 520 last year. Owing to Rabbi Levine's resignation, this department was put under the direct supervision of the superintendent. A number of changes with regard to the method of instruction and text books were made in the course of the year. Religious services were conducted for the children every Saturday afternoon, with addresses for the most part by Rabbis of the city. The total attendance for the year was 16,363 against 14,028 last year. The average attendance per day was 255, against 243 last year. The ages of the pupils were from seven to fifteen. In addition to the seven classes, there was also a post graduate class in charge of one of our regular Sabbath School teachers. If it were not for the lack of room, more classes of this kind might be conducted at the Institute, to good advantage.</p>
