   <p>Harvard claims no discrimination against any race in its new examination program, which purports to be wholly determined by questions of scholarship. We hope it is not a new kind of smoke screen the college authorities have invented to blind the vision of the public, whose recent opinions have not at all favored Harvard's policy. Perhaps Harvard has discovered that even materially her policy of discrimination does not pay, and that American public opinion has its comeback against the one-track prejudiced minds of Harvard trustees. The new policy, if it be as much, will be keenly watched by all, and if it is nothing more than a subterfuge and an excuse for the old methods practiced by Harvard, it will be promptly condemned, as it will deserve to be.</p>
   <p>It is rather difficult to believe that at this late hour there would be <pb facs="5423972_1_0125.jpg" n="2"/>such substantial opposition to an eight-hour day for women, but the legislature of Illinois barely defeated a bill with that provision. Eight hours is sufficient work for any industry, even for men. Those who oppose the passage of a bill to limit women's work day have not the interests of others but only of themselves at heart. It is becoming a well-recognized fact that long working hours for women affects not only the health of women workers themselves, but the future generation adversely, and yet there seems to be opposition of no mean sort arrayed against this reform, now long delayed in its recognition. We venture to say the law will pass. The egoistic interests of the opposition will not avail.</p>
