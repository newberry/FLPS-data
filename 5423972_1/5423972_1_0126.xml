   <p>Last March, the Chicago Board of Education granted increases in salary to the teachers of Chicago, to be retroactive from the first of the year. We learn now that these increases have not been paid because, as the superintendent of school claims, the Board has otherwise appropriated its money, and there is not sufficient left to actually pay out these increases. The teachers are thus again the scapegoats of alleged necessity. The city is rich enough to pay out large sums of money for one doubtful advantage or another, but not rich enough to grant a decent wage to the teachers that train its future citizens. If this were true of Chicago alone, it could easily be attributed to the political mesalliances and general incapacity in such matters of the outgoing city administration, but this is not the case in full. As a matter of fact, all the municipalities of America suffer from some similar myopic viewpoint relative to the question of teachers' salaries. America pays its business employees much <pb facs="5423972_1_0127.jpg" n="2"/>better. The profit of their handiwork is apparent, even to the dullest observer, while the advantage of a brain properly trained is easily overlooked or forgotten. Some day America will realize its mistake.</p>
