   <p>The chairman of the School Committee has been solicited to extend aid to a branch religious school now in existence at Avondale, and upon a careful examination and inspection he had found the same to be a very worthy object and would recommend that the teacher now in charge of said school be allowed a payment of $2.00 per week for the term of ten weeks and that the sum of $20.00 be appropriated to stimulate the healthful activity of said school by providing the children there with manuscript of a play which is about to be enacted by them at a Purim festival.....being a total appropriation for said school of $40.00.</p>
   <p>On motion, duly made and seconded, the appropriation was made and the motion declared carried.</p>
