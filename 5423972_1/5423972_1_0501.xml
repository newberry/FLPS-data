   <p>A meeting of the Trustees of the Jewish Educational Society was held yesterday afternoon in the lecture-room of the Sinai Congregation on the corner of Indiana Avenue and Twenty-first Street. The chair was taken by Mr. Hermann Felsenthal, who announced that the object of the meeting was to elect officers for the ensuing year and to consider the formation of a school for the Hebrew children of the city. There were also present Messrs. Snydacker, Silverman, Hexter, Eleassof, Gersoni, Michael Greenebaum, Witkowski, and Rubel. The election of officers resulted as follows: President, Hermann Felsenthal; Vice-President, Lazarus Silverman; Treasurer, Michael Greenebaum; Secretary, Ira W. Rubel. Mr. Greenebaum called the attention of the meeting to the fact that a notice had appeared in the Jewish Advance to the effect that two ladies had offered their services to direct a sewing school in connection with the proposed scholastic institution. Mr. Gersoni stated that the Rev. Mr. Felsenthal, the Rev. Mr. Norden, of the North Side, and other gentlemen had offered their services to teach Hebrew in the school as soon as it was established.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silverman suggested that rooms in the central part of the city, which would be <pb facs="5423972_1_0502.jpg" n="2"/>convenient to all the divisions of the city, be secured at as little cost as possible.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum said that the school should be of an industrial as well as a religious nature, and that a committee of three should be appointed to call upon the ladies mentioned in the Advance and secure their proffered services.</p>
   <p>Mr. Eleassoff expressed the opinion that, to start with, all that was necessary was to form a sewing-school for the girls and to get up a course of lectures for the boys, which could also be made a source of profit to the work of the Society. He thought that a committee should be appointed to confer with the lady Presidents of the sewing societies in order to secure their help to establish classes in the different parts of the city. A lengthy debate ensued as to just what the scope of the proposed school should be, - whether it should merely be one of Hebrew instruction, or whether it should take up other branches of learning. The idea finally prevailed that for the present the matter had better be placed in the hands of a committee and on motion of Mr. Greenebaum, a committee of four, consisting of the President and Messrs. Gersoni, Witkowski, and Greenebaum, were appointed to make arrangements about establishing a school, secure rooms, and report progress at the next meeting of the Board of Trustees.</p>

   <p>On motion of Dr. Gersoni, Messrs. Eleassof, Silverman, and Hexter were appointed a committee to secure popular lecturers to speak before the Society. The meeting then adjourned until Sunday, the 21st. inst.</p>
