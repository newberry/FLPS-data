   <p>In the Middle Ages, four and five hundred years ago, there were no public schools, but there were universities. Education as a whole was limited to a small group of people, but the great masses were ignorant, uneducated, superstitious, and barbaric.</p>
   <p>In modern times, education has become democratized. Modern society and the modern state give every citizen an opportunity to educate his children. This duty was taken over by the state, and it fulfills it by establishing and maintaining public schools. It is now an accepted principle of civilized mankind that the public school is the essence of education.</p>
   <p>We Jews, like the Gentiles, always have had our educational traditions. We <pb facs="5423972_1_0161.jpg" n="2"/>always have had our universities, Yeshivas, but we also always have had public schools, Cheders [Hebrew schools] and Yeshivas. Before any nation in the world had a public school, we had a developed system of public schools. One of our traditional beliefs is that Jerusalem was destroyed because the public schools were neglected. The first concern of Jews of all generations has been that the little ones should imbibe the knowledge from the house of their Rabbis. Jerusalem was not destroyed because of the Yeshivas, but because of negligence in the education of the children-- so relates the Talmud. And the moral of that is simple: Before establishing Jewish universities, Yeshivas and Hebrew theological colleges, it is first necessary to have Jewish public schools, Talmud Torahs and Cheders for Jewish children. Whoever stands aloof from this path, not only stands aloof from the accepted principle of cultural mankind--public schools first and then universities but also from the Jewish traditional belief.</p>
   <p>More than thirty thousand Jewish children are running around in Chicago without <pb facs="5423972_1_0162.jpg" n="3"/>any kind of Jewish education. The few Talmud Torahs which we have here are not even enough for five thousand children. We need at least ten additional Talmud Torahs, and even with the additional ten, we will be unable to provide all the children with a Jewish education.</p>
   <p>But instead of following the Jewish tradition and the accepted principle of cultural mankind, certain Rabbis and their thoughtless supporters are undertaking the establishment of a Hebrew theological college. Jewish public schools in Chicago are only enough for a few thousand children, yet a Hebrew theological college is to be established--this is already being called--the improvement of Jewish education in Chicago. The few impressarios of the Hebrew theological college think that the public is dumb and will tolerate such things and give money for an institution that cannot flourish here, because there are none of the necessary spiritual forces in Chicago to administer it honorably, and because Talmud Torahs are more urgent than a Hebrew theological college.</p>
   <p>It seems to us that certain Rabbis who are so anxious for a Hebrew theological <pb facs="5423972_1_0163.jpg" n="4"/>college will soon find out that the public is not dumb, and that the public will not finance any Jewish university in Chicago so long as there are no Jewish public schools for all the Jewish children in Chicago.</p>
