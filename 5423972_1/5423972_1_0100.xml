   <p>Chicago's new superintendent of schools, McAndrews, abolished the nicest institution existing in the system of education, - the teachers' councils.</p>
   <p>These councils, organized way back in the times of Mrs. Ella Flag Young, helped considerably in the system of education, and through them, many good things have been accomplished.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Young was superintendent of Schools in Chicago for many years. She was one of the most distinguished personalities the feminine world has ever produced in America. She was an outstanding teacher who thoroughly understood the system of education.</p>
   <p>We maintain our disapproval of the new system adopted for the education of children under the present social order. We would like that the system, regardless of how good it may be, should have an entire different character. This, however, does not stop us from recognizing the difference between a <pb facs="5423972_1_0101.jpg" n="2"/>good system and a poor system. Mrs. Young introduced a good system, for which she received great recognition.</p>
   <p>One of her methods of education was to hold counsel with the teachers, who are in close contact with the children. Who else understands the child as well as the teacher? Who else understands the profession of teaching children better than the teacher?</p>
   <p>The teachers developed the councils into an important institution. The councils have done wonderful work for the schools, for the children, and even for the teachers.</p>
   <p>The new superintendent, Mr. McAndrews; with one stroke of his pen abolished the teachers councils. He forbids the councils to hold any more sessions.</p>
   <p>His act resulted in many protests and excitement among the teachers. They called a meeting, not in a school but in a theatre, and resolved to combat the czarism of Mr. McAndrews. It is expected that the sentiment of the public will be in favor of the teachers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0102.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The teachers claim that McAndrews abolished the councils because he could not control them. The councils did not agree with his method of education; the teachers were against McAndrews "two-platoon" system, which is being supported by the largest capitalists of Chicago. The "two-platoon" requires that the child, aside from the regular studies, shall be taught various trades; that the child shall not be kept too long under one teacher, but that he shall be passed in the course of a day through a few teachers. In other words, the capitalists want the schools to prepare tradesmen for them.</p>
   <p>Since the teachers declared themselves against this system, McAndrews employed opposition measures against them. First of all he suppressed their reports on very important question on the Junior High Schools, and in general disrupted their work until presently, when he altogether prohibited the teachers to meet in the school buildings.</p>
   <p>At first McAndrews even refused to give an explanation as to why he forbade the teachers councils to meet in the school buildings; now, after the teachers have declared the situation publicly, he is forced <pb facs="5423972_1_0103.jpg" n="4"/>to come out with some kind of explanation to the effect that the councils are holding their meetings at the expense of the public schools. The meetings of the Board of Education cost $150,000 a year, but he does not object to this expense. He now realizes the obsurdity of his complaints and claims the councils do not produce good results for the educational system because they are held at a time when the teachers are supposed to be teaching the children.</p>
   <p>This is a horse of another color. If he believes that the teachers councils are not doing any good for the improvement of the educational system, he should have brought the matter before the Board of Education and let them decide. The board of Education would have surely given the teachers a "hearing," and would have dealt with them more liberally than McAndrews.</p>
   <p>McAndews' dealing in this case was true despotism.</p>
   <p>This fight against McAndrews by the teachers should be supported by everyone.</p>
