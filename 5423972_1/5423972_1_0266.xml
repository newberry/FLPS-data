   <p>Dr. Emil Hirsch, the renowned Reform rabbi who is also a professor at the University of Chicago, delivered a very able address last Sunday at Sinai Temple, in which he appealed to the rich Jews of Chicago to found a Jewish University. In his speech he related the necessity of a Jewish University in the city of Chicago. He stated that he could see much anti-Semitism among the Christian students who are our university comrades. Of course, we all know why there is anti-Semitism in this great university. It is all due to the superior intelligence of our Jewish students, which arouses the jealousy of their gentile classmates. Of course, the Reform Jews never did want to believe that anti-Semitism exists in the colleges and universities of our free United States, but it is nevertheless a fact. Therefore, Dr. Hirsch is making this appeal to the rich Jews of Chicago; for the sooner we lay the foundation of a Jewish university, the better it will be for Jewish-American youth.</p>
   <p>In conclusion he stated that it is no wonder that Jews in all lands are so enthusiastic about a homeland of their own.</p>
