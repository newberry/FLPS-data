   <p>Intermarriage, aside from the biological arguments pro and con, has always been opposed by members of all religions and races, with the exception of those cases where titles, social prestige, and money were concerned.</p>
   <p>With us Jews, intermarriage was (and with the orthodox Jews it still is) nothing less than a curse from heaven, a malediction so painful and degrading that the culprits were excommunicated and ostracized and held up to execration by the whole community and by the relatives: brothers and sisters, father and mother. The son or daughter who <pb facs="5423972_1_0583.jpg" n="2"/>deserted the faith of their parents and took onto his or her bosom a help-mate of a different creed, was proclaimed dead as far as his family was concerned and, to emphasize the edict, every ceremony performed in a case of death was gone through at the sad tidings of a child's departure from the fold. Father tore his clothing; mother shed bitter tears of agony; Kadish was chanted, and the parents sat Shiva with bowed heads and grief-stricken hearts. The name of the deserter was never mentioned after that, the incident was a closed book to everybody. Everything that could in any way remind the family of his existence, or his past, was destroyed, - he had never lived. Often, in the quiet of the night, the old mother sobbed and moaned and writhed in pain, repeating the name of the loved one in a futile attempt to deaden the aching heart. And father, in spite of his <pb facs="5423972_1_0584.jpg" n="3"/>outward calm and imperturbability, frowned when alone and muttered incoherent syllables. Tragedy and constant grief lodged in such a house to the end of it's inhabitant's lives.</p>
   <p>Times have changed. From the little villages of the European countries, Jews have migrated and settled in the vast bee-hives of the New World, in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago. A new clime, new conditions, new customs, and new people. Old values had to be modified or exchanged; intolerance was displaced by curiosity.</p>
   <p>Intermarriage in a city like Chicago, for instance, is a frequent occurrence. Not only do Italians and Irish, Chinese and Germans, Whites and Negroes, inter-marry, but among Jews also the number of <pb facs="5423972_1_0585.jpg" n="4"/>those who get their spouses in non-Jewish quarters has greatly increased. A people, in the long run, cannot brush elbows in its daily intercourse with others and still remain physically as well as spiritually intact.</p>
   <p>But the most interesting feature in the study of Jewish intermarriage in America, is the fact that seventy-five out of every hundred cases, if not more, take place with Italian affinities. After marriage, or sometimes before it, one of the two gives up the old religion and embraces the other's faith. The parents of both parties, usually devout Catholics and Orthodox Jews, are strongly opposed to these marriages, but in most cases a half-hearted conciliation follows, and though the old people do never fully overcome their secret pain at the thought that a child of theirs has married out of the fold, they submit it to their fate and find consolation in charity and devotion. Rarely do the Orthodox Jewish <pb facs="5423972_1_0586.jpg" n="5"/>parents sever all relations with their offspring or ban them with bell, book, candle (the medieval form of excommunication).</p>
   <p>There are many causes which bring about the mating of Italians and Jews. For one thing, the Italian and Jew come in close contact with each other socially and in their economic pursuits. The workingmen of both races meet daily in their shops and unions, where they exchange views, adopt policies, and come to know each other perfectly. It is here in the shops and union locals. that love affairs are concocted and finally lead to marriages.</p>
   <p>A far greater and stronger Shadchen (match-maker) between the Italian boy and the Jewish girl, or vice versa, is the close proximity of <pb facs="5423972_1_0587.jpg" n="6"/>both ghettos. Not only are the Jewish and Italian centers next to each other, but both quarters overlap. Indeed, such streets as Taylor, 12th, Halsted, Center Ave., and dozens others, are Judo-Italian.</p>
   <p>Families of both races occupy the same houses, live next door to each other, and find each other's company pleasant. Formerly, as one race would start a migration to a certain section of the city, the other would commence a gradual exodus. It is not so now. There are at present suburbs occupied by both creeds to the full enjoyment of all concerned. Melrose Park is the best illustration.</p>
   <p>What happens in these Latin-Semitic encampments is quite fascinating from a sociological point of view. Brought up in the same streets, <pb facs="5423972_1_0588.jpg" n="7"/>taught in the same classrooms, where they occupy seats next to each other, sharing each other's secrets, chumming together, the children of both races grow up with a liking and respect for each other which their parents in their time did not possess. The friendship of childhood days in very many cases ripens into glowing love with the passing years. It is hard, almost impossible, for two such lovers who have known each other from babyhood, to comprehend the objection of parents against uniting their fates in wedlock. The scruples and antagonism of the "old people" seem petty and senseless and foreign, imported from Europe, in the face of their great love and desire. In ninety out of every hundred of these cases, the sweethearts, marry with the consent of the "governors," if possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0589.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>A Jewish girl who has recently married an Italian young man, related to me the story of her love the other day. Her story is characteristic of many others, and I will, therefore, report it here.</p>
   <p>"I could not really tell you when it was that I first met Angelo. It might have been twelve years ago, and it may have been fifteen. At any rate, I was a very little girl, then eight or five years of age. We used to play ball and hide-an-seck together with the rest of the children of the block, and that is how we came to know each other. We were in the same school, and we just naturally kept together. Afterwards, I was his girl and he my boy. We went together to theaters and dances; we were what is usually called "sweethearts," but I must confess that I thought at that time that Angelo, whom I always knew as "Anky," a very colorless name, you must admit, was a Jewish boy. I had never been <pb facs="5423972_1_0590.jpg" n="9"/>to his house, you see. We just used to meet on the block, and it never occurred to me that "Anky" might not be a Jewish name. Perhaps, if I were told then of his religion, I might have put an end to our meetings. I think I would. Afterwards, when I did find out that "Anky" was not a Jew, it was too late. I had gone too far to withdraw. Anyhow, even if I could, I don't think I would have done it. I had to marry him, Jew or non-Jew."</p>
   <p>They meet and, Jews and Italians resembling each other so closely, they mistake each other for members of their own race. Thus the wet blanket of religion is removed, and love unhindered plays havoc with their destinies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0591.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>Still, even in our own age tragedies are not seldom the result of such intermarriages.</p>
   <p>But this tale will serve no lesson. Life is not halted by morals or lessons; it marches inevitably onward.</p>
