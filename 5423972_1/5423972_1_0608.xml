   <p>A short time ago there was an article by Nathaniel Zalowitz on "Should Jew and Christian Intermarry?" It may seem unwise for me, a sixteen-year-old high school girl, to discuss such a subject, but nevertheless I would like to state my opinion on this interesting topic.</p>
   <p>First, it appears to me that Mr. Zalowitz makes practically nothing of Jew and Christian marrying. He gave two examples of happy inter-religious marriages. This may be so, but these two couples may be the only ones among thousands. I think that marriage between Jew and Christian is a failure ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I think that there can be no true lasting love between Jew and Gentile, for somewhere in the hearts of all Christians, there is nothing but hatred toward our people. The converse seems true also.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0609.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Perhaps you will think me narrow-minded. Perhaps I am. Mind you I do not mean to say that the Gentile is absolutely no good. No, I do not mean that, for I myself have many dear friends among them, but I am approaching this from the standpoint of marriage. When a marriage such as I am speaking of takes place, there may be happiness, but it lasts only a short time.</p>
   <p>Again, I do not think that such an article should appear in the paper the way Mr. Zalowitz's was written. It seemed, in a way, to say that these marriages do no harm. Or, at least, that is the way it appeared to me. But they do! Oh, so much suffering is caused by them. This article may have been read by thousands of young people who are not very strong-minded, and it may have persuaded them that intermarriage is not so terrible after all.</p>
   <p>It appears to me that if many mothers and fathers had read the article they would have forbidden their children to read it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0610.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Why not devote the paper, or rather part of it, to interesting stories, sketches, or anecdotes about great Jewish men? I am sure this would be more interesting and wholesome for the young readers of your paper. I wonder, do they, the readers, agree with me or not?</p>
