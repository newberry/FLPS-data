  <body>
   <p>Why give your child a religious training? First, because it will keep alive a great historic civilization, and secondly, because it will increase the chances of your child's happiness and self-respect.</p>
   <p>From the very beginning of our career as a people, we realized the fundamental importance of transmitting to the child the ideals and aspirations worth cherishing. God is said to have chosen Abraham mainly in order that he might communicate to his children and his household after him, to follow the way of the Lord by doing what is good and right. Giving the child a moral and spiritual education has always been to the Jew a solemn religious duty, a fervent expression of piety in keeping with the commandment, "And thou shalt teach thy children when thou walkest upon the road, and when thou sittest within thy house, and when thy liest down, and when thou risest."</p>
   <p>Throughout the centuries the greatest hope of the Jewish mothers was that her child would grow up in the knowledge of his people's life and wisdom. This hope is reflected in the well-known, lullaby which the Jewish mother would sing to her child:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0376.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What is the best "Sehorah?"</p>
   <p>My baby will learn Torah</p>
   <p>Seforim he will write for me</p>
   <p>And a pious Jew he'll always be.</p>
   <p>If you prevent your children from getting a knowledge of those ideals and practices which assure the maintenance of Jewish life, you are virtually putting an end to that life. You surely would not be a party to the crime of administering a death blow to a civilization that has so enriched human life and that still possesses inexhaustible spiritual wealth. By depriving your child of his Jewish training, you would inevitably influence other parents to do likewise, and they in turn would influence others. Every Jewish child who stays away from a Jewish school serves as an excuse for ten or fifteen other children staying away. And so the mischief of evil examples set by negligent parents spreads and undermines all that is beautiful and spiritual in the life of the Jewish people, but aside from having a great historic civilization endure, Jewish training will make for the future happiness and self-respect of your child. It is only by means of Jewish upbringing that he will be able to adjust himself properly to life. You have given your child his name as a Jew; he cannot escape from his Jewishness. Will you let his Jewish birth be to him a source of bitterness and humiliation? Will you have his Jewishness <pb facs="5423972_1_0377.jpg" n="3"/>become a lifelong encumbrance, which he would fain to be released from, and cannot? Or will you help him convert his Jewishness into a source of inner richness and strength, into a fruitful and life-communicating possession?</p>
   <p>It is in the Jewish school that he will come into possession of his own vast heritage. There will he learn those things which will serve him as an armor and as a defense against the hostility which as a Jew, he will sooner or later meet. He will know his own past, and the heroes who made that past fruitful and memorable. He will feel himself the product of an ancient and honorable civilization, and he will come into possession of his birthright. He will acquire a knowledge of those ideals which have made Jewish life endure through the ages.</p>
   <p>Jewish education will communicate to your child the soul of his people, the thoughts that breathe in their great literature, and the strivings that mark their unique history. This knowledge of his people's past, together with the realization of the promise that inheres in his people's present, will give your child assurance and self-respect. Instead of being hopelessly adrift in an alien world, he will be sure of his bearings, and easily avoid dangerous shoals upon which so many of our youth are wrecked morally and spiritually. If therefore, you want to fit your child to meet the future with courage, with wisdom, and with hopefulness, do not deprive him of his right to a Jewish education.</p>
