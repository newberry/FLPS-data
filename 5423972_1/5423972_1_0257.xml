   <p>The Board of Education has decided to condemn 250 feet of land on Throop Street near Elburn Avenue [now Fillmore]. The struggle carried on by the Jewish members, David M. Falcher and Harry Lipsky of the Board of Education, was very fruitful. They have been very successful in providing the Jewish population on the West Side with enough grammar schools, so that the Jewish children may be able to go to school a whole day instead of part of the day.</p>
   <p>The Jewish members of the Board of Education protested against the plan to build a new technical school on the West Side, and served notice [on the board] that a grammar school must be built first.</p>
   <p>After considerable wrangling at several meetings, the Board of Education decided to give up the idea of building a technical school on the West Side. Instead it made preparations for the building of a new grammar school. With this decision in view, the Board condemned 250 feet of land front of Throop Street near Elburn Avenue extending as far back as Lytle Street.</p>

   <p>Just as soon as all the legal formalities can be straightened out with regard to the land title, the new grammar school will be built. It is needed in that community, especially for the Jewish population in that section who have been waiting very patiently for this school.</p>
