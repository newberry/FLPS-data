   <p>Chicago Hebrew Institute. Sabbath Schools.</p>
   <p>The Sabbath School, after persistent effort, has become an important feature of the Institute. Limited only by lack of room, the school has grown to seven classes, with an average attendance of 45 in each class. Though open to both boys and girls the proportion of the girls is much greater. The present registration is 300, the pupils ranging in age from 8 to 14.</p>
   <p>The program has been adopted with a view to meet the interest, the mind and capability of the young ones. The school has attracted most of the children of the neighborhood as well as those coming from a distance. The graduation class, which in past years consisted at most of only 10 pupils, now boasts of a class of 40. The graduates at the completion of their course will be given a Sunday School Certificate. However, if the particular graduate is still sufficiently interested, she (he) can still pursue her (his) studies in the post biblical class. Most of the pupils taking the work are High- <pb facs="5423972_1_0459.jpg" n="2"/>School students and the course as arranged calls for the history of the Jews up to the present time.</p>
   <p>The children themselves take active part in the celebration of the festivals, either in the form of appropriate programs or plays and symbolic tableaux. These presentations are for the benefit of the children and invitations are extended to the public. In the past, these plays were very well attended, frequently crowding the large assembly hall and filling the gallery. "Judas Maccabees," a Channukah play, is at present engaging their attention. The elimination of money collections from the routine of the teacher has removed a cumbersome and needless task, frequently taking away time from class work.</p>
   <p>A decided departure will be taken from last year's services. It was found that the Mincha services with the children did not meet with satisfactory results. The children were not as interested as they might be. The change, <pb facs="5423972_1_0460.jpg" n="3"/>it is hoped, will succeed in not only making the services interesting to the children, but also attractive. The responses will be sung by the children and the readings of the entire services will be rendered in English. It is expected that a prominent Rabbi will address the children each Saturday. These changes it is expected, will serve to make that phase of the work a complete success from all points of view.</p>
