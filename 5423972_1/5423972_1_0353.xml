   <p>Nothing that Lewis Carroll thought up for "Alice in Wonderland" can equal the comedy presented by the situation of Jewish education in Chicago. On one hand we have the Sunday schools in the richer congregations receiving subventions from the Jewish Charities of Chicago, and on the other hand we have the Talmud Torahs in the poor Jewish districts receiving their entire support from the poor Jewry of their own neighborhoods. The rich Sunday schools are not too proud to receive charity money, but the Board of Jewish Education, by a ratiocination all of its own, refuses support to the poor schools.</p>
   <p>To our mind, the primary duty of the Jewish community of Chicago is support of its Jewish schools. In any properly functioning community, Hebrew education, at least in its elementary grades, would be as free as the ordinary secular education, and tuition rates would be charged in an increasing scale for higher education - if it should be charged at all, a matter for which we have grave doubt.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0354.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But in the "Alice in Wonderland" of the Jewish Education in Chicago we find that the elementary education is the most neglected, while the college supported by the Board of Jewish Education is, comparatively, far better off. The chief function of that college is to train Hebrew teachers. A laudable endeavor, doubtless. But we are inclined to question the wisdom of spending charity funds for the upkeep of a school whose students are being taught a means of livelihood, and at the same time denying poor Jewish youth that elementary Jewish education which we have always thought to be the birthright of every Jewish child.</p>
   <p>Jewish education in Chicago has become so intertwined with personalities, with grievances, and imagined affronts that the real victim of this warfare, the Jewish child who wants a Jewish education, is being totally neglected. The Jewish Charities of Chicago finds no difficulty in supporting some institutions which insist upon absolute kashruth, and other institutions which do not. Yet one of its departments, the <pb facs="5423972_1_0355.jpg" n="3"/>Board of Jewish Education, will only lend financial aid to those educational institutions, which in its opinion, are "kosher," i. e., follows minutely the rules laid down by the Board, or rather by the Board's bureaucracy.</p>
   <p>Jewish education in Chicago is far too important to be left, as it is now, to "pedagogical science" or "absolute traditionalism." It is high time that some constructive action be taken to unite, once and for all, Jewish educational effort in Chicago under one control. It is probable that this control will have to be found outside of present existing bodies. That is an advantage, as it will be able to build from the ground up, free from the present prejudices which have done so much to hamper Jewish education in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0356.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It seems to us that it is peculiarly a duty for the rabbinate. Is it not possible for the members of the rabbinate in this city to cooperate for once, to work out a sensible program of Jewish education in Chicago, a program that will not offend the sensibilities of the Orthodox and at the same time will give the Conservative and the Reform the atmosphere they desire in the religious schools? Such a program can be taken up and carried out by an enlightened public opinion.</p>
   <p>But if the present drift in Jewish education in Chicago continues, we can foresee the future very clearly: We might as well shut down the College of Jewish Studies now as later, because in a few years there will be no more Jewish children to teach, because the Jewish community will disappear with the lapsing of primary Jewish education. And what is more useless than a teacher without students?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0357.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The future of the Jewish community of Chicago is inextricably bound up in the question of primary Jewish education for the mass of Jewish children. History will gauge the value of the leaders of our present community by their work upon that problem.</p>
