   <p>Those who will qualify, will begin to teach the Hebrew classes immediately at a salary of $110 a month. According to a ruling of the board of education the teacher will also receive a bonus of $100. The person who passes the Hebrew language examination must also possess a certified high school teacher's diploma [before he will be allowed to teach in the schools]. He will have to teach Hebrew full time, and will not have any time to teach anything else since there <pb facs="5423972_1_0303.jpg" n="2"/>is a great need for Hebrew instruction in many Chicago high schools.</p>
   <p>This is the latest news we have received from that prominent Jewish gentleman, Harry A. Lipsky.</p>
