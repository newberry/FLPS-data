   <p>In the year of 1883, the State of Illinois enacted a law for compulsory education of the children between the ages of 8 and 14 years.</p>
   <p>The law makes it compulsory for every person having control and charge of any such child to send it to a public or private school for a period of not less then twelve weeks in a school year. This was done for the welfare of the community, as many of the children, through the selfishness and neglect of parents or guardians, never see the inside of a school room, but grow up without the training and education so necessary in a republican form of government.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the great protest issued by friends of private and parochial schools against compulsory education, there has not been, in the City of Chicago, one single instance of interference with parental authority.</p>
   <p>The highest objective of this law is:</p>
   <p>Send your children to school, take them off the streets and if possible, take them out of the stores, shops and factories.</p>
