<title level="a">KREGIER SCHOOL CHILDREN ON STRIKE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The strike of the children in the Kregier School received a good deal of publicity in Chicago Metropolitan press.</p>
   <p>This school is in the heart of the Chicago west side and possibly that alone was the reason why the press made such a fuss about it.</p>
   <p>They (the press) evince a desire to make us believe that the strike resulted from foreign agitation, that the "foreigners" are not being Americanized, and that the spirit of the American institutions is strange to them.</p>
   <p>The strike was called as a protest against the principal, Miss Tobin. The complaint against her was that she acted tyrannically toward the children, and punished them severely even for the most trivial offense.</p>
   <p>The complaints, after being investigated by the Board of Education, were pigeonholed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0105.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The investigation disclosed that Miss Tobin did not treat the children inhumanly, and the demand for her resignation was rejected.</p>
   <p>Miss Tobin, categorically denied the accusation that she treats the children cruelly or that she is anti-Semitic.</p>
   <p>A teacher of this school declared to a representative of the Forward that she has known Miss Tobin for many years, and that the latter never displayed anger towards Jewish children, on the contrary, this teacher told him, Miss Tobin acts like a mother and a pal to all children.</p>
   <p>Most children are wild, but the children of the Kregier school are wilder than the average, and in a school there must be discipline. Those who violate the rules of discipline receive a punishment. You must know how to punish a child. This requires the principal to understand child psychology. Punishment is to be such as to make the child understand that it has done wrong; then the child will not commit the same wrong a second time.</p>
   <p>Miss Tobin is a principal of the old school. She is not radical, but <pb facs="5423972_1_0106.jpg" n="3"/>very conservative in her views, and she is not a person who would treat children brutally. Her conduct is much the same as that of any other school principal.</p>
   <p>A group of parents, refusing to accept the decision of the investigation made by the Board of Education, called a "strike." It is not hard to prevail upon children not to go to school; most children like to stay out of school even without being told. This incident was viewed by some as an opportunity for furthering the "class struggle." Naturally it did not work. The outside elements who concern themselves in other people's business were fooled. In spite of this the west side ghetto received much publicity in the local American press, even though the strike did not materialize because of a law forcing children to attend school, a law which none of the parents dared to violate. The children were back at school yesterday.</p>
