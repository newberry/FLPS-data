   <p>Despite the inclement weather last Sunday afternoon, several hundred men and women attended the 12th Annual Meeting of the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber, president of the institution, opened the meeting with a brief review of the activities of the college during the past year. He pointed our its financial difficulties - and also its great cultural success. He bemoaned the fact that the debt to the faculty was being constantly increased.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0373.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>FINANCIAL REPORT.</p>
   <p>The financial report was submitted by Rabbi Samuel S. Siegel, executive director, who reported that the college received during the year $45,638.53, leaving a deficit for the year of $6,388.09. Of this amount faculty salaries were $18,386.01; $5,700 were administration costs; and $20,000 went for payment on loans, restaurant costs, and building maintenance.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Jacob Greenberg, dean of the institution, in his report stated that there were 412 students enrolled; 148 in the rabbinical department, and 264 in the preparatory department. Students are registered from 38 cities and 23 states; 42 students have graduated with "smichah" from the institution, and are now serving in 42 communities all over the country as rabbis; 53 senior students of the college officiated <pb facs="5423972_1_0374.jpg" n="3"/>in synagogues during the past High Holidays, and in the near future eight rabbis will be graduated from the college.</p>
