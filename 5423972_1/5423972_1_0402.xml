   <p>The College of Jewish Studies was called into being in response to the demand of young men and women for systematic study in the various aspects of Jewish culture. The college aims to provide various opportunities for pursuing organized study in the history, language, literature and the religion of Jewish people. The college contemplates offering special opportunities to those who wish to train themselves for teaching in Sunday schools and kindred institutions, and for leading and supervising Jewish club work: Also to social workers who wish to acquire such Jewish knowledge as is necessary for a better understanding of their work.</p>
   <p>The faculty consists of teachers of high academic standing, and is supplemented by special lecturers from the universities, from the Rabbinate, and from among community leaders of Chicago. The course of study consists of Jewish history: A general survey - detailed study of special periods, current Jewish problems; Jewish literature: Bible survey of post Biblical literature, Medieval and Modern Jewish prose and poetry; Hebrew: Elementary intermediate, and advanced; Reading: Writing, grammar and conversation;</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0403.jpg" n="2"/>
