   <p>We should not only sympathize with our neighbor, the Gentiles, in their fight against ebriety, but we must also apply all our energies to help them root out this plague, which is so dreadfully contagious. Gradually our young Jewish people are being more or less dragged into this marsh, from which, it can be truly said, all those who entered never returned.</p>
   <p>Until now we are still sharing the reputation of being a sober people, but this holds good in so far as the immigrant is concerned and it hardly applies to their offspring, the first generation of Americans. The more Americanized we get, the more impregnated we become with the general faults of our neighbors. It is no uncommon occurrence nowadays to see a young Jew indulging in liquor, and not exactly in Jewish districts on Purim or Simchas Torah (Jewish holidays).</p>
   <p>It would be of no avail to waste energy in trying to shield the Jewish youth against this misfortune. We cannot wage war against our destructive surroundings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_1_0567.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Individually, we cannot fight. It is best to join the ranks of the general opponents of ebriety.</p>
   <p>The Jewish neighborhoods have their saloons and wine-joints where young Jewish people spend their time at the bar or in provisional rooms where one can drink and do everything that should not be done. There is nothing new in seeing Jewish girls standing on street corners, waiting for a friend to go to a Jewish saloon to spend an evening at a table covered with liquors.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it would be a good thing if the people living in wards densely populated by Jews prevail on the aldermen to prohibit the use of side entrances, or "women entrances," to the saloons and the use of "individual cells," where couples are screened against curious eyes.</p>
   <p>True, we know that the best way to wipe out the plague of drinking is to rear the youth in such a manner that drinking should not tempt them, - just as we were brought up by our parents. We regret that our neighbors lay more stress <pb facs="5423972_1_0568.jpg" n="3"/>on the effects than on the causes. It is unquestionably better, and even easier, to abolish the causes which tempt the youth to indulge in drinking than to fight the effects, as is now the custom. True as this is, yet there is no excuse for us to stand aloof and witness unconcernedly how the serpent of ebriety innoculates its poison into the best elements of our youth.</p>
