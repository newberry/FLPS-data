   <p>There are many outstanding citizens in our community who enjoy the esteem and the respect of the general public; we have many leaders in patriotic and political affairs. Still, everybody must admit that those deserve the first place who through their own efforts and in their struggle with difficulties have attained important position and have gained the confidence of their fellow emigrants. Among such people, members of the class here accurately called "self-made men", belongs Maximilian Adamowski, for the third time alderman of the Twenty-eighth Ward.</p>
   <p>Maximilian Adamowski was born on January 24, 1880, in Zurawo, in the province of Posen, western Poland. As a six-year-old boy he came with his parents to America; they settled in Chicago. For a long time he lived in St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish. There he graduated from the parish school. As a fourteen-year-old lad he began to work in a basket factory, earning $1.20 a week. In the course of time he learned the printer's trade. While <pb facs="5423968_3_1639.jpg" n="2"/>working as a printer in various shops, he also helped his father in his barber shop. But Adamowski, even though still a young man, had already a much higher ambition. Everywhere he was known for his modest, pleasant, and friendly character.</p>
   <p>After he had moved to St. Hedwig's parish, he opened there his own real-estate office and entered a new field of activity. In the course of time he became so popular that the Democratic party, seeing that the Polish population was growing rapidly in the Twenty-eighth Ward decided to put up Mr. Adamowski as a candidate for alderman from his Ward, but he, feeling that he was not fit for this office, declined it. The committeemen, however, would not be convinced. Again they explained to him this opportunity to serve his own sadly neglected fellow countrymen. Finally Mr. Adamowski consented and accepted the nomination for alderman of the Twenty-eighth Ward. And so he began his career in an office which he did not seek, for which he was not looking, but which was forced upon him against his wishes as the reward of his honest life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1640.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This first victory was in 1916, when he beat his opponent for the office of alderman by a tremendous majority. He was re-elected in 1918; in 1920 he began his third term. He is the first Democrat to be elected for the third time in this Ward; he is also the first Pole to become chairman of a committee in the city council [see translator's note at end]; he is also a member of the city finance committee. It is probable that Mr. Adamowski will go even higher in his political career. The well-informed predict that he will be elected a trustee of the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamowski married Miss Mary Wejnerowska in 1899. They have six children, three of whom are dead. He lives at 2863 Logan Boulevard, and his real-estate office is located at 2812 Fullerton Avenue.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In an interview with Mr. Jakicic, city editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski, I learned that Mr. Adamowski never was chairman of any committee in the city council, although member of several. Perhaps that was <pb facs="5423968_3_1641.jpg" n="4"/>the reason why the author of this short biographical sketch did not, or I should say could not, be specific and name the committee of which Mr. Adamowski was supposed to be chairman.
