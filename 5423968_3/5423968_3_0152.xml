  <body>
   <p>One of our readers, Mr. J. S., of 17th Street, informs us that the employees of the Davidson Marble Company, among whom are more than a hundred Poles, have been on strike for the past week and a half. The strikers demand $2.25 for nine hours of work. Until a few days ago, the strike was entirely peaceful, but when the workers discovered that the factory was employing other men in their places, they picketed the street corners and prevented anyone from approaching the building. The new workmen, returning from the factory, were pursued and beaten. Three men were seriously injured, one of them losing an eye in a fist fight. There was no more violence on the following day.</p>
   <p>The strike was instigated by the Irish, while the strikers are nearly all Poles. Mr. J. S., who is himself employed in the factory, states that, in the face of the present unemployment, the strike cannot possibly be successful. He maintains that the best thing the Poles could do would be to go back to work.</p>
