   <p>Over the world still hang the heavy black clouds from which came the most violent storm in history. There is not a corner on this earth that has not felt the effects of this storm. The nations have been locked in a death struggle, fighting for freedom and the right to rule themselves without having the will of the depraved satrap of Germany imposed upon them.</p>
   <p>But, as after a violent storm fair weather usually comes, so after this storm among the nations there will come peace, and we, as a nation, must see to it that we benefit from the rays of the sun of peace, that its life-giving rays revive our homeland in the freedom of its laws.</p>
   <p>Today Washington has become the center of the world. With its unlimited resources, America will be the land to which the nations of the world, torn <pb facs="5423968_3_1352.jpg" n="2"/>by years of war, will have to turn, and though today America is making sacrifices with the rest of the nations, its resources will not run out so soon; it will be able to supply everyone without harm to itself. Placed in a special position by virtue of this condition, America will have the deciding voice in peacetime; even the arrogant Teuton will have to bend himself to its will, if he does not wish to become a beggar among the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>The fate of the world will undoubtedly be in the hands of the next Congress. But are we to remain silent where the defense of our nation is concerned? Can we not guide our affairs in such a way that a Pole may speak, in defense of the rights of our wronged homeland, before what is now the greatest tribunal on earth? Are we to let our fate rest in the hands of representatives who are merely favorable to our cause, or shall we choose a spokesman of our own blood, a man well acquainted with our conditions and our problems, adept in international politics?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1353.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have the means to do the latter, and this goal could have been attained a long time ago. However, little personal ambitions and political shortsightedness kept us from this privilege, as a result of which we are forced to ask others to defend our rights.</p>
   <p>Regardless of anything else, we, of all people, should have a right to demand something of this country. Our homeland was dying at the time America was being born in an aura of freedom, but even in its dying convulsions, it still sent two of its sons to the aid of the new republic. Today their bronze monuments stand in the nation's capitol as eternal proof that Poles love liberty.</p>
   <p>Great tracts of untilled land lay in need of hands to cultivate it, factories needed hands for work--fresh human material gave this country strength. Polish labor helped this country attain the wealth it now has, Poland strengthened this country with her best sons, of whom she can well be proud. For when the bugle called, when America threw itself into the World War, Polish volunteers <pb facs="5423968_3_1354.jpg" n="4"/>were among the first to enter the ranks, while the whole Polish element gave unqualified proof of its loyalty. And again Polish blood flowed freely in defense of the Star-Spangled Banner; on the list of American heroes, the names of sons of Poland and men of Polish ancestry figure prominently; they have shown a contempt for death in the noblest of causes, the cause of justice.</p>
   <p>America will not forget our rights, it will see that they are respected. But to stand guard over our interests, even in the most favorable atmosphere, we need someone to keep reminding the country of those rights; we do not need to ask, we have a right to demand. Never before have we needed a Polish representative in Congress as we need one now.</p>
   <p>The next Congress will doubtless propose new reforms in the immigration laws; it will make trade treaties with the nations of Eastern Europe; there will be many bills to limit the use of foreign languages, and among them, our own. In general, there will be proposed a great many reforms that will closely <pb facs="5423968_3_1355.jpg" n="5"/>concern us in this country, and our countrymen in Europe. What invaluable services a Pole could render in Congress! Knowing Eastern conditions, the whirlpool of international politics, the plight of his own people, he would be the best and most useful representative of America, guardian of oppressed peoples.</p>
   <p>We still have time--let us join hands and help ourselves to victory. Personal ambitions can be shelved until later. Now Poland must have a son amongst the Representatives of the greatest nation on earth.</p>
