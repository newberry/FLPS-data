   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the Polish-American Democratic Club of the 16th Ward was very active. Approximately six hundred persons participated in this gathering. The committee formed for the purpose of contacting other political clubs relative to the aldermanic choice, submitted a report to the effect that the delegates of the three Polish political clubs of the 16th Ward had met last Saturday. The clubs whose delegates met last Saturday are the Polish-American Democratic Club, which was represented by Francis Fuhl, John Kortas, Jacob Mucha, and W. Tomasik; the Washington Workingmen's Democratic Club, represented by P. Mazurkiewicz and Kwasniewski; and the Young Men's Democratic Club, represented by F. Bieszka, W. Barwig, E. Szajkowski, J. Szczepanski, and W. Nehring. These delegates proposed Mr. P. J. Ellert as a candidate for alderman.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the report there followed several short speeches by Peter Kiolbassa, F. Bieszka, Peter Ligman, and L. Rolanda.</p>
