   <p>An organization has been formed in Chicago whose aim is to join all Polish Democratic clubs into one great association. Unified work and help is its slogan.</p>
   <p>Let us become united so that we will not be pushed around on this free soil. The greatest authority is vested in a people who rule themselves.</p>
   <p>We already have held two meetings in this respect. Each time many delegates were present from various Polish communities and wards. Through these gatherings it has been concluded that one general Polish Democratic organization is imperative.</p>
   <p>Other nationalities have had such organizations for many years and through them managed to get their own candidates appointed for public office, because of their impregnable unity. We have been divided, never maintained our unity, and because <pb facs="5423968_3_0907.jpg" n="2"/>of this have <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> received the least number of appointments.</p>
   <p>Let us take an example from the last election. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> just about got one Pole into office. For the general good of our <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, we are inviting all Polish Democratic clubs of Chicago to appoint one delegate for every fifty members and to have them attend the next meeting to be held on Friday, September 3, at the Building Trades Council, 1<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>7 East Washington Street. All delegates of the Polish Democratic clubs should be present, because a permanent staff of officers is going to be elected.</p>
   <p>The temporary committee is made up of the following: Albert Nowak, Fifteenth Ward; S. P. Popek, Sixteenth Ward; John <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, Sixteenth Ward: John Paczkowski, Thirtieth Ward; Andre<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Stasiewski, Twenty-ninth Ward; Albert Urbanski, Tenth Ward; and F. Kalish, Seventeenth Ward.</p>
