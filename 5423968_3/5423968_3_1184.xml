   <p>Resolution of the central administration. To all loyal members of Alma Mater Society on the selection of all Polish candidates.</p>
   <p>Brother compatriot:</p>
   <p>Proceed according to the mandate of our organization's constitution which imposes on us an obligation to help our members in every respect, in all possible ways, and to support everything that is of benefit to the American "Poles"; we are calling to you with a brotherly word to, please, remember, at the coming election, our Polish candidates and our work in behalf of solidarity; to uphold the Polish nationality by giving support to our good candidates.</p>
   <p>The Poles should know the name of the Polish Alma Mater Society, and its attempts <pb facs="5423968_3_1185.jpg" n="2"/>to bring before the eyes of all Polish citizens the names of its members who are seeking election on Election Day, Nov. 3rd. They are:</p>
   <p>Walter Schrojda, Democratic candidate for the county commissioner's office, Peter Rostenkowski, Democratic candidate for the county commissioner's office. Nick Budzban, Democratic candidate as a member of the State Board of Equalization.</p>
   <p>Polish candidates not members of the Alma Mater Society should also get the votes of all Polish voters. They are as follows: Phillip Kaycki, Republican candidate for the office of congressman from the 8th district; Mr. Martin S. Furman, Democratic candidate for the Sanitary District Board; Joseph S. Gieszkiewicz, Democratic candidate for the office of state representative. We sincerely hope that all Polish candidates will be victorious, for their own good as well as for the sake of the good of the Polish name.</p>
   <p>Max Brochocki, Secretary.</p>
