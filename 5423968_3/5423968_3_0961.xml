  <body>
   <p>A week from today (April 2) city elections will take place.</p>
   <p>These city elections are not only as important to the Poles of Chicago as state or county elections, but judging from the precious elections they are even more important.</p>
   <p>Our recent coming to this country, our lack of adequate preparedness, plus the small number of our people as compared to the entire population, does not permit us to occupy a too important place in politics at large. This condition, however, is considerably better in certain cities, and in separate communities where the Poles have settled in large numbers, and thereby represent a large percent of the population. This is true in Milwaukee, Buffalo, Detroit, Stevens Point, [Wisconsin], and in various communities <pb facs="5423968_3_0962.jpg" n="2"/>in Pennsylvania. In these cities the Poles play a rather important role in politics, but this could be even greater if the Poles had more citizenship training, special <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and, plainly speaking, national solidarity.</p>
   <p>Equally in other cities as in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, our political activity is mostly centered about city politics. Consequently, we can enter directly into the political organization, and even into the office of the city administration, from where we can derive benefits. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> friendly city officials or our own brothers <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in the city government, for a <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> offices will go to our citizens, more city jobs will <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to our <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> consideration will be given our communities, and in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> will be shared by us.</p>
   <p>That is why city elections are <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to us. "The shirt is closer to the skin than the coat...." says an old proverb, and in this instance it is <pb facs="5423968_3_0963.jpg" n="3"/>very true. In this respect the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> elections are awakening more interest, because next Tuesday the people of the city are to vote for more than half of the alderman and for four city officials and besides this we are to decide whether the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> system of civil service regulations should be changed in our city to one that would alter the present distribution of jobs.</p>
   <p>These are very important matters, and it is no wonder that we have devoted space to these questions for some time, and from today until the election even more interest, will be taken.</p>
   <p>We beg the indulgence for the time being of our out-of-town readers who are less interested in Chicago polities; regard is given to our subscribers in Chicago, for our interest and the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the Polish people in general does not <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>As has been mentioned, the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> elections are going to decide very <pb facs="5423968_3_0964.jpg" n="4"/>important and vital matters for citizens of Chicago, and for the Poles, too.</p>
   <p>Because of this, it is our <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to treat this matter gravely. Not one of us ought to shun his duty as a citizen and a voter on April 2. Everyone should go to the Polls next <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Some perhaps will fall back on the old saying "that the war can do with one soldier less", and as a consequence the will not vote; but this old maxim <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> about pad results. What would happen if every soldier thought this way? In truth, the lack of one soldier may decide the victory for the enemy.</p>
   <p>Secondly, we <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> vote with been concentration and consideration, having in mind our <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> well as the good of our brothers. He who gives his vote for <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of beer or a spoonful of honey is a poor citizen, and is not worthy of being given the privilege of voting. He who <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> himself to be befuddled by <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> intrguers, and does not see further than the end of his, nose, is not capabel of fulfilling his duties as <pb facs="5423968_3_0965.jpg" n="5"/>a citizen. That is why we urge everyone to vote with conviction and care. It is necessary for us to see, hear and judge quietly; we should not fall for new fads just because they are something different, nor cast aside an old and tried party, nor waste that which we have in our hands, even though it is only a sparrow (sic), for the promises of the Republicans or the Populists [People's Party], who are offering swarms of pigeons on the roof (sic). We will never see this come true, for the pigeons are too far away, and in the meantime we will lose forever all that has been planted (sic) by us.</p>
   <p>One of the best ways to become informed about political events is to attend political meetings; but such meetings should be chosen where well-known, reputable people speak, and not just any of the upstarts who would sell our Lord for a dollar, and who today are Republicans, but were Populists yesterday and Democrats the day before.</p>
   <p>Another matter of importance is not to permit oneself to be duped by false <pb facs="5423968_3_0966.jpg" n="6"/>labor agitators. Everyone of us is practically a worker, and we willingly support the interests of the worker against the capitalistic class, be it in the press, in organization or in other fields. That is why the slogans of the workers and the slogans of the people always interest us. But what good does this do if the workers are taken advantage of by skilled intriguers who make certain of victory for the capitalists!... This happened during the last election when the Populists took away the votes of tens of thousands of Democrats , thereby giving victory to the enemies of labor--the Republicans. It is assumed that the voters will not permit this to recur during the forthcoming election, but it should not be forgotten that there may be other forms of these tricks.</p>
   <p>Finally, we, as Poles and Catholics, should help a party that gives us general benefits, and especially one that gives us an assurance of friendliness, and respects our religion and our national customs.</p>
   <p>Only after careful deliberation should we cast our vote, for this vote will <pb facs="5423968_3_0967.jpg" n="7"/>not be wasted, nor will one's interest be harmed.</p>
   <p>So much for general remarks. As to what party to vote for, our stand is well known to the readers. We stand faithfully by the Democratic party, because this party is the most friendly toward us and toward the people; it does not believe in ridiculing one's religious beliefs, in condemning one's birthplace, and, finally, we stand by it because this party has already done something for us.</p>
   <p>Further details as to why we should vote for the Democratic party are given in an article "Why the Poles Should Vote for the Democratic Party in the Coming Election" from the Gazeta Katolicka, in the adjoining column. Further comments about this election will be given from time to time in future issues.</p>
   <p>The present elections, as we have pointed out, brings many important questions to the fore, among them being the change of civil service regulations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0968.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>This is too important a matter to be discussed in a few words. A special article dealing with the entire phase of the present system of civil service will be published within the near future.</p>
