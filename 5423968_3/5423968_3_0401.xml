   <p>The <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Socialists' Alliance in America has a history, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> has brought and brings <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and teaching them <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Polish <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Alliance did much work, especially during the revolution in the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> proclamations, and collected about $20,000 for a revolution in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> finally, it protected the organ of the Alliance, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Dziennik Ludowy.</p>
   <p>Hasn't the Executive Committee of the Polish, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> And has the Polish Socialists' Alliance<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> No! Did it properly understand the needs of the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> by poverty to the land of America? <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> working men and direct them into the proper <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> local conditions and does it know to adapt <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> no!</p>

   <p>The situation became worse after the split of the Polish <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Party under Russian Poland, when the Polish Socialists' <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> by the Executive Committee of the Alliance, declared that it favored the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> faction. From that time on, the Polish <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Alliance practically ceased to exist as an independent Polish socialist organization the United States, since <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> became a gropup of adherents of only one faction in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> under Russian Poland.</p>
   <p>This caused a <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in the Polish Socialists' Alliance. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> who sympathized with other factions, were excluded from the Alliance. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> members have joined the Socialist Party, others formed new organization.</p>
   <p>The decomposition of the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Alliance was spreading very rapidly, due to the disorganizing direction of the executive Committee of the P. S. Alliance. It couldnot be otherwise.</p>
   <p>The sympathizers of the faction have won. All members, who did not <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> with the faction, were "excommunicated" from the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Alliance, and the whole independent <pb facs="5423968_3_0404.jpg" n="4"/>organization became only an "aid society", a branch of the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>All attention was directed toward the old country faction, and the interests of our Polish working people in this land were given second place. This caused the downfall of the Polish Socialists' Alliance.</p>
