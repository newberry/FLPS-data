   <p>The Poles in Chicago are subjected to a great injustice at the hands of the Democratic political "bosses." The executive committee, which is the deciding factor in conducting local Democratic party interests, is made up of eighteen Irishmen, two Germans and one Pole. Is this not a clear and obvious injustice? Three hundred thousand Poles in this political party have but one representative, while four hundred thousand Irishmen have as many as eighteen. Why should the Irish have such a disproportionate majority? Even if there were an unequal proportion of representation of the above-mentioned nationalities, the Polish Democrats should demand that the Irish be denied such an unfair majority. There are other nationalities, as the Bohemians, Belgians or Hollanders, Italians or Scandinavians who should also obtain their proper share of representation but who have thus far been denied participation. At any event, we are not primarily concerned with others, as long as the Polish Democrats, and they constitute a majority of the Polish voters in general, demand an equal, relatively proportionate representation in the party government in our city of Chicago.</p>
