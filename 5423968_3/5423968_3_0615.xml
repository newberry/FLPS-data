  <body>
   <p>All Polish women who possess American citizenship rights, whether they are single or married, whether they are active social workers or only quiet housewives and mothers, ought to consider it a most important duty to take an active interest in the country's politics.</p>
   <p>This does not mean that our women should spend their time at political meetings or in pre-election campaigning, neglecting their home, family, and the duties of their position, but they should vote in the primaries and the election and with their votes help toward the victory of the Polish candidate.</p>
   <p>Women can be well informed about what is going on in politics through the daily newspapers, if they will for that. The cause will lose nothing if they do not attend the meetings, but there is harm <pb facs="5423968_3_0616.jpg" n="2"/>done when they refrain from voting.</p>
   <p>The Poles in American, if they would only care enough, could gain a most important recognition in politics, because they constitute a great power. The vote is the most powerful weapon and the most effective means.</p>
   <p>The Polish women can contribute toward this if they will go to the polls. They will elect the kind of officials, local, state, and federal who will guard the interests of all in general.</p>
   <p>Indifference on this point and the disregarding of elections are great sins of society which always draw resultant penalties.</p>
   <p>Let us take for example the courts. If more Poles were seated <pb facs="5423968_3_0617.jpg" n="3"/>there, we would not have as much injustice in relation to persons of Polish descent brought under the jurisdiction of the courts, who quite often innocently receive penalties because they could not properly explain their case. THey did not understand the matter, and the judge, one of another nationality, not knowing the conditions of the Poles, is guided solely by antipathy or prejudice.</p>
   <p>Polish women young and old (upon reaching 21 years of age) ought to vote without exception if they have the right to (vote). The good of all demands this.</p>
   <p>Registration in Chicago will take place on March 21st, and our women readers should not forget it. If our worthy mothers, sisters and daughters will go to the polls, as the should and have a right to, then we can expect favorable results. The dirt will <pb facs="5423968_3_0618.jpg" n="4"/>be swept out of politics and honesty and cleanliness will take its place.</p>
   <p>Remember,, Polish women, your good and the good of your families demand that you register and vote!</p>
