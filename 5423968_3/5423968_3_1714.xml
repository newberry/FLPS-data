<title level="a">WHO STANISLAUS KUNZ IS--AND WHY WE SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM AS ALDERMAN OF THE SIXTEENTH WARD</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Those hostile to Stanislaus Kunz, present alderman of the Sixteenth Ward and candidate for re-election to this office, are spreading an uncomplimentary rumor about him, stating that he is not a Pole. These individuals are primarily the ones who are ready to sell the Polish ward to the German candidate, Lanke, for a few paltry dollars.</p>
   <p>This sort of impudence has gone far enough. A reply to this rumor would probably not be made, if everyone in the Sixteenth Ward knew Mr. Kunz personally; however, this is not the case, and that is why his enemies are able to spread adverse publicity about him.</p>
   <p>As idiotic as this gossip may be, it is even worse when those that hear it are ready to believe it. That is why we feel it our duty to make it known publicly that Mr. Kunz is Polish in birth and upbringing, in <pb facs="5423968_3_1715.jpg" n="2"/>language, feeling, and above all in adherence to the Catholic faith. He was born on September 26, 1864, on Polish soil in the province of Posen, of Polish parents. When he was but two years old Mr. Kunz was brought to America. It was here that he lived and was educated among the Polish people (at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish). He attended the parish school and received his first Holy Communion in the parish church. He married (the daughter of the well-known Polish citizen, Kortas) and he has remained a member of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish to this day. His children have been reared in a Polish atmosphere and can speak Polish. Mr. Kunz received higher educational training at St. Boniface and St. Ignatius high schools and at the Business College. He is well versed in the Polish and English languages. Mr. Kunz has not only lived among the Poles but for them, and has worked for them in the political field. Who has not heard his speeches at the various political meetings? Everyone knows that not only politics but our affairs interest him a great deal. He made donations willingly to various Polish causes. Amid all this, who dares to say that he is not a Pole? Only the most shameless <pb facs="5423968_3_1716.jpg" n="3"/>liar.</p>
   <p>To all this it must be added that he is a good citizen and a good Pole, because he has always worked in public office for the interest of his brothers and fellow citizens of the Sixteenth Ward. He accepted his first public office when he was appointed to the State legislature in 1889. It was during the tenure of this office that he showed his aptness for public work, which brought him recognition. He defended the people's interest against the monopolies of the railroad corporations. In 1891 he was elected alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, and from that time to the present he has been working for the good of the ward and the Polish people. Suffice it to say that five years ago the Poles had only three Poles in the city hall; today they have forty. Years ago nothing was heard about Poles holding city jobs; today there are hundreds. All this, of course, was not brought about by Alderman Kunz, although he accomplished a great deal even during the Republican administration when Washburne was Mayor. The citizens of the Sixteenth Ward know only too well that if they need help in civil, court <pb facs="5423968_3_1717.jpg" n="4"/>and other matters that it is only necessary to go to Alderman S. Kunz and everything will be all right.</p>
   <p>Kunz, as an alderman, has always made an effort to have the streets, alleys, etc., improved. In 1893 he supported the proposal to have the Northwestern railroad tracks elevated, so that its trains would not run over our children, and this will shortly be realized; he managed to get an appropriation of fifty thousand dollars for building a bridge at Blackhawk Street; he helped in having the street lights on Noble Street, Chicago Avenue, and other streets electrified--this project will soon be completed. We could mention many others, but they would take up too much space.</p>
   <p>All his achievements in public office are worthy of consideration, at least to those who are honest and supporters of truth, for they are convinced that no other candidate should be elected alderman of the Sixteenth Ward. It is their contention that a Pole should hold this office--and this Pole is Mr. Kunz.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1718.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>All Poles without exception, and regardless of party beliefs, ought to support a Pole, and not a candidate of another nationality.</p>
