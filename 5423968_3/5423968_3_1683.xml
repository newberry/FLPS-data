  <body>
   <p>Henry M. Shabad was born in the town of Wilna in the year 1861. The use of the Polish language was forbidden because Poland at that time was under the rule of Russia.</p>
   <p>In the year 1877, at the age of 16 he came to America with only $1.30 in his pocket.</p>
   <p>He worked until 1882 in a print shop at 5th Ave. where he was paid $4.00 a week, he was an apprentice printer. Later he opened a print shop of his own under the name of Henry M. Shabad and Co. While continuing his enterprise, he attended law school with Julius Smietanka, also a candidate on the democratic ticket for Judge of the Superior Court. They both graduated from Kent College in May 1894.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shabad, at present, is a lawyer, but has never sought any political office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1684.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The city council selected him to represent Chicago in the convention at New Orleans in October in the year 1903; this convention was held to try and form a system and build a waterway connecting Chicago with New Orleans.</p>
   <p>Soon after his arrival in Chicago he had the misfortune of losing both his children in the Iroquois theatre fire.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shabad is living with his wife at 4041 Indiana Ave. in the neighborhood of Hyde Park.</p>
   <p>He promises solemnly that if he is elected he will support and encourage all Polish movements and activities.</p>
