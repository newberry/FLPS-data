   <p>Details about the stormy strike at South Chicago, which was intermingled with broken heads and arrests, were given during the past few days.</p>
   <p>This strike ought to be of especial concern to us Poles because our brothers not only took part in it but were victims of the riots to a large extent. Essentially, Poles are victims in this strike.</p>
   <p>Thus far we have published news about it from general sources and from police reports. These reports, however, do not give the entire truth. The truth about the causes of the strike can only be found among the workers. Our staff has made efforts in this respect to get at the truth.</p>
   <p>Competent individuals and obvious facts prove to us that the strike was the result of the worst kind of exploitation of labor by the company (Illinois Steel <pb facs="5423968_3_0111.jpg" n="2"/>Works). This exploitation dates back from the suspension of work last year.</p>
   <p>The factories are now open,it is true, but the wages have been cut to an unbelievable level. Those who previously received one, two and three dollars per day are now doing more laborious work for a dollar, seventy-five and even fifty cents per day! But if this were only a regular daily pay! Unfortunately, it is not so. The company bet out contracts for the work, and the contractors brought the workers to despair. When a month would pass there was nothing to ward off hunger with. How serious these conditions were is evidenced by the present strike.</p>
   <p>The first to strike were those that were getting a dollar a day in wages; however, many of these did not work regularly and seldom made more than ten dollars per month. But even this was not justly paid out.</p>
   <p>And how was it possible for the worker to live with his wife and children under such conditions? How was it possible to avoid hunger? How was it possible to be patient? It is no wonder then that the strike broke out.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0112.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After the meeting of the workers' committee, a delegation conferred with company officials, but a reply to their demands was refused. Only then did desperation grip the workers.</p>
   <p>The police were dispatched to break up the mobs of strikers gathering about the company plant. Police clubs swung freely among the strikers and many heads were broken. Those whom the police came in contact with and who were caught were immediately jailed and fined. Many innocent victims were taken to the criminal court.</p>
   <p>At the present time the company is replacing the strikers with Negroes, and wants to continue in operation with them.</p>
   <p>As it appears to us from all this information, the workers, our brothers, have been wronged, and the company is to blame for it all.</p>
   <p>To our poor and oppressed compatriots we extend our sincerest sympathies. We not only wish them success against their exploiters but also consideration and peace.</p>
