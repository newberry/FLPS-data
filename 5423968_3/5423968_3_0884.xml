   <p>Members of the church choir of St. Stanislaus gathered at yesterday's meeting a passed the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Our citizen Vincent J. Jozwiakowski is seeking re-election for the aldermanic office, an office which he has held faithfully for the last two years. During his term he built himself a good name as a man of social standing, trustworthy and one of integrity. Even the organizations of other nationalities are supporting him in the coming election.</p>
   <p>He was a reliable member of the Choir of St. Stanislaus for many years, at present he is an honorary member of this organization.</p>
   <p>He was a great help to the youngsters of this parish, while an honorary member he approved of sports, athletics and different kinds of amusement, and was liked by them all.</p>
   <p>We, the members of this choir, support him whole-heartedly, as candidate for the 16th ward, and beg sincerely the Polish citizens, in the name of solidarity, to give their votes for V. J. Jozwiakowski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0885.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Please, citizens of Polish clubs, societies and organizations, consider our plea, and give it your utmost consideration, and vote for the man of our own flesh and blood.</p>
   <p>St. Stanislaus Choir</p>
