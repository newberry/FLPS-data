   <p>The Germans are doing their utmost to prevent a Polish candidate from running for tax assessor. It is a well-known fact that this unfilled office was offered to a Pole who could easily be elected by his countrymen. At a meeting held last week at the central headquarters of the Sixteenth Ward, J. J. Dahlman was unanimously chosen by the Polish citizens. The Germans, however, are now presenting Frank Stauber, a German, who already is on the Trades and Labor party ticket for the same office.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung, the same German daily which immediately after the Cook County Democratic Convention supported the arguments of Dziennik Chicagoski, and even quoted parts from it,is now reversing its order of support. Ever since the Poles nominated their candidate, this German paper has ignored everything it said before and is now strongly supporting efforts to nominate a German candidate Frank Stauber, for the tax assessor's office. It is evident that this German intrigue was delayed until the Poles had first chosen their own candidate for this vacancy. Since then, efforts have been made to shove in a German.</p>

   <p>Let us do our best to prevent this from happening. Let us not overlook the matter, for it is important. We have done our best to place a German as second committeeman in the Sixteenth Ward, although we have a right to two Polish committeemen. This is the thanks we get from the German ranks. In Politics generosity happens to be a total loss. It is up to us to protect our own interests, since the Germans know how to look after theirs.</p>
