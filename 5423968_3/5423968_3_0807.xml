   <p>One of the most important obligations of every Polish-American citizen to his adopted country, a country which is so kind and hospitable, and which accepted him so graciously is to willingly take active part in its government. Those who do not take an interest in their adopted country's politics are not very grateful to the host who has been very kind and gracious.</p>
   <p>It is an established fact, that American politics are foul, corrupt, and dishonest, and it is also supposed that for that reason the honest and decent folks, in order to not become sullied themselves, avoid getting mixed up in politics.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0808.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This laziness, this lack of interest and negligence have brought about the very conditions, which these decent folks shun.</p>
   <p>That in many instances our politics are scummy and dirty, that many people holding public offices are not competent and well-meaning, are not honest and sincere, and are not interested in the welfare of the public, is true.</p>
   <p>In Russia, where the people have not voice in the choice of their public servants, all manner of corruption and abuse must be tolerated. There is no alternative.</p>
   <p>Here, in the United States, however, things are different. Here we have a liberal constitution granting every man the right of the ballot. Here every citizen has in his hands a power far greater than the power of all the cannons, bayonets and bombs. We have no need for bloody revolutions, <pb facs="5423968_3_0809.jpg" n="3"/>because our bloodless revolutions are waged in the polling places, where we elect those who make laws which are the expression of the will of the majority. This privilege should prove very profitable to every citizen. The exercise of the right to vote is a sacred obligation a citizen owes to himself and his his neighbors. He should guard that right and always exercise it.</p>
   <p>Wherever and whenever any abuses or political corruption come to light, perpetrated by carelessly and unwisely by selected officials, that is the time to act. That is the time to go to the polls and vote for a person that is honest and dependable. Every good citizen should take these steps, to eliminate the unscrupulous, greedy, wolves, who attained public office through dishonest methods. Above all, this is not time to shun or to stay away from the polls.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0810.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Up to the present time the Poles were lax in making full use of their citizenship rights. Many procrastinated in obtaining their citizenship, thereby injuring their own political strength, and as individuals were useless to the country.</p>
   <p>Blind adherence to one party or to the other, and continually contending among themselves, proved harmful to the Poles as a whole. We know that both parties have their good and bad points, and good and bad individuals, among their adherents. Individuals of other nationalities, also adhere to one party or to the other, and usually give it their full support at election time; but if the candidate, for instance, is a Germen, and is running for mayor, or governor, then the Germans discard their party loyalty, and give full support to their countrymen. The Irish, the Swedes, the Czecho-Slovaks and others do likewise, but not the Poles; they remain loyal to their party. The other national groups, even though they are in the minority, are able to elect their candidate, but not the Poles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0811.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Nationality plays an important role in this country, and the groups able to elect their candidate are usually on top; the others must be content to be their servants.</p>
   <p>The Poles ought to try to understand the old saying, "that the shirt is closer to the skin than the coat." Our countrymen are just as capable and in many instances more capable, than the others.</p>
   <p>In truth our faces should blush when we stop to think that we are so poorly represented, in proportion to our numbers. We are 300,000 strong in Chicago, but not in any official capacity. Not even in wards populated almost wholly by Poles. We are being represented by Irish, Swedish, German, and Jewish officials, and we have only three Polish representatives in the city council and they are from wards wholly Polish.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0812.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Now it seems, that we have suddenly become conscious of the injustice that we are perpetrating against ourselves by our indifference, and we have put up six Polish candidates into the political arena; these candidates should be elected by us. Our Dziennik Zwiazkowy is not obligated to either of the two parties, and it will not sell out for a few paltry dollars; but we will always support our candidates wherever they may be running for office. In helping them up the ladder, we are helping our Poles as a whole. Nevertheless, we have in our midst so-called Polish, national, and Catholic newspapers, These papers are a hindrance to our Polish cause, and we are sure that they would support the devil himself if there was a dollar in it for them. The success or failure of a Pole means nothing to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0813.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Our Dziennik Zwiazkowy fortunately is beyond bribery; we do not have to sell out our own brothers; we are here, and always will be here, to defend, support, and promote Poles and their cause. We will give our support to Polish candidates irrespective of party. It is our natural obligation.</p>
   <p>We are firing the last shot in the present aldermanic campaign. We have from the beginning supported Polish candidates irrespective of their party affiliations, and we still think that we are justified in doing so. The results of tomorrow's election, will give us the answer. Our Poles either have become conscious of their obligation, or they will require many more years of learning in order to become fully conscious.</p>
   <p>Therefore, today, for the last time before the election, we are making our final plea to all our Polish citizens to go to the polls tomorrow, and place your crosses before all the names of Polish candidates on the ballot.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0814.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>The following are candidates running aldermen:</p>
   <p>John S. Derpa, a Democrat, a falcon, and a member of the Polish National Alliance. For alderman of the eighth ward.</p>
   <p>Frank P. Danish, for alderman of the eleventh ward. A Democrat and a member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Frank Koralewski, a Democrat of the sixteenth ward, also a member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>T. Lesniak, a Republican, also of the sixteenth ward, vote for one or the other.</p>
   <p>Stan S. Walkowiak, from the seventeenth ward. A Democrat, running independent.</p>
   <p>John Golembiewski, a Republican from the twenty-ninth ward.</p>
   <p>We hope this last reminder will bring success to our fellow Poles.</p>
