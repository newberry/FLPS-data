   <p>Over two hundred people attended yesterday's meeting of the Polish-American Democratic Club of the 16th Ward. As the purpose of the meeting was important and worthy of emulation, we shall strive to give an extensive description of it.</p>
   <p>The nomination of a candidate for County Commissioner was on the day's program. To avoid embarrassment to the voters, secret ballots were adopted. On the ballots were written the names of the six candidates slated by the committee, a square in front of each name. Voters were then instructed to place a cross in the square before the name of the candidate of their choice.</p>
   <p>The names of the following candidates appeared on the ballots: Frank Wleklinski, Anton Rudnicki, Albert Jendrzejek, Victor Sardonski, John Dahlmann, and August Kowalski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1303.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the request of the members, Mr. Anton Rudnicki selected three judges--Szwajkart, Michalski, and Olejniczak--and two secretaries--Krolik, and Szopinski--to count the votes. The secretary of the club, Mr. Fuhl, and his assistant called out the names of the members ofthe club and furnished each with a ballot, giving them instructions to return them to the election judges after they got through voting. Before the election started, visitors were invited to join the club. Over sixty persons accepted the invitation, which increased the club's total membership to 241.</p>
   <p>Subsequently, Mr. Anton Rudnicki withdrew his candidacy and it was suggested that the secretary strike his name off the ballots. Then Mr. [A.] Kwasigroch proposed that members willing to do so could make five-minute speeches in behalf of their candidates. The first to speak was Mr. Roland. He did not mention any candidate by name, but stressed the importance of a nomination for the office of County Commissioner. He said that the duty of a citizen is to cast aside sympathy and favoritism and give the vote to the man deemed most competent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1304.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Gieszkiewicz, whose speech was clamorously applauded, spoke in behalf of Mr. John Dahlmann. Mr. Karlowski did the same for Mr. Victor Bardenski, and Mr. Biniak recommended Mr. Kowalski. All speakers were applauded.</p>
   <p>The speeches over, the voting began, followed by the final tabulation, which was as follows: Wleklinski, 4 votes; Bardonski, 5; Dahlmann, 34; and Kowalski, 66. As soon as the results were announced, Mr. Biniak suggested that Kowalski's nomination should be unanimous. Mr. Dahlmann stood up and said that he did not expect to get the nomination, but that he was proud to have been a candidate and to have received a number of votes, for which he was grateful. He said that since Mr. Kowalski was the choice, he would support his candidacy with all his power and sincerity. He also seconded the proposal to make his nomination unanimous.</p>
   <p>Thereupon Kowalski's nomination as candidate for County Commissioner was made unanimous by the Polish-American Club of the 16th ward. Then the meeting adjourned.</p>
