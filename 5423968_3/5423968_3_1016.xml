   <p>Yesterday's registration did not break any records. A comparatively small number of people registered. According to some sources, it is estimated that only from 70 to 80 per cent of those eligible registered, and others say that not even 50 per cent registered. Registration tabulation ought to be completed today. There should be about 250,000 names on the list.</p>
   <p>Most of the registration places were crowded during the closing hours, a fact which can be easily understood. It is difficult for the worker to register during the course of the day, but in the evening he has more time. A few minutes before nine o'clock in the evening many of the registration offices were crowded with men. When the clock struck nine many were turned away in every precinct. This created many unpleasant incidents at the registration places, <pb facs="5423968_3_1017.jpg" n="2"/>for men were reluctant to leave after having waited many minutes to register. The law states that everyone must be present before 9:00 P. M. As it happened, many judges turned away everyone when they could not register by 9:00 P. M. This is unlawful, and the judges guilty of this act should be punished. There is, however, still another day to register: next Tuesday, October 25. Those who did not register yesterday can do so next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>The Republicans, realizing that yesterday's results were not favorable to them, will exert their best efforts next Tuesday to prevent as many Democrats as possible from registering. Various measures will be resorted to. The election depends upon the outcome of the registation. This means that the Democrats must be very cautious and must make a special effort to see that everyone eligible to vote registers. Do not wait until the last minute; Registration should be completed at the earliest possible time.</p>
