   <p>In that terrible overthrow caused by the World War, all those factors that go into the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of individual societies, give an account somehow before the entire humanity of their moral strength. In a well nigh general revolution a deliverance has been anticipated by the till now, the socialistic parties world avail themselves of such an exceptional opportunity and would show at last to humanity, tormented by war, the good fortune, so boisterously promised by them up to this time. Unfortunately, Socialism has disappointed humanity completely, and disappointed above all because it did not find in itself sufficient moral strength. It hid itself under the wings of that power, which it has fought <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> now with utmost stubborn persistency, under the protectorate of Prussian <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of liberty. Not only in Germany, but in England, in France, and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in the United <pb facs="5423968_3_0314.jpg" n="2"/>States, Socialism has gone under the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of German <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and instead of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> humanity against the pressure of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> autocracy, instead of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> conscious about the danger threatening <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> with social slavery, it has endeavored to restrain the hands of the people, so as to render then harmless in self-defence and let them be put in irons as soon as possible by the fellows of the Pan-German autocracy. Socialism, with its fatal mark: "Made in Germany." became the most fatal <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> for the awakened-to-liberty revolutionary Russia. It has <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and broken her into many parts and turned her <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> sold <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> accomplish its disaster, the overthrow started to cleanse its abominable paws in innocent blood, in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in murders, in destruction. Through this it as <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> against itself a most effective and most powerful reaction because it has opened the eyes of society and all of humanity, attesting to its infirmity and above all lack of moral strength.</p>
