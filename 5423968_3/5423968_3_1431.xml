   <p>Not long ago a question was asked of a quite influential Pole in the section of Town of Lake - Why so many negroes are working at the present time in the Chicago stock yards? This Pole did not hesitate for one moment to answer this question: Above all one must mention that during the late stock yards strike the workers there did not have the support of the general public, and they did not have it for the reason that there were so many non-citizens among them. The employers filled the places of the union workers with Negroes, who are citizens of this country, therefore they have the first preference for employment. The indifference toward acquiring their citizenship contributed in a great measure toward the loss of the strike in the stock yards. One lesson of this kind ought to serve as a example to all Poles in America; the American will sympathize with the citizen, even with the Negro, and will not give priority to one who lives in America for a good number of years and does not try to acquire his citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>The Poles working in the stock yards ought to try and get their papers as soon as possible if they desire to hold their jobs. The can take advantage of the citizenship schools, existing in all the Polish parishes in the vicinity of the stock yards.</p>
   <p>No one can complain about the shortage of schools in that section, and if necessary more will be added to those already existing.</p>
