   <p>As the head of elections in Chicago and Cook County, Judge Jarecki had an excellent opportunity to analyze the methods, used by ballot thieves in Chicago. Judge Jarecki brings to light the methods, so successfully used by cheaters. This fact should be brought to the attention of those voters who presume, that because of their negligence to perform a civic duty by failing to appear at the polls to vote for candidates of their choice, they merely lessen the number of votes for this candidate. The result, however, is far worse. The ballot thieves, before each election, arrange to hire people, who cast votes for their particular candidate in place of those who fail to vote on election day.</p>
   <p>A non-voting citizen not only, deprives his candidate of a vote, but makes it possible for the ballot thief to vote for his. This method of cheating can be prevented entirely if all people who have registered, and are allowed to vote, will perform their duty. Let us not permit these ballot thieves to use our votes for the benefit of their candidates, so that in the future we must suffer for our negligence. Let every Pole who has the right to vote perform his duty on election day, thereby forcing the attention of office holders in our direction.</p>
