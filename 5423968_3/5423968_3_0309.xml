   <p>We wrote in our yesterday's notices that much work is waiting President Wilson upon is return, and he will be forced by circumstances to roll up his sleeves and start a general bleaning of this country from the red element, threatening not only the League of Nations, created by Mr. Wilson, but our own country as well. The investigation conducted by the U. S. Senate corroborated our opinion by finding that Bolshevism in America is not only existing, but is growing rapidly, and is a real menace. The well known fact is that for a long period of time this Bolshevism movement was receiving moral and financial help from America. After the downfall of tsarism in Russia a group of 4000 Jews from New York left for Petrograd where they helped to overthrow Kerensky's government. They were Trotzky's and Lenin's advance-guard and, aided by thousands of their racial brothers in Russia, they resorted to terrorism and established in that unlucky country the Bolshevik regime.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0310.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is obvious that a country which has sent to Russia many Bolshevik half-wits and has helped them with money collected in New York, Chicago and other Jewish centers, cannot be free from this red plague. It is evident that propagnda in this country is conducted according to orders from the Soviets.</p>
   <p>Dr. Simmonds' testimony before the Senate commission proved that Communism is more deeply rooted than was supposed and for some time was laying low, being secreted in many labor and political organizations, and was awaiting for opportunity to strike. Bolshevik propaganda is conducted in this country by traveling orators and agitators, and by mass distribution of printed literature, such as pamphlets, newspapers, and magazines. All this destructive work is conducted by the Jews from the East Side of New York, who are the brains of this movement.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0311.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Further Dr. Simmonds proved that known American writers, such as John Reed and Albert R. Williams, are closely connected with the Soviet government. He pointed to the Bolshevik literature in America as the chief means of propaganda, such literature being published by the Rand School of Social Science, New York; Chas. Kerr &amp; Co., of Chicago; the Socialist Literature, New York, and the Russian Daily Novyi Mir, New York, where Trotzky was employed some time ago as a co-editor. Another witness, called by the Senate Investigation Communists, was former Russian Consular agent for the United States, Ralph Dennis. He testified that, according to is observation for a period of two years, Russian people are not confirmed Communists, but Jews forced the idea upon them by terror. The terror was used to such an extent that whoever refused to adopt the Bolshevik doctrine was murdered. He further testified that funds used for propaganda in America were collected in this country and partially were received from the Soviets. Major Hume proved with the records that Lenin's government, on December 17, 1917, alloted two million dollars for Bolshevik propaganda, especially in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0312.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Professor Dennis further testified that upon his return to America he attended a mass meeting at the Coliseum in Chicago and was very much surprised when masses of workers applauded every mention of Trotzky's name and the words of the orator who openly told them that the next country ruled by Bolsheviks will be the United States.</p>
   <p>The Senate investigation and all testimonials proved beyond a doubt that the Jews are the chief instigators of that destructive propaganda, and what they accomplished in poor Russia they are trying to do in America.</p>
   <p>The red plague is spreading again that Mr. Wilson on his return should roll up his sleeves and start a general cleaning in order to prevent is ideals from being marred by the Communist Jewry.</p>
