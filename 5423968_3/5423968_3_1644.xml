   <p>Mr. John Czekala was born in 1861 in Rosek, in the province of Posen,Poland. He came to America with his parents in 1868 when only seven years old. At first his parents settled in Toledo, Ohio, but in 1872 they moved to Chicago and established themselves in Stanislawowo (the section around the St. Stanislas Church, in the northwestern part of the city). He received his initial schooling in the St. Stanislas parish school; later he attended evening classes in American schools, working at the same time at various jobs.</p>
   <p>In 1896 the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, appointed him to the St. Stanislas parish committee, of which he is still a member. In the political life of Chicago Mr. Czekala plays an important role. From 1899 to 1903 he held the office of deputy coroner; in 1909 he was appointed deputy sheriff; in 1911 he was elected alderman of the Sixteenth Ward for the first time. From 1914 to 1918 he held office as a keeper of records in the City Hall;</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1645.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>later he was elected alderman of the Sixteenth Ward for the second time, and he has represented the Ward in the City Hall ever since.</p>
   <p>Mr. Czekala belongs to many different societies and organizations such as the Polish Roman Catholic Union, in which he held the office of treasurer from 1909 to 1913. He was elected director of the Union for four years by its national convention. He has been member of the St. Cecilia Society for the last thirty years, a member of the St. Stanislas Church choir for more than thirty-five years, and a member of a dramatic club for thirty years. For the last fifteen years he has been president of the Building and Loan Association in St. Stanislas' parish; he has been a director of this financial institution since its foundation.</p>
   <p>In 1899 Mr. Czekala married Miss Cecily Solinska, the daughter of old settlers in St. Stanislas' parish. They have two daughters, of whom one is married, and four sons, the youngest of whom, Edward, is a student at Northwestern University. Mr. Czekala always takes a very active part <pb facs="5423968_3_1646.jpg" n="3"/>in the social and political life of the community.</p>
   <p>He is also interested in patriotic work. The success of the Polish Loan campaign is due in great measure to his efforts. He made many speeches connected with this campaign for Poland before various organizations and assemblies.</p>
   <p>As an alderman he has always been a strong and worthy representative in the City Hall of the Chicago Polonia.</p>
   <p>He is a fine, agreeable type of Polish-American, a man always courteous and obliging, always smiling, a man with many true friends in our local Polonia.</p>
