   <p>Members of the Avondale Improvement Club expressed their indignation in the meeting held last Sunday afternoon in St. Hyacinth's parish hall and condemned the actions of some street and alley inspectors and garbage and ash collectors for their demand of payment by householders for collecting garbage and ashes from the rear of buildings in the Avondale district. Indignation reached such a point that a proper resolution was passed condemning the practice of graft extorted by the street and alley inspectors and the drivers under their supervision. It was decided to send a copy of this resolution to Mayor Thompson, to the superintendent of public works, to both aldermen of this Ward, to the committeeman, to the Ward superintendent, and to all the Polish papers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Avondale Improvement Club was organized a little more than a year ago when some private companies had sent exorbitant bills to householders for the pavement of alleys in the Avondale district. This newly organized Club <pb facs="5423968_3_1764.jpg" n="2"/>was forced to take action against the exploitation and cheating of the citizens, frequently practiced by politicians. The Club is striving to enroll in its membership all the right-thinking citizens of Avondale.</p>
   <p>A committee was also elected at this meeting for the purpose of improving streetcar transportation in the district, especially during the morning hours when people going to work are forced almost invariably to hang on to the streetcar platforms.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected for the year 1922: A. J. Plocinski, president; J. Rezmer and Mrs. J. Rossow, vice-presidents; T. Piskorz, secretary; M. Jasiewicz, collector [sic]; F. Rezmer, treasurer; Messrs. F. Winkleman, J. Kielbasa, L. Stankowicz, J. Haydis, and A. Rospond, directors; A. Adamik and B. Wolf, marshals; S. Adawis and J. Paliwoda, press committee; A. Kloska, H. Cholewszczynski, A. Pokornowski, A. Zalugo, and A. Dudek, welfare committee; and T. Jaszkowski, A. Tworek, and J. Niemiec, streetcar committee.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned resolution is as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1765.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Whereas, many of our members made complaint at our last meeting that some street and alley inspectors and the garbage and ash collectors who are under their supervision demand payment for collecting garbage and ashes from the alleys in the rear of their houses and insult those who refuse to pay them graft, therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we, members of the Avondale Improvement Club, [do hereby] express our indignation at such actions and condemn the low and contemptible conduct of the above-mentioned street inspectors and drivers in demanding graft for work paid for by the city from funds paid to the city treasury in taxes by the householders of our district; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mayor William Hale Thompson, to Mr. Charles Francis, commissioner of public works, to both aldermen of the Twenty-seventh Ward, to the committeeman of the Ward, to the superintendent of the Twenty-seventh Ward, and to the Polish newspapers in Chicago, that they may put a stop immediately to such abuses, and that <pb facs="5423968_3_1766.jpg" n="4"/>the city employees may treat Polish citizens in Avondale decently and with respect, since at present the citizens of Chicago pay enough to the city treasury, and in fact taxes are higher than ever before, and that the cleaning of alleys may be accomplished without graft or special payments, since payments for such services has previously been made, as required by law, by the citizens.</p>
   <p>Avondale Improvement Club</p>
   <p>A. J. Plocinski, president</p>
   <p>Theophil Piskorz, secretary</p>
