  <body>
   <p>A mass meeting of Polish citizens of the Sixteenth Ward was held yesterday, at 8 P. M., at which Mr. Anthony Rudnicki presided and Mr. Francis Fuhl acted as secretary. Several hundred citizens gathered for this meeting, who, after numerous orations, decided to support the re-election of Mr. Durborrow to the United States Congress and Mr. John Kwasigroch to the Illinois State Legislature. Twenty-five new members joined the Polish-American Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward, which had undertaken the task of calling this meeting.</p>
   <p>One commendable thing about yesterday's meeting, was that Mr. Louis Roland, in his interesting speech, made known to the audience the duties of Senators and Representatives in Congress, and Senators and Representatives in the State Legislature. Such educational political speeches are so very necessary to us that we hope they will occur more frequently.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Club will be held this coming Sunday, August 7, at 8 P. M.</p>
