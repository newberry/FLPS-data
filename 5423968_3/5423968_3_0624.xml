  <body>
   <p>We should have known for a long time the indisputable fact that the only one valued is he who has power and proper authority. When Ireland, small relatively to Poland, conducted a struggle for her rights, everyone from among the unprejudiced had to notice how helpful in each respect was the American press, what readiness could be noticeable in Congress and in the influential circles in Washington to carry aid to her.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, in matters of most vital importance to Poland, a certain indifference could be noticeable toward us. All of our most justifiable demands were accepted with certain reservations, and in many instances calumnies were thrown in our face. We were called a troublesome nation and aggressive towards others. Likewise, everyone could not help seeing how ready the average American was to accept as true the report abou the Jewish pogroms in Poland and what number of commentators, harming our nation, could be found in the press.</p>
   <p>Others are superior to us in this respect. These facts illustrate most eloquently in the world how important, in the forming of public opinion in America, is the numerical proportion of votes which can be cast by a certain nationality at election, and its participation in the public life of that country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When an Irishman, Israelite, German or Scandinavian comes to this country, he not only tries to master its language, but immediately endeavors to become a citizen and in this way he becomes an important factor at election which whom one must reckon. That is why the people aspiring to public office turn very melancholy eyes upon these nationalities and in every possible way try to follow their hand. Meanwhile we sleep - the public life of this country concerns us very little, and even if numerically we constitute a very important power, it practically represents no value - because the majority of our people have no citizenship papers. Even when we have the papers many of us do not even register and vote, and due to this we quite often undergo defeat, where victory for us should be certain.</p>
   <p>In Cook county and in the city of Chicago we have at present a very rare opportunity to prove that we have cured ourselves of the malady of indifference, that we have come to understand what benefits can be brought to us by our active participation in politics of this country, and that those times have gone forever when influential persons could pass over us with disregard.</p>
   <p>Jarecki has a good record. The committee from fifteen regular Democratic organizations throughout Cool county, after a stubborn struggle, has offered to our nationality the very influential office of county judge, and it ought to be a point of honor to gain this office at any cost.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0626.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The choice came upon a man whose record in public life is a proud sign of our national integrity and our ability to hold the offices of public trust.</p>
   <p>As a municipal judge, Mr. Jarecki had gained recognition here from everybody for his honesty and impartiality in valuing the matters entrusted to him. As a citizen, for the work full of devotion to his countrymen, he has earned for himself their love and recognition, and at the same time the highest respect of other nationalities. A man of remarkable qualities is stepping today into the election battle not from any selfish motives, but with the conviction that in reaching for this high office, he is rendering to Polish society a remarkable service, and that the honor which will fall upon him with his eventual election will become the property of his fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>Judge Jarecki outlined many times, while speaking in public, his stand in this respect and that is why we take the privilege of quoting his words, which ought to speak unto our hearts most eloquently:</p>
   <p>This is what he says about himself: "If it concerned me personally, I would aspire for the peaceful and not so responsible office of a local judge, which I could gain without much difficulty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0627.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Throwing myself into the whirlpool of the election battle for such a responsible and influential office of county judge, I am doing it with the conviction that through this I render unto my fellow countrymen a certain service. Through their interest in the struggle taken by wider masses of citizens of POlish descent, we will be able to demonstrate to the Americans that we constitute an important factor in politics. By acquiring this office we will become, in the county and state, a first-rate and influential power, having a decided influence on the election and the possibility of occupying very important offices. The overwhelming amount of work which awaits me after my election does not frighten me, because I am conscious of the fact that I will be able to accomplish something for my fellow countrymen and for future generations. But above all, what concerns me at present is that with the primaries being close at hand, all Poles should register and those who already have their first citizenship papers and the possibility of getting the second, should do so before the November election, so that we could be able to show our strength numerically. WIthout regard for my personal chances a marked increase of the Polish vote would be for us politically a great success."</p>
   <p>He does not desire honor for himself. Does Judge Jarecki demand a great sacrifice from us? Does any personal interest guide him? No! He only wishes to struggle in order to increase the importance of Poles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0628.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>In this respect he spares neither costs, time, or any tedious work so as to gain for us a powerful and very influential position.</p>
   <p>It is high time that we gained in this country the same recognition the Irish and other nationalities have and we will be able to do that when we act and not moan. We are always ready for complaints and protests, but we forget that our best protest is the vote cast at the polls, that is our power. When we acquire in Cook county the most influential office of county judge, then, finally, the eye sof others will open and they will see that "those Poles" do amount to something in this country, if they are able to put forth and elect one of their own to a leader office.</p>
   <p>Let us set aside all disputes about trifles and things of very little meaning. Let us work perseveringly towards one outstanding aim. Let us show that we are a great nation, thinking and understanding our interests and that in politics we are not only as able as others, but in every respect we able to excel. Then our desires will find different response, and we will be able to serve our Fatherland in a better way, because the influential spheres in the city as well as the state and country will recognize that the Polies have an overwhelming power of votes which are always able to balance the scales.</p>
