   <p>Conditions in Chicago at present are worse than in Russia.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shippy, the famous Chief of Police in Chicago, prohibited displaying the picture of two boys clothed in rags, in front of Brand's Hall where a convention of the Socialist Party is being held.</p>
   <p>This picture was shown just before another representing a rich lady's poodle dog, dressed in rich velvet.</p>
   <p>Besides these two illustrations, depicting the difference between the social classes, were others. One showed the beautiful interior of a millionaire's luxury railroad car, with a workingman sitting under a freight car. Another picture represented the interior of a workingman's living quarters and the interior of a bedroom in the St. Regis Hotel.</p>
   <p>These pictures were arranged for the purpose of showing the difference between classes in our present capitalistic era; and, therefore, appeared to our policeman as dangerous as anarchistic agitation, or perhaps as dynamite.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0421.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Reformers of the Miss Jane Addams' type have complained quite often that the Chicago police, with their brutal behavior, resembles the Russian police more and more every day. Miss Addams should have no cause for complaint against the brutality of the Russian police, who may learn how to commit outrages from the Chicago police.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Collins, our former Chief of Police, must answer before the courts for using the Police Department for the purpose of opposing one political party and placing the police at the service of another party.</p>
   <p>Is not the conduct of our present Chief of Police a sure sign of the opposition toward one political party for the benefit of another?</p>
   <p>But who is Shippy, if not a hireling of the capitalists, the republicans? What is the Republican Party? Is it not the expression of its electors, who are mostly workingmen?</p>
   <p>This brings us to the conclusion that the workingman puts his head into a muzzle every time he votes for the Republican Party.</p>
