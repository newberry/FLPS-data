   <p>Not long ago we called the attention of our Polish politicians,to political clubs that in order to gain more influence in local and national politics, it is necessary to have such clubs, not the kind which pass the collection bag before the election, but the kind that would act as a school.</p>
   <p>In our circumstances politics should be conducted in a different way. Germans, Swedes, and Irish distinguish themselves by becoming citizens as soon as possible and joining one of the political parties, either one or the other.</p>
   <p>State, county and ward clubs of those nationalities know very well what goes on and how strong they are; if they are not sure of winning they compromise with so-called (by them) foreign voters, with the result that they come out victorious.</p>
   <p>We are different. Our people, due to laziness, neglect to study the <pb facs="5423968_3_1179.jpg" n="2"/>language of the country, and only those apply for citizen papers who lose their jobs in the factories on account of not having them.</p>
   <p>The citizens of other nationalities read newspapers and know what is going on in politics. They know the principles of all parties and do not neglect political campaigns. On the contrary, our people have no idea about politics and care still less for citizenship; therefore very little attention is paid to "foreigners" by the politicians, if they do, it is only when they need their votes for the election of their candidates; for that they throw us a bone by giving us some insignificant job.</p>
   <p>The cause of this evil is the lack of well organized clubs through which our people could enlighten themselves about political matters. Such clubs should also teach English and prepare our people for citizenship. It is true that such action is connected with some expense, but this would be willingly covered by those who would like to become citizens and take <pb facs="5423968_3_1180.jpg" n="3"/>part in American life.</p>
   <p>We have only one such club in Chicago, and that is in St. Adalbert's parish. We do not know of any other Polish political clubs.</p>
   <p>Politics play a very important part in Chicago and for that reason we should take an active part.</p>
