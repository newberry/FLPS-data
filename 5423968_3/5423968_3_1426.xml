<title level="a">S. H. KUNZ, FIRST POLISH CONGRESSMAN FROM CHICAGO</title>
</bibl>

  </front>
  <body>
   <p>After a long struggle, the Chicago Poles succeeded in electing the first Polish congressman. So far no Polish newspaper has furnished any information concerning his fruitful activities in Washington. Being of retiring disposition, Congressman Stanislaus H. Kunz avoided publicity. Only persons having something to do with the Federal Government had an opportunity to convince themselves that our representative must have had developed some influence, because he was able to adjust favorably some of the very intricate cases of those who had elected him. His willingness to serve the public in any good cause won their hearts for him. Whenever Congressman Kunz stays in Chicago, his doors are not closed to anyone. Everyone gets some advice or help from him. When Mr. Kunz is in Washington, he pays particular attention to the letters addressed to him; they must have immediate attention. It is understood that uncertainty causes many hardships to those who are waiting for the adjustment of some matter.</p>
   <p>The district which Congressman Kunz represents has a good deal of correspondence. Although the majority of the people inhabiting Mr. Kunz's district are Poles, the Italians and the Jews, who constitute the minority do their business through him.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1427.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Quite often Mr. Kunz must intervene in passport difficulties and at the immigration office in order to effect the entry of a newcomer into this country. The new immigration laws are very complicated and admit only a certain percentage of every nationality; they have not been in use long and cause many hardships to the immigrants. If the immigrant can not find someone who can help him, he must wait a long time at Ellis Island or be deported. Mr. Kunz has helped thousands of these unfortunate immigrants. This is a very beautiful page in the history of his life. As you know, Mr. Kunz is a Democrat and because of that, has some difficulties during the present Republican Congress. In spite of the fact that Mr. Kunz is a Democrat, he managed to win his colleagues to him, gaining their confidence and respect. Today they are glad to help him in his endeavors. There is a saying in Washington that Congressman Kunz gets everywhere and that he possesses unusual political <pb facs="5423968_3_1428.jpg" n="3"/>abilities. His name appears in Washington newspapers.</p>
   <p>He is interested in the World War Veterans and gets many letters from them.</p>
   <p>Mr Kunz uses very beautiful English and has very good pronunciation. That is a great help to him. When asked what the secret of his popularity is, he answered, "I try to serve the public."</p>
