  <body>
   <p>The struggle undertaken by the Polish Printers' Union is just, deserving support and attention from all angles.</p>
   <p>The printers turn toward the public, because they are convinced that the existence of the world depends on them.</p>
   <p>The public reads and subscribes to the newspapers and with their pennies upholds the high priced editors, managers and machinists of the paper.</p>
   <p>The public who, with their cents, pay for every edition of the paper, help the"scabs."</p>
   <p>If the public would suddenly stop supporting the papers, stop giving them their pennies, fail to support them with advertisements - where then could they possibly find the money necessary for the existence of the paper?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0082.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thus, by this method the public would force the editor to bow his head before the union; before the public.</p>
   <p>Similar action was portrayed by the people of Milwaukee and forced Kruszka, the editor of the Polish Courier to discontinue his battles with the union.</p>
   <p>A similar method ought to be used by the people of Chicago, and have Gordon, editor of the Polish Daily News, bend his neck before the will of the thousands subscribing workers.</p>
   <p>In unionism there is strength! United we can conquer those exploiters, those well dressed, whether in dress suits or priestly robes.</p>
