<title level="a">KU KLUX KLAN THREATENS ALDERMAN WALKOWIAK WITH DEATH</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Since the City Council undertook the matter of the Ku Klux Klan's activities in Chicago, and in order to put through an inquiry, appointed a special committee of five, it being charged that among the various city departments there are functionaries who are members of the klan; the members of the committee have received threatening letters from the members and sympathizers of the Ku Klux Klan, to which they have not paid much attention.</p>
   <p>But yesterday two members of the Council, namely, S. S. Walkowiak, from the 31st ward (formerly the 17th), and Louis B. Anderson, of the 2nd war (colored) received letters threatening death.</p>
   <p>These letters are of the same tenor, written by one person and sighed <pb facs="5423968_3_0234.jpg" n="2"/>by a 'Kleagle' (a high official and organizer of the Ku Klux Klan), who threatens that if the aldermen do not cease their inquiry, death is awaiting them and their families. Their homes will be blown up, because, as threatens the aforesaid mysterious kleagle, the Ku Klux Klan can and knows how to use other means besides tar and feathers in order to subdue and punish its enemies.</p>
   <p>A representative of Dziennik Zjednoczenia turned for information in this matter to one of the interested persons, namely, Alderman Walkowiak.</p>
   <p>Alderman Walkowiak corroborated everything and showed a whole bundle of letters which he has lately received from the klansmen. He has already turned over to the police the last letter with the threat of death to him and his family. Among the others, two are worth mentioning because in them Alderman Walkowiak is especially attacked as a Catholic <pb facs="5423968_3_0235.jpg" n="3"/>and Pole; as such he is well known. Nothing can be used against him as being an American citizen. He stands faithfully by the faith of his fathers and the Polish nationality, which is a corroboration of the fact that in order to be a good American one does not have to deny either his faith or nationality.</p>
   <p>One of the letters reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Alderman, as long as you come out against the Ku Klux</p>
   <p>Klan, therefore you are not a good American, only a foreigner,</p>
   <p>and as such your deserve to have your head shot off, which</p>
   <p>finally is what all of your kind deserve."</p>
   <p>It is known that the Ku Klux Klan has as its aims, among others, a battle against Catholics and foreigners; it is therefore, in reality, an un-American organization because it is contrary to the spirit of tolerance and liberty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0236.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In the other letter some klansman signed as L. Reeves writes in this manner to Alderman Walkowiak:</p>
   <p>"Sir: Five dollars and naturalization papers do not yet make</p>
   <p>an American. Since when does a bunch of foreigners have a</p>
   <p>right to dictate to real Americans what sort of society</p>
   <p>they should organize? Catholicism is not American. Whoever</p>
   <p>comes out against the K. K. K. is not an American. As yet</p>
   <p>I am not a klansman but I am now joining the K. K. K. because</p>
   <p>there are too many over here like you, sir, Mr. Alderman."</p>
   <p>"This does not move me," said Alderman Walkowiak to our representative, "and I will carry on in the same way because that is why the citizens elected me as their alderman, so that I would guard their matters, therefore, I will never disappoint them, and I do not make much of threats from cranks."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0237.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It is proper to add that Alderman Walkowiak is honorably representing the 31st ward (formerly the 17th) in the City Council, and the fact that he is active there is best proved by the very threatening letters which he is receiving. He enters into the make-up of the most important committees, a credit to him, and through him to the 31st ward. The citizens of this ward can be well proud of having a representative such as is alderman Walkowiak.</p>
