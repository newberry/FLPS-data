<title level="a">ELECTION OF ALDERMEN</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Today is election day for aldermen and other city officials--a very important day for Chicago. Whether the city is to go forward along the road of progress and general welfare or go backward depends upon the election of the right candidates. A great deal depends on the aldermen, since it is they who can put an end to innumerable abuses by passing appropriate ordinances and by seeing to it that they are not violated by the people and the police.</p>
   <p>The city needs a City Council, but this Council must be efficient and honest. To vote for candidates with dirty, repulsive records is a crime which will affect all the people.</p>
   <p>There are a great many things which should be done in Chicago. To begin with, an end should be put to the robbing of the people by speculators. The police <pb facs="5423968_3_1768.jpg" n="2"/>should not be permitted to beat innocent people over the head with their clubs or to protect prostitutes, pimps, and thieves. The working class should be aided in its fight for a better standard of living. The city should be cleaned of dirt and rubbish. These are the problems which it should be the main purpose of the new aldermen to solve.</p>
   <p>We need people with a clear conscience and impeccable character in the City Council. Remember this, compatriots, when you go to the polls to cast your vote.</p>
   <p>We Poles need our own people in the City Council; therefore, vote only for your own people. The polls will be open until 4 P. M.</p>
