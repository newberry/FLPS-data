   <p>Countrymen!</p>
   <p>The necessity for a strong and permanent political organization--an organization dedicated especially to the interests of the Poles--daily becomes more and more evident. Thus far we have no such organization, and the natural result of this is a necessity of turning to others for that which can easily be accomplished by ourselves.</p>
   <p>The Poles who live in Chicago constitute an important part of the city's population, but in spite of this they do not get the proper recognition because of lack of organization, lack of uniform direction, and the comminution of effort.</p>
   <p>In order to circumvent this, in order to bring about a greater significance <pb facs="5423968_3_1267.jpg" n="2"/>of the Poles in American politics, a temporary Polish-American Central Committee has been organized.</p>
   <p>This committee proposes:</p>
   <p>1. To join all Polish Democratic Clubs in Chicago and Cook County into one political unit.</p>
   <p>2. To bring about the recognition that the Poles rightly deserve and to raise the Poles' political significance in general.</p>
   <p>In accordance with these aims, the Central Committee asks each Polish Democratic Club in Chicago and Cook County to appoint two delegates, or committeemen, to membership in the Central Committee. Every ward in which Poles live has a right to appoint two committeemen. Ward conventions will be held, to which one delegate per hundred registered voters will be elected; these delegates will in turn elect two committeemen for the term of <pb facs="5423968_3_1268.jpg" n="3"/>one year.</p>
   <p>The committeemen will gather at the headquarters, 137 Monroe Street, on December 3, 1893, for a general meeting, at which a permanent organization will be effected. Committeemen must present their credentials at this meeting.</p>
   <p>In behalf of the temporary Committee of the Polish Democratic Organization,</p>
   <p>Stanley Kunz.</p>
