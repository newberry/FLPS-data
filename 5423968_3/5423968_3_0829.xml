   <p>As a candidate for the office of County Recorder from the Republican Party, I am calling to all citizens in Cook County, especially to my fellow citizens and co-citizens, asking them for active support of me on primary day, Saturday, August 8, 1908.</p>
   <p>I am openly stating that there isn't any other Polish candidate seeking this office from either the Republican or Democratic Party. My opponent seeking the nomination for this high office from the Republican Party, is the present County Recorder Mr. Abel Davis.</p>
   <p>I think that everyone knows that Mr. Davis is not a Pole, and even not a friend of the Poles. Although he received his position as a candidate from a ward populated mostly by Poles, and through the aid of Polish politicians, there is not a single Polish person working in his office. But there are people of other nationalities from this Polish ward who are working in Mr. Davis' office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0830.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Isn't this the best evidence that he disregards our Polish votes, although the last time he was elected by these votes? It is plain that he ignores the same Poles who were partly responsible for his last election. If he were one of those who, feeling that with the aid of the Poles they were elected, are grateful and show some appreciation for this service, the Poles would support him for re-election. But this is not so. In order to put an end to his false utterances about the Poles, and to give the Polish people a chance in regard to employment for their services, the Poles are nominating their own fellow countryman for this office.</p>
   <p>I am asking all the Polish citizens that on primary day they vote for their fellow countryman who seeks the county recorder's office, and support all the other Polish candidates seeking to be elected. All you, Polish people, should know by now that if you can't get results from the present office-holder, you should vote for the Polish candidate. He can do more for you because he is your flesh and blood.</p>
   <p>I am sure that he will live up to his pledges and vows and fulfill the people's every wish.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0831.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We can prove that Mr. Abel Davis hasn't done anything for us. We shouldn't let a man like Davis be re-elected; we should prevent him from continuing his false and unscrupulous work, which keeps us from advancing in the political work.</p>
   <p>My past is open for everyone to read. I was born in Kwiestwie, Poland, in the year of 1874, and migrated with my parents to America in 1881. My parents are still living and are residing in the Northwest Side of Chicago. I attended St. Stanislaus parochial school and the Chicago Business College. I opened my office of business in partnership with Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, selling real estate and fire insurance, at 2593 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>Fellow citizens, I am stepping out as a candidate for an important office of county recorder, not only to better my social and political standing, but to better the name of the Poles as a nationality and a good class of people. We should stand together, arm to arm, and show <pb facs="5423968_3_0832.jpg" n="4"/>the other nationalities that they cannot buy our Polish votes or listen to their lies, that whenever election time is on hand, the politicians have the Polish votes in their pockets.</p>
   <p>I am sure that if all my fellow citizens do their duty on primary day and support me faithfully instead of Mr. Davis, they will have a Polish county recorder. I have the support and backing of Governor Richard Yates, Congressman William Lorrimer, and Judge Willard M. McEven.</p>
   <p>I feel sure that with the above mentioned men supporting me for this office, I, Edmund Szajkowski, will no doubt receive the election as county recorder. This will be a day of rejoicing when the Polish citizens and their candidates will be on an equal par with the others.</p>
   <p>Edmund Szajkowski</p>
   <p>Candidate for County Recorder's Office.</p>
