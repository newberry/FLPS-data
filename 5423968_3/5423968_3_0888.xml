   <p>Tuesday, February 14, 1905, between the hours of 12 o'clock noon to 7 P. M., the primary election will take place in Chicago for city offices, but the most important is the aldermanic issue. This election is very important, and we should stop and consider the value it will have for the future, for the good of all Poles.</p>
   <p>In the 5th Ward we have the opportunity to show our true Polish political spirit by supporting one of our native sons seeking the aldermanic office on the Republican ticket, it is none other than Andrew Leszczynski.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leszczynski was born in the year 1871 in the town of Dobro, near the city of Warsaw. He came to America in 1888, and has resided for the last fourteen years in Chicago. He is in every way a true Pole, had a good education, is intelligent in every respect, kind hearted, energetic, ambitious, and a respected citizen in this city. His main ambition is to reach the top in the political world, and in his old age take life easy.</p>
   <p>What not promises will always be done, and he feels happy and contented that not only his own people, but other nationalities, because of his record in the past, will help to nominate him to that office; and he will at last be able to help the Polish people to receive recognition as a political group in this city.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0889.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For the first time, we Poles of the 5th Ward, will have an opportunity to elect our own Polish alderman, and we should not forget that on election day. We should go to the polling place and cast our votes for a man best suited for this office.</p>
   <p>Citizens' League</p>
