   <p>At last the law is after the notorious labor union sluggers who having gained the confidence of organized labor, spread terror and anarchy in the ranks of workingmen, and become the traitors, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> than the friends of organized labor. The jury, which has <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>by the state's attorney and by the attorney <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> has found four of them guilty of criminal attacks and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> organizations. These <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> have occurred quite <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the city <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> still ineffectually enforced, which will eventually curb these outrages, when public opinion will be stirred. This opinion was strained even Among the workingmen themselves, who did not want the sluggers to enjoy themselves at the expense of the workingmen's ideals; for the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> just plain outlaws not having anything to do with read work.</p>
   <p>Organized labor is a great thing, it is a battering ram crushing the walls of <pb facs="5423968_3_0064.jpg" n="2"/>capitalism. Most people sympathize with the intelligent organized working man, but they detest gangsters.</p>
   <p>With whom did these sluggers pretending to be friends of the workingmen, fight? Did they fight against the capitalists? Did they demand shorter hours and higher wages for the working; class? Did they try to eliminate abuses which cause harm to workingmen employed in factories and other places? Not at all. They were settling their personal grievances at the expense of the workingmen, and, like thugs, were attacking workingmen who refused to be dominated by them.</p>
   <p>There are many labor unions in Chicago, belonging to the same organization and yet fighting one another. Each of these unions has a leader who has nothing to do with real work. These leaders live at the expense of the workingmen; they oppose one another furiously and quite often fight bloody battles. If these leaders were fighting only among themselves, if they would perforate with bullets, and stab with knives, only their own bodies, it would not be so bad; but alas, these cowards also attack the workingmen of <pb facs="5423968_3_0065.jpg" n="3"/>other unions, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and then they run away in an automobile. These outrages were so terrible that the law stepped in and will undoubtedly punish them. It is high time for stopping such <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> for even the lives of workingmen belonging to the labor <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> not safe.</p>
   <p>Just imagine a split in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> account of the intrigues of its leaders, dividing the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> The workingmen of either faction receive same <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the union in any of the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the opposite faction invade the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> with knives the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and depart like <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> punished severely by law.</p>
   <p>This <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> condition has existed and still exists in Chicago. A very bitter conflict existed between the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Association, and the International Steamfitters and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. This feud was started by the leaders and caused much bloodshed. The leaders of the first union organized a band of sluggers, who attacked systematically the members of the other <pb facs="5423968_3_0066.jpg" n="4"/>union and wounded many of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>police arrested a few of the sluggers and brought them before the justice. The evidence against the sluggers was so overwhelming that the jury, consisting of workingmen,union members,and not capitalists, found the sluggers guilty of common crime. Their verdict imposed <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> The quality were Million Connor, Peter Gentlemen, Arthur O'Connor, and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. None of them was a Pole. There men are guilty of many crimes,including murder.</p>
   <p>We sympathize with the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and other outrage committed of the union <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> They should be punished.</p>
