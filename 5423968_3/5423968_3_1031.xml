  <body>
   <p>Many times we have mentioned the importance of solidarity during the election period, and, if this is not enough, last year's election should be a good lesson to us. In tomorrow's election, we should take advantage of solidarity, and every Pole should cast his vote for our candidates.</p>
   <p>Although last year we were successful in electing Peter Kiolbassa as City Treasurer, the split in the Democratic ranks resulted in the defeat of the regular Democratic ticket. As a result, many of our candidates were defeated.</p>
   <p>Who incited at that time the Polish people against their own candidates? Who helped the German faction to cause a split among the Democratic ranks and bring about the defeat of many Polish candidates? Who caused the Polish people the most harm? The one responsible for all this is the same man who now says that he is a Pole, but who is trying to split the regular Democratic vote again by running as an independent candidate. It was he who caused a split in the Polish vote last year, and it is he who <pb facs="5423968_3_1032.jpg" n="2"/>is trying to repeat the same thing now.</p>
   <p>The Poles of the 16th Ward should not let themselves be duped for the second time by a man who one year claims that he is a German working for the benefit of the Germans and with them, and the next that he is a Pole, only to cause another split in the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>We wish to call your attention to the circular accompanying this paper regarding the candidates on the regular Democratic ticket. For the present, We wish to point out that the attack against Peter J. Ellert, regular Democratic candidate for alderman, is unjust. Every Pole of the 16th Ward can vote without fear for this regular Democratic candidate, for there is no truth to the claim that he is a 'Deputy' of some kind of secret organization.</p>
   <p>The above has been officially substantiated by the following:</p>
   <p>"State of Illinois,</p>
   <p>County of Cook.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1033.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Peter J. Ellert has taken oath before me, Peter J. Kiolbassa, notary public for the County of Cook, State of Illinois, this fourth day of April, 1892, and said: My name is Peter J. Ellert. I am no 'Deputy' nor do I belong to any secret Society or Alliance of persons that oppose Catholicism. It is my belief that any such society that tries to influence any candidate with its concepts, is un-American and detrimental to any political group.</p>
   <p>Peter J. Ellert.</p>
   <p>"Signed and acknowledged in my presence this day, April 4, 1892.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa,</p>
   <p>Notary Public."</p>
   <p>Do not permit yourselves to be duped again. Let last year's lesson suffice. Go to the polls tomorrow and vote the regular Democratic party ticket.</p>
