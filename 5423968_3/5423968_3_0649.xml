   <p>While the results of the primary election of September, 1918, are evidence of the sincere desire of the people to bring the World War to a victorious end, nevertheless they failed to fulfill the expectations of the Poles. Our people have failed to gain the very thing that they so earnestly desired. They did not gain what Polish honor required of them. Ambitions and petty local and personal differences disrupted our national unity. Our people have failed to achieve the necessary political solidarity, and in their blindness they have buried their chances for representation in Congress. The Polish element, embittered by such base conduct, will ultimately take energetic steps to expose the dissenters from Polish solidarity who abuse their authority. They will be deprived of their powers once their nefarious and underhand activities are brought before the bar of public opinion.</p>
   <p>Enough of this disgraceful abuse of our national honor! The betrayal of Mr. F. Koralewski as an individual would be insignificant were it not for the fact that his candidacy embodied the hopes of the Polish people to express <pb facs="5423968_3_0650.jpg" n="2"/>themselves in Congress through their own Representative. Let those gentlemen who are responsible for this betrayal ask their own consciences whether they still have the right to expect the confidence of Polish voters. They had better retire from public life lest the embittered Polish voters sweep them from the political scene once and for all. Thanks to these gentlemen, the Polish voters of a purely Polish district are entirely dependent upon the good graces of Mr. Thomas Gallagher. He is unfamiliar with our interests and is not in the least concerned with our Polish national cause.</p>
   <p>Just words of reproach are also due to Polish Republican voters. They allowed an almost certain nomination to be torn from their grasp. It was unpardenable carelessness. They might easily have foreseen that the intrigues in the Democratic camp, which for the last several years have acquired an almost chronic character, would make impossible the nomination of a Polish candidate. They had an extremely well-qualified candidate who enjoyed general respect, and whose name carries no little weight in authoritative circles. With Mr. <pb facs="5423968_3_0651.jpg" n="3"/>Max Kaczmarek the Poles could easily have won the nomination and have saved the Polish national cause. Unfortunately, the Republican leaders were entirely indifferent to this matter. Their indifference allowed the nomination of Mr. Pocelli of the disloyal Thompson faction, in a Polish Republican district. Well, Polish Republicans, this does not reflect great credit upon you.</p>
   <p>The generally popular Republican candidate for clerk of the municipal court, Mr. John Pelka, failed to gain the nomination despite the fact that his victory was said to be assured. It would have been better to boast less and to work more, and victory would not have been snatched from us. Luckily for us Mr. Frank Rydzewski gained the Democratic nomination for this office and in that way maintains our prestige.</p>
   <p>Among Poles, besides Mr. Rydzewski, the following have their victory assured on the Democratic ticket: Messrs A. Nowak and Thomas Kasperski, candidates for country commissioner, Joseph La Buy and S. Walkowiak candidates for judge <pb facs="5423968_3_0652.jpg" n="4"/>of the municipal court, and Vincent Zwiefka, Joseph Petlak, and D. Tysiak, candidates for state representative. Other results of the primary are as yet uncertain, since the countis not complete. Mr. Albert Rostenkowski gained the Republican nomination for State senator from the twenty-seventh senatorial district.</p>
   <p>Among our sympathizers Democratic nominations were received by Thomas Scully for the county court bench and Anthony Cermak for sheriff. Adolph Sabath [Jewish-Bohemian], a true friend of the Poles, gained the Democratic nomination for Representative to Congress from the Fifth District.</p>
