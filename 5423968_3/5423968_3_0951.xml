<title level="a">A TIMELY APPEAL FOR STANISLAUS KUNZ</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>An appeal appeared in the Sixteenth Ward today for the re-election of Alderman Stansilaus Kunz [he is running for re-election on the Democratic ticket on April 2]. This appeal is endorsed by the outstanding Polish citizens of this ward. This appeal reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"To the Polish [-American] citizens of the Sixteenth Ward:</p>
   <p>"Countrymen!</p>
   <p>"In the name of Polish solidarity, as your compatriot and fellow citizen, I wish to say a few words to you. As you all know, I have received the nomination for alderman of this ward on the regular Democratic ticket, thanks to your wholehearted support during the past four years. It is not necessary for me to use many words to introduce myself. You all know me, for I grew up among you. As alderman I have tried my best to do the most good for the Poles, and to help place them in city jobs. A large number of Polish citizens can confirm this at any time. If I am elected the third time as alderman, <pb facs="5423968_3_0952.jpg" n="2"/>having already served four years as one, and being thus enabled to get acquainted with many Americans and city officials, through your support I will be in a better position to serve you. I am not promising you much because he who does generally gives very little. I will only say that all my efforts will be expended in representing you fairly, fellow citizens. I will try my best in various ways to get for the Polish people the recognition which they deserve in the city administration. In return for all this, dear friends, I most kindly ask your support on election day.</p>
   <p>"Having been recommended through the kindness of the Polish citizens, and counting upon their solidarity and unanimous support, I remain</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"Stanislaus Kunz,</p>
   <p>"Candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0953.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The following endorsement was attached to this letter:</p>
   <p>"The undersigned not only gladly support Stanislaus Kunz as a candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, but we also have great hope that next Tuesday every Polish citizen will stand by us and vote for him.</p>
   <p>"It would be a great shame and loss to us if our Polish Sixteenth Ward should elect the German candidate.</p>
   <p>"It would be a shame, because other Polish communities would ridicule us for making a laughing stock of our patriotism. This would mean irreparable damage to us, for, if a German should take charge in the Sixteenth Ward, many Poles would lose their jobs. We are Poles; therefore, it is our national duty to give mutual support. It is hoped that not one Polish citizen will shirk his duty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0954.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"On election day, the various aversions, quarrels, misunderstandings, and petty private grievances should be cast aside.</p>
   <p>"Let us remember this: that the Germans are expending every energetic force to get their own candidate into office. They want to defeat us in this ward. Are we going to permit this? Never, nevermore! (sic) That is why, brothers, we should act in unison! If every Polish vote is cast for our Polish candidate only then will victory be assured. Let us not oversleep next Tuesday. Let us all appear at the polls and do our duty, and victory will be ours!</p>
   <p>"Compatriots! remembers the old Polish saying: 'As long as the world is going to be a world, a German will never be a brother to a Pole!' (sic)</p>
   <p>"Today, George C. Lenke, who has always hated and disregarded the Poles--for he is of the same spirit as Bismarck--is making high promises and also promises <pb facs="5423968_3_0955.jpg" n="5"/>gratitude. We are familiar with these tactics and know how much German promises are worth; for we have often been burnt (sic). He who has a Polish spirit and a Polish heart will not serve Lenke for he--be convinced of this--will turn his head on his Polish friends after election day is over. Instead, as a true Pole, vote for S. Kunz, the Polish candidate for alderman, whose name is placed in the second column of the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>"Those who work should cast their votes early. The polls will be closed at 4 P. M.</p>
   <p>"In unity lies our strength. Unity and harmony will therefore triumph. And despite the fact that some of our 'Polish friends' have been bought out and are supporting the German candidate, we will defeat the enemy of our people.</p>
   <p>"Yours respectfully,"</p>
   <p>[Long list of names.]</p>
