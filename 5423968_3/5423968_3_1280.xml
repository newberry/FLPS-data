  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the Polish-American Sixteenth Ward Democratic Club was held last Sunday, at which the members expressed their disappointment in the newly elected Mayor of Chicago, Carter H. Harrison. In spite of his oft repeated promises, Harrison has as yet done nothing toward obtaining positions for Polish citizens.</p>
   <p>A committee was chosen to ascertain the extent to which Poles may count on the Mayor's favor in the filling of city posts. The committee is composed of A. W. Ruenicki, Frank Fuhl, Frank Fuhl, Joseph Bieszko, and Julian Stasiewski. Its party is to determine exactly how matters stand by communicating with the Polish political leaders and with Mayor Harrison himself. The committee is also to do its best to see that the rights of Polish citizens are respected and that promises are kept. The committee will submit its report at the Club's next meeting on May 7, at four o'clock <pb facs="5423968_3_1281.jpg" n="2"/>in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>In publishing this news, we must add that we believe the Club to be entirely justified in the steps it is taking. The more energetically and tactfully its committee acts, the greater will be the respect for our Polish community.</p>
