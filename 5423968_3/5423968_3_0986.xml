   <p>Chicago's mayoral elections are approaching. The Republicans, greedy after their victory in the last elections, think that they can catch the Democrats napping for a second time. They are concentrating especially upon the Poles, who have been and still are solidly behind the Democratic party. They would like to divide us, to break us into two parties--to create among us a hitherto nonexistent Republican party. Accordingly, they have printed in Polish a number of appeals intended for simpletons; here and there (<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth wards), they are forming supposedly Polish Republican clubs. Finally, they are trying to mislead the Polish people at political rallies. Somehow, they are not very successful, however.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, for example, two rallies were held in the Fifteenth Ward, but since the appeals were signed by the whole family (five individuals of the same name) of a certain Polish "politician," the meetings and the Republican club which <pb facs="5423968_3_0987.jpg" n="2"/>was to have been organized came to naught. A great number of Democrats attended the meetings and created a tumult. Although it is hard to condone such occurrences, why do the Republicans try to mislead us and create dissension among the Polish people? They ought to remember the saying about fingers--which should not be placed in the door jamb.</p>
