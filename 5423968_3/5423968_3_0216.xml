<title level="a">UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>One of the most important and very urgent problems with which humanity is confronted today, is without a doubt, unemployment. This problem has existed since the beginning of so-called civilization and comes to the fore, here and there, from time to time, disturbing the peace of cities, provinces and even whole countries. Only recently, newspapers gave reports regarding the great disturbances in Berlin, caused by the army of unemployed, which numbers 100,000.</p>
   <p>In London there are hundreds of thousands of unemployed who continually overburden the budget of that city. A few days ago there was a parade of the unemployed in Chicago, an incident that gave our police an excuse to exercise their zeal, which was not only superfluous, but also disgraceful to our city, state and all United States. Every country, every state and every large city has its unemployed to cope with. They cannot be ignored and are, sometimes persecuted. There are three classes of unemployed, or people who do not work. The first, is the independent class or those who do not find, it necessary to work for their living. This class does not trouble society at present, though the existence of many young and healthy people who do not contribute anything to the wealth of the country is an abnormal phenomenon, therefore, harmful. The second class of the unemployed is made up of people who have a natural aversion to any kind of work, and a natural desire to live at the expense of society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0217.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If we set apart professional criminals and beggers belonging to this class, we still have a very large class of people who are relatively harmless yet - sinning, because of an unconquerable dislike for everything that is work. Almost every nation has such people. In Russia they are called <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in Italy <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and here in the United States tramps, and soon. The conscience of society is not burdened with this evil, for, such individuals would remain idle, and lazy under any social system, they are always figured as an item in the budget of the working and producing class. The community does not trouble itself about these vagrants as long as they do not trespass or violate any laws, when they do, then the police are obliged to apprehend them; otherwise they are just left to their own fate.</p>
   <p>The real problem with which society is confronted today is the third and the largest class of unemployed. These are normal, honest and healthy people who know how to work, and who are willing to work; who look for work, but can not find it. In the manufacturing districts this class is very large and during the so - called slack times grows to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. A down town factory employed 5000 people. Suddenly something went wrong, nobody knows what and the factory stopped operation. Five <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and people lost their <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of employment. Five thousand people will use up their savings on left overs from the better times. In a short time their funds and supplies will give out and the army of unemployed will increase from thousands to millions. Besides this, the younger generation is growing up, which adds to the normal increase of the unemployed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0218.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The people want to work, they look for work but they cannot get it. They go down town to some high official to complain and to get his advice, and on the way home a band of public guardians descends upon them, and in the name of the law commit unlawful acts, such as cracking people's heads and throwing them into jails.</p>
   <p>As many times as there are people who want work and cannot get it, so many times we feel that there is something wrong somewhere. There should be plenty of work in the world, for we need railroads, bridges, buildings, ships and other commodities, great and small. Why then is there no work? Because the social system of today is faulty, it either does not want, or does not care for the good of humanity.</p>
