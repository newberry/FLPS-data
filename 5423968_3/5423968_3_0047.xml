   <p>Being on duty as newspapermen and looking into the life of our workingmen, we would like to say a word in this regard.</p>
   <p>In a copy of our newspaper we noticed an article as follows:</p>
   <p>"His world is built by the worker;and from his labor, the industrialist, merchant, priest, publisher, etc., makes a living and profits. On the workingman's back ride certain major and minor politicians. The politician flatters the worker while he is running for a well paying office, toward which the workingman contributes his hard earned pennies. Into organizations, solely for the protection of the worker, force themselves certain individuals speculating on the good faith of the working class, and by possessing good vocabulary and an agressiveness which brings them to leadership of industrial unions and their locals, in which they pose as friends and supporters of workingmen's rights. But instead, the workingman is often disgracefully exploited and in reality these individuals are his enemies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0048.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"This truth comes out when scandals arise which are caused by such friends of the workingman.</p>
   <p>"What is decent and honest in the working class, they exploit for their own purpose, from which arise the scandals degrading the good name of the average union organization.</p>
   <p>"It is known that a strike is a powerful weapon against the capitalist who exploits labor, which the working class uses as a last resort to gain better working conditions and higher wages. Some of these strikes were called because the workingman was badly treated and exploited by his employer. The workers have a right to live and struggle for their betterment, and every honest friend of the workingman wishes to see him victorious and even helps with good advice and money, in order that the working class can get what properly and justly belongs to them.</p>
   <p>"There is also another kind of strike organized and brought about just because some workingmen's leader, organizer, or agitator, in a low-down, underhanded <pb facs="5423968_3_0049.jpg" n="3"/>method for a large sum of money, calls a strike in another concern, a competitor, in order to crush that competitor materially and force it out of business.</p>
   <p>"Such strikes have been called everywhere, but mostly in Chicago, brought about by the corruption from both sides - the capitalists,and leaders of workingmen. Such strikes are mostly lost; because after the workingmen's leader receives his share of the graft, he goes back to the workers and announces that they can not gain better conditions, and that they must go back to work under the same old conditions. Even if they receive a few pennies more per day, when you figure the loss suffered during the strike, you can not even up for some time to come; besides this, each year after there is danger of having another strike called by such dishonest leaders.</p>
   <p>"This came to light during the strike in the stockyards, when drivers, tailors, builders, and brick-layers, etc.,2,000 workers prevented 150,000 workers from working, so that the city was paralyzed and lost a colossal sum of money. Particularly when some dishonest labor leaders called the builders' strike, <pb facs="5423968_3_0050.jpg" n="4"/>they demanded graft from the employers as payment to the union; but in reality they bid that money in their own pockets while the striking workers and their families were suffering misery and hunger.</p>
   <p>"Mr. McLaughlin, a contractor of Chicago, has unmasked such grafters who had terrorized him even after he had paid them $2,000 in checks,demanding still more and threatening him with strikes. Other contractors also came out with similar accusations, supported with facts.</p>
   <p>"This shows what kind of friends, protectors and leaders the workingmen have. We say that not all labor leaders are dishonest, but there are many facts to prove that some of them are crooked. The workingmen must be careful whom they elect for their leaders; know who is their real friend; and who only assumes the appearance of a friend. They should throw out such traitors of the working class; they are only demagogues. There are many such in industrial unions, who profit by getting rich on the misfortunes of the workingman instead of serving the people honestly and conscientiously.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0051.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Workers themselves must know and decide when they should strike, and not permit some "walking delegate" to call a strike without any reason for it."</p>
   <p>Attention, mighty army of workers! Protect your rights!</p>
