  <body>
   <p>The Poles of the 15th Ward held a meeting last Sunday at Kosinski's hall for the purpose of devising ways and means to prevent the Polish voters from being fooled by candidates who, after getting elected, forget all the promises they made before the elections and ignore the Poles completely.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Stanislaus Fruzyna, president of the Kosciusko Polish Democratic Club, and Mr. Andrew Glowczewski, its secretary. Mr. Fruzyna, who delivered the first speech, told the citizens of the 15th Ward that it was time for the Poles to act, that they should not let themselves be fooled any more, and that this time the politicians would have to fulfill their promises. The speaker remarked that good results depended on quick action, that the Poles must present their candidate for alderman of the 15th Ward, supporting his nomination at the convention. Then the speaker proposed John B. Pallasch, a very capable citizen, as a suitable candidate for alderman. His <pb facs="5423968_3_1258.jpg" n="2"/>candidacy was approved unanimously.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pallasch is a member of the St. Cecilia Society and of the Catholic Order of Foresters, St. Stanislaus Council. If all the Poles support him, he will be nominated. Two Polish Democratic clubs--the Kosciusko Polish Democratic Club and the Polish Young Men's Democratic Club--promised to support him.</p>
