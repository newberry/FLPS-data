<title level="a">POLISH DEMOCRATS OF SOUTH CHICAGO HOLD MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Polish Democrats of South Chicago held a meeting yesterday at Templin's Hall. Mr. Lederer opened the meeting and called on Mr. M. Wiora to act as chairman.</p>
   <p>The first speech, in English, was delivered by Mr. Jones, Democratic candidate for United States senator, who pointed out the great benefits every freedom-loving citizen derives from the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was Peter Kiolbassa, who explained why we have hard times and who is responsible for them. "The Republicans are deliberately and entirely responsible for this condition," he said. "The Democrats have proved by their actions that they are interested in the welfare of the working class, which has been benefited by the laws the Democrats have enacted. Miners are greatly benefited by these measures, for mining companies are required to provide them with proper ventilation and safeguards. The Democratic party has <pb facs="5423968_3_1578.jpg" n="2"/>endeavored to introduce an eight-hour working day; it has assured for the workers the so-called mechanic's lien; it has passed a law to the effect that workingmen must be paid in cash and not with slips of paper to company stores, etc. Furthermore, it has abolished the Silver Bill, which was so harmful to the country. The Democratic party cherishes the principles of liberty and equality." Directing his attention to the A.P.A. (American Protective Association), an enemy of the Roman Catholic Church and a friend of the Republicans, the speaker said that its malevolence, is so intense that this group not only conducts an anti-Catholic propaganda but has also attempted several times to damage Catholic schools and churches in Indianapolis, Boston, and Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>His splendid speech was received with great enthusiasm and was frequently interrupted by applause. Only one individual, a certain W....ak, attempted to interfere, but was quickly silenced.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hendrick delivered a short speech in English. The last and most eloquent speech was delivered by August J. Kowalski, who convinced the audience that <pb facs="5423968_3_1579.jpg" n="3"/>the only party the Poles can depend upon is the Democratic party. "Formerly," he said, "a Pole could not get a city job, while today more than four hundred of them are employed by the city. In Mr. Kowalski's department alone, two hundred and fifty Poles are employed."</p>
   <p>This ended a meeting which proved that the Democrats lead even in South Chicago and that a good spirit prevails there.</p>
   <p>It should be added that the hall was filled to capacity. The meeting was preceded by a parade led by a band, which attracted many people.</p>
