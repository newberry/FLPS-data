   <p>The conduct of the Chicago and Philadelphia police proves very plainly that American republicanism does not differ very much from Russian despotism. The whole difference depends on this: that the spreading of constitutional and republican theories is dangerous to the Czar and the propagation of socialistic theory, (not saying anything about anarchy) is dangerous to the American businessmen.</p>
   <p>Over there in Russia, and over here in America, the government is trying to exterminate new ideas by a most absurd means, that is by curbing the freedom of speech and the right to assemble. In order to justify these childish means, the nationalists and the clericals call us socialists, agitators, and anarchists are called criminals.</p>
   <p>Words alone do not convince people any more the listeners and the readers demand facts, proofs. Here, the whole mental comedy of all adherents to the present government is brought to light, they blame us for the strikes and the anarchists are accused <pb facs="5423968_3_0437.jpg" n="2"/>of killing monarchs and presidents, but they remain silent like the sphinx, when it is necessary to print out who is responsible for unemployment, mass and single accidents in mines and factories.</p>
   <p>Narodowy and Chicagoski (Polish newspapers) do not demand curbing of free speech or right to assemble for these destroyers of social life; on the contrary, being their hirelings, they defend their freedom, which in reality is a slavery for the working people.</p>
   <p>But for this they get graft and can afford to keep their readers in ignorance.</p>
   <p>This benefits both sides.</p>
   <p>In Poland, they do not talk less about democracy than anywhere else, but as soon as we try to prove our words by practical application in life, we find out that we have no democracy at all and that we are a very aristocratic community. To many of our comrades the international solidarity of the proletariat seems to be only an ideal watch-word, lacking the real and fundamental principles of life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0438.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is very hard to accept this point of view, if only on account of the fact that the originators of these ideas who propagated them based them on the real, though not on the immediate profits derived from the international solidarity of the exploited.</p>
   <p>On one side we oppose the similar work of the international capitalists. On the other side we are preventing the race struggle, which profits from economical inequality. Economic inequality causes inequality in culture which is the cause of class struggle, and finally ends in terrible wars. Proletariats of all nations, let us unite!</p>
