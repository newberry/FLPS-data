   <p>Colleagues!</p>
   <p>While they are closing factories by the hundreds and thousands, while all of American is suffering beyond expression from commercial crisis, there are nevertheless trades which have not suffered at all in the present crisis and will not suffer. Our trade, printing, belongs among these. Especially for printing shops which edit daily papers the outlook is very good. From the one side, the general public during unemployment, having plenty of thing their disposal, reads more; on the other hand, be coming presidential election was a very important political meaning to the entire country, and the battle for the presidency will be conducted mainly in the columns of the newspapers and through numerous addresses which as you know, must be passed out through us. Our outlook for work, therefore, for some time to come is very good, especially in Chicago, where in recent times two daily <pb facs="5423968_3_0078.jpg" n="2"/>newspapers were established (Dziennik Ludowy and Dziennik Zwiazkowy) and there is no danger of lack of work. On the contrary, in almost every printing shop they are working overtime. The editors and owners of printing shops are conducting their enterprises for profit, there fore they depend on paying their workers as little as possible. It depends on us whether to receive the highest pay possible for our work, which constitutes our only source of income. We will receive a higher wage only when we will lay claim to it. By refusing to work for a low wage we will force the employers to give way. Laying claims individually never, or at least almost never, brings the desired results, because the employer can always find someone to take the place of one worker. But he will net find him if we will all demand together, if we will all put up the same claim, if none of us will undertake work before the employer agrees to our demands.</p>
   <p>Desiring to make joint demands, we must all join into one organization, a union.</p>
   <p>When two years ago we all demanded an increase in pay, all the larger <pb facs="5423968_3_0079.jpg" n="3"/>printers, except the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Dyniewicz Printing Shop, had to agree to our demands. In the two printing shops named, work was undertaken by people not understanding sufficiently their interests and that of their colleagues, and maybe they were forced into this through lack of means of making a livelihood. They had to pay heavily for their inconsiderate step, because for two years they worked for a scale much lower than that of their colleagues in union printing shops.</p>
   <p>In the Dyniewicz Printing Shop the strike has already started. There are no strike-breakers. It is time for you now, colleagues form the printing shop of Dziennik Chicagoski, in order to benefit from the occasion, to join the organization which will give you the possibility of putting in your claim for a higher pay, such as is being received by other colleagues in union printing shops. Do not allow yourselves to be exploited any longer.</p>
   <p>Through the support of all colleagues you will be assured of a victory!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0080.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We understand that we are calling you to a struggle which demands perseverance, solidarity and the assurance of a livelihood for the duration of the strike. We, the organized typesetters, put out our hand to you and call you to battle, we assure you on our part brotherly, moral and material aid, which we will not spare and will support you with all our strength and ability in your struggle - the struggle in which all of us who are organized will take part. With joint efforts we will overcome the greed and obstinacy of the employers!</p>
   <p>The Association of Polish Printers</p>
   <p>546 I. T. U.</p>
   <p>A meeting of the Polish Printers' Union will be held at Szymkowski Hall, corner Division and Kolt Sts., at 8 P. M., Saturday, Feb. 8.</p>
