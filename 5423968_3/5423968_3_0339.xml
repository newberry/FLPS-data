   <p>The factory boss is the nightmare of the unskilled Polish worker who must bow to him and give him graft money so that he would select him from a group of other unskilled candidates for work in a factory, then he must keep on paying to the boss so he would not have a change of mind, do any and all types of work the boss demands from him, in one word, he virtually gives himself up to voluntary slavery.</p>
   <p>In spite of this submissiveness, this type of worker is never sure of his job and at any moment can be removed by the boss, if that one finds a candidate promising him more graft.</p>
   <p>Grafting in factories has rooted itself to such an extent, that today with difficulty a worker can count on being accepted if he does not back up his argument with cash.</p>
   <p>The biggest prey to the grafting bosses are the foreigners who have no knowledge of the language generally in use here, and who haven't enough <pb facs="5423968_3_0340.jpg" n="2"/>intelligence to know in what way to check this domineering evil.</p>
   <p>The only means of changing this humiliating condition under which are living the majority of our brothers in factories, is the learning of the English language, putting our minds on a higher level, and educating ourselves to become skilled workers.</p>
   <p>The boss disregards a humble low-bred man who does not know what to do and how to do it, who does not know anything or understand anything.</p>
   <p>Instead he will deal with the intelligent person possessing a higher level of reasoning, who not only knows what his duties are but also understands his rights.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to give an immediate remedy to remove grafting in factories, because as long as there are candidates for work so long will the bosses have their pick. Polish workers, improve yourselves mentally, and the bosses in factories will then reckon with you to a greater extent.</p>
