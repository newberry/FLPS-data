   <p>The greater part of Polish voters have the idea that by voting for the Polish candidates they are doing them a favor. Many Polish citizens, and especially the women, refrain from voting, thereby treating with indifference their right to vote, that very right for which nations have striven ardently, for many hundred years. Today, when it is possible for us to elect our officials for any office in the country as well as the city, where the vote of the majority decides, many Polish men and women citizens do not permit themselves the benefits possible for this opportunity. Instead they offer their services to citizens of another nationality. Polish citizens who disregard the laws of Polish society are inflicting much harm on the entire Polish society and even to our fatherland.</p>
   <p>The election on November 7th is very important to us, if not the most important in the history of Poles in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0598.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A Pole is striving for the office of County Judge, of a county having a population of over three million. He is a citizen of honorable repute, Mr. Edmund K. Jarecki. Likewise there are Poles running for other offices for city, state and Congress. It is only reasonable to expect them to receive all the Polish votes regardless of party affiliations. As Congressman Stanley Kunz once said at a certain gathering, "We helped our Poland beyond the ocean as much as we possibly could in a material way and if Poland needs further help it is only a moral help."</p>
   <p>This moral help can be given her only by the Poles holding office in the United States. With their influence and the importance of the office they hold, they will command respect before Poland, and before the Poles;and matters of international importance will be investigated more justly in the future.</p>
   <p>We can take for example Germany, which in its most trying moment of existence, received through the efforts of American citizens of German <pb facs="5423968_3_0599.jpg" n="3"/>descent, the necessary help and support and were it not for that help the German government would not exist today.</p>
   <p>Such loyalty in a nation is worthy of praise and should be practiced among ourselves also. We should, regardless of party affiliations, regardless of personal views, regardless of our ill-will, stand united at the polling booth and unanimously elect those candidates who are our fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that we were born Poles, we were reared as Poles, we were taught to respect and love that which is Polish. We then only succeed in gaining some certain parties, or factions thereof, because discord has stolen its way into our midst.</p>
   <p>Discord between parties and factions should not hinder us from the goal for which we are striving, because, regardless to what faction the Poles belong, every aim to which we are drifting must flow dutifully to the benefit of our fatherland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0600.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The day of November 7th, 1922, will pass into the history of Poles in America and will be written with capital letters. Whether it will be to our benefit or loss, will depend upon our loyalty to the cause.</p>
   <p>The one-hundred-year period of slavery in our native land, the bloody battles to free her from enemies, showed enough to convince the Poles that when that fatherland in its infancy and at a time when it needs moral support and helping hand, it is the sacred duty of every Polish citizen to come to the moral aid of that fatherland by voting for the Poles who are striving for office. It is only fitting to expect that no traitor to the Polish cause will be found among us, who would be disloyal enough to cast his vote to our disadvantage.</p>
   <p>According to law every citizen who is engaged at work on election day may be excused from his duties for two hours without loss of pay.</p>
   <p>Fellow countrymen! Remember that in unity there is strength, and through <pb facs="5423968_3_0601.jpg" n="5"/>this strength we can acquire that which every true heart and the honor of every Pole yearns for, that is, the election of the Polish candidates with Jarecki at the head.</p>
   <p>Walter Helezer.</p>
