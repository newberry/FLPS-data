  <body>
   <p>The plot of the Germans and their adherents, which they have been secretly hatching for several months, has failed. The purpose of the plot was to change the name of the park from that of "Kosciusko" to one sounding more American. The Poles in Avondale have displayed their solidarity by coming in large numbers to the meeting of the park commissioners at which the name of the park was to be changed. The following persons spoke at the commissioners' meeting: Alderman Kennedy, attorneys Peter Schwaba, J. Lisak, and Kwasigroch, as well as several other influential people, who explained to the commissioners who this hero of two worlds, Kosciusko, was. After these speeches it was decided not to change the name of this park. The name of Kosciusko from now on will be more highly respected by Bradshaw and similar fanatics. The Poles in Avondale deserve praise for their solidarity in a Polish cause and for taking up action energetically against our ancient enemies. Three cheers for Avondale.</p>
