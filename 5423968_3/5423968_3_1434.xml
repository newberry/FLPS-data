   <p>So far things look pretty well for us in this year's political campaign. We were afraid that we should encounter greater difficulties and meet with less success. Above all we were afraid that our two main groups of local Democratic politicians would begin to fight each other in their keen competition for jobs and public office, and then the whole political business, would result in a complete loss to us, just as surely as two and two are four ! And it already began to look as if that was going to happen because of the intrigues of certain individuals known only too well by our past experience with them, but fortunately the majority of our clear-thinking and well-informed fellow countrymen exerted their best efforts to bring about an understanding and a compromise which immediately produced the favorable results desired.</p>
   <p>Whoever is familiar with our city politics knows only too well how the Irishmen, <pb facs="5423968_3_1435.jpg" n="2"/>The most notorious political tricksters in the entire country since the earliest times, manipulate continually and invariably the divergent ambitions of private groups or individuals within the non-Irish nationalities against one another in order to promote thereby their own selfish interest. To give you an example: they call in one of the prominent Poles and ask him to run for a certain office; then they do the same with another Pole of an opposing political faction (and if there is not such a faction, they are sure to create one by their intriques), offering him, of course, the same candidacy; to the first one in secrecy and to the other also in secrecy they offer the same thing as bait and lure. Of course the first man is willing, and neither does the other refuse the offer. And so rivalry and competition and mutual recriminations begin. Then the Irishmen announce that Poles can only fight among themselves; that one cannot come to any understanding or agreement with them, and so one cannot offer them anything, and besides, they do not deserve anything because they do not constitute a united force. In this way they divide the Poles, and when the election comes around, they either put up an Irish candidate, as long as the Poles could not agree on one of their own, or <pb facs="5423968_3_1436.jpg" n="3"/>they put up both these contending Poles on the ticket to split the Polish vote so that the third candidate, who is always an Irishman, a German, or a Jew, is elected.</p>
   <p>This is an old story and a familiar political trick. Had the Poles become aware in time of how this game is being played here, and had they not fallen for empty husks, had they understood that two candidates cannot be elected to the same office and having come to some agreement among themselve had supported one whom they had chosen as the better man of the two, we should hold today many of even the most important city and county offices. When our fellow countrymen, having so many votes behind them and working closely with the Democratic party, would have every chance to control Chicago politics.</p>
   <p>So far, unfortunately, it has not been thus, and for this reason aliens have been bossing us. Besides, some of the leaders whom we have had in our political life have been of the lowest and worst type: liars of all degrees, intriguers, and those called here "doublecrossers" [English word used]; they have always <pb facs="5423968_3_1437.jpg" n="4"/>followed and helped people of their nationalities, ready to betray their own people, even their closest friends. Fortunately matter are improving, and an intelligent civic ideal is gaining the upper hand among us. And that is exactly what we see this year.</p>
   <p>In this year's campaign the Poles have succeeded in large measure in achieving their aims, at least at this stage of the campaign. Great service has been rendered in this respect by the Polish leader of Chicago Democrats, Congress-man Stanley H. Kunz, who, experiences in local politics as few other men are, submitted our just claims with such force and defended them so courageously that we received what we demanded. In large measure it now depends on us whether we win the final victory. For this great work Congressman Kunz deserves the most sincere appreciation, which we most willing accord to him. We are sure that the Polish community will remember remember how much we owe to him and will repay him when the opportunity offers.</p>
   <p>Above all we have gained this, that we have a Pole at the head of the list <pb facs="5423968_3_1438.jpg" n="5"/>of candidates for judge, the candidate for the distinguished and eminent office of county judge, [Edmund K. Jarecki]. Various jingoistic bodies strove to stop this "Polish peril," as we wrote some time ago, but they were unsuccessful. In this connection we should like to mention that in writing this article condemming Hearst for his hostility toward us we had in mind his Chicago newspaper, the Chicago American, which printed that insulting article containing chauvinistic and contemptuous remarks about us. In our haste we said that the article had appeared in the Chicago Examiner, but what we wrote applied really to the Chicago American. We are making this correction for the sake of truth and exactitude, for of course both these papers are of the same kind, both are notoriously scandalous Hearst organs, both are equally hostile and unsympathetic to us; in short, [they are birds of a feather].</p>
   <p>While we are on the subject of politics and our gains in this year's campaign, we should like to mention that besides Mr. Jarecki, the candidate for county judge, we also have three other candidates running for judicial office, and <pb facs="5423968_3_1439.jpg" n="6"/>these are Messrs. Schwaba, a prominent attorney, Prystalski, who was one of the albest assistant State's attorneys under Hoyne, and Walkowiak, who is at present an alderman. Mr. Danisch, who rendered such valuable service on behalf of Upper Silesia, was to have been placed on the judicial ticket, but because he lives in the same ward as Mr. Schwaba, in order not to concentrate political representation in one ward but to distribute it fairly, it was decided to put Mr. Prystalski, of the South Side, in Mr. Danisch's place.</p>
   <p>We have also received on the ticket two candidates for county commissioner, Mr. Nowak and Mr. Kuflewski. These fellow countrymen of ours, if they remain on the ticket in the same order in which they are at present, should make a thorough campaign for their election, since the Irish political master minds have placed them at the very bottom of a long list of more than a dozen candidates, of which only ten are to be elected, which considerably reduces the chances of the Polish Candidates. But we are convinced that because of their good records and their [Polish] names our fellow countrymen will easily find them and will not pass them by.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1440.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We repeat, therefore, that to a certain degree everything is coming along all right. Keep it up, Polish Democrats! Together in solidarity, in agreement, and understanding, without intrigues, without trying to harm one another, without sniping! Remain on active duty to the end of this campaign, and we shall succeed in putting our men into important county and city offices.</p>
