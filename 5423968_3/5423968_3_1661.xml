   <p>John Szymkowski, alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, died at 4:45 this morning at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Le Moyne and Claremont Streets, after a short but severe attack of pneumonia.</p>
   <p>The late Szymkowski was born in the Grand Duchy of Poznan on February 26, 1874, and came to America with his parents when he was seven years old. After graduating from local schools with honors he worked for his living.</p>
   <p>Szymkowski was first elected alderman of the Sixteenth Ward on April 7, 1914, and continued in this capacity until his death. He is survived by his widow, Mary, a son, George, twenty-two years old, and a daughter, Clara, nineteen.</p>
   <p>Szymkowski was generally liked and was a member of the following societies: Fraternal Harmony Society (Group 996 of the Polish National Alliance, of which he was one of the organizers), St. Adalbert's Society (Group 260 of the Polish <pb facs="5423968_3_1662.jpg" n="2"/>Roman Catholic Union), Kosciuszko Society of the Catholic Foresters, Polish Cavalry Society, and Pulaski Citizens' Club. The funeral will be held on Tuesday, July 17, at the residence of the deceased at 1502 West Division Street and at Holy Trinity Church. The remains will be interred in St. Adalbert's Cemetery.</p>
   <p>The staff of this newspaper extends its sincere condolences to the bereaved family. May the late Szymkowski rest in peace.</p>
