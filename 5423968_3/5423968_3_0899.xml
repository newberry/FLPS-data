   <p>The Republican Party has nominated three Polish candidates for the office of alderman in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the 16th ward, Dr. Adam Szwajkart; in the 17th ward, Mr. John Smulski, a Polish lawyer, received the nomination; in the 25th ward, Town of Lake, a Polish contractor, Mr. K. Ziolkowski, received the nomination.</p>
   <p>We are hoping that our three Polish candidates will win their respective offices and be part of our city council.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary for us to remind the Polish citizens that they should support their countrymen, as this has been preached over and over again for years. We are not trying to dictate to the people how to vote or whom to vote for, but are stressing the point that the more Polish candidates we elect, the more consideration we will receive from the city council and our respective parties. Elect our three Polish candidates, the proper men for the aldermanic offices, who will work for the cause and good of the people and not for the benefit of their own pockets.</p>
