   <p>The Polish population of Cook County is large in number and by this time it should have gained some significance in [county] politics. Yet, this is not so.</p>
   <p>At the last registration, the undersigned was called upon to perform the duties of election judge in the precinct where he resides. Having the registration lists at hand, he counted the number of Poles who had registered and found more than he expected. But what of it? Of all those registered, only one was listed as being born in Poland; the others appeared as natives of Germany, Austria, and Russia.</p>
   <p>The political machine distributes jobs in proportion to the influence of a given element, according to the number of registered voters. Every Pole who registered as being born in Germany, Austria, and Russia gave his rights and <pb facs="5423968_3_1597.jpg" n="2"/>privileges to the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, and renounced his own Polish origin.....</p>
   <p>Every individual, when registering, is under oath to answer all questions truthfully. Whether this oath is in one form or another, it is still an oath, and Poles who say they were born in Germany, Austria, or Russia, are considered as natives of these countries: On the other hand, they commit something very close to perjury.</p>
   <p>The registration lists do not require a person to say under whose rule he was born. The answer ought to be: born in Poland, even though Poland is ruled by three different governments. Ireland is in the same position as Poland, yet no Irishman registers as being born in Great Britain. Canadians, though they are English subjects, do not say they were born in Great Britain or in England, but say they were born in Canada.</p>
   <p>Polish leaders in American politics, Polish political clubs, and Polish <pb facs="5423968_3_1598.jpg" n="3"/>societies ought to take this matter under consideration and see to it that in the future the Polish people do not remain a tool, used for the benefit of Germans. To speak plainly, we should no longer allow Germans to get jobs for Polish votes falsely credited to them.</p>
