   <p>It is important to note that the Polish voters of the 17th Ward are not misled so easily by the agitators who think only of their own interests. They try to instigate the common citizen of this district against a deserving alderman, such as Alderman Dever.</p>
   <p>It also gives us great pleasure to inform the public that all of the Polish leaders are happy with the present attitude among the Poles in this 17th ward. They stood like a stone wall supporting and aiding their candidate, Alderman W. E. Dever, also sparing no time or expense, in order to assure him of the victory. Alderman Dever, during his few years in office as a city counsellor, gained for himself extreme sympathy of the Poles of the 17th Ward. Always and everywhere, whenever he had the opportunity, he showed himself a true and sincere friend of the Poles. We are all thankful for his efforts. The services of Alderman W. E. Dever to the general public are numerous. The entire city acknowledges him as one of the trustworthiest and most capable of being the city's counsellor.</p>
   <p>William E. Dever was born in Woburn, Massachussets, in the year of 1862. He attended the local parochial school and later went to higher public schools in that city. In the year of 1887 he came to Chicago and for three years worked at the tanners' trade in our locality and there he met many of our older Polish countrymen working at this same trade. In spite of his daily <pb facs="5423968_3_0863.jpg" n="2"/>strenuous routine, he did not cease to educate himself. He attended evening classes at the Kent College and in the year of 1889 completed his courses, receiving his diploma and from then on he devoted his time solely to the practice of law.</p>
   <p>He was elected alderman the first time in the year of 1902 and re-elected in the year of 1904 without any opposition.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, and the Forester Catholic Convent. He belongs to the Roman-Catholic church of St. Stephen.</p>
   <p>He married in the year of 1885 and at the present time resides with his family at 225 W.Chicago avenue.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, that is, Tuesday 27 of this month at 7:30 P.M. in the evening there will be a vast meeting of Polish citizens on behalf of our candidate Alderman W. E. Dever, in the Walsh Hall, located on the corner of Noble and Emma street. Even Mayor Dunne will be present at this gathering and also shall speak. There also shall be other speakers, such as Commissioner Budzban, Adamkiewicz, Judge La Buy, representative Gieskiewicz and other Poles. All of the Polish citizens in the 17th Ward should be present at this meeting.</p>
