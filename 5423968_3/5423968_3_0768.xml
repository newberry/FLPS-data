   <p>The Republican ticket this time does not have many Polish candidates because this election is so dominated by the Democratic party that the Republicans have little chance. We should try to keep our people from incurring the unnecessary expense of campaigning against the greatly superior force of the Democrats at this time.</p>
   <p>The Polish Republicans, however, stand a good chance of getting the office of Clerk of the Criminal Court, for which a universally known man and an important member of the Alliance, Casimir Armknecht of St. Hedwig's Parish, is running. They also have a chance of getting the office of State Senator of the Fifteenth District, for which John S. Rybicki, president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Singers, a very capable lawyer and a good citizen, is running. For the lower house of legislature they have the present representative Albert Rostenkowski. For the office of County Commissioner the well-known member of the Alliance Frank E. Lackowski is running.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Alliance members of the Republican party to support with all their strength our loyal friend the universally liked and respected <pb facs="5423968_3_0777.jpg" n="10"/>Walter Schrojda for Ward Committeeman of the Sixteenth Ward. He has been one of the leaders of the Polish Republican party for the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>On the Progressive ticket there are not many Polish candidates. Among the better-known candidates we should mention W. Gieldzinski, who is running for election as representative to the legislature, and Professor T. Siemiradzki, candidate for County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>On the Socialist ticket there is, for the first time, a Polish name. We recommend to the voters of District Eight Mr. Henry Anielewski for congressman and thus emphasize the impartiality of our list.</p>
   <p>Vital national interests, not any sort of calculations or regard for advertisements, have prompted us to write this article. We are confident that the members of the Alliance will willingly receive our appeal and will get together to see to it that every member of the Alliance casts his vote at the primaries for the benefit of Polish interests.</p>
