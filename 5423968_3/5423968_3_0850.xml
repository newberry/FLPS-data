   <p>We remind our fellow citizens of Chicago that the day after tomorrow we hope to take part in the Democratic primaries and we strongly urge all Polish Democrats to go to the polls. Frequently the electors disregard the primaries in an unusual manner, and yet the primary election is some times equally important and at times plays even greater part than the final voting.</p>
   <p>From all appearances the Poles of Chicago have at present a good opportunity of electing their fellow countryman for one of the most important positions in this city. Mr. Budzban is a Democratic candidate for city clerk, and if he is nominated in the primaries, we are sure he will be elected in the finals.</p>
   <p>This should interest every Polish citizen of Chicago. Every Polish Democrat should cast his vote on this day. It is not often that a Pole has held such an important office in the city of Chicago. We all know of our former distinguished persons. The late Peter Koilbassa, who held a position as city treasurer, and Mr. John F. Smulski who held the office of city counsellor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0851.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are quite sure that as soon as Mr. N. Budzban is elected city clerk, he will be in a position, with his former associates, to pave the way for other Poles in obtaining various important positions. Those who are qualified should do their part and vote in this primary election.</p>
   <p>At this primary we shall also decide who shall receive the nominations for aldermen in various wards. This is also important for Polish citizens wherever there is a possibility of electing their fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>We should assure ourselves of a few political offices. We've had for many years Poles representing us in the city council, but truthfully not as many as we should have had, considering the number of Poles we have living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have had people in office who were very capable and respectable, others who were less eminent, but at least they were honest and of clean character. But alas! there were even those who their behavior condemned and marred the good name of other of our fellow countrymen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0852.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is very unpleasant for us to recall those times and persons during the past years. Dziennik Chicagoski at various times had this sad duty to perform, editing warnings to the electors in editorials to beware of bringing upon themselves this stain of disgrace and loss by electing those undeserving representatives. Let us hope and assure ourselves that these times shall never have a repetition and that from now on our newspapers will and shall be able to recommend the candidacy of every Pole (that is, for those highly esteemed offices), those Polish citizens who have all qualifications for this honor. The time has arrived when we can only enlighten you briefly about this and give you once again our admonition.</p>
   <p>There is a person who is seeking nomination for alderman in the 16th ward in the primaries; he is known to us from previous political activities, all of the political parties, all Democratic organizations, all nationalities and all newspapers always condemned his activities, his behavior and character as a public official. During his time he has had political influence with the aid of various tricks, in which he was <pb facs="5423968_3_0853.jpg" n="4"/>a past master and with the assistance of his accomplices and followers, gained benefits for himself. Later, that's about a few years ago, a vast number of his friends turned against him for the simple reason of his not fulfilling various promises he had made at which he was a master. His pleas and trickery were of no avail. He was able, however, to hold a group of minor politicians who shall try and assure him of a victory in this coming primary.</p>
   <p>The respectful, experienced and qualified citizens of the 16th ward are earnestly hoping to assure for Mr. John Kondziorski the candidacy for alderman in their ward. We are in no position to sing hymns of praise for Mr. Kondziorski. As to what kind of a representative he shall be for his ward, remains to be seen after be is elected. He never had the opportunity to serve his fellow citizens, but we can at least be assured his character shall bring to us honor. He is known to us from early childhood, and judging from his behavior in private life, he is an understanding and capable man, and the public can best be assured than when elected, he will never stoop so low as to have the public's opinion link him with the "Black wolves." Having the opportunity to select two of these candidates, not one Democrat of the 16th ward should stop and <pb facs="5423968_3_0854.jpg" n="5"/>hesitate to cast his vote for Mr. Kondziorski. And so let every elector do his part in the primaries and cast his vote for delegates who can bring about the election of Mr. Kondziorski. If the citizens are careless in their duty, which is demanded from them, now the "black wolf" shall again steal into their coop.</p>
   <p>Likewise in various other political wards Poles have the opportunity this time to nominate their fellow countrymen for the office of alderman, if every Pole votes for Polish candidates in these primaries. We are informed that in the 17th ward Mr. Michael Kolasa is also running for alderman. Even the 27th ward, where we find a huge Polish colony around the locality of St. Hyacinth, is supporting the candidacy of a Pole for alderman; he is Mr. M. Lengowski.</p>
   <p>Poles in Avondale should have their own representative in the city council. And so let us all of the Polish electors participate in the after tomorrow's primaries. If you all do this well then in the following year many of you will be able to get political jobs.</p>
