   <p>The entertainment given Sunday by the Polish Patriotic Organization was more than a mere charitable function--during it a speech was delivered and a treatise was read, both of which represent permanent and important values. Of the former we have already given a lengthy review, so that now we will limit ourselves to the latter. Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz's speech has been already published.</p>
   <p>Herewith we are publishing a synopsis of the article read by Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek. We regret that the limited space at our disposal does not permit <pb facs="5423968_3_0527.jpg" n="2"/>us to publish the complete text of the article, which begins with an exposition of the unhealthy condition of modern living. This condition has been eloquently described by Reverend Siedlaczek in these words:</p>
   <p>"The history of the world shows a continuous battle, a fight for survival, bitter in the extreme, sorrowful, desperate. For some time past, particularly the last two decades, this desire to destroy one another has led the modern world into a strange state of unrest. This is evidenced by the convulsive tremors that shake governments and institutions, and by the persistent evil work which undermines and destroys all of the precepts of religion, morals, good order--in a word, everything that civilization has depended on for ages.</p>
   <p><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, unheard-of demoralization, has stolen into the highest spheres among those who consider themselves superior and to whom the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> look for help and relief, and in whom the nation<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> place all their confidence. Foreign ministries are falling one after the other. The government will follow them, and then, what will happen This question is a great puzzle to all who participate in political activities. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> beers into the future with <pb facs="5423968_3_0528.jpg" n="3"/>fear, because before his eyes he sees a horrible vision with blood-stained hands, on whose forehead the word 'crime' is written, on whose face egoism has engraved its mark--egoism which sacrifices everything standing in its way.</p>
   <p>"This vision is coming ever nearer and cries: 'Ay <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> is Revolation!' Who created its The the moral reaction of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> other lower. The first one <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> store of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to extinguish the evil in its <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> undoubtedly from the day of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>righteousness-that is its motto.</p>
   <p><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> fundamental fore of today's criminal revolution? The Catholic religion. Thus the Catholic Church is <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> exposed to its <pb facs="5423968_3_0529.jpg" n="4"/><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>
    <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>
   </p>
   <p>"The <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> revolution many to the working <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> 'You are as good as your employer'; to the employer: ' You are a free man and need not recognize any responsibilities toward the working man'. In this manner it preaches its socalled 'universal brotherhood' while in reality it fans the flames of hatred and civil war among the poorest. Such is today's revolution, today's socialism.</p>
   <p>"One must look deeper for the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> sources of this revolution. The world of today, the present decade, throwing <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Christian doctrines which interfere with <pb facs="5423968_3_0530.jpg" n="5"/>its evil babits, vainly seeks a solution for infernal doubts by discovering new systems of philosophy and reaches in the and a state of paganism that clothes nature with a raiment of deity and preaches a voluptuous freedom of conscience--freedom in evil habits, a base paganism which destroys all <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> feelings and all truth.</p>
   <p>"What is the cause of this It is lack of that moral strength which energizes our entire human structure and can only be derived from belief in the one God and certainty of a higher destiny."</p>
   <p>And so, normal living and civilization, according to the author of this articles, lie in genuine Christianism; the cause of their downfall, in evading Christian ideas. He furthar considers the composition of the human being: the body, the soul, and the grace. In proportion to which of these prevails, human beings are either materialistic, learned, or spiritual. In the last one, the author recognizes the real Christians--the chosen people, and commands them to become the leaders of humanity, for the have greater educational, moral, and material attributes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0531.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The author's beautiful words to the effect that the human soul is endowed with grace, we are quoting at length. They will best explain this thesis.</p>
   <p>"A spiritual person, truly Christian, sees in a stranger a brother. He does not look askance at him even if the latter does not share his ideas and beliefs but gives him a friendly handshake and supplies him with the things he needs. He looks at a stranger as a human being, a co-worker in praising God and for the benefit of all. His heart is filled with love form God and exclude all love of himself.</p>
   <p>"A spiritual person endowed with this third life, that is, grace of living, will sacrifice himself for another individual, and for humanity. According to the thought of God, he who blesses his brethren is an apostle.</p>
   <p>"This person not only understands that he is burdened with his own private duties, performed around his home fire or in private circles, but he also recognized his duty to his country. Patriotism follows the love of God, and <pb facs="5423968_3_0532.jpg" n="7"/>is his ideal; he knows that such Christian patriotism, sincere and genuine, naturally cannot be idle, lifeless."</p>
   <p>This is how Reverend Siedlaczek would like everyone to be, especially those who are in any way superior and who, endowed with exceptional graces, are in a position to influence of lead others. As to the proper use of this influence, he says:</p>
   <p>"Just as in a Christian family enlightened with the grace of life, the older brother or <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> gives a helping <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and brings up, leads, guards, and helps his younger brothers or sister, just so in our national life, those clases more liberally endowed should continually endeavor-if their hearts are filled with genuine patriotism, godly patriotism--to exert their influence on the lower classes and raise them mentally, and materially. No doubt such <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> would demand much <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and self-denial on the part of these superior beings, but these <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> are only their direct duty as consibdered in the light of Caristian aprit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0533.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>"Every nation is composed of old and young people, of watchers and workers, of lawmakers and law enforcers, of teachers and students. There are millions on the one side and on the other. And these millions of people in a nation are more or less obligated to improve other millions morally, spiritually, mentally, and materially."</p>
   <p>As necessary adjuncts for properly undertaking these tasks, the author demands: similarity, if not in methods, at least in the objects desired; sacrifices and self-denial, and the elimination of egoism, whose daughter is this infamous liberal freedom leading to disorder and crime; finally, sincere patriotism. Once more we regret that lack of space does not permit us to quote the complete passages of the article relating to the foremost two conditions. Nevertheless, we quote, without any change, what Reverend Siedlaczek says about patriotism.</p>
   <p>"Sincere patriotism--not the kind that depends on gold or honors but the one inspired by a true love for our Country--places upon us the tremendous, holy, and public duty of working and sacrificing ourselves for our younger and <pb facs="5423968_3_0534.jpg" n="9"/>weaker countrymen, not in proportion to any earthly reward but according to one's strength and ability. Sincere patriotism does not exclude the recognistion of personal meritorious acts, and it does not deny the right of suitable rewards to those who, while sacrificing themselves for their follow men, bring credit to their country by helping others. But as a basis, as a fundamental law true patriotism demands sacrifices for one's fellow men merely because they are sacrifices for the public good, without thought of remuneration, without thinking of any personal benefit. On the contrary, if necessary, even against our own interests.</p>
   <p>"Whenever this spirit of national patriotism disappears, or when it is used only as a mask to disguise personal views and intentions, then from the highest official to the lowliest public servant, from the general to the private in the ranks, from the minister of education to the plain teacher--all will betray their country in the name of such false patriotism and take unfair advantage of the public, in the end betraying their own country. These things have happened and still happen. We can expect such things, if the souls of patriots are false.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0535.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>"And there is still another sort of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> alas! among us. Stubborn, and crooked, unfruitful and selfish. This sort of patriotism is temporary, exclusive, jealcus. Many would give all they possess for their country, but would demand exclusive control over it. They will give and serve, provided they be allowed to direct and centrol things their way.</p>
   <p>"This kind of patriotism is <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Every faithful <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of a nation should love it in God. We will then be faitaful and great in his sacrifices for the benefit of all everywhere and at will <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>Such patriotism, according to the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> this <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> is an indispensable condition for wholesome and beneficial inflnence over the younger folk. One more pointing out the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> makes a very <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the public as a whole and the family in which the older brothers neglect the pounger ones and forget to word <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> In the family circle, much neglect is the cause of death, crippling, or <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> injuring the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> The same applies to the public as a whole. Left without help or supervision of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> brother over their</p>
