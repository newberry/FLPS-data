<title level="a">CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST LEMONT CONTRACTORS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The case against the Lemont contractors has begun, thanks to the efforts of the committee which was appointed at a mass meeting in Chicago to take charge of the matter. Action was taken against the contractors Locker and Bibb, who were responsible for the slaughter of Polish workers. Both men are charged with the murder of J. Kluga, a young Pole. It was at the inquest into the death of Kluga that the testimony of the witnesses was most incriminating.</p>
   <p>The proceedings were opened by Attorney Max Drzemala, assisted by [Attorney] Donahue, of Chicago, and [Attorney] D'Arcy, of Joliet, where the trial will be held. Last Wednesday, Mr. Drzemala obtained warrants for the arrest of Locker and Bibb in Joliet. Both were arrested and later released under a ten-thousand-dollar bond.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0122.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The case will open in Judge Blood's court on Monday, August 21. It will then be argued whether the defendants may retain their freedom under bond, or whether they will be imprisoned without bail on charges of murder. Results will appear in Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>The attorneys conducting the case have already received $105 to cover initial costs. The committee also paid out six dollars to pay for the trips to Lemont. There remains in the hands of the treasurer the sum of $88.40.</p>
