   <p>Delegates representing 16,000 Republican voters yesterday gathered at St. Stanislaus school hall, Noble and Bradley Streets, to pledge their hearty support to the Republican state, county, congressional and city tickets.</p>
   <p>Incidentally they took occasion to repudiate the efforts of N. L. Piotrowski, Democratic candidate for state treasurer, to make it appear that they were opposed by John F. Smulski, then candidate for state treasurer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1190.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Piotrowski's attack upon Smulski, made at the recent meeting of the Democratic state committee, was replied to by half a dozen speakers and Piotrowski was roundly scored. It was claimed that Piotrowski had made the attack for the purpose of diverting attention from his own record.</p>
   <p>There were present at the meeting more than 300 delegates representing the Polish American Republicans of the city. A new constitution was adopted, new officers elected and special indorsements given to all Polish candidates on the Republican ticket. Speeches were made by Walter Sehrojda, Philip Ksychi, Mal. L. Kasmar, Andrew J. Schultz, Stephen Gorechi and Stanley Popek. Victor Pijanowski was chairman of the convention and Joseph T. Spiker and S. J. Dudek secretaries.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1191.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The New Officers Chosen.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected as follows:- President, Walter Sehrojda; Vice President, Alexander Rettman; Treasurer, Albert Rostenowski; Recording Secretary, John Ruskiewiez; Financial Secretary, Michael Rgeszotarski.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>We, the members of the Polish Republican League of Cook County, Illinois, in convention assembled, hereby reiterate our loyalty and support of the principles of the great Republican Party, which has been a leading and efficient factor in its progress, prosperity and success.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1192.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We hereby express our approval, support and recognition of the sans, patriotic, and wise administration of President Roosevelt and his cabinet; we express our admiration of his fearless and honest action against the trusts and all violations of the laws and especially his efforts to protect the public health by compelling the packers to bring about reforms at the stockyards and his efforts to give the farmer and the small shipper an equal opportunity upon the market by compelling the railroads to stop their discrimination in freight rates.</p>
   <p>We also approve the administration of Charles S. Deneen, his impartial performance of his duties, and we have faith that he will fulfill all his anti-election promises made to the people of the state of Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1193.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Cullom also Indorsed.</p>
   <p>We most heartily approve the re-election to the United States Senate of Shelby M. Cullom and we hereby express our recognition, support and thinks for his long, tried and honored career in the senate and his honest, untiring, sincere, useful and unselfish efforts, in behalf of the people of this republic and the success of the present and past administration.</p>
   <p>We also approve the honest administration of the various public offices by Republicans and the fearless work of John J. Healy, the state's attorney of Cook County, in behalf of clean and honest conduct of public offices.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1194.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>We hereby indorse the candidacy of every candidate upon the Republican Ticket of Cook County at the coming November election.</p>
   <p>We especially pledge our support to the candidacy of John F. Smulski for state treasurer because of his unblemished record in the public service, his acknowledged ability and tried honesty, because we know him to be a representative man worthy of our race and one whose public as well as private life has been beyond reproach.</p>
   <p>We promise to give special support to the candidacy of Walter J. Sehrojda for county commissioner, whom we know as a loyal Republican, an honest and self-made man and an able and worthy citizen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1195.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We also vouch for and give our special wishes and efforts to Philip Kaycki, candidate for state senator, whose work in behalf of the Polish people and whose business integrity, sobriety and honesty warrant his fitness for the office he seeks.</p>
   <p>We also pledge our support to the candidacy of John A. Pelka and of Joseph Piotrowski for state senator, both of whom are tried and true Polish citizens, respected by their neighbors and favorably known to the Polish-speaking people as worthy and honest men.</p>
