   <p> Among others the American civilization passes as a journalistic civilization</p>
   <p>This is actually in agreement with the truth for there are more than 23,000 newspapers in the United States, while in Germany, a country standing so high in respect to journalism, there are only about 10,000 newspapers.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably, this journalistic civilization must also have a bad sude, which is not the result of the unlimited freedom of speech, that distinguishes the United States from other countries, but is the result of the shameful conditions of the social life which exists in this capitalistic El Dorado.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0430.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Although the disappearance of a few thousand of the newspapers and periodicals which are at the service of the demoralized and culturally bankrupt capitalistic world, would not cause great harm, a loss of only one propagator of freedom, equality and brotherhood, would be a great blow.</p>
   <p>To these belong the Socialist newspapers, which are more and more "a thorn in the side" of the impudent exploiters.</p>
   <p>It seemed that after the rejection of the Penrose's "dragon" project, the purpose of which was to curb the Socialist press, the owners of the United States will abandon any new attempts in that direction.</p>
   <p>But alas! the facts are different. About ten days ago we mentioned in this section that the postmaster General refused the anarchistic La Questione the right to be sent by United States mail.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0431.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is the first case which would not in similar circumstances stir the public opinion very deeply. At present the Appeal to Reason is also endangered the same way.</p>
   <p>The charge is that in one number of this publication there was a demand for abduction of the ex-governor of Kentucky, which is a violation of the criminal law; in another number, it attacked Roosevelt regardless. Besides these two serious charges there is also this, that these numbers were sent without wrappers. Appeal to Reason should not wait for somebody else to do it; they should guard their rights themselves.</p>
   <p>This can be done only at the time of election of the President and other officials when they vote for their own representatives - for workingmen and Socialists.</p>
