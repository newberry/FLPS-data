<title level="a">POLISH DEMOCRATIC CLUB OF SIXTEENTH WARD HOLDS MASS MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Over six hundred persons attended the meeting of the Polish Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward last night. F. Bieszki called upon Judge M. A. LaBuy to preside as chairman, and J. Gieszkiewicz to act as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, August Kowalski, F. Bieszki, and John Biniak were among the speakers. All speakers stressed the point that the Republicans did not keep their promises. Instead of the promised days of prosperity, days of depression are becoming more prevalent. Factories are closed, wages have been lowered, and the Poles are disregarded in appointments for city positions despite the fact that they carry a large portion of the tax burden. Members of the American Protective Association, of which there are 160 in this ward, are proud of this achievement. The Poles should be wary of them.</p>

   <p>This meeting was called rather early in order to convince the Poles of the need of solidarity and the hazards of party division. It is imperative that the Jews' words be taken with a grain of salt [reference to the Jewish businessman], for they bought out the Republicans in the fall election and sold out a part of the Polish people of Chicago to the American Protective Association.</p>
   <p>On the other hand every effort must be made to list Polish names on the ballots for the coming election. along with the names of those who are favorable to the Poles. Mr. Kowalski considers such candidates to be Carter H. Harrison and Peter Kiolbassa, the former for Mayor and the latter for City Treasurer. Both should get the nominations, he advised.</p>
   <p>This proposal was received with great acclaim by the entire crowd. The same cheer greeted Anthony Rudnicki, Republican, when he said that his party members will vote for Peter Kiolbassa in the event that he runs for City Treasurer.</p>

   <p>When the vote was taken, Carter H. Harrison was unanimously endorsed as candidate for Mayor, as was Peter Kiolbassa as candidate for City Treasurer.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all Polish citizens to attend the mass meeting to be held tomorrow at 636 Milwaukee Avenue. In this way the Poles will be able to demonstrate to other nationalities that they must be reckoned with.</p>
