<title level="a">SEVENTEENTH WARD ALDERMEN CALL MEETING OF REAL-ESTATE OWNERS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting of real-estate owners was called by the aldermen of the Seventeenth Ward, S. Walkowiak and S. Adamkiewicz. Joseph Ruszkiewicz presided, and W. Duzewski served as secretary. The chairman spoke on the purpose of the meeting, explaining that it has not a political gathering but concerned only owners of real estate.</p>
   <p>The City of Chicago intends to pass an ordinance calling for the installation of water meters. This is a matter of importance to owners of real estate, the chairman explained, and it rests with the real-estate owners of the Seventeenth Ward to instruct their aldermen how to vote. He mentioned also that Keeler, of the Public Efficiency Board, was present, who wished to speak to the citizens of the Seventeenth Ward on the subject of water meters.</p>
   <p>From Keeler's speech it developed that the house owners would save with the installation of meters, since they would pay only about half as much water tax <pb facs="5423968_3_1361.jpg" n="2"/>as they do at present. He pointed out that Cleveland and Milwaukee use water meters, and that the citizens there pay far less water tax than we in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Alderman Walkowiak spoke next, saying that what Keeler said was fine and good, so far as residential districts were concerned, but from our point of view the system would not prove very practical. Adamkiewicz also spoke, and agreed with Walkowiak in opposing the new system, but he said that he would vote in accordance with the meeting's decision.</p>
   <p>Chairman Ruszkiewicz then called upon various citizens for their opinions, which showed that all except three were apposed to the installation of water meters. There were about five hundred real-estate owners present.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Ruszkiewicz thanked the gathering for its exemplary behavior during the course of the meeting, and also thanked Keeler for his participation in the meeting, of which he must have carried away a very favorable impression.</p>

   <p>Ruszkiewicz told the gathering that, with such representatives in the City Council as Walkowiak and Adamkiewicz, we can be sure that our affairs are in good hands. He added that Alderman Walkowiak deserves Polish recognition and support in his race for nomination to the office of Municipal Court Judge on the Democratic ticket in the coming primaries. If he is elected, he is sure to bring honor to all Polonia, for he has given incontrovertible proof of his capability during his terms as alderman in the City Council of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 21, 1918.</p>
   <p>W. Duzewski.</p>
