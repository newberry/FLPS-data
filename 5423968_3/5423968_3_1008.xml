   <p>The Daily Calumet, published un South Chicago, writes as follows: "Democrats of the Thirty-third Ward acknowledge the fact that the Poles were largely responsible for the Democratic victory in this ward. Many Poles who have received their citizenship papers in recent years are taking an active interest in politics.</p>
   <p>John Koziczynski, who has devoted a large part of this spare time and money to help others to become citizens, has been conducting citizenship classes among the Polish people for quite some time, and hundreds of Poles have obtained their citizenship papers as a result of his efforts.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, Mr. Koziczynski succeeded in arranging two Polish mass meetings, despite the fact that the Republicans tried to have the meetings blocked. In writing about the outstanding political leaders of the Thirty-third Ward, <pb facs="5423968_3_1009.jpg" n="2"/>we omitted his name by mistake. Because of this, we have devoted this section to him, for he deserves the right to be considered as one of the individuals responsible for the Democratic victory in this ward.</p>
