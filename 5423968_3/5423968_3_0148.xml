<title level="a">THE SLAUGHTER OF POLES IN LEMONT</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>As we promised yesterday, we are returning to the revolting "slaughter" of Polish strikers in Lemont, Illinois. It is our opinion that this matter demands the attention of our American Polonia. We should protest loudly against the crimes committee with uncontrolled ferocity upon the poor and uneducated Poles of Lemont, in the conviction that they cannot defend themselves and that such crimes will escape punishment. We must see to it to it that these crimes are punished, swiftly and severely.</p>
   <p>News of the things that are happening in Lemont appears elsewhere in this paper. The latest reports convince us that swift action against the perpetrators is, at this time, out of the question. The authorities are helpless; it may be that they do not consider themselves legally empowered to intercede. The strikers have neither the means nor a sufficient knowledge <pb facs="5423968_3_0149.jpg" n="2"/>to take any steps. The most wronged are either dying or are on beds of pain, struggling against poverty and suffering. On the other hand, the Millionaire contractors will stop at nothing to keep the matter quiet and to prevent justice from being done.</p>
   <p>If we, the Poles of Illinois, do not intercede in behalf of our countrymen, their wrongs will be unavenged; and boldened by impunity, the criminals will next turn their guns upon us.</p>
   <p>What, then, ought we to do? What is our duty in this case?</p>
   <p>The answer to these questions lies in the affair itself. We ought to call mass meetings here in Chicago and in other Polish settlements, "indignation meetings" at which appropriate resolutions can be formulated. These resolutions must next be submitted to the governor of Illinois and to the legislature. It would also be desirable to appoint a citizens' committee which <pb facs="5423968_3_0150.jpg" n="3"/>would go to Lemont to investigate the matter more thoroughly; this same committee could undertake the necessary steps to bring the perpetrators of the crimes to justice. The duty of this committee, consisting of organization representatives and lawyers, would be to see to it that justice be done in the proper measure. As we know, the strikers in Lemont have already formed a committee whose members are of various nationalities. Our committee would co-operate with the strikers' committee. Thus, the way is obvious and leads directly to its object. In our opinion, steps similar to those above mentioned are imperative.</p>
   <p>A protest against violence will prove that we will not allow ourselves to be murdered like lambs. We should approve of such a protest, as Poles and workers, against the violators of law and liberty. When we will have been able to bring about the punishment of wrong-doers, we will then have proved that we are strong enough to stand in defense of our rights as human beings and as citizens. But this is only half of our task.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0151.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Another equally important duty of ours is to bring aid to the poor people upon whom this misfortune has fallen. The citizens' committee should take care of this matter also. Our brethren will not begrudge the few pennies that will bring relief to their countrymen who suffer through no fault of their own. Naturally, an investigation is necessary to determine the extent of need; only then will contributions be solicited. On this question, the Polish citizens of Lemont should take the initiative.</p>
   <p>At any rate, we mention our duties again: to protest against the slaughter of our brothers in Lemont, to see justice done, and to aid the unfortunate victims. These duties should be fulfilled.</p>
