   <p>For many years the Poles living in the 27th ward did not have a representative in the city council. The 27th ward is populated in great majority by Poles; therefore it should have its own alderman. In the past we could not elect a Pole for alderman because always there were more candidates for the primary and our votes were scattered. Now it is different; we have just one candidate on the Democratic ticket, N. S. Budzban, for alderman of the 27th ward. With the help of all Polish votes we hope to elect him. N. S. Budzban had held many public offices; he was a member of the Board of City improvements, member of the State Tax Commission, and lately chief clerk of the Municipal Courts. He is an honest and efficient public servant. Mr. Budzban is endorsed by the citizens' club of St. Ladislaus Parish, by the Women's Voters Club and the Business men Club of Avondale.</p>
