   <p>We have been requested to publish the following information in Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"A meeting to organize a Polish workmen's association was held last night in school hall No. 1, near Bradley Street.</p>
   <p>"Reverend V. Barzynski opened the meeting with a short talk, in which he outlined the purpose of the proposed association and read its constitution, which had been prepared by the committee.</p>
   <p>"Mr. J. Ligman, after being chosen chairman of the meeting, called upon W. Singer to act as secretary. The discussions were very lively. P. Krus urged the gathering to join the organization. Inda, [J.] Mucha, Chabowski, and P. Ligman also spoke.</p>
   <p>"It was decided that the Polish workingmen should have an association and that members should be accepted. The result was excellent, for approximately one <pb facs="5423968_3_0511.jpg" n="2"/>hundred persons applied for membership.</p>
   <p>"The meeting then adjourned until next week.</p>
   <p>"Albert Singer,</p>
   <p>"secretary of the meeting"</p>
