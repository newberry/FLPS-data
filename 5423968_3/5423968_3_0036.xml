   <p>In accordance with an order issued by Chief of Police Fitzmorris, all police captains within the vicinity of the Union Stockyards will prepare two hundred men to protect the packing houses in the event of a strike, which will probably be called today. Over twenty thousand persons will take part in the strike, and according to an estimate, over forty-five thousand union men throughout the country will participate. Officials of the packing houses assert that the strike will be disastrous to the union. Armour and Company has notified its workers that any employee who takes part in the strike will be automatically discharged. Besides this, the firm has made announcements in Kansas City and Chicago that it is looking for men to replace the strikers.</p>
   <p>Fifteen major cities will be affected by the strike in the event that it is called, as well as all the large packing houses and their affiliates.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0037.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The workers claim that the strike is being called because the company will not recognize their union. The recent cut in pay is also a factor.</p>
