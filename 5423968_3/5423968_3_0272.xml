   <p>It is a well known fact that there is no equality in this world, neither in the human nor other kingdoms.</p>
   <p>Men are not equal in respect to character and mental development.</p>
   <p>There night be two persons who are dressed alike or who resemble each other, but there are no two persons who have the same character or whose spiritual level is exactly the same.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why some people are very wise, others are stupid, and still others are very stupid.</p>
   <p>The spiritual development of humanity could be presented as a very long ladder, and each rung occupied by only one human being.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0273.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These are the facts and no human power can change them for such is the law of nature.</p>
   <p>Whereas every person has a different character, every person mush have a different view on this or that question. That is why we have so many political and social doctrines, some of them are wise; others are foolish.</p>
   <p>The most absurd of all of them is the Socialist doctrine, because it is not based on anything that is real or practical, but on idle phrases. Secondly, it is very old and has not made any progress.</p>
   <p>It has brought only poverty and death. Let us for example, take Russia. One glance will convince us of reality.</p>
