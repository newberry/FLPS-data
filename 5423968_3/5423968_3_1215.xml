  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held by the Polish Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward at A. Nowak's Hall, Webster and Seeley Avenues, Sunday, January 10. The hall was jammed by ardent Democrats.</p>
   <p>The club numbers over two hundred members. All these and many newcomers were present at last night's affair.</p>
   <p>John Krajecki opened the meeting at 6:30 P.M. In a short address he thanked everyone for attending the meeting. This was followed by many warm discussions about the plans to be made for the coming elections.</p>
   <p>An executive committee was chosen, consisting of F. Czepek, W. Soleski, and Felix Lama. One of the younger members put through a motion to organize a debating club. The purpose of this club is to discuss and debate the major political issues.</p>

   <p>Many speakers appeared on the rostrum. Mr. Nowak spoke to the youth and urged it to take more interest in politics. Before he closed his speech he told the Polish youth to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered in the city, for without education we will not be able to compete with the Irish, German, and other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Felix Lama spoke about the necessity of organizing clubs of uniting in one solid group. To make his point clear he referred to the work being done among the other nationalities along these lines. Mr. Lama said that only through a strong organization will we avoid being taken advantage of. The speaker urged the businessmen and national as well as church societies to support the political clubs.</p>
   <p>Many other speeches were made, and many questions relative to the coming campaign were discussed.</p>
