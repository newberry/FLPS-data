   <p>It is not very easy for a working man to distinguish between a real friend and an enemy, because the enemies cover their real purpose very cleverly by flattery and insignificant favors.</p>
   <p>At present we have a regular post-war mental confusion in respect to social order. This confusion is excused by all kinds of reformers and progressives, who do not even know the fundamental principles of progress. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to give this matter very careful attention and find out who is really a friend of the working man and who is his secret enemy.</p>
   <p>Above all we should remember the old time saying; "A friend in need is the friend indeed." Our real friends reveal themselves in times of trouble, misfortune or need. We should observe very carefully all activities of so-called "friends" and protectors and the effects produced by these activities. Furthermore, we should remember that a true friend is not a flatterer; he would rather show us our faults. A true friend does not flatter us because <pb facs="5423968_3_0265.jpg" n="2"/>the motive of his friendship is unselfish love, a desire to do good. A real friend of the working man will not make a statement that he is his only defender and protector; he will not make a selfish monopoly out of caring for the needs of his fellowmen; this is done only by false friends who profit by the confidence of the working man; and who by the gullability of the working man want to create for themselves a get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
   <p>A true friend of the working man will never try to rouse hatred against other social classes among the working class; he will not incite a working man to violence, for he knows well that it would bring him only harm; but he will always show him the true cause of his poverty and exploitation due to his low mental level, lack of knowledge regarding the laws and rights of citizenship and gullability.</p>
   <p>A true friend of the working man will not try to discourage him from learning history, either past or present; on the contrary he will try to teach him the history of civilization, because, only the knowledge of that which can give us a true view on present social conditions can save us from mistakes <pb facs="5423968_3_0266.jpg" n="3"/>which lead to moral and material ruin.</p>
   <p>A true friend of the working man will always encourage him to study, to learn, in order that he may better himself, that he may become a useful member of society and the nation. This is, more or less, how a true friend of the working man acts.</p>
   <p>And how do his false friends and protectors act? The first step of the false protector of the working man's interest is to convince the working man that the whole social system is faulty and decayed, that his only salvation is the revolver, the bomb, the violent revolution removal of the property owners by murder; and abolition of private ownership. Then, he persuades the working man to believe that all wealthy people obtained their wealth not by work but by stealing and robbing the working class, that hard work is degrading, and that we could live comfortably without working, providing all the wealth of the country is equally divided.</p>
   <p>The false protectors of the working man never do anything for him without touching his pocket book. The working man will suffer for it, for instead <pb facs="5423968_3_0267.jpg" n="4"/>of progressing he is retarding his mental development and becomes an easy prey of "heavenly birds" who do not sew, yet they reap. This is a warning to all well-thinking working men.</p>
