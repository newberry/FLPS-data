  <body>
   <p>Every Polish Democrat living in Chicago, having a little understanding of our city's political affairs, knows this very well: that the Polish Democrats with their number of votes do not receive any consideration from this party, neither do they control a considerable per cent of political offices; the Poles aren't given a proper number of Polish candidates on the ballots, and lack the true support of this party.</p>
   <p>This fault is evidently due to us Poles alone. We have not advanced enough in our political endeavor and we do not progress solidarily enough for our own good as we really should.</p>
   <p>Above all we lack a big Polish Democratic organization. During a short period we had a Polish Democratic county league, but for quite a time it has not been functioning, it is dead now.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0866.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>NEED OF A NEW GENERAL ORGANIZATION</p>
   <p>We are in need of creating a new active Polish Democratic organization in the city of Chicago, County of Cook. This organization should consist of representatives representing Polish clubs; a club of this kind should exist in every ward in Chicago, and in every small town with Polish residents, within the jurisdiction of Cook County. The representatives of these clubs can be divided in this order: that a precinct with one hundred or more Polish citizens should be represented by one representative; the ward having the most Polish citizens in Chicago will be the headquarters of this organization; thus, if we Poles live up to these rules, there is no doubt in our minds that we will get more consideration in the future than we ever had.</p>
   <p>BIG CAMPAIGN NEXT YEAR</p>
   <p>Next year, in the autumn of 1906, we will have to elect twenty-eight city judges, fifteen county commissioners, a few court clerks, a county judge, <pb facs="5423968_3_0867.jpg" n="3"/>a treasurer and county clerk, congressmen, senators, and representatives, besides other officials, all together about sixty officials. If everything runs smoothly in our club we should have at least six candidates. Shall we? That's another question. This all depends on us. If we attempt to do this and get to work on this immediately, we will have to be considered in this coming election.</p>
   <p>POLISH DEMOCRATIC CLUB IN EVERY WARD AND TOWN</p>
   <p>All Polish Democrats in every ward and town should organize and support this Polish Democratic club, this week, the quicker the better. Pick five members to represent the administration of the Central Polish Democratic organization in Cook County.</p>
   <p>Tuesday, Dec. 5, 1905, at 8 P. M., the first big meeting of the representatives of this Polish Democratic club will be held at Schiller Hall, room 301 and 302 at 109 Randolph street to form the Central Polish Democratic organization of Cook County.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0868.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And so to work fellow-Democratic citizens! Join the ward clubs and create a general organization in our city and county; an organization that will with-stand political interests. Therefore, people from various political circles will respect us.</p>
   <p>We hope that all the Democratic Poles will realize the need of such an important act, and will send their representative without fail to the place of this meeting.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Committee of the Polish Democratic Club of Cook County.</p>
