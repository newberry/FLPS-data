  <body>
   <p>A week from tomorrow, April the 11th, we will know who shall be nominated for the office of county judge. The results of this election shall be known to us by midnight on that day. We will then know definitely whether Jarecki defeats his Irish opponent or whether he will be the defeated victim due to lack of support given him by his countrymen.</p>
   <p>Among the Poles, Jews, and Czechs there exists an understanding in the present campaign, and should end with a victory for the deserving candidates. The Irish, who have governed in politics for a long time have already nominated their candidate. This candidate is Rooney, who in not a Democrat. Rooney is the candidate supported by those "green-islanders." who still believe that every policeman, every fireman and every official in the city of Chicago and Cook County should and must <pb facs="5423968_3_0611.jpg" n="2"/>be an Irishman.</p>
   <p>The "regular" party presents Jarecki. The Poles must elect Jarecki with the aid of the Jews and Czechs! They say that you cannot depend on the help given by others and so the whole argument ends here, the Poles themselves must elect Jarecki.</p>
   <p>We know the Jews and Czechs are backing us. We also know that there are some Irishmen who are supporting us, but our main strength lies in our very own Polish votes. For this reason at election time, April 11th, every Polish vote will be necessary.</p>
   <p>If we care to be victorious, hoping to elect Jarecki April 11th, we must display our entire strength.</p>
   <p>Every Pole must vote on this day. If we don't, there shall be no victory for us. And so let us be active, go to work and do your part.</p>
