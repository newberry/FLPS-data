  <body>
   <p>During the present primary election, in the ninth Ward, especially, there is much excitement among the Polish element because the Republican organization has nominated a Pole to run for the aldermanic office in April. The choice of G. Lauferski brings a Polish aldermanic possibility for the first time in the history of the ninth Ward.</p>
   <p>The Polish people of that Ward realized the significance of this victory, and have immediately planned a mass meeting after the primaries. This meeting was held last night at St. Albert's Parish Hall. A committee of fifteen was chosen to lay plans for a campaign in the Ward. S. Rokosz was chosen as a delegate to make a collection, and over one hundred dollars was given towards the support of the campaign.</p>
   <p>Every member that crowded the hall pledged to support their native son.</p>

   <p>Among those present was also a Bohemian delegation that offered assistance. To assure victory of this first Polish aldermanic possibility, it was agreed to hold political meetings everyday during the coming week.</p>
