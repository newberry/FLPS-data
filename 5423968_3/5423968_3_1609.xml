   <p>Last night the Democratic Club of the sixteenth ward held its pre-election meeting at A. Schutz's hall, Blackhawk and Noble Streets. Alderman S. Kunz opened the meeting and named J. Arkuszewski to act as president and F. Murkowski as secretary.</p>
   <p>Alderman Kunz made the first speech of the evening, and after him followed City Treasurer Peter Kiolbassa. The following persons also spoke: Joseph Schroeder, L. Roland, John Biniak, A. J. Kowalski, and Attorney M. Kaczmarek.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kowalski, who had been supported as alderman of the sixteenth ward by the other fellow speakers, asked the people to tell him frankly if they would support him in the April elections. At his words practically the entire assemblage rose to its feet and amidst the applause was heard the cry of "Kowalski must be our alderman ten times over."</p>

   <p>The Poles were informed of the importance of the coming election and urged to cast their vote. Getting a Pole on the West Town ticket would be another step forward in city politics. Keen effort in this direction will probably place one of our men on the ticket for Collector, or some other office.</p>
   <p>The Polish citizens of the sixteenth ward showed their interest by filling the hall to capacity. This is a good indication that their vote will be a deciding factor in the April elections.</p>
