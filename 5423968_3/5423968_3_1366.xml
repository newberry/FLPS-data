   <p>Saturday afternoon, September 4, the newly built park at Holt and Blanche Streets was officially opened for public use. A majority of Polish children and adults were on hand to participate in the program. The ceremony was opened with the singing of the national anthem and then the Polish people sang their national hymn, "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>On the program, arranged by J. Stitt, the following delivered speeches: Mrs. Henry Wade Rogers, Mrs. E. Sly, Miss Mary McDowell, N. B. Gallaway, and Edward Horth. All the speakers made reference to the imperative need of such parks throughout Chicago. They were of the opinion that the danger of playing in the streets would be greatly eliminated.</p>
   <p>John Czekala spoke in the name of the Poles. His speech was on safety.</p>

   <p>The Poles thanked the organizers of this park.</p>
   <p>After this many competitive games between children took place. Many books were distributed among the children. After the program was over, all children received a flower as a token of the opening of the park.</p>
