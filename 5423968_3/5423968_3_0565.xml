   <p>At one time we were so bold as to ask what was really happening in the renowned "Liberty League." A convention of this League was to have been held at Omaha, Nebraska, about a month ago, at which its principles were to be made known and its platform presented--[the platform]with which it was to take vigorous action before the all Republican congress. All is quiet about the convention and nothing is heard even about the Liberty League.</p>
   <p>It is of consequence to us to know something more definite about this matter because it pertains to the public interest. Nearly all the Polish periodicals defended the League, and only we dared to express a conjecture that perhaps this League as yet is not necessarily the alpha and omega of human intelligence. For this we were covered with abuse.</p>
   <p>Did the Liberty League feel such a need of rest after this victory that it has fallen asleep? And it followers, do they not wish to disturb the League's peace that is so salutary to the nation?</p>
