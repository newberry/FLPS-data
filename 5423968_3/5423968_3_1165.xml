   <p>The Polish Women's Democratic League was organized in 1916. There were very few wards organized at first, since it was only the beginning of women's interest in political affairs. In addition, the women had differing views about the political parties. This and other factors hindered the League's development.</p>
   <p>Everything changes with time, and this applies to politics. The Polish women citizens have come to understand their task more perfectly. They are exerting all efforts to organize their Democratic clubs in nearly every ward where Poles are found.</p>
   <p>In order to create a better understanding, to form a powerful political unit, and, at the same time, to aid our fellow Poles, the undersigned have devised the idea of organizing all Polish-American citizens. With this purpose in mind, they are calling a meeting of all Poles at the Democratic headquarters, the Briggs House on Wednesday, February 3, 1915, at 2:00 P. M., and all Polish women <pb facs="5423968_3_1166.jpg" n="2"/>citizens are invited.</p>
   <p>Every organized ward club in Chicago is requested to appoint five women delegates to attend this meeting. They will have an opportunity to present their opinions and plans for reorganizing the Polish Women's Democratic League.</p>
   <p>For the Committee:</p>
   <p>F. Rydzewski</p>
   <p>L. Kadow</p>
