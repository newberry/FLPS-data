   <p>The Polish Daily News (Dziennik Chicagoski) on August 10, 1923, published a political editorial, which we deem of enough importance to translate and submit to our readers for thoughtful consideration. The article speaks for itself.</p>
   <p>Two Senators represent the State of Illinois in Congress. They are Medill McCormick of Chicago and William B. McKinley of Champaign, Illinois. The term of the first mentioned expires in the year 1925, and that of the other in the year 1927.</p>
   <p>"We are a Democratic newspaper and some may unwisely conclude that we should not touch upon the internal dissensions and friendships obtained in the Republican party. To such persons we apologize, and for the moment will interrupt the 'monotony' of the discussion about the Democratic party and its leaders, good and bad and direct our attention to Senator HcCormick.</p>
   <p>"The writer of this article had the privilege of meeting Senator McCormick at public meetings, three of them, and twice in Washington, if he recalls correctly, in the 'Press Club'."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0583.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Sen. McCormick always maintains that he is a friend of the Poles, but never backed up that contention with deeds. On the contrary, he acts as though he carried all the Poles in his vest pocket and was not compelled to seek their consideration or friendship.</p>
   <p>"At one time the periodical known as the Chicago Society News from the pen of its able editor, attorney Louis Pinderski, a Republican, charged both Senators with that fact that neither have done anything for our citizens.</p>
   <p>"We will go a little further, and for a moment raise the political curtain to prove that Sen. McCormick not only did nothing for the Polish voters, but did not even make an attempt to do anything for the Republicans of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>"With the changed administration, and after the resignation of Julius F. Smietanka, Collector of Internal Revenue during the Wilson regime, we know well that this office was to have gone to a citizen of Polish ancestry, who, as a Republican aided in the national campaign and later became the link between McCormick and the national administration, and the Poles of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0584.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"When it came to filling the position above mentioned, held by a Polish citizen, Mrs. Mabel Reinecke, against whom we have no complaint, was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue, at the insistance of Senator McCormick, that staunch friend of the Polish voter. The writer was present at a conversation, among men who were not of Polish origin, about filling the position of Collector of Revenue which throws an interesting light on the friendship of Sen. McCormick for the Poles. The conversation was confidential and private in nature, although nothing was said about keeping it in confidence, we expect to keep it and will not repeat it. The writer can assure you that it depended entirely on the Senator whether a Polish citizen would get the appointment or not.</p>
   <p>"Facts teach us, and this fact has taught us, that McCormick made no attempt to get the appointment of Collector for one of our citizens, and that is a certainty.</p>
   <p>"The untimely death of our late President, whom we all loved and respected, again disclosed the little respect Sen. McCormick has for the citizens of Polish origin. Among the many committees appointed was one named by the Senator. The Senator as a politician and a diplomat, as he is known to many, is cognizant of the fact that <pb facs="5423968_3_0585.jpg" n="4"/>we are loyal citizens of this country. As a publicist and writer (he is a member of the Tribune family) he knows very well that the Polish citizen felt the loss deeply as did the entire citizenship of this country. Knowing all these things, what does he do? He names a committee on which list there is not one Polish citizen.</p>
   <p>"Far be it from us to attempt in the hour of the loss of our first citizen, to divide our citizens into parties or factions, but Senator McCormick, had he so desired, could have looked around among our people and found many worthy and deserving citizens of Polish extraction, to many of whom he is bound by ties of friendship, and designated the members of that committee.</p>
   <p>"We need but mention the names of : John F. Smulski, well known in the Republican circles, Anthony Czarnecki, with whom the Senator is well acquainted, President C. Zychlinski of the Polish National Alliance, to whom the Senator is much indebted when the P. N. A. is considered, and there is Miss A. Emily Napieralski, President of the Polish Women's Alliance, who was a Vice-President at a mass meeting last fall at the Auditorium at which the Senator spoke, and finally there is Mr. John B.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0586.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Wieklinski, Post Office Inspector. Besides these, there are thousands of other worthy Polish men and women whom Sen. McCormick passed by a if they were unworthy of a place on the committee of mourners.</p>
   <p>"Senator McCormick passed us up--forgot about us and thousands of loyal citizens of our parentage, and thousands of the late President's Polish admirers. This slight, which will be charged to the strain and excitement of the occasion, said by his act that there were none among our Polish citizens capable of representing our element in expressing its sorrow on the occasion of the burial of the President, as members of his committee."</p>
   <p>We have no comment to add on our part, preferring to leave the worth of the article to the individual judgment of our readers.</p>
