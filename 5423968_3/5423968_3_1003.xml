   <p>Every citizen who has changed his address since the last elections, or who failed to register for the autumn elections, must register now if he wishes to vote. Only one day has been set aside for registration in the regular polling places, which will be open from 8 A.M. to 9 P.M.</p>
   <p>Those who have had their first papers for two years (figuring to April 4, Election Day) can now obtain their second papers free of charge. Such persons should come with their witnesses to August J. Kowalski, 617 Noble Street, on Saturday, at any time until eight in the evening. Mr. Kowalski will provide every applicant with a card which will enable him to obtain his second papers free of charge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1004.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Second papers are to be issued by Judge Clifford on Saturday and Monday evening.</p>
   <p>Those having any doubts as to their citizenship status may apply to Mr. Kowalski for information. Likewise, the editorial office of Dziennik Chicagoski will supply information every day before noon.</p>
   <p>It is most important that all those wishing to vote register on Tuesday.</p>
