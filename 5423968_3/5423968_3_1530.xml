   <p>Installation ceromonies of the new leading city officials, recently elected, were held in the city Hall.</p>
   <p>Mayor C. H. Harrison and other officials were accorded a great and enthusiastic reception. About 2000 persons were able to gain admittance for the occassion. Beautiful floral decorations, baskets of flowers were tendered the officials. Estimated cost etc. was $6000.00. When the Mayor arrived he was escorted into the chambers by the Police, Fire Dept., Democratic Organizations and a number of bands. It seemed the program would never end.
