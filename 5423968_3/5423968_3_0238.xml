   <p>One has to laugh heartily when one hears the Socialists loudly renouncing the Bolsheviks, claiming that they warped the socialistic idea and that they have rendered it odious through their unskillful compliance with active socialist principles.</p>
   <p>Like all other socialistic arguments, so is this one only an empty phrase calculated for the ignorant masses and nothing else.</p>
   <p>In reality, Russian bolshevism is nothing else but conformation of a practical socialistic theory, it is practical socialism.</p>
   <p>Sociali<gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in a form as it is being preached at present by socialistic teachers is the entree to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, it only clears the way for bolshevism and, there-fore, is the last phase of the socialistic make-up, beyond which there is nothing but remnants of conflagration, death and the cemetery.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0239.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Socialism kindles the flame of class <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and hatred and prepares for bolshevism to reign over the ruins <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of the cultural and civil acquisitions burned by the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>Socialism, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> from under cover by an <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> organized capital, is making war on the national capital, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in this way economically a given nation and rendering it <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> ready to commit mass suicide <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to despair, by throwing it self into the whirlpool of a fratricidal war and giving away later voluntarily the rule over itself to the murderers of the social intellect and work, and to their own <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>Socialism quite often clothes itself in various garments in order to hide its own intentions and aims, so as to gain easier the confidence of the masses, to acquire through them the physical power necessary to arouse disturbances and riots in the community, and, if it is successful, to accomplish a bloody bolshevistic overthrow.</p>
   <p>Socialism, by degrees, drop by drop, trickles into the weak heart and mind, <pb facs="5423968_3_0240.jpg" n="3"/>the venom of hopelessness, hatred of one's own nation and one's Christian culture, with the intention of leading man to despondency, savagery and brutality; bolshevism casts these savage multitudes before itself and brings about a complete work of destruction, preparing in this way the exclusive rule of an "anonymous" power over the world. Socialism is a red, bloody theory; bolshevism is a socialistic practice.</p>
   <p>For that reason, all of you desire happiness for yourselves and your children, those of you who want to live and develop, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> yourselves against socialism, because socialism does not build <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> destroys everything; because destruction and agitation are its aims.</p>
