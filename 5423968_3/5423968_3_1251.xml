   <p>We have been requested to publish the following announcement:</p>
   <p>On Sunday, February 25, the Poles of the 20th Ward held a political meeting for the purpose of organizing a political club.</p>
   <p>The meeting, which was held at St. Joseph's school hall, was opened by the pastor of St. Joseph's church with a short address.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Jan Kumpria and Mr. F. B. Chamberski had been chosen chairman and secretary respectively, the speakers explained the purpose of the club, the name of which was discussed but not settled. The next meeting, to which all Poles are invited, especially those having their first papers, will be held on March 4, at 4 P.M., in the same place.</p>
   <p>There are no dues of any kind. The object of the club is to encourage the <pb facs="5423968_3_1252.jpg" n="2"/>Poles to participate in political activities in order that they may gain political influence.</p>
