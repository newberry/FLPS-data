<title level="a">CONVENTION OF THE POLISH REPUBLICAN LEAGUE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The long-advertised convention of the Polish Republican League of Cook County was held yesterday in Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>We hear all kinds of conflicting reports about this convention. The official report, sent to us by the secretary of the convention, sounds beautiful. Everything went smoothly, nicely, and peacefully.</p>
   <p>The reports of disinterested and trustworthy witnesses at the convention are quite different. They prove that it was merely a sham, arranged by a few leaders, filled with quarrels and incidents.... That is how the Tribune, the Republican party organ, and a power in the Republican party, reported the convention.</p>
   <p>We are printing herewith the reports of both factions, to avoid any suggestion of partisanship from our side. We are first publishing the report of <pb facs="5423968_3_0936.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Leo M. Nowak, and immediately thereafter an accurate translation of an article from the Tribune.</p>
   <p>The Official Report</p>
   <p>The official report received by us reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"On Sunday, March 1, a convention of delegates to the Polish Republican League of Cook County was held in Pulaski Hall, on Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>"After the credentials committee, consisting of Leo M. Nowak, from the Fourteenth Ward, Frank Karcz, from the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Ward, and S. Kwasniewski, from the Thirtieth Ward, had carried out its duty, Mr. Max L. Kaczmarek (Kasmar), temporary president of the League called the Convention to order and cordially greeted the delegates in a lengthy speech. Then Mr. Leo M. Nowak read the list of the delegates.</p>
   <p>"The reports of all the various committees were unanimously passed. Next, <pb facs="5423968_3_0937.jpg" n="3"/>according to the program, followed the election of new officers for the League for the ensuing year.</p>
   <p>"In the balloting for president, Mr. Max L. Kaczmarek, from the Sixteenth Ward, received all the votes, and was declared president of the League. Others elected were: first vice-president, Mr. S. Kwasniewski, from the Thirtieth Ward; second vice-president, Mr. F. J. Palt, from the Sixth Ward; recording secretary, Mr. Andrew J. Schultz, from the Sixteenth Ward; financial secretary, Mr. F. Karcz; treasurer, Mr. S. Budzbanowski, from the Ninth Ward; marshal, Mr. J. Wabalinski, from the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>"The following were elected to the executive committee: Sixth Ward, F. J. Palt; Ninth Ward, Joseph Tomas; Tenth Ward, Martin Kucik; Fourteenth Ward, Leo M. Nowak; Fifteenth Ward, Theophil L. Patta; Sixteenth Ward, Walter Nowak; Seventeenth Ward, Julius Malkowski; Thirtieth Ward, S. Kwasniewski.</p>
   <p>"Additional nominations to the executive committee were postponed until <pb facs="5423968_3_0938.jpg" n="4"/>the next meeting.</p>
   <p>"L. M. Nowak."</p>
   <p>THE TRIBUNE REPORT</p>
   <p>In the Chicago Tribune we read a different version of the convention:</p>
   <p>"THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE POLISH REPUBLICAN LEAGUE IS LONG AND STORMY</p>
   <p>"Fifty delegates representing Polish Republican Clubs from ten wards, as well as Lemont, South Chicago, and Hawthorne, assembled yesterday for the convention of the Polish-American League of Cook County, which was held in Pulaski Hall. There were almost as many alternates as delegates; there were also delegates with no credentials; there were two factions, which endeavored to enlist support, and on account of this bickering, the session was long and stormy.</p>
   <p>"Ex-Alderman Dahlman, a member of the Board of Equalization, was leader of <pb facs="5423968_3_0939.jpg" n="5"/>the minority faction, and Mr. Max Kasmar (Kaczmarek) led the majority faction. Mr. John F. Smulski, who wishes to become alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, tried to placate both parties, but his efforts were unavailing.</p>
   <p>"An effort was made to pass resolutions indorsing certain candidates on the Republican ticket in West Town; other resolutions protested against the meager representation of Poles in the City Council. And when Mr. Dahlman left the hall with his adherents, the meeting was hastily adjourned, because there were no more delegates to protest.</p>
   <p>"THE FIRST DIFFICULTY</p>
   <p>"The first difficulty was encountered when the credentials committee was to be nominated. The delegates of the Sixteenth Ward, led by Mr. Dahlman, insisted that the committee be composed of seven members. The majority, however, decided that a committee of three was sufficient, and when the chairman appointed these, the opposition, numbering seven, walked out of the hall, and then about <pb facs="5423968_3_0940.jpg" n="6"/>twelve other adherents, who had no credentials but who always voted with them when a standing vote was requested, followed them.</p>
   <p>"However, before Mr. Dahlman left, he tried to eliminate the temporary president and elect a new president for the ensuing year. He was ruled out of order.</p>
   <p>"When the malcontents left, it was comparatively peaceful, and further business was considered. Max L. Kasmar was elected president of the League for the following year; Andrew J. Schultz was named recording secretary, and S. Budzbanowski, treasurer.</p>
   <p>"In the meantime, another quarrel broke out among the delegates and it was difficult for the chairman to maintain order. The speakers continually made personal attacks, claming that the chairman refused to recognize them; the chairman seldom interrupted them; hence the noise was terrific.</p>
   <p>"When one party tried to put a motion to a vote, the minority threatened to <pb facs="5423968_3_0941.jpg" n="7"/>leave the hall, and if a new motion was submitted for debate, the majority demanded consideration of the previous motion.</p>
   <p>"A GREAT RIOT</p>
   <p>"An effort was made to elect a central committeeman from every ward to the Polish Cook County organization. Then the riot began. In some wards two separate Republican clubs exist, and the rivalry between them is great. Each club had its own favorite candidate for the position of committeeman. So there were a half-dozen factions, and it was very difficult for the chairman to preserve order.</p>
   <p>"In some of the ward groups,the fight was so intense that, after a half-hour of furious discussion, the selection of a committeeman was postponed until the next meeting. In the course of an hour, representatives of some of the wards were elected to the Polish executive committee. The Ninth ward group, Hawthorne, South Chicago, and Lemont, did not elect delegates.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0942.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>"An effort was made to indorse the candidacy of Mr. N. F. Relewicz, who seeks the nomination for West Town clerk. But the friends of Mr. M. J. Szamait, who is a candidate for the same office, would not permit it.</p>
   <p>"The discussions were ended when twelve delegates, with Mr. J. Napieralski at their head, left the hall. Then the meeting was hastily adjourned."</p>
   <p>WHICH TO CHOOSE?</p>
   <p>It is left to the discretion of our readers to believe what Mr. Nowak wrote or what is published in the Tribune.</p>
   <p>We would rather believe the Tribune, the more so because trustworthy and respectable Polish Republicans assure us that the convention was merely a sham, arranged by certain bosses to satisfy their own ambitions.</p>
   <p>If this is really a fact, it is sad.</p>
