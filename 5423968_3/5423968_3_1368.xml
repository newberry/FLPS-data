   <p>Fellow citizens! I have been a resident of Chicago for the last twenty-five years. During these years I have become familiar with the Republican, the Democratic, and other parties.</p>
   <p>In a few words I wish to say that the Democrats are the friends of the poor, whereas the Republicans are senseless exploiters and oppressors of the poor people.</p>
   <p>In the term of my residence in Chicago the city never rotted in such rubbish and muck as it has been defiled with during the last two years. Remember the "parks of Swift," the streets full of holes, and the unprecedented disorder in addition to this.</p>
   <p>And the taxes! Do these days of depression warrant such disgraceful increases? I had never paid more than $18; however, during the last two years I have paid <pb facs="5423968_3_1369.jpg" n="2"/>$24.30, and at present I pay $26.23. Despite this there are not funds sufficient to pay the teachers, let alone to build public schools.</p>
   <p>Every one of you feels the pinch of this; therefore, you should consider every Republican as a traitor, and every independent candidate as selfish or jealous. Let us not expect anything from such a group.</p>
   <p>Remember this, you old timers, and help our younger citizens; let us cast our votes for the regular Democratic party.</p>
   <p>I do not consider myself a politician, nor do I listen to politicians' lies or attend the meetings held in saloons. I am merely voicing my sincere opinion and wishing for the good of all.</p>
