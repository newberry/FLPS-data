   <p>The "American Federationist", the voice of the American Federation of Labor, in statistics secured in 23 large cities shows that 17.8 percent of the workers who are members of a union are idle. This is an increase of .04 percent over that of the last publication. Of the larger cities, Baltimore has the greater increase per capita which is 42.5 percent; next in line is Cleveland with 33.8%, followed by Buffalo with 26.7 percent, New York, 24.2%, Los Angeles, 22.7% and Jersey City 21.6%. Chicago, has in proportion the smallest number of unemployed union workers; only 7.8% are idle.</p>
   <p>The grand total of unemployed reaches the four million mark. This total, however, is really far greater because of the time required to compile statistics through the organ of the American Federation of Labor. If 17% of the skilled union workers, are without employment, the percentage of unemployed must be substantially greater. The unions have, however, an organized system for aiding the unemployed in their search for work. The "American Federationist" does not favor the present situation, nor does it offer a solution to the problem of unemployment; neither does it remove the idea, that the main cause of unemployment is over production, and poor distribution. These prevailing conditions could, to some degree, be remedied for the good of the country in general. This can be accomplished by aiding the major as <pb facs="5423968_3_0198.jpg" n="2"/>well as the minor industries. If, however, we are to judge the present attitude of politics, this is not as important as the coming Presidential election. We cannot, nevertheless,deny that unemployment is increasing.</p>
