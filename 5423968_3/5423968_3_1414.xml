<title level="a">PROFESSOR SZYMCZAK IS PLEASED WITH NEW APPOINTMENT</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Professor Miecislaus S. Szymczak, a former candidate for City Treasure of Chicago, now the secretary of County Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, who received the largest number of votes on the Democratic ticket, was the recipient of appointment to the important office in Cook County, of General Superintendent of Forest Preserve. The position of general superintendent of the Forest Preserves was created by Anton J. Cermak, president of the County Board, on suggestion of the Citizens' Committee, whose chairman is General Abel Davis. The committee, on analyzing the conditions of the Forest Preserves were convinced, that the president of the County Board, Mr. A. J. Cermak, is burdened with many responsibilities and is therefore, unable to concentrate his attention, upon all the affairs of the Forest Preserves in detail, as he would like to.</p>
   <p>As soon as notice was received of Mr. Szymczak's appointment, a reporter was sent to interview him. Mr. Cermak said, that it was upon the suggestion of the Citizens Committee, that he immediately prevailed on Mr. Szymczak to accept this newly created position, because he recognized in him the qualification necessary to fill the duties required. The general superintendent's position was not designated for the purpose of expanding his salary, but for the definite purpose of perfecting all service rendered to the public by the Forest Preserve system.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Forest Preserve system has accumulated 35,000 acres of land and is anticipating a larger area, for which it has a fund of over $1,000,000. However, the Forest Preserves have been somewhat neglected, because it was impossible for Mr. Cermak, as president of the County Board, to observe all of the shortcomings of this department; there is, therefore, much room for improvement, such as will add to the comforts of the public who visit and make use of various facilities which the Forest Preserves offer during the summer season.</p>
   <p>In an interview with our reporter, Mr. Szymczak made the statement that he was very much elated to receive the appointment. The first to call upon Professor Szymczak, at his office, to congratulate him on his appointment for general superintendent were, Mr. Chonarzewski, manager, and Openchowski, editor of The Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>We should be very grateful to Mr. Anton J. Cermak, because he did not forget the citizens of Polish descent. We congratulate Mr. Szymczak, upon his new venture, and wish him success. May he continue to bring great honor to the Poles of Chicago.</p>
