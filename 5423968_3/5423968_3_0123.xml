   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski has already written several times of the great strike now in progress at the lumberyards in Tonawanda, New York, near Buffalo. As is well known, Buffalo has quite a large Polish population. From the very beginning of the strike, which involves most of the townspeople, the owners decided to use the Poles against it. They hired great numbers of Polish people, who worked in the lumberyards as scabs, under the protection of the militia. We omit the clashes that occurred during the strike, the riots, etc. We will not discuss the hatred of the local workers toward the Polish people, caused by this and other cases of scabbing. We are cheifly concerned with the results of this last case. What have the Polish scabs gained? The answer to this question is to be found in the last issue of Echo, which, in its latest news of the strike, <pb facs="5423968_3_0124.jpg" n="2"/>states that the bosses are rehiring the strikers, who are experienced workmen, and turning the Poles out. That is the Polish scabs' reward. They have acted against themselves as well as against the workingmen, and such is the result. We quote the following details from Echo:</p>
   <p>"Hatred for the poor Polish workers, who for some time have been playing the sad role of scabs, reached a culminating point yesterday. The people of Tonawanda, seeing that the bosses had won and had forced the strikers to make concessions, turned their full resentment against the Poles from Buffalo.....</p>
   <p>"The same day, the train carrying the Polish workers back to Buffalo was derailed. There were no serious injuries, but several of the scabs were bruised. A great crowd of people gathered at the scene of the accident and instead of helping to restore order, they stoned the badly frightened Poles. Shots were fired into the crowd. One resident of <pb facs="5423968_3_0125.jpg" n="3"/>Tonawanda was seriously wounded in the stomach; several Poles were severely beaten. The disturbance lasted more than five hours."</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that such scenes are outrageous, that the Poles treated thus are truly unfortunate. They are the more unfortunate in that, while they served as a tool in a struggle against their fellow-workers, they were discharged without even the benefit of having gained permanent, though poorly paid, employment. But in the final analysis, whose fault is it? Our own. The Poles who work so willingly as scabs during strikes are themselves at fault. They gain nothing, but instead awaken against themselves the ever-growing ill will of the workers of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>We, the Poles, should long ago, for our own good and for the preservation of our honor, have left the role of scabs, the drudges of capitalism, to the Negroes and the Chinese.</p>
