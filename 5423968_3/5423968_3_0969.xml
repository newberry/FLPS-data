<title level="a">POLITICAL MASS MEETINGS HELD ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY</title></bibl>

   <p>Many political meetings were held throughout the various Polish communities yesterday [Monday] and Sunday. The Democratic rallies were especially well attended by enthusiastic crowds. Lack of space yesterday did not permit us to publish accounts of these meetings. Although we are faced with the same difficulty today. we are able to give a resume of what has taken place.</p>
   <p>Frank Wenter, candidate for Mayor and a man who is favorably disposed toward us, made speeches at eight meetings in the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, and Fifteenth Wards. He was accorded an enthusiastic welcome at each gathering.</p>
   <p>Two of the meetings were especially outstanding. Piotrowski's Hall, Laurel Street and James Avenue, was filled to capacity. Those unable even to find standing room stood on the sidewalk. Attorney N. L. Piotrowski presided at <pb facs="5423968_3_0970.jpg" n="2"/>the meeting. Messrs. Wenter, Cooke, Mangler, and Senator O'Brien spoke in English, while Peter Kiolbassa and Mr. Piotrowski spoke in Polish. All speakers were given a great hand by the interested audience.</p>
   <p>An equally successful meeting was staged that same evening at Pulaski Hall, which was also jammed. C. Brukwicki presided as chairman. F. Wenter, G. A. Trude, Mr. Mangler, and E. F. Cullerton made speeches in English, and Casimir Zychlinski spoke in Polish. All speakers were well received.</p>
   <p>Other meetings were held at the Bohemian Hall, 592 W. 18th Street, and at the Germania Hall, 31st and Halsted Streets.</p>
   <p>Another large meeting was held at Kronenberg's Hall on Fullerton Avenue. This rally was opened by F. Bieszki, who spoke Polish. Many parishioners from St. Josephat Parish were present. F. B. Kamarki presided as chairman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0971.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Meetings were held yesterday at Apollo Hall, Twelfth Street and Blue Island Avenue; Turner Hall, Fortschritt Turner Hall, and Lincoln Hall. Several thousand people attended each rally.</p>
