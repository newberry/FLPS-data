   <p>We have been requested to publish the following communication:</p>
   <p>"We, the undersigned, representatives of the Independent Polish Bakers' Union, feel that the public should be acquainted with the following facts:</p>
   <p>"The purpose of the Polish Bakers' Union, which was organized a year ago, has always been and still is to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, by legal means, the rights and interests of the Polish workers employed is bakeries and to give them assistance, if necessary. However, after our union had been established for some time, we were informed that an organization embracing all Polish workingmen in the United States was being formed under the name of Polish Workers' Alliance. This organization claimed to have our same purpose but on a large scale. Thinking that we could accomplish more by co-operation and solidarity, we decided to join <pb facs="5423968_3_0513.jpg" n="2"/>the [Polish Workers'] Alliance and support its organ, Gazeta Robtnicza.</p>
   <p>"Neither efforts nor material sacrifices were spared, yet, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> all this, we were disappointed, for the leaders of the Alliance, instead of fighting for the rights of the workers by peaceful and legal means, started to propagate anarchism and lawlessness, a thing which in our opinion is harmful to our workingmen. The Alliance's organ, Gazeta Robotnicza, edited by [J.] Rybakowski, became a source of lies and ridicule against religion, society, and private persons. In the sixth and seventh issues especially, the organ reveals itself as an atheistic and anarchistic journal.</p>
   <p>"Our union has never had, nor has any desire to have now, anything to do with the ideas the Alliance is preaching through Gazeta Robotnicza.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we wish to announce that, according to a unanimous decision reached at our meeting of April 14, our union no longer belongs to the Polish Workers' Alliance and ceases to be Group No. 3 of said organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0514.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"We are workingmen, we support the workingmen's cause, and we are ready to defend our rights, but we have no desire to be anarchists.</p>
   <p>"Polish Bakers' Union:</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Plucinski, president;</p>
   <p>J. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ornung, vice-president;</p>
   <p>W. Troinski, secretary;</p>
   <p>For the Executive Committee:</p>
   <p>Francis Rozwachowski;</p>
