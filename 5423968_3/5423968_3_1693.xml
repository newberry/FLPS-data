   <p>My administration as a justice of the peace ended the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of June. In closing of my court of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, I wish to thank my friends and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> for their brotherly support that I have received for the past 24 years that I have been in office.</p>
   <p>I wish to say that while in office I tried <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> best and most sincerely to serve all of you people.</p>
   <p>Our poor fellow-men, who must suffer so much, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> knowing the English language and <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> advice, always have found in my court a free <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>sulation. All the time and everywhere I tried to serve my nation sincerely. For the past 24 years of court service, I haven's benefited much financially, but to me today it means a great deal <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to have serve you for nothing, than to have received a steady financial in<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1694.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> long term in office I have <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> know what a great deal of annoyances and what big losses our Polish people suffered in other courts. I have known of affairs, where our Polish people were <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> for the rest of their lives and could have secured <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> thousand dollars as a <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> but no, they settled for a few hundred, because they could not speak English, and they engaged <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
