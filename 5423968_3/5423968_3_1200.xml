   <p>To the secretaries of clubs:</p>
   <p>We are informing you that the Republican convention of the Polish League will take place Sunday, Jan. 29, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, at the Holy Trinity Auditorium, located at 540 Noble Street, where the election of officers and the committee will take place, besides finishing all the old business as well as starting the new. Every club belonging to this League has the right to send one delegate for every twenty members.</p>
   <p>The representing delegate has to have a mandate signed by the president and secretary of the club he represents. Clubs not belonging to this league can join by sending to the secretary of the Polish League, not later than Jan. 25, 1905, their declaration and list of the members' names and addresses and undersigned by the club's president and secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1201.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Clubs that do not fulfill the above requirements cannot take part in the voting at this Polish convention, and the delegate will be refused to vote, make a motion, or give any comment.</p>
   <p>We are calling your attention to the convention that the interest shown by the different clubs should be great, because by their presence is the success of the convention decided.</p>
   <p>A. Y. Centralla, President.</p>
   <p>John M. A. Drzycimski, Secretary.</p>
