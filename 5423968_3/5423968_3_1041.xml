   </div>

  <body>
   <p>On page two [of the newspaper] we are printing a copy of the ballot of the sixteenth ward. We cannot print all the ballots of each ward, as space does not permit. Our purpose is to enlighten the people of this ward as to the proper procedure to be used in casting a vote for the various candidates the voters wish to support.</p>
   <p>If one desires to give his vote to all the Democratic candidates, he needs only to place one cross in the large circle before the word 'Democratic.' The same applies if one wants to vote for all the candidates of the Peoples Trade and Labor ticket. Only one cross is necessary in the desired circle preceding the respective party.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1042.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It happens that there are those who do not wish to vote a straight ticket, because they favor a particular candidate from another party, but wish to cast the remaining votes for another party group. In this respect, a cross is not placed in any one large circle. Instead, a cross is marked in each square preceding the desired candidate's name, otherwise the ballot is invalid.</p>
   <p>Special attention must be given when voting a split ticket. Only one cross can be marked in the square for a candidate running for a particular office. That is, a cross can only be placed before one candidate for alderman, or Town Clerk, and not two. The ballot in this respect would be invalid.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1043.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is a simple matter. A preparatory study should be made of this procedure. If this is done, the voter can spare himself the unknowing shame of marking the simple ballot erroneously. Not only that, he can also strengthen the possibilities of his favored candidate. There is no reason for mistakes in voting. With a little instruction, even a child could do this correctly. In case a person makes a mistake marking his ballot, another can be secured, providing the original one is returned.</p>
   <p>If one cannot comprehend the above instructions or cannot help himself because he cannot read English, he can get the assistance from the election judges. There are two judges from each party who are assigned to assist those requiring aid in filling out the ballot. They will make the crosses as designated by the voter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1044.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A person is not allowed to take the ticket out into the street or home. All help must be received before entering the polling place. If any one burns, destroys, or hides the ballot, another one will not be given.</p>
   <p>All the tickets in all the wards of the West side have the same candidates for Town Offices, with the exception of alderman.</p>
   <p>All the tickets of the West Town section will have the name of the candidate, August J. Kowalski, as West Town Collector on the Democratic ticket, and also on the Workers' party ticket. The same occurs in the wards of the South Town section on which tickets appears the name of candidate Juliusz Piotrowski, who is another of our citizens, running for the Supervisor's office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_1045.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>All the Polish people in these two sections should get together and strive hard to assure their countrymen victory in the coming election.</p>
   <p>We will gladly assist all those desiring help in making out the ballot if they will come to our office on Monday or Tuesday morning. Help will be rendered free of charge.</p>
   <p>At the end of the ballot, there is added a proposition in a form of a resolution to have a part of the Town of Cicero annexed to the city of Chicago. At the end of the written matter, two words appear: Yes and No. Those who are in favor of this idea should simply mark out the word 'No' and should let the word 'Yes' stand as it is. Those who are against it, should cross out the word 'Yes' and should let the word 'No' remain intact. If none of these words are crossed out, or if both are, <pb facs="5423968_3_1046.jpg" n="6"/>the voter in this instance did not cast a vote for this cause.</p>
