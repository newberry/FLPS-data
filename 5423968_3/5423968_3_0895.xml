   <p>Harlan, he who on Mr. Kiolbassa especially and on all the Poles generally did not leave a clean "patch," announced publicly that he would be Republican candidate for mayor of the city in the spring. He also stated that he has the wards inhabited by the Poles in his pocket. Mr. Harlan is greatly mistaken when he states that, the Poles will surely vote for him. The Poles will surely know how to repay him for being provoked at every opportunity by this "hot-head," they will show him that the Poles have no votes for fools and squabblers. The nice and sweet words for the Poles will not help Mr. Harlan, neither will the beer with which he claimed he could buy the votes of the Poles. Mister candidate for mayor can rest assured that at the coming election he will receive from Poles such a "licking" as he well deserves.</p>
