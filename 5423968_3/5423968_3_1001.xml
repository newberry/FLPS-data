   <p>Despite the fact that there are from eight hundred to a thousand Poles in the 9th Ward (St. Adalbert's), the Poles of that section have had no success in politics. They have not succeeded in electing a single Pole to office, and in general they have not been able to gain any political advantages. The reason for this state of affairs is the utter lack of organization.</p>
   <p>To this end, a group of Polish citizens have started a movement to organize a Polish-American <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> East Sunday, at a meeting in Pulaski Hall, the Club was organized. It hopes to include all of the Democrats of the 9th <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> The founders of the Club are Frauds Sowadzki, K. Zych linski, J. Rozanski, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>. A great many people joined the Club immediately, and it is hoped that in a short time many more will do the save. A <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> was elected to formulate a constitution; its secretary is Mr. Sowadzki. The Club will be incorporated as soon as possible. Meetings are to be held every first <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>of each month, with <pb facs="5423968_3_1002.jpg" n="2"/>special meetings in cases of emergency.</p>
   <p>Even though the Club is but newly organized, it is already very active. It has called a mass meeting for April 3 at Pulaski Hall. Besides Carter Harrison, Captain Williams, and Judge Hughes, others to speak will be A. E. Gans, August J. Kowalski, K. Zychlinski, G. Kozlowski, and F. Sowadzki.</p>
