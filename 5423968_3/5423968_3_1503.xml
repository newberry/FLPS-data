   <p>The results of yesterday's election were not lucky for honest people. Such gentlemen as Brown, Shurtleff, Wilson and others of their kind received nominations, people who were involved in the well-known graft scandal in connection with the election of Senator Lorimer.</p>
   <p>Too much space would be required here to mention all those nominated to the various offices. We therefore limit ourselves to informing our readers as to the results of the Polish candidates who were nominated.</p>
   <p>And so--from among the Poles we find that Mr. Joseph Pytalk received the Democratic nomination for state representative from the Twenty-seventh District; Mr. Albert Rostenkowski, from the same district, but on the Republican ticket. In the Twenty-first Senatorial District, where several Polish candidates <pb facs="5423968_3_1504.jpg" n="2"/>campaigned, Mr. M. Mitchell was successful in his efforts.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. W. Koraleski obtained the nomination for the Assessor's office, receiving over twenty thousand votes, a majority of more than eight thousand over his closest rival. Mr. Stanley Kuflewski received the nomination for County Commissioner on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Frank H. Landmesser, a staunch Pole and patriot, gained the Democratic nomination in the Twenty-fifth Senatorial District. Mr. John Prystalski was successful in his Democratic candidacy for State Senator. The other Polish candidates at the primaries lost by a very small margin.</p>
