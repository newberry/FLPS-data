   <p>As all of the Zgoda readers already know, the editorials, have never mixed in any American political affairs. During the time of election it only supported their fellow-men.</p>
   <p>At the present time, for the good of the members and the Polonia of Chicago, we are forced to support three candidates who aren't Poles.</p>
   <p>Why?</p>
   <p>We shall immediately explain.</p>
   <p>Mr. George A. Trude is seeking office as judge in the Circuit court. Who is he? He is a brother of the best friend of the Poles in our city, the celebrated A. S. Trude. Mr. Trude, in short, is trying to aid Poles, as many of them as possible, to gain public office in Chicago. He always remembers the Poles.</p>
   <p>He donated $100 toward the monument of Kosciuszko and also collected money from American millionaires for this statue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_3_0909.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Who are we Poles and members of what organizations?</p>
   <p>We must show him gratitude. We ought to support these Americans who have supported us that is in their power. It is necessary that we repay not only with gratitude, but with political action. Mr. A. S. Trude has already done a great deal for us in the past and we can expect even more from him in the future. He does not care to reap a profit from us. He knows our future and our character and remains, as we assure you by our endorsement of his candidacy, a sincere friend of the Poles.</p>
