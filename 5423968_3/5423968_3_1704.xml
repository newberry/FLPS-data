   <p>Victor Karlowski, 634 West Division Street, former editor of Gazeta Polska and ex-member of the Illinois State House of Representatives, has been missing for the last sixteen days.</p>
   <p>On March 4th he reported for work in an unfit condition at Mr. Dyniewicz's office and was sent back home. Mr. Dyniewicz thought that Karlowski would return the next day, but he didn't....Karlowski remained in Chicago until April 3, leaving home as usual every day. He told his wife he was working in a factory at 211 State Street.</p>
   <p>It was first on April 3, that he disappeared completely.</p>
   <p>His wife has inquired about him at the 211 State Street factory, but they never heard of such a man there.</p>
   <p>Some express the opinion that Mr. Karlowski has been the victim of some unfortunate accident. Others claim that he went to Cleveland, Ohio, where he had previously expressed a desire to go.</p>
