   <p>Elections in our city and county, as well as in the whole country were very interesting, especially the fate of the Democrats. The outcome of this election in the case of Mr. W. Bardowski is not yet known, because of false police reports. We can judge that the Irishmen and the Germans used the old method of voting; the Democrats of these nationalities voted Republican, so Mr. Bardowski, a Pole, would not be victorious for the county commissioner's office.</p>
   <p>The Democratic central committee was furious about the attitude shown by these two nationalities toward a Polish candidate; the Poles voted for Democratic candidates regardless of nationalities; how would it look if all Democrats would not vote for a Pole, who belongs to their party?</p>
   <p>It is statistically proven that Mr. Bardowski was victorious by a large majority, and is rightfully our new county commissioner, the same is true of Mr. Kwasigroch, who was elected to the State of Illinois legislature, from the 13th Senatorial district.</p>
   <p>There is some doubt among the different nationalities about his victory, but the final report proves his victory.</p>
