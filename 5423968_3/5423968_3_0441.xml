   <p>The present depression is not the consequence of the ignorant management of the Republicans. For the past fifteen years we've had similar conditions during the administration of the Democrats. Even if the Democrat Cleveland was President during this time, this present crisis would still be here.</p>
   <p>The depression is the result of capitalistic management, which is conducted by the Republicans as well as by the Democrats.</p>
   <p>We are familiar with the capitalistic system, it is supported on private property and uncontrollable gains, obtained from soil, mines, railroads and factories, which are serviced by the work of millions of people.</p>
   <p>We really cannot blame Roosevelt or Cleveland for these present <pb facs="5423968_3_0442.jpg" n="2"/>conditions because this is really the fault of the capitalistic management, supported by those two parties, and we the Socialists demand a change of this productive system.</p>
   <p>The Republicans as well as the Democrats tell us many lies; they claim that the depression is passing, that present conditions are the result of the radical politics of Roosevelt.</p>
   <p>Facts teach us nothing - only Socialism can save us from the capitalistic slavery and so let us join the Socialist organizations and fight on the Socialist side.</p>
