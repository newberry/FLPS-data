   <p>After long and repeated urging on the part of many friends, Pros. Rasmus B. Anderson has under-taken the writing of his autobiography, which he has also consented to give to the readers of paper in installments beginning with the opening of the new year. Prof. Andersons career has been interesting from many points of view.</p>
   <p>His parents were among the earliest Norwegian settlers in this country, so that his story reaches back and practically covers the whole period of Norwegian settlement. He was a member of the first class to graduate from Lutheran College at Decorah, Iowa, was the first man to hold a chair in Scandinavian languages and literature in an American university and the first of Scandinavian parentage to represent our country abroad serving as United States minister in Denmark from 1885-89.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1232.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He has also written and translated numerous books dealing with Scandinavian history and literature. In the American supplement to the Enclyclopedia Brittanica, he is called the father of Norwegian literature in America.</p>
   <p>Prof. Anderson has enjoyed the acquaintance of many eminent men, such as the poet, Longfellow, Prof. John Fiske - Ole Bull, Henrik Ibsen, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Paul de Chaillu, Bismarck, Admiral George Dewey, Fridtjof Nansen, Saphus Bugge, Ivar Aasen, all of the Lindings, George Brandes, Holger Drachmann, the Czar of Russia, the late King Edward of England, the various royal head of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Greece and Portugal and the members of their families, Mark Twain, Bayard Taylor, W. D. Howells, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, John Sverdrup and others. Of all of these he will have some interesting incidents for his readers.</p>
   <p>His autobiography will be particular interesting from two points of view; his accounts of the beginnings of Norwegian settlements in this country and his recollections and estimates of the notables he met not only during his hearly five <pb facs="5423969_5_1233.jpg" n="3"/>years residue near the court of Denmark but also before and since. Because of his own interesting career and his relation with notables of his day Pro. Anderson had been frequently urged to tell his life story. He finally agreed to do so on the condition that someone would take down the facts from his dictation. The writer of this article has undertaken to do and has also suggested their publication in installments in the paper Amerika.</p>
   <p>Prof. Anderson is a good story-teller, with a rare memory for details and a high appreciation of dramatic values and his story will no doubt be read with great interest, particular by the younger generation of Norwegian-Americans in this country, November, 1913, Albert O. Barton.</p>
   <p>With great persistence several of my friends have urged me to write the story of my life. Again and again I have refused largely for the reason that the constant <pb facs="5423969_5_1234.jpg" n="4"/>use of I is distasteful to me. I have however finally yielded to the importunities of my friends and Mr. Barton has already transcribed enough to make my installments in Amerika.</p>
   <p>In autobiography the narrator becomes the center around which the story is gathered and told. He appears to be the chief actor in episodes where he was, in fact a mere super-numerary. It is difficult to draw the line but an effort will be made to keep the author in obeyance and rivet the attention of the readers not only to incidents with chich he has been more or less personally identified, but more particularly to events of which he has been the observer. While I shall at all times do ray best to tell the truth and how close to the line, letting the chips fall where they may, it is my purpose to bestow praise without flattery and find fault without malice.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1235.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>My friends know that I am approaching the three score and ten and probably feel that if this work is not done now it will never be done at all.</p>
   <p>I consider myself exceptionally fortunate in getting so competent a transcriber as Mr. Albert O. Barton. Mr. Barton himself is of Norwegian parentage, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and journalist of many years experience. He was for some time Senator LaFallette's private secretary and assisted the latter in the preparation of his autobiography.</p>
