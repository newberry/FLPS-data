   <p>The school committee passed several resolutions and decided many important questions. The committee consists of Reverend J. N. Anderson, chairman; M. M. Stensland, secretary; and Olof Holen. The following report was given by the committee:</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, in general convention assembled, expresses its thanks to Almighty God for the prosperity our schools have enjoyed during the past year, and again directs the attention of its membership to the fundamental importance of the cause of Christian education.</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as the bylaws of Luther Seminary (par. 16, p. 551, clause 191) fixes the maximum salary of theological professors at $1,800, and inasmuch as this sum is entirely inadequate in meeting the requirements of prevailing conditions, steps should be taken to change the bylaws of Luther Seminary so as to permit a necessary increase in salaries.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0246.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We hereby express our appreciation of the work done by Professor C. K. Preus in raising funds for a library at Luther College, of the good will with which he has been met, and of the enthusiastic interest shown by the students and alumni in planning for the erection of a gymnasium and the creation of a fund for equipment at Luther College. The college authorities are asked to provide for a proper observance of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the institution.</p>
   <p>"The convention rejoices in the remarkable growth of St. Olaf College, and hopes that it may continue to progress along substantial lines. We express our profound appreciation of the long and faithful service of Professor Eikeland who now ceases his active work as a teacher of Norwegian at St. Olaf College. No man among us has done more for the maintenance of interest in the language, history, and traditions of our people.</p>
   <p>"The committee reports the following nominations made by the Board of Education: Luther College: C. K. Preus, president for a term of six years; <pb facs="5423969_5_0247.jpg" n="3"/>O. M. Norlie, professor. St. Olaf College: H. M. Thompson, dean of men: Gertrude Hilleboe, dean of women; E. T. Tufte, Edward Schmidt, Emil Ellingson, W. C. Benson, Karen Larsen, Paul Bollenbacher, teachers; P. C. Birkelo, financial agent with rank of faculty member.</p>
   <p>"We express our appreciation of the faithful and efficient services of Professor J. M. Wick as a teacher during the last two years, and as president of Red Wing Seminary.</p>
   <p>"We congratulate the South Dakota District upon its enthusiastic response to the call for a $200,000 endowment fund for Augustana College and Normal School.</p>
   <p>"We express our appreciation of the valuable work of Professor J. J. Thompson."</p>
   <p>The committee calls attention to the following resolution adopted by our Church in 1917: "'No academy shall institute college classes without the sanction of the Board of Education and the Church.'</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0248.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"We approve of the following proposed salary schedules for teachers:</p>

   <p>"Ordinarily the salaries of teachers in each class in academies, normal schools, and colleges shall, at the discretion of the Board, be increased $100 each <pb facs="5423969_5_0249.jpg" n="5"/>year until it reaches the maximum. In the case of teachers who have the doctorate or have had long experience in teaching, especially in the given institution, the Board shall have authority at its discretion to increase the salary to the maximum.</p>
   <p>"We approve of the recommendation of the Board of Education to create two new positions at Luther College--dean of men and teacher of public speaking and elocution.</p>
   <p>The board of efficency and economy now consists of five members. [None from Chicago.] The board of elementary education has been increased to eight members."</p>
   <p>The following resolution was passed by the convention of the Lutheran Church of America:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We, the members of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, in <pb facs="5423969_5_0250.jpg" n="6"/>convention assembled, have viewed with greatest satisfaction the continued temperance victories being won in our country; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We view with equal satisfaction the fine beginning made in foreign lands, and particularly in Scandinavian countries looking toward universal prohibition, and we are thankful in knowing that the example of America has been an inspiration and help to the temperance leaders of our fatherland; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we express our profound thanks to almighty God for the great moral, social, and economic victory won by the Christian sentiment of this country in outlawing the liquor traffic, and in order that the full benefits of this victory may be realized, we urge upon all law enforcement officers the strict and thorough enforcement of the Volstead Prohibition Enforcement Law. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we urge upon the leaders of both political parties the <pb facs="5423969_5_0251.jpg" n="7"/>absolute rejection of all proposals to repeal or weaken the Volstead Act. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we extend to the Anti-Saloon League the assurance of our hearty support in every possible way that it may battle successfully with the powerful liquor organization until it is completely overthrown and prohibition established as the settled policy of the United States and of the world."</p>
