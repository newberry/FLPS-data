   <p>The Northwestern Emigrant Agent is the name of an advertising sheet published monthly by The Emigrant News Company and containing four pages, four columns to the page.</p>
   <p>Some time ago, the Scandinavians realized that the vast Northwestern empire [of the United States] is richer in resources than in men, and forthwith proceeded to hold conventions and organize bureaus for the promotion of immigration. But it would seem that they have now come to the conclusion that they have too many people and ought to get rid of a lot of them. The starting of a sheet with the avowed purpose of promoting emigration from the Northwest cannot be explained with any other theory--unless we are to assume that the publisher-editor is a fool.</p>
   <p>Judging from an item "devoted" to misrepresentation of Scandinavians, such <pb facs="5423969_5_0945.jpg" n="2"/>an assumption would be entirely safe. "The little villages of Scandinavia," this fellow says, "are plentifully sprinkled with mental wrecks"--people who have been returned from here insane. Whether this statement voices the disappointment or the malice of a "ticket-runner" [office seeker], it is a stupid falsehood. The author evidently knows nothing about "the little villages of Scandinavia". He will be expected to retract his lie and in the future to obtain from slandering the Scandinavians, whose money he probably never refused. If he is bound to misrepresent, let him confine himself to other fields. The Scandinavians decline to be the victims of another "outbreak of that tendency", to use his own words--whatever that may mean.</p>
