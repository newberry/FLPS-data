   <p>Says the Times Herald: "There is apparent exultation in certain circles over the expectation that, with the coming in of Mayor Harrison's administration, Michael Schaack and Captain Hansen are to lose their stars. What ground there is for this expectation the Times Herald has no means of knowing, but it is a noticeable thing that the Market Street gang is doing the most rejoicing. Inspector Schaack has long been a thorn in the sides of that crowd of thugs and lawbreakers, and they, more than any other persons, would gladly see him dismissed from the police force. There are, too, certain friends of Alderman O'Malley who bear ill will against the inspector for his very earnest and persistent prosecution of the alderman on the Colliander charge. This may be natural, but it should have no influence. It is not the business of a police inspector to determine the guilt or innocence of a person charged <pb facs="5423969_5_1468.jpg" n="2"/>with crime. That is the duty of the court and the jury. A police officer may be greatly mistaken as to the weight of the evidence in his possession or its applicability, but he is not mistaken when he brings that evidence before the tribunal whose business it is to pass upon it. To punish an officer for his zeal, is to put a premium on police corruption.</p>
   <p>Inspector Schaak has been connected with the police department of this city for nearly thirty years, and his reputation is widely known. It is that of a faithful and honest and zealous officer, and he should be judged by his record, not by what his enemies say. Least of all should he be made the victim of a gang of outlaws like that of Market Street."</p>
   <p>Every word is true. If we had more men like Schaack in responsible positions on the police force, thug rule and crime would be less rampant in the city. Inspector Schaack and Captain Christian Larsen have made themselves a terror to evil-doers,and it is but natural that the thugs and their protectors should be anxious to get rid of them. A police officer who knows his business <pb facs="5423969_5_1469.jpg" n="3"/>and has the courage to do his duty despite threats and intimidations was never popular with lawbreakers, nor will they ever be.</p>
   <p>During the O'Malley trial, Mr. Schaack and Captain Larsen were made a target for repeated attacks of the most unjust and malicious character. Their energetic zeal in collecting evidence bearing upon one of the foulest murders in the history of Chicago, was persistently represented as personal malice and vindictiveness. Yet they did only what their oath of office bound them to do--their plain duty. If honest and fearless public servants are to be disgraced and punished for doing their duty, lawlessness and crime will reign supreme.</p>
   <p>Inspector Schaack is not dependent upon his salary for a living. Retirement from service would come to him as a well-earned rest without any attendant cares. But he should not retire of his own accord. He has served the people long and faithfully; yet, one duty remains for him to perform, and that is "to stick". The police department has passed into new hands, and <pb facs="5423969_5_1470.jpg" n="4"/>the people are anxious to know, as soon as possible, what sort of service they are going to get for the next two years. The treatment accorded to Schaack and Larsen by the powers that be will furnish the best test that can be desired, and put the new administration on record at the very beginning of its lease of power. Mr. Schaack's position may be far from pleasant, but his duty requires him to remain at his post until he shall be told to go. Let this[article]be in the form of a protest by this paper and its readers.</p>
