  <body>
   <p>The Zion Norwegian Lutheran congregation has undertaken to practice the rule, "The young are to be taught, the old to be honored," through the honoring of two men who have been leaders of the young people in the church since the congregation was first established.</p>
   <p>When the Zion congregation was organized on February 15, 1892, Mr. Jacob Conrad was one of the three founders. He is the only survivor of the three, and through all these years has been taking a prominent part in the Sunday-school work, Norwegian and English, and has been one of the real pillars of the congregation.</p>
   <p>Two weeks ago Mr. Conrad observed his fiftieth birthday. Reverend J. H. Meyer, the pastor of the church, sent notice to Mr. Conrad that he was needed at a conference. On his arrival at the church Mr. Conrad found the congregation assembled and a birthday gift, consisting of a fine dining room suite, placed in the Sunday-school room of the church.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0675.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A very pleasant evening was spent by the congregation and the birthday "child". Singing alternated with speeches. The speakers were Reverend Meyer and Reverend Espeland, and several of the members of the church; and, of course, Mr. Conrad had to speak. He declared that he was not worthy of the kindness bestowed upon him, but that he greatly appreciated the attitude of minister and flock. Afterward the ladies aid society brought refreshments, and late in the evening the people left for their homes, all having enjoyed the social.</p>
