   <p>On October, 1872 a society was organized in Chicago, called the Young Mens Christian Association of the Norwegian Evangelical Trinity Church, Chicago. The soul and originator of this commendable enterprise was lamented Rev. J. Z. Torgerson, who devoted all his time, strength and energy to promote it until, in 1876, he was obliged to give it up in dismay. The first and greatest difficulty encountered was in financing the enterprise, and the next arose from overestimating the society's own resources in the zeal of its members to attain something great for the cause of the Lord. During the first struggle to get a footing one capitol mistake is apparent: Veritable craze for appointing committees seems to have prevailed almost every business meeting some new committee was appointed in consequence of which the same names were frequently found on half a dozen different committees. This procedure caused strife and discord instead of harmony and unity. Another weak spot of the society was its <pb facs="5423969_5_0850.jpg" n="2"/>adherence to one definite branch of the church. Several attempts were made later on to sever the connection and to build in a broader christian basis, that they only caused more strife and bitter animosity between the contending factions. At almost all of the business meetings, the question came up, regarding the relation of the society of the Trinity Congregation, until in December, 1874, a voice was heard that something must be done in order to save the society. Dissolution became practically a fact at the meeting on Jan. 5, 1875. To be sure the regular meetings were still held and a committee was appointed to revise the constitution, but no real work was accomplished and the indifference of the members became more evident as time passed. The society finally arranged its accounts and was formally disolved.</p>
