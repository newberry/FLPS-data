   <p>"We have met on this glorious May day to render homage to liberty. It is altogether fit and proper that we should do so, for in these stirring times, when history is being made, when the fate of a long-suffering people is being determined, liberty and freedom have acquired a fuller meaning to us. A long period of peace and tranquillity had lulled us into a sense of indifference. We did not appreciate our priceless possessions. A mercenary spirit prevailed among us. Recent events, however, have at last aroused the nation from its long sleep. We find ourselves in the darkness of a dreadful war--a war, however, not for plunder, a war not for selfishness, a war not for territorial extension, but a holy war waged for humanity and liberty--not for ourselves but for another nation, a stranger to our blood. Ah, gloriously indeed does America round out her history in the nineteenth century!</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0177.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Another era will soon draw to a close. Who has eloquence enough even faintly to indicate the grandeur of her future?</p>
   <p>"We have selected as the day for this liberty celebration a day near the anniversary of an important event in the history of Norway. Our thoughts on this day,therefore.naturally turn toward the country of our fathers, toward the land so fair, beyond the seas. Fond recollections of happy experiences in the days of old cluster around the 17th of May and render the day ever bright to us. In spirit we visit the old familiar places on that day of liberty. We see the country clad in festive garb. Countless flags are flying on land and on sea. We behold the fair land herself, the old rugged, furrowed, weatherbeaten land, released from her wintry covering and lying refreshed and smiling in the invigorating spring air. The world seeing such a picture would realize, as we do, that in such a land the plants of despotism and of oppression could find no soil.</p>
   <p>"The 17th of May will forever remain a red-letter day not only to us and in <pb facs="5423969_5_0178.jpg" n="3"/>the history of our fatherland but also to the world and in the sacred annals of liberty. For the influence and significance of a victory in liberty's cause, wherever won, extend beyond geographical boundaries and give example and encouragement to humanity in every clime in its weary march toward freedom.</p>
   <p>"The early part of the present century found Norway in a union with Denmark under a king wielding all but absolute power. Though the union between the closely related countries was originally based upon mutual consent, Norway had allowed herself, because of a waning spirit, gradually to drift into a subordinate position.</p>
   <p>"But the spirit of liberty, though asleep, was not dead in the land. It only awaited a fit opportunity to be rekindled in the hearts of the people. The time came. In the year 1814, by the treaty of Kiel, the European powers which had opposed and crushed Napoleon undertook to transfer Norway to Sweden. It was without the consent of the people thus sold. When the news of this highhanded transaction reached Norway, a storm of indignation swept over the land.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0179.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The people arose as one man resolved to regain the liberty and independence of their fathers. Delegates to a national constitutional convention were hastily elected. The convention met at once. On the 17th day of May, 1814, it adopted and promulgated a national constitution. This was a most remarkable and significant document. It placed Norway in the front rank of the democracies of the world. In it the Norwegian people declared themselves free and independent. It was a bold act, and it was a bold document. In the face of the European powers this people--small in numbers but great in purpose and in spirit--asserted its independence. On that great day old Norway, great in history and tradition, redeemed herself. She became worthy of her great past.</p>
   <p>"Yes, we are proud of old Norway. We are proud of her past; we are proud of her present. We see through the hazy mist of history the ancient Norseman. He stands before us as a type of the highest manhood, an independent, dignified individuality. He was brave. He was bold. He was fearless. His field was the wide world. He penetrated beyond the known into the unknown. He <pb facs="5423969_5_0180.jpg" n="5"/>reached the shores of this great continent centuries before the Spanish expedition. Yes, to one of them, to our own Leif Ericson, belongs the honor of first discovering America. This honor is due to him and will be yielded to him, and ere long his monument to be erected here in Chicago will proclaim to coming generations the Norsemen's triumph.</p>
   <p>"We are proud of her present. She has constantly moved onward in liberty and culture. She has demonstrated that the fearless spirit of the Vikings is not dead. Who can read the story of Dr. Nansen's wonderful achievement without feeling a thrill of admiration and pride?</p>
   <p>"Yes, let us acknowledge it--we love that ancient land of our fathers. We are Americans. We are proud of our land of adoption. We are willing to sacrifice all for her protection and her honor. We look upon this glorious land as the land of opportunity, as the land of the future, as the land which will ever lead the world in noble aspirations. But we also freely acknowledge that we entertain tender feelings for the land of liberty and promise of the <pb facs="5423969_5_0181.jpg" n="6"/>old world; that we follow its onward course with solicitude.</p>
   <p>"May she always be found in the ranks of the free--that is the devout wish of our hearts. May we ere long welcome her into the grand sisterhood of the world's republics!"</p>
