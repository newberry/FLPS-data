  <body>
   <p>The bazaar committee has met at the Deaconess Home to make up the accounts from the bazaar of December last. The reason for the delay in accounting is that about two hundred subscription books had been sent to the members in Chicago, and it had taken considerable time and work to get all of them collected. The result of the bazaar is as follows:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Total expenses</cell>
     <cell>$57.59</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Groceries to the Home</cell>
     <cell>7.80</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>To the building fund</cell>
     <cell>664.84</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Total</cell>
     <cell>$730.23</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>In addition there are unsold articles to a value of $40.</p>
   <p>The result of the bazaar exceeded expectations, especially when it is remembered that the committee had only one month for preparation, also that at the time <pb facs="5423969_5_0700.jpg" n="2"/>when the bazaar was being held there were several other bazaars held by Norwegian churches and societies. The committee wishes to express hearty thanks to all those who lent their aid to the good cause...</p>
