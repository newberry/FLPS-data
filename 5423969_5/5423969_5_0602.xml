   <p>This congregation is erecting a new large church and parsonage on the corner, of Humboldt Blvd. and Dickens Av., and as a consequence the call on the members' finances have been heavy. Yet these members are not forgetting their minister and his wife. On Monday a large number of the members of the church met in the school hall of the old church, then marched over to the parsonage and invited the ministerial pair to join them in the old church. The place soon was crowded with people. There was community singing and speech making, and many words of appreciation were spoken of the good pastor and his wife. And then, it developed that in spite of the heavy calls on the members in connection with the building of a new church, enough money had been gathered to procure a beautiful mahogony parlor set, a mahogony center table, and in addition, a purse <pb facs="5423969_5_0603.jpg" n="2"/>of $27 was handed the pastor.</p>
   <p>Reverend Tiller was deeply touched and thankful for the gifts and the attitude that prompted them. Afterward the ladies of the church brought their very special contribution in the form of refreshments. Not till a late hour did this gathering of friends with their leaders separate.</p>
