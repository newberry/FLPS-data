   <p>Knut Hamsun has been awarded the Nobel prize. This causes us to remember him when he lived here in the eighties and nineties. Hamsun was a conductor on the Halsted Street car line, earning about twelve cents an hour. He was very studious and would stand on the back platform of his car and read, often neglecting to collect fares, invariably giving the wrong change, and frequently forgetting to let his passengers off at the street requested. One day he was discharged by the company because he did not know whether he was going north or south on Halsted Street. This was in the days of horsecars.</p>
   <p>After his discharge from the Street railway job, he starved for a long time before he could get another. Those who knew Hamsun remember him as a quiet, unassuming man of a few words.</p>
