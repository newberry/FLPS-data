   <p>Henry Olsen was born at Nordland, Norway, August 24, 1846. He learned the cabinet makers' trade. He arrived in Chicago 1864 without a cent, secured work as a laborer unloading vessels, etc. On Oct. 6, 1864 he enlisted in the United States Army as a volunteer. He was immediately sent to Indiana, where he joined the 82 Regiment Indiana Volunteers. On November 10 of the same year he took (part) in the burning of Atlanta, and was with Sherman on "His March to the Sea," and also on the march from Savannah through South and North Carolina. He took part in many small battles and skirmishes and was at Raleigh, N. C. in April 1865, when Johnston surrendered to Sherman. They then marched north through Richmond to Washington, where the regiment was mustered out of the service, but Mr. Olsen was transferred to the 22nd Indiana Volunteers, then stationed at Louisville, Ky. On July 24, 1865, he was honorably discharged from the <pb facs="5423969_5_1436.jpg" n="2"/>army as a private. Returning to Chicago he secured employment at the Chicago Illinois Central passenger car works, then located at 26th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Mr. Olsen was married to Emilie Marie Harriet Blanquist, January 7, 1866. They have nine children, four sons and five daughters. One son and three daughters are living; all are married, living in Chicago. In 1885 he started his own business and two years later took in Gustav Tilgner as partner, manufacturing all kinds of machinery, patterns, models and mill wright work, under the name of Olsen and Tilgner, their factory being at Indiana Street and La Salle. In 1901 the company incorporated under the name of Olsen and Tilgner Manufacturing Company, of which Mr. Olsen is president, their shop having been moved to 37-39 Ontario Street. Mr. and Mrs. Olsen have been members since 1872 of the Second Norwegian Methodist Episcopal Church, now known as the Maplewood Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church. He has also been identified with the Tabithat Hospital and with the Norwegian Old People's Home since its organization. Mr. and Mrs. Olsen reside at 517 N. Hoyne Avenue.</p>
