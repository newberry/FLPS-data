   <p>Yesterday the Norwegian Synod conference discussed the Synod missions both here and abroad. It was reported that the Chicago Town Mission had done very good work in the local mission field.</p>
   <p>J. R. Birkeland reported for the Town Mission as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Mission workers find much of their work already out out for them in the Juvenile Court, the criminal courts, the city courts, and also at Oak Forest.</p>
   <p>"The work of the Mission broadens each year; it is almost impossible to do what should be done with the few people and the meager resources we have. It is my hope that I will soon be able to have an assistant who will take much of the routine work off my shoulders, leaving me free to work in the field. It is felt that we should have someone assigned to the Juvenile <pb facs="5423969_5_0482.jpg" n="2"/>Court, one who can spend all of his or her time in that institution.</p>
   <p>"In regard to the Immigrant Mission, we have not accomplished all that could and should have been done. However, many of the difficulties have been removed, and much better work and fair results are being obtained.</p>
   <p>"Various institutions--the County Hospital the Detention Hospital, the two hospitals for consumptives, the hospital for contagious diseases, the insane asylum, the county jail, the city jail, and the Juvenile Court--have been visited 618 times in the past six months. I have also made 132 visits to various hospitals, two visits to the Joliet State Penitentiary, and three visits to the Kankakee State Hospital. We have held 132 sermons in Chicago, and 20 sermons and 16 lectures outside Chicago. This has been a difficult task for one man.</p>
   <p>"About 10,500 tracts and pamphlets, and 225 Bibles and New Testaments were distributed. I have baptized 11 (7 children and 4 adults), confirmed 2, <pb facs="5423969_5_0483.jpg" n="3"/>married 3, given communion to 314, and buried 8. I have addressed 2,300 persons in the last six months, and have written 1,475 letters and postal cards. This has been a great and seemingly impossible task.</p>
   <p>"Much of my time has been taken up with the Home Finding Society and its Children's Home. This Society has now been active for over five years. It has been three years since we bought our building. Here 68 children have been permancently housed for shorter or longer periods (some for three years), until such time as it was possible to place them in private homes.</p>
   <p>"The membership of the Town Mission is now about five hundred. In closing my report, I want again to stress the importance of appointing an assistant."</p>
   <p>E. Petersen gave the report for the Immigrant Mission as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0484.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"The total number of immigrants entering through the port of New York in 1909 was 921,094, including 11,757 Norwegians, 6,452 Danes, and 16,797 Swedes--an increase of 6,150 Scandinavians over the preceeding year.</p>
   <p>"In our Lutheran Pilgrim Home in New York, 1309 Scandinavians were cared for while waiting to leave for Chicago and the West. Last year we placed 289 immigrants in more or less permanent jobs, many of them on farms."</p>
   <p>Oliver C. Tostrud reported for the Bethania Indian Mission....</p>
   <p>T. C. Saetra reported for the Alaska Mission.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Lauritz Larsen and Mr. Thomas Nilsson gave a very interesting report on the <pb facs="5423969_5_0485.jpg" n="5"/>Zulu Mission. This branch of the Norwegian Synod has done some very outstanding work...</p>
