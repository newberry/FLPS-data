<title level="a">THE MORELAND LUTHERAN CHURCH</title></bibl>

   <p>Last Tuesday evening the congregation of the Moreland Church celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Reverend Thompson read the history of the Church from archives that the librarian of the congregation had carefully preserved. Following is the history as read:</p>
   <p>On July 25, 1886, we find a small group of Norwegian Lutherans meeting in Nils Moeller's home to discuss the possibility of organizing a Norwegian Lutheran congregation. A resolution was passed to organize such a congregation, to be known as the "Norwegian Evangelical Congregation of Moreland". [Translator's note: Moreland was a suburb of Chicago in the eighties and nineties; it later became a part of the city of Chicago.]</p>
   <p>Reverend Marcus Nielsen was the chairman of the meeting. Others present were: John Hevly, John Petersen, Andreas Iversen, Nils Andreansen, and Nils Moller. A printed copy of the constitution of another church was read. A motion to <pb facs="5423969_5_0477.jpg" n="2"/>adopt this constitution was made and carried. This constitution was later changed.</p>
   <p>The meeting reconvened on August 8 in the home of Andreas Iversen. At this meeting, John Healy, Andreas Iverson, John Petersen, and Nils Andreansen were elected deacons and trustees.</p>
   <p>The meeting also called Reverend Marcus Nielsen to serve as pastor... His first assignment was to incorporate the congregation under the laws of the state of Illinois. The incorporation took place on August 11, 1886, with Hevly, Moller, Pedersen, Andreansen, and Iversen as incorporators. On August 28, 1887, application was made for membership in the Norwegian Augustana Synod, and on December 21, 1887, the congregation officially became a member of the Synod. Reverend Nielsen served the congregation until February, 1889, when he went to Woodstock, Illinois. At this time, the congregation consisted of only seven families. The future did not look very bright, but they held on, and in later <pb facs="5423969_5_0478.jpg" n="3"/>years this unity had its reward.</p>
   <p>From the spring of 1889 to some time in the fall of 1890, several pastors served the congregation; of these we will mention only Reverend J. C. Reinertsen, who had served the churches in Aurora and Plano, Illinois. He came to Moreland at the invitation of Reverend Hatlestad, who at this time was the president of the Augustana Synod.</p>
   <p>Through the church extension fund, the congregation received some financial help. In 1891, two lots were purchased for $1,250. On January 4, 1892, it was decided to elect a financial committee to solicit funds for building a frame church..... At a meeting on February 1,1892, the congregation unanimously decided to build. Lumber costing $850 was bought on credit, and on March 3, work started on the church. It was not before February 1, 1894, that the exterior of the church was completed, and it was necessary to borrow $500 to complete the interior.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0479.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The first ladies' society was organized by the congregation on August 3, 1888, but after the fire in Moreland in 1888, most of the residences were destroyed and many of the members moved to Chicago proper. This proved a serious setback for the ladies' society, and it was not until some years later that it was reorganized.</p>
   <p>The young women's society was organized in the spring of 1894 by Reverend O. J. Nordby. On January 19, 1895, the Luther League was likewise organized by Reverend Nordby.</p>
   <p>The choir was also organized in 1895.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Youth League and an aid society were organized by Reverend Espeseth. The children's group was organized by Mrs. Espeseth.</p>
   <p>The present members of the board are: Reverend T. C. Thompson, pastor; Gustav Olese, sexton; John Olsen, secretary; Harry Christensen, superintendent of schools; <pb facs="5423969_5_0480.jpg" n="5"/>and six deacons and seven trustees.</p>
   <p>This completes the history of the Church. Only the highlights have been covered.</p>
