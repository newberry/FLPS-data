<title level="a">THE LUTHER LKAGUE CONVENTION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The second annual convention of the Luther League of America was successful beyond the most sanguine anticipations of those who had the work in hand. The attendance of delegates and others was large, and the proceedings of the convention were characterized by vigorous enthusiasm, tempered with genuine Lutheran conservatism. The closing session at the Auditorium was especially memorable. If the program fell somewhat short of expectations, the exercises were impressive and elevating. Luther's grand battle hymn was probably never rendered with greater impressiveness in this country. An audience of six thousand people rose to greet the soul-stirring hymn, which filled the immense hall like a tempest of faith arising from thousands of devout hearts. It was a truly inspiring scene.</p>
   <p>It is very evident that the new movement has acquired a strong hold upon the Lutheran youth of the land. The growth of the League during the past year has been rapid and substantial. Sixteen states were represented by delegates at the Chicago convention, and the movement is still spreading westward and southward. Originating in the East within one of the English-speaking <pb facs="5423969_5_0716.jpg" n="2"/>branches of the Lutheran Church, it has gradually drawn to itself young Lutherans of other shades of belief and speech, especially from German and Scandinavian churches. That the League has come to stay is no longer doubted. The friends of the League movement hope that eventually it will secure the friendly cooperation of all Lutheran synods and conferences in America. As yet it is regarded with some distrust by those who are slow to accept innovations. In the opinion of the leaders of the movement, the League must needs promote Lutheran unity by accontuating all vital points of belief and gradually eliminating differences of minor importance; but this high goal cannot be attained unless the movement receives the benefit of the steadying influence of the most conservative branches of the Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>The civic importance of the League movement cannot be exaggerated. Many people in this country look upon the Lutheran Church as a more or less outlandish institution, wholly un-American in character and aims. Nothing could be more erroneous. The great German reformation unshackled the conscience of man and established individualism, and hence is one of the main-springs of modern liberty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0717.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The American Declaration of Independence is rooted in the famous theses of Martin Luther. That the Lutheran Church has preserved this spirit of freedom bequeathed to it by the great reformer, the League convention just held in Chicago abundantly attests. The gathering of young Lutherans combined the sturdy and wholesome conservatism of their church with true and vigorous Americanism. People whose hearts throb to the rhythm of "A Mighty Fortress" can sing "America" with the zest and love of true good citizens.</p>
   <p>Whenever American liberty and American institutions shall be exposed to attack, the Lutheran Church and the Lutherans of the land will be found in the front ranks of their defenders.</p>
   <p>The last election furnishes conclusive proof of the high character of Lutheran citizenship. The Lutherans hold the balance of power in all doubtful states and saved the country from national disaster and the dire consequences of a crisis of untold magnitude.</p>
