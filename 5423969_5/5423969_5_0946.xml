   <p>Far out on Madison Avenue, in a row of small wooden shacks, live eighty people, people who have, in a way, become famous here in Chicago. These people have decided to spend the remaining days of their lives in the Holy Land. At sundown tonight, these shacks will be empty, and only the bare walls will be able to tell of all the prayers that have been said in these rooms the last few years.</p>
   <p>At 8 A.M. today, these people will leave, with a feeling akin to that which filled the crusaders of old, who undertook the long journey to Jerusalem and the Holy Grail. They will go via the Grand Trunk Railway to Philadelphia, where they will board the steamer "Waelslano," which is to take them to Liverpool, continuing from there to Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>The group consists mainly of Chicago people. They have felt that it is their duty to give up their homes and their businesses, and live the rest <pb facs="5423969_5_0947.jpg" n="2"/>of their days in the place where Christianity was born. This group was first organized some fifteen years ago, when Mrs. Anna Spofford, who was born in Norway, her husband, and ten other people went, for the first time, to Jerusalem. Mr. Spofford died by the walls of the Holy City, whereupon the colony returned to Chicago. Those that went to Jerusalem the first time were: Mrs. Anna Spofford, Miss Grace Spofford, Miss E. H. Spofford, Mrs. Amelia Guld, J. D. Eliahu, and three English people.</p>
   <p>But this time, quite a large group is leaving; nearly all [in the group] are Scandinavians. [A long list of the names of those comprising the group is now given; several Jewish names are to be noted.]</p>
   <p>The members of the first colony called themselves the "Americans". They lived for only one thing: to help everyone that needed help. They tried to live in accordance with the word of the Bible, helping the poor and needy, nursing the sick, and seeking to do good, in the spirit of the Ten Commandments.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0948.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Part of their belief was that good deeds should be kept a secret, and no one should seek recompense for anything one did. The first colony lived near the walls of Jericho, and the new colony will set up its tents in the same place. They sincerely believe that the resurrection of Christ will take place in Jerusalem, and they will await His return there. They will do no work in the Holy Land, but they have the firm conviction that God will care for them in every way.</p>
   <p>They look forward to the day when they will live among the olive trees and the date palms; when they will see the waters of the Jordan; when they will walk with the shepherds as did Joseph of old; when they will visit Bethlehem and Mount Sinai; and when they will listen to the prayers at sunset.</p>
   <p>Their dream will come true. They are on the way; yes, soon they will be "home".</p>
