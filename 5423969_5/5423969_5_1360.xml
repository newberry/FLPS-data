   <p>Mrs. Ragnhild Ray Olsen received many visits yesterday at her home, 651 N. Humboldt Street. The occasion was her 76th anniversary, and it was also the anniversary of the Norwegian Home Industry Society, which Mrs. Olsen founded fifteen years ago.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Olsen was born near Levanger, Norway, Sept. 26, 1831. Fifty-three years ago, she married Olai Olsen, who was editor of Dagsposten, Trondhjem. The couple came to Chicago twenty years ago, but in 1894 Mr. Olsen died. Mrs. Olsen has been able to keep going however; when one watches her, it is difficult to believe that she is 76 years old. She is healthy and lively and is still able to dance the Springdansen (a lively Norwegian dance).
   </p>
   <p>At the time of formation, only eight women joined with Mrs. Olsen in the Norwegian Home Industry Society, and had it not been for her energy and able leadership, the Society would probably have foundered on the rocks several years ago. Most certainly, without her, it would not have been
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1361.jpg" n="2"/>
  able to do as much good as it has done.</p>
   <p>Two years after the Society had been organized, it had its own exhibit at the World's Fair here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Later on, when depression came in the wake of the exposition, the Home Industry Society started soup kitchens, and hundreds of hungry and cold people received much-needed help through the activity of this Society.</p>
