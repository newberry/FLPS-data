   <p>Due to the controversy between leaders of the Norwegian Lutheran Churches in America and the fraternal order, Sons of Norway, Reverend Hauge, prominent clergyman of Norway, has been delegated by the State Church of Norway to investigate conditions in the United States. Reverend Hauge is now here and, naturally, has been in conference almost exclusively with church dignitaries, getting a decidedly one-sided view of the situation. The church accuses the Sons of Norway of working against it. Reverend Hauge writes to Norway: "They (Sons of Norway) place themselves in opposition to the Church and strive to eliminate our church organizations. Although without a creed of their own, they propose to supply the spiritual needs of our people and are gradually drawing our people away from the church." This, in short, is the consensus of the opinion of our church leaders and nothing can be farther from the truth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0425.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One can readily realize the impression created in Norway by such statements by a man of Reverend Hauge's standing. It is to be regretted that our people in Norway should be so shamelessly misinformed, as the Sons of Norway never attempted to tear down the church. The prevalent idea in Norway is that this society is trying to de-christianize our Norwegian-Americans, as the side of the society has not been heard so far.</p>
   <p>Had the esteemed Reverend taken the attitude of being fair and made inquiries, he would have learned that the Sons of Norway make neither restrictions nor suggestions as to the religious beliefs of its members. The constitution of the Order forbids any and all dictatorship in religious matters, and furthermore they have even eliminated their burial ceremony in deference to the church. Reverend Hauge would have learned that many of the pillars of our Norwegian Lutheran churches are members of the Sons of Norway, and they are conceded to be among the most faithful workers and most devout worshippers of their respective congregations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0426.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Sons of Norway have done everything in their power to create harmony and co-operation with the church, but our selfish, narrow-minded clergy refuse to accept the overtures of the Order, and there is now a condition similar to the one existing under the rule of Catholicism's blackest regime. While church leaders have effectively split the Norwegian Lutheran people in this country, the Sons of Norway are drawing them more closely together, which is of benefit to the Church rather than a drawback. However, in spite of the resentment created by arrogant leaders of the church, we find the majority of our pastors friendly to the Order and appreciative of its members whether in or outside the church.</p>
