   <p>Mr. A. Abrahansen, was married last Wednesday to Miss Minda Olsen of Madison, Wisconsin. The wedding took place very quietly at the home of the bridegroom, 1909 Milwaukee Avenue. Only a few of the relatives and closest friends were present. The Rev. Bergesen officiated.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Abrahansen is one of the best known Norwegians in Chicago. Having been the president of the National Association for nearly two terms; he has had excellent opportunities to prove himself a staunch Norwegian and in possession of a rare executive ability. He came to America about fourteen years ago and for several years was an assistant at Newberry Library until he opened a store for men at 1905 Milwaukee Avenue, which he still operates.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Abrahamsen was born at Solor, Norway and came to America while a child. She is well known in Norwegian circles in Chicago.</p>
