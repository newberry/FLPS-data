   <p>Dr. Manqus Andrew Unseth was born near Westly, Wis., Oct. 8, 1867. He entered a seven-year course at Luther College, Decorah, Iowa. He graduated in the spring of 1890 with the degree of A. B. In the fall of that year he entered upon a three-year course of study in medicine at Rush Medical College, Chicago, and graduated in 1893 with the degree of M. D. He immediately opened an office in Chicago and commenced the practice of medicine as a physician and surgeon. On Nov. 27, 1895, he was married to Clara T. Wulf of Chicago. They have two children. In 1895 Dr. Unseth was appointed medical inspector of the Department of Health in Chicago, in which position he served for two years. He was for several years a member of the staff of attending surgeons at the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital. For many years he has been an examining physician for a number of societies and during the last six years has been one of the regular examiners for the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America. In a competitive civil service examination for the position of assistant city physician of Chicago he holds the distinction of being number two on the list. He was eligible on the list as attending physician on the insane asylum, poorhouse and consumption hospital in Dunning, but declined to accept the position when offered.</p>
