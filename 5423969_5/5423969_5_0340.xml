   <p>Congregation of the Church of Christ honors Rev. J. H. Meyer.</p>
   <p>Friday evening, June 29, marked the twelfth year since the Christ congregation was organized, and on that occasion an unusually pleasant social was arranged. The basement of the church was beautifully decorated, the tables were set and the wholes audience partook of an excellent meal. Afterwards speeches were in order; Rev. Meyer was lauded for the excellent work he had done and presented with an expensive Morrischair from the congregation. The festival continued on Sunday; the story of the struggles of the congregation and its pastor from the insignificant beginnings in "Scharlaus Hall" was told in speeches and in songs. Several ministers from other congregations visited during the afternoon and evening and added their words of praise for the work that had been done, as well as cheering predictions for a bright future for the congregation.</p>
