   <p>First Church, Grand Avenue and Sangamon Street, Chicago was organized in 1868 by O. P. Petersen. The church was bought from the American Methodists in 1869. There also is a parsonage besides the church. The work in the church has been carried on during the past thirty years with wonderful success. The revival spirit has manifested itself in this church from the beginning, especially under the fervent preaching of J. H. Johnson, 1869 to 1871 when one-hundred precious souls were converted and added to the church. This was the greatest revival up to that date in Norwegian and Danish Methodism.</p>
   <p>Also during the pastorate of C. F. Eltzholtz, A. Haagensen, M. Hansen, O. A. Wierson, Fr. Ring, and J. C. Tollefsen, great gatherings have been held, and during Ring's first pastorate, the old church debt of $2,400.00 that had been carried for years, was paid in one year.</p>

   <p>From the First Church, directly or indirectly, have sprung the other seven Norwegian-Danish Methodist churches in Chicago, as well as the one in Evanston. About forty preachers have come from this church and are now or have been pastors of churches among us. Members from this church who moved to the Pacific Coast after the great Chicago fire in 1871, started Norwegian-Danish Methodism out there. In later years, however, many of the old members have died or have moved further west or northwest in the city. Italians and other nationalities have moved in and for this and other reasons, it has been deemed wise to invite the First Church and the Immanuel Church to sell the property of both these churches, and to erect a new church in a better location. The preliminaries of this work already have been completed. The pastoral appointments at the First Church have been:</p>
