   <p>Weary and homesick I was drifting along the streets of Chicago looking for a place to stay. A lady of my circle of acquaintances came along. "Why not go to the Bethany Home?" she said. "It is a home for Scandinavian women." Well, why not. All right, I go to the Home. On my arrival I was greeted by the matron, Mrs. Bruun, in a manner that made me feel at home right away, and soon I was engaged in a lively conversation with her. Of course our talk was mostly of Norway and America, and then, suddenly, my eye wandered to a picture of Bjornstjerne Bjornson. This was the first picture of the author that I had seen here in America, and....a surge of joy arose within me; my eyes even filled with tears at the awakening of the many memories from Norway called forth by this familiar and characteristic face--for no one did ever picture our country and its people so lovingly as Bjornson. Mrs. Bruun had noticed the direction of my gaze; she smiled and said, "You realize that I am patriotic."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0940.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That sort of a statement I had not heard before in America, perhaps for the reason expressed on a certain occasion by a young doctor: "Here in America, my friend, we keep our patriotism to ourselves. It is not stylish to be 'Norwegian-patriotic' in America."</p>
   <p>I turn the talk to the Bethany Home. Mrs. Bruun says: "The Home is new; it is yet in its early youth. It was organized for the purpose of providing a good Christian home so as to make it unnecessary to turn to expensive hotels or to the cheap lodging houses. There is also an employment office connected with the Home."</p>
   <p>At the moment, Mrs. Bruun added that there was no vacancy at the Home. A deep sigh escaped me. There was, then, no chance for me to stay? Mrs. Bruun relented; she would find some way to make room for me.</p>
   <p>This pleased me very much, for over the cozy rooms at the Bethany Home there <pb facs="5423969_5_0941.jpg" n="3"/>rested such a spirit of peace and homelikeness that I felt like shouting "This is a place where I would love to stay."</p>
   <p>That evening as I went to bed, I felt more at home than had been the case since I left Norway....At the Bethany Home we young Scandinavian girls are finding those elements which we need so much--love and understanding. Mrs. Bruun is rich in human understanding; she not only understands people, she loves them......</p>
   <p>The Bethany Home is yet in its infancy, and it has many difficulties to contend with; but it is a good undertaking and it is of great importance that it should succeed. There are many young girls coming to America, and once here they are greatly in need of love and sympathy. The dangers and temptations are many. The Bethany Home will try to protect the young girls; everybody knows that the influence of a good home is the very best protection against all dangers.</p>
