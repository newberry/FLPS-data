   <p>No intelligent Norwegian considers "Dr." Rasmus B. Anderson an authority on history or on anything else. His paper is the most bigoted and narrow-minded journal printed in the Norwegian language, and he is generally despised by the whole Norwegian fraternity; even leading men in the church which his paper pretends to support have been obliged to disavow him. The editor of the Review may consider him "an eminent American representative of his nation," but in the eyes of his own race he is only a misrepresentative.</p>
   <p>As to the Review's authority on general Scandinavian politics, Dr. Enander, we doubt whether he knows much more about Norwegian affairs than does the editor of the Review himself. In writing of Norwegian matters this doctor of divinity has always revealed himself as a mudslinger and a prevaricator, and in his short article in the Review he handles the truth in a manner that <pb facs="5423969_5_0784.jpg" n="2"/>is very unbecoming to a divine.</p>
   <p>But these articles in the Review are not without humor: every Scandinavian has read them and has enjoyed the sight of the portraits, side by side, of "Dr." Rasmus B. Anderson and Dr. Enander. How the two gentlemen themselves like it is another story.</p>
   <p>Dr. Anderson is advertised by the Review as an ex-United States minister to Denmark, while Dr. Enander must go without this title; and thereby hangs a tale.</p>
   <p>"Dr."Anderson was appointed [minister] by President Cleveland in 1885 as a compensation for having turned mugwump, and when President Harrison was elected in 1888, minister Anderson used all his efforts to keep his position; he renounced his mugwump ideas and offered to return to the Republican Party. Dr. Enander was appointed to succeed him. Minister Anderson then dug up <pb facs="5423969_5_0785.jpg" n="3"/>Dr. Enander's record in his native land and presented the facts to the Danish court, with the result that Minister Enander was "declined with thanks"; whereupon he pleaded illness and rejected the appointment. Since then Brother Enander loves Brother Anderson dearly and has bestowed a great deal of affection upon Norway and Brother Anderson's compatriots in general.</p>
   <p>But what irony of fate that the Review of Reviews now pictures these gentlemen side by side as "eminent representatives of their nation"!</p>
   <p>Yes, we can truly say that we have some "great" Norwegians here in Chicago.</p>
