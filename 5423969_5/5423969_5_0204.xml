   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Club gave a Christmas banquet and ball last Saturday at their club rooms, with one hundred and twenty members and friends taking part. Math Pedersen's orchestra furnished the music.</p>
   <p>As the guests marched into the banquet hall, they were struck by the novel lighting effects,-myriads of wax candles on small Christmas trees on all tables; truly, a Christmas atmosphere. At the moment the guests were seated, the entire electrical lighting equipment burst forth in a deluge of light, making the place as light as day. This was the first banquet of its kind to be held in the new club rooms, and the club is more than pleased with its success. Olaf Bernts, Norwegian Consular secretary, spoke on the significance of Christmas, and O.S. Bang proposed a toast to the ladies with a fitting poem of his own composition. Other speakers included William Gerener, president of the club; K.G. Lindwall, Swedish consular secretary; Sen. Niels Juel; J.G. Giever; T.O. Raaen; Dr. Warloe; M. Kirkeby; <pb facs="5423969_5_0205.jpg" n="2"/>T. Thorstensen, and A. Hummeland. While the hall was being cleared for dancing, coffee was served in the side rooms, after which came the grand march led by Mr. Gerner, retiring president, and Mrs. J. G. Giever, wife of the new president of Den Norske Klub (The Norwegian Club). The ball lasted till early dawn and all participants left with a feeling of well being and good fellowship.</p>
