   <p>Thousands of Norwegians met at Mount Olive, the Norwegian cemetery, to decorate the graves of their departed relatives. Mr. Paul O. Stensland, who is one of the newly elected directors of the West and North Side Traction Company, had seen to it that eighteen extra cars were put in use on Milwaukee Avenue and twelve on Irving Park Boulevard for the day. In spite of this, all the cars were crowded, as was also the extra train which left Chicago in the morning. The Winfield Scott Post No. 445, of the G. A. R., with its own band, came by train. Upon their arrival at Mount Olive Cemetery, the members of the Post marched in procession, the band at their head, to the Memorial Monument, located close by the chapel.</p>
   <p>The day's program was opened with a speech by Commander Nichols, G. A. R., who explained the significance of Decoration Day, a day dedicated to the memory of the dead, especially those who have sacrificed their lives for the <pb facs="5423969_5_0151.jpg" n="2"/>free flag of America. Afterwards, Reverend Hoyt said a prayer and the choir sang a hymn.</p>
   <p>G. A. R. Commander Thomas Barker read Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (delivered on November 19, 1863) in which Lincoln called to mind not only the many hardships endured in the Battle of Gettysburg, but also the honor won by America in that battle.</p>
   <p>After this the choir sang a hymn, and former Commander Estover read the customary rituals used by the G. A. R. and requested all the old soldiers to place wreaths on the monument, which they did while the choir sang "The Battle Hymn". Reverend Hoyt, dressed in his G. A. R. uniform, then read, feelingly, "The Sleep of the Brave," after which the commander of the day, Captain Lathum, delivered a brief speech. Mrs. Estover placed the American flag over the monument, after which the Hon. Clark Tisdell was introduced to the audience. Mr. Tisdell's father was one of the heroes who gave their lives during the Civil War, and the speaker expressed his pride at being the son of one of these <pb facs="5423969_5_0152.jpg" n="3"/>heroes. He gave a brief survey of America's history from the end of the eighteenth century, when the thirteen states, then existing, seceded from England, but he dwelt chiefly on the achievements during the Civil War. He dwelt on the spirit of liberty that prevails in the North, and on the abolition of slavery, passing on to the story of American expansion--the twenty-eight new states which joined the Union during the past century. Finally he touched on the Spanish-American War and, in connection with it spoke of Lieutenant Andrew E. Paulsen, who fell on October 30, 1898, and is buried in Mount Olive.</p>
   <p>It is doubtful whether Mount Olive ever had as many visitors as on this years' Decoration Day. All the graves and monuments were decorated with wreaths, flowers, and Norwegian and American flags. Lieutenant Paulsen's grave, in particular, was beautifully decorated, and all the visitors came over to see it.</p>
   <p>The afternoon railroad trains to the cemetery were crowded with visitors, and <pb facs="5423969_5_0153.jpg" n="4"/>and Mr. Paul O. Stensland, who was present at the cemetery during the whole day, estimated the number of visitors that came to the cemetery at about 10,000.</p>
