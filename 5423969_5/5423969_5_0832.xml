   <p>Ola A. Bottner, a newly arrived immigrant from Norway, writes to Scandia as follows:</p>
   <p>"In no other country in the world do Norwegian young people's societies flourish more abundantly. No sooner does a group of our people get together than the question of founding a society is broached, and another Norwegian association is formed. The avowed purpose of these societies is to preserve the language and the culture of our ancestors, though the methods employed are peculiarly inconsistent with this aim. The leaders of the various groups invent the most comical conceptions of what constitutes Norwegian culture, and to us who are newly arrived here their conglomeration of queer ideas is a ridiculous farce, a genuine comedy. At their meetings we hear spoken a language purporting to be Norwegian, but it is anything but that. The language, if it can be called such, is a half-and-half mixture of English words, to which a Norwegian pronunciation is given, and poorly pronounced Norwegian, making it next to impossible for a newcomer, in many instances, even to get the drift of the conversation, much less to understand it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0833.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"To organize societies for the preservation of our old language and culture is commendable if the people who conduct the meetings have a proper conception of what constitutes Norwegian culture. They should strive to perfect their command of our language, but they offer us a good slogan and put on a series of dances and coffee parties in the way of enlightenment. One would imagine that the mental development and culture of the young people here is so far advanced that instead of study and instruction for advancement they must receive a little recreation and refreshment to rest their enormous intellects.</p>
   <p>"It is not to be wondered at that young people seek greater excitement than this plan offers, thereby becoming victims of vicious habits."</p>
   <p>The foregoing rebuke is well merited by a number of our young people's organizations, and our churches, on the other hand, are also somewhat to blame for the number of immigrants who are victimized in so many ways. Neither the young people's societies, nor the churches have an adequate program to attract <pb facs="5423969_5_0834.jpg" n="3"/>and protect the stranger within our gates. The morals and the ideals of the average Norwegian immigrant are high, and sympathy and guidance through a comprehensive program would help him preserve his natural heritage and encourage his efforts to rise to unlimited heights with the opportunities which our country offers.</p>
