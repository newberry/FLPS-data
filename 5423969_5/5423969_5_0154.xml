   <p>In the Skandinaven of May 20, Mr. Olav Ray, on behalf of the Committee on Arrangements for the festival at the Auditorium, practically accuses me of having sent him by mail an anonymous letter, which he publishes. I beg to inform Mr. Ray that I am not mean, and that I did not at all write the kind of letter published by him. There is no point in attempting to create ill feeling between Mr. [Emil] Bjorn and myself. If Mr. Ray should become a member of some committee on arrangements for some future festival, I hope that he will not repeat his attempt to disturb the friendly feeling between Mr. Bjorn and myself or to try to take a hand in the question of musical competition or music unions.</p>
   <p>If the Norwegian National Association and its Committee on Arrangements considered the seventeenth of May as an exclusively Norwegian day, other <pb facs="5423969_5_0155.jpg" n="2"/>Norwegians may well do the same, as we are at liberty to celebrate the day wherever we want to and in our own manner. Finally, let me extend a piece of advice to Mr. Olav Ray: Do not try to exclude the Norwegian musicians on a day like this; do not try to make the Norwegian people travel far away to a downtown hall. Give us a chance to earn a dollar on the affairs of the day, and you will find greater co-operation.</p>
