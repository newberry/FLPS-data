   <p>Hauman G. Haugan, who is now eighty years old, has an interesting past. He has been in the United States for some sixty-two years. Mr. Haugan was born in Christiania in 1840. He came to America in 1858, not in the usual way, across the Atlantic, but across the Pacific, landing in San Francisco, and from there he travelled down the coast to Panama, across Panama on foot and by burro, then up the Atlantic coast to New York. How long this trip lasted we do not know, but all the water travel was by sailing ship. From New York he went to Canada, where he took up a homestead claim. His family arrived in 1859.</p>
   <p>After working on the farm for some time, he went to Quebec, where he worked in a brewery for five dollars a week. Here his brother Helge Haugan, who later became a well-known Chicago banker, worked for one dollar a week. Hauman Haugan came to Chicago in 1868. A short while later he went to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where his family had lived during his wanderings, and <pb facs="5423969_5_1229.jpg" n="2"/>became the cashier of the Batavian Bank there. In 1870 he began to work for the Southern Minnesota Railway Company as postmaster. After some time he was promoted to be treasurer of the road. In 1880 he became general secretary to W. C. Van Horne, superintendent of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway in Chicago. In 1883 he was appointed land commissioner of the railway, remaining in Chicago, and in 1901 he was made comptroller. He resigned from his railroad career in 1910 after forty years of service.</p>
   <p>In 1884, he had become a partner in the Haugan and Lindgren Bank, which his brother Helge and John A. Lindgren had opened here, in Chicago in 1879. In 1890 this bank was considered Chicago's largest [private] bank. In 1891 the bank was chartered as a State bank, and it was known thereafter as the State Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Among the many things worthy of mention which Haugan has accomplished is the organization of America's oldest Norwegian singing society, Normanna, at La Crosse, Wisconsin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1230.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We believe that Haugan's history is one of the most interesting in the annals of Norwegians in America.</p>
