   <p>It seems unbelievable that Dr. Anders Doe, who looks twenty years younger, is spry and wide-awake, bubbling over with humor and friendliness, and vigorous as when he first came to Chicago thirty-three years ago.</p>
   <p>Idealists never grow old and, in spite of criticism aimed at him, he is and always will be a full-fledged idealist.</p>
   <p>Dr. Doe's faith in the ability of the Norwegian people, especially in America, to develop and advance to the greatest heights has, at times, been sorely tried; but an untiring optimism and an unconquerable faith in his people brings him onward and upward with new ideas and renewed courage to enlighten and lead. What a fiery leader he has always been!</p>
   <p>Throughout our Norwegian colony, the energy and broad-mindedness of Dr. Doe has always been in evidence. When he first came to Chicago, our colony was scattered, and collective action was practically unknown. The personality <pb facs="5423969_5_1267.jpg" n="2"/>of Dr. Doe attracted his fellow men, and soon he was the central figure among leaders of various groups. His idealism and ability to organize afforded the necessary impetus and direction to what had been a number of half-hearted and confused attempts to bring our colony together. Many of today's strongest Norwegian lodges, clubs, singing societies, and benevolent groups thank Dr. Doe for their very existence.</p>
   <p>Among the groups in whose activities Dr. Doe took a leading part are the Norwegian Old People's Home Society, the Norwegian Club, singing societies, Sons of Norway, Knights of the White Cross, Dovre Klub, The Children's Home, Deaconess Hospital, and many others.</p>
   <p>Dr. Doe's medical practice is very extensive, and we have not yet heard of one of his patients who has complained either of poor treatment or of exorbitant fees. Every patient whom he has had is a friend. Dr. Doe has been a builder of bridges, spanning social chasms that others considered impossible. Truly he is a born leader.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1268.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Scandia wishes to congratulate him on his having reached his sixtieth milestone without having lost his youthful vigor and sense of humor, and his wonderful power to make and keep friends; we also wish to congratulate him upon his success as a physician. We tender him our heartfelt gratitude for his many contributions to this paper and trust that they may continue to come in for many years.</p>
