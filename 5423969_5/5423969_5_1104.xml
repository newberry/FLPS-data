   <p>The following editorial is to be found in the Decorah-Posten for January 29:</p>
   <p>"The correspondence to the Skandinaven concerning the memorial gift to Norway has turned into a complete mix-up. Every conceivable plan and project is being presented for consideration so that one knows not where to turn. If the discussion for which the paper has opened its columns is to serve as guidance in the matter as to what form the gift is to take, then it is quite certain that a memorial gift will not be sent to Norway in 1914. We suppose that this is what the Skandinaven would prefer, and if so, all this writing will have served its purpose; for the opposition will hurt the cause and delay the work of collecting the money as far as the circle of readers of the Skandinaven is concerned.</p>
   <p>"We are inclined to believe, however, that when Skandinaven thinks itself <pb facs="5423969_5_1105.jpg" n="2"/>powerful enough to prevent the carrying out of the proposal once adopted--now, after the work of collection has been started--the paper has mistaken the situation."</p>
   <p>This, then, is what one of our most widely read newspapers has to say about the discussion in the Skandinaven concerning the memorial gift. In spite of this, Skandinaven is still of the opinion that general discussion is the only way in which the matter can be carried to a successful completion. The people are supposed to provide the money; the people have a right to be heard. There is plenty of time, and we believe that our people will come to an agreement concerning the form that the memorial gift is to take so as to satisfy our entire national group. The fact that there is general participation in the discussion is evidence enough of this.</p>
   <p>Everybody, including the committee, the Decorah Posten, and all the others are doing their best to think straight in this matter. Skandinaven alone, according <pb facs="5423969_5_1106.jpg" n="3"/>to the Decorah Posten, forms an exception to the general rule, since the purpose of the Skandinaven is to prevent the execution of the work that has been started.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven will merely say in regard to this that if the committee considers the type of "help" which has thus been rendered by the Decorah Posten as being helpful, then it ought to provide as much help as possible of the same kind.</p>
   <p>As to the concern shown by the Decorah Posten for the readers of Skandinaven, we believe it is enough to say that on occasions in the past the readers have been given space in the paper for their opinions, and as in the past Skandinaven is not going to fail its readers this time.</p>
