   <p>Carl William Birch Nord, civil engineer with the American Bridge Company, Monadnock Block, Chicago, was born in Christiania, October 7, 1880. After completing his high school and technical education with practical training in machine shops in Christiania he went to Germany in 1901, where he extended his studies in electrical engineering at the Institute of Technology at Binger au Rhein. He was later employed as superintendent of electrical installations at Boras, Sweden. He arrived in Chicago in July 1902, where, after having held various positions with the Western Electric Company, Burnham Company and others, he secured a place as draftsman with the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad Company. He found it difficult at first to get a position as civil engineer. He remained with the Metropolitan until 1903, when he accepted the position of first assistant engineer in the estimating department of the American Bridge Company, Chicago office. Here he had charge of the designing of several of the largest car foundry and machine shops in the country. He is a member of the Western Society of Civil Engineers.</p>
