   <p>p.4.... The young Norwegian Architect, Christian N. Bagge, has again been honored by the Architects Club. The club has just concluded its annual competition for young architects and Mr. Bagge was awarded second prize;a large gold medal. During the short time he has been a member of the club he has won no less than eight prizes in various competitions. He came to Chicago from Christiania, Norway, in 1903 being first connected with Carbys, Zimmerman, Frost, Granger and Co. and since 1908 with D.H.Burnham and Co.</p>
   <p>His entry into the latter firm opened the door to his golden opportunity. "The Commercial Club of Chicago" had just launched its campaign for a "Chicago Beautiful" and the architectural planning had been placed in the hands of Burnham &amp; Co. Mr. Bagge was immediately put to work on the prospective drawings. His artistic genius was given full freedom and his excellent workmanship and ability to solve the most knotty problems won him recognition and promotion with his firm. Mr. Bagge is also a very popular member of "DEN NORSKI KLUB."</p>
