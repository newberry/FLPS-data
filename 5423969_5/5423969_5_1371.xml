   <p>Axel Pedersen, one of the oldest active members of the Norwegian Singing Society celebrated the anniversary of his birth and also of his wedding last Monday. This double anniversary caused his friends to call. The Norwegian Singing Society gave a serenade at his home, the corner of Drake and Dunham Streets, Logan Square, and many gifts were bestowed upon both Pedersen and his wife.</p>
   <p>The president of the Singing Society, M. Clausen, decorated Mr. Pedersen as honorary member of the society by affixing the emblem, a harp in gold, to the lapel of his coat. Many short speeches were made both for the fifty-year-old jubilee and for the bridal couple, and all those present enjoyed a pleasant evening in the hospitable home.</p>
