   <p>The festival in honor of the returning soldiers was well attended. The guest of honor was General Leonard Wood. The toastmaster was Attorney [Andrew] Hummeland who also gave the address of welcome. This was followed by a roll call of those members who had served with the colors.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was John J. Sonsteby who spoke for the guests of honor. He stressed that the Norwegian Club, with only two hundred members, had as many as forty with the colors. The next speaker was Harry Olson who referred to the representative members of the Norwegian colony by name and elaborated somewhat on each individual's background. The toastmaster then introduced General Wood who told about the role the Norsemen had played in the war. Olaf Bernts spoke for those who had stayed at home, stating that mothers, sisters, and wives had suffered greatly, not knowing if or when their loved ones would return.</p>
   <p>Charles L. Pedersen said a few words concerning all the Scandinavian boys with <pb facs="5423969_5_0732.jpg" n="2"/>the colors. The last speaker was Lieutenant Colonel T. A. Sequeland. He thanked those who had stayed at home for helping to keep up his spirits which at times were very low.</p>
