   <p>There appears in the July 2 issue of Skandinaven, an article from the pen of Mr. H. S. which for its sarcastic denunciation of the progressive movement of the Hauge Synod in the use of English in its congregations, deserves the severest condemnation of all progressive-minded Scandinavian-Americans everywhere regardless of creed or belief.</p>
   <p>Of course, it is evident from the spirit of the article that Mr. H. S. either does not know what the motives are underlying the movement, or else is so thoroughly prejudiced against the movement that he is unable to see any good in it. If he does not know of the motives underlying the movement I would, in the most brotherly manner, urge him at once to acquaint himself with the facts in the case. If he is prejudiced against the movement, let him by all means resort to reason and common sense. If he does he will praise the movement instead of cursing it.</p>
   <p>Personally I like to believe that the motives underlying the movement are noble <pb facs="5423969_5_0647.jpg" n="2"/>and praiseworthy. I like to believe, too, that the supporters of the movement see the imperative need of the use of English in the congregations; and that they have set about to meet that need. I do not want to believe that they desire the extermination of the Norwegian language in America. Neither Mr. H. S. nor I can judge them guilty of such action.</p>
   <p>The supporters of the movement see that the young people are leaving the church in alarmingly large numbers; that these young people either associate themselves with other denominations or they wander about without any church connections; and that one of the causes for this falling away of the young people from the mother church is the failure of the church to provide services in the language which to them is the most popular.</p>
   <p>Nay, these men see more. They see that the future welfare of the Lutheran Church in America demands that the young people be rescued and that they be taught the principles as well as the proper management of the church. It is the young people who are to be the pillars of the church of tomorrow. Hence we must adopt a plan whereby the young people can be rescued and whereby they shall be induced to join <pb facs="5423969_5_0648.jpg" n="3"/>with the church--not a means whereby they shall be given an excuse for leaving it.</p>
   <p>Let Mr. H. S. and those like-minded with him who look upon matters pertaining to the welfare of the church, do in a manner more befitting sane-minded men. Let Mr. H. S. and those with opinions similar to his learn to praise instead of to curse men who are broad-minded enough to see what is to be done, and who are men enough to do it.</p>
