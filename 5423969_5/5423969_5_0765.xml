   <p>The Norwegian National Committee held a grand party in honor of Nicolay A. Grevstad last evening. Every representative Norwegian of Chicago was present. Mr. Carl A. Backer president of the National Committee, presided. Speeches were many and long. Dr. Anders Doe spoke at length about Grevstad's childhood. A poem entitled "To Nicolay Grevstad," written by Professor Wilhelm Petersen, was read. The Norwegian Singing Society then sang a few of Grevstad's favorite songs. Among the several speakers were: Birger Osland, J. B. Nordhem, State Senator Johan Waage, L. B. Bergesen, Reverend Molstad, H. Sundby Hansen, Reverend Frederick Ring, Olaf Ray, and, last but not least, Dr. N. T. Quales, who made the following speech:</p>
   <p>"We are met here this evening to do homage to our distinguished countryman, United States Minister Nicolay A. Grevstad. Our guest of honor is no stranger among us. For nearly a score of years he has been editor in chief of Skandinaven,....a position he has recently given up in order to enter the diplomatic service of the United States Government.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0766.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Minister Grevstad's excellent work as an editor is familiar to us all. However, I shall mention one matter that it seems is not as well understood and appreciated as it deserves to be. I allude to his great and successful effort to enlighten and inform the people of Norway about the Norwegians in America, and vice versa. He was capable of the task because of his familiarity with economic, religious, social, and political conditions both in Norway and here.</p>
   <p>"As an editor, Minister Grevstad has attained a high rank, possessing in an eminent degree qualifications that go to make up a first-class journalist. Besides great natural ability, he has a liberal education, years of training, untiring energy, a broad and comprehending mind, good judgment, delicate tact, and keen foresight. These qualifications enabled him to build up in a comparatively short time the greatest and the best, the most popular and the most influential newspaper in the Norwegian language today.</p>
   <p>"Your appointment, Minister Grevstad, by the President of the United States to this important and responsible position is very gratifying indeed to your many <pb facs="5423969_5_0767.jpg" n="3"/>friends, who view it as a well-deserved recognition of your ability and of your long and meritorious service as a journalist. They are all the more pleased because they know you will fill the position to the entire satisfaction of our Government, and with honor to yourself and to your countrymen.</p>
   <p>"My more intimate relations with Minister Grevstad have been on matters relating to benevolent work--our charitable institutions in the city--and I can cheerfully affirm that I always found Mr. Grevstad in full sympathy with our endeavors. He not only gave us all the space in his paper that we asked for, but time and time again he pleaded our cause editorially, pleaded it with his well-known force and eloquence. In considering what we have accomplished in this line of work, I am fully convinced that we owe our success in no small measure to the valuable aid and assistance rendered by the Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>"As your appointment to such an important position necessarily takes you from our midst, those of us whom you have so kindly aided in our efforts to ameliorate the sufferings and the needs of our fellow men desire to avail ourselves of this opportunity to express our appreciation of what you have done, and to thank you.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0768.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the same time we offer our hearty congratulations upon your appointment to this high and important position, and wish you all possible success.</p>
   <p>"As for myself, I regard your leaving as a great personal loss. During these many years you have shown me so much kindness and granted me so many favors. But as part we must, so also we must submit. I can only thank you, Minister Grevstad, and wish you much success in your new sphere of activity."</p>
   <p>Of the many resolutions received, we quote the following:</p>
   <p>"To the Honorable Nicolay A. Grevstad,</p>
   <p>"United States Minister to Uruguay and Paraguay:</p>
   <p>"In view of the fact that you have accepted the office of United States Minister to Uruguay and Paraguay, and thus have closed a long and useful period of years spent in the service of the Norwegian-Americans of this city and country as editor of Skandinaven, we, the Chicago pastors of the Synod for the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, take great pleasure in congratulating you upon this <pb facs="5423969_5_0769.jpg" n="5"/>appointment to an office of trust and honor in the service of our country, and also in expressing our high appreciation of your excellent work as editor in chief of Skandinaven, which, we are proud to say, has risen under your supervision to be the best edited daily and weekly newspaper in Chicago, not even excepting the English press.</p>
   <p>"We have been aware of your sincere attempt to be fair to the several church bodies active here, and we are glad to express our sincere appreciation of your attitude. We wish you success, happiness, and God's blessings in your new field of endeavor, and we will be glad to welcome you when you return to Chicago.</p>
   <p>"On behalf of the Chicago pastors of the Norwegian Synod,</p>
   <p>"John A. Moldstad, President</p>
   <p>"Lewis Moe, Secretary."</p>
   <p>A resolution was also received from the Pastors Conference of the United Lutheran Church.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0770.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Mr. Grevstad leaves Friday for Washington, D. C. He will then go to New York, and will proceed by steamer to Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>
