   <p>Chicago was visited recently by a man who is very prominent in business and governmental circles in Norway, Mr. Oppegaard, who is a delegate to the Commercial Convention which convenes in Boston, Mass., on Monday. Mr. Oppegaard is one of Norway's most progressive business men, and as such took the westward trip to inspect various institutions in Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>We of the Chicago Norwegian Colony regret that we were not advised of his coming, so we could have arranged for his entertainment in a true Chicago manner, thus bringing him in contact with those he most desired to meet. Mr. Oppegaard, being a member of the management committee for the great 1914 festivities, feels that the Norwegians of the United States more than any other group have co-operated with Norway in every way and should be adequately represented and acclaimed at the coming festivities. Among <pb facs="5423969_5_0997.jpg" n="2"/>other items of interest, Mr. Oppegaard visited various places of amusement and was especially pleased with the rides on midget trains running in some of these places. The trains, he was sure, would prove of great interest and entertainment in Norway. In his opinion Chicago and the surrounding territory have more to offer in every way than any other place in the world, and he said: "I have visited the worlds greatest cities." Mr. Oppegaard desires, through Scandia, to thank our people for the courtesies shown him, and advisees that he would like to hear personally from our singing societies that intend to go to Norway in 1914. Norwegian-Americans are so well represented, he said, that a special July 4th program is to be arranged, and although no request has been made for it, the auditorium, seating 3,000 has been set aside exclusively for the Norwegian-American Singers for July 4th.</p>
