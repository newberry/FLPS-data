   <p>p.3. Hauman G. Haugan, Chicago banker, returned on Tuesday from an extensive trip through Norway and Sweden. This, stated Mr. Haugan was one of the most wonderful and pleasant trips he had ever taken; he was especially pleased with the hotel service and food. He spoke very enthusiastically of Norway's transportation and communication systems. The railroads, all government owned, offer unexcelled service in every branch; dining and sleeping cars are spotlessly clean, roomy and supremely confortable; food served in the diners is wonderful and prices very reasonable. Norway is ahead of the United States in these respects and the extreme courtesy shown all travelers at all times is a revelation to an American tourist. Nowhere in the world can be found people who in all walks of life are more considerate for the welfare of the visitors than in Norway. Norwegian hospitality is whole-hearted and genuine and wins even the most ill-natured traveler.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1022.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The crops, Mr. Haugan reports, will fall short of normal this year due to the unusual drought; the potato crop hardest hit of all will be almost a total failure, which will necessitate importation of this item till next years crop can be harvested.</p>
   <p>While in Christiania Mr. Haugan was a guest at the reception, given by the United States Minister, Mr. Swenson, on the occasion of the centennial jubilee of the University of Norway.</p>
   <p>The new Norwegian-American Line, the boats of which will soon plow the waves between Norway and the United States America, is making rapid headway in the sale of stock as the idea of such a direct home-owned, line is becoming more and more an object of national pride.</p>
   <p>Mr. Haugan suggests the organization of a comprehensive Norwegian-American group to promote commerce and travel between the two countries for mutual benefit.</p>
