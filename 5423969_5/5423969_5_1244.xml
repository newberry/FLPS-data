  <body>
   <p>Bank director, Oscar H. Haugan has recently been appointed captain of the American Army. Captain Haugan was born in Chicago and gained his education through the public schools, Northwestern University and Northwestern Military Academy. Later on he added to his education through travels in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and England.</p>
   <p>In 1892 he was employed by the State Bank of Chicago where his father was an owner, and he has remained with the bank for the twenty-five years that have followed. He celebrated his twenty-five years jubilee in the bank on the day when he was appointed captain. On the occasion of the jubilee, the personnel of the bank presented him, at the hard of President Goddard of the bank, with a beautiful gold watch, suitably inscribed.</p>
   <p>In 1910, Mr. Haugan was appointed Norwegian Consul to Chicago, to succeed Consul F. Herman Gade. He executed the work brilliantly until 1916, when Consul Gade once <pb facs="5423969_5_1245.jpg" n="2"/>more took over the consulate, under the new Norwegian law on consuls. The same year Mr. Haugan was appointed, by the King of Norway, Knight of the Order of Saint Olaf.</p>
   <p>During September - October 1915, Mr. Haugan was a member of the first military training camp at Fort Sheridan. After the training was over he was elected treasurer of Fort Sheridan Military Training Camp Association and, later on, for the National Association for Military Training.</p>
   <p>In 1900, Mr. Haugan was married to Miss Clara Jevne. The couple have three children. The family home is in Evanston.</p>
   <p>In June this year Mr. Haugan was elected one of the American representatives in the directory of the Norwegian America Line. He is director of the State Bank of Evansto president of the Norwegian Old Age Association, and has contributed much to the advancement of this important cause. He is member of Chicago Norwegian Club and of West Moreland Golf Club.</p>
