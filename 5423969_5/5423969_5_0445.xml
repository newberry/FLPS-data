   <p>We are pleased to note that our friend The Social Demokraten (The Social Democrat), Norwegian Socialist daily of Chicago, agrees with Scandia in our denunciation of the Lutheran Almanac for 1912 and the narrow-mindedness of present day Norwegian pastors.</p>
   <p>Our friend Social Demokraten is laboring under a wrong impression in claiming that it and it alone stands ready to defend our people and fight the domination and egotism of our Norwegian church leaders. "Comparisons are odious," said a well known American commentator, but under the circumstances we fell impelled to copare the attitude of the Social Democrat with that of the "Hon. Did-More Hearst."</p>
   <p>Not one reform movement has been started that Mr. Hearst has not claimed all credit for, and nothing has been done for the welfare of the people in which Mr. Hearst through his publications, has not done all, or at least the lion's share, of the work.</p>

   <pb facs="5423969_5_0446.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are wondering if the Social Democrat is assuming a Hearst-like role, expecting to out-Hearst Mr. Hearst. Scandia has been and will continue to be the people's friend in their battle with oppression, exploitation, and egotism.</p>
