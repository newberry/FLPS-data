   <p>On Monday evening, August 19th, about fifty guests partook of the banquet given in honor of Rev. and Mrs. Kildahl at the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital, where Rev. Kildahl served so many years as rector. In the gathering were thirty doctors, deaconesses, student nurses, and special church dignitaries. Dr. Holmboe was the evening's master of ceremonies,and among the speakers were Dr. N.T. Quales, chief of the medical staff; Rev. A. Ofstedahl, from Northfield, Minnesota, rector to succeed Dr. Kildahl; Dr. Svenning Dahl, Dr. Hendersen, Sister Ingeborg, head deaconess, Dr. Fischkin, and others.</p>
   <p>Rev. Kildahl expressed his own gratitude and that of his good wife for the courtesy and cooperation given them during the years by all in any way connected with the hospital, and urged the organization to refrain from enlarging the hospital for the present at least, pointing out that the original idea of the church was to establish a hospital for the care of such of our people who <pb facs="5423969_5_1272.jpg" n="2"/>could not afford hospital care and to train a number of our Norwegian women for hospital and welfare work as it trains its men to preach the gospel. Rev. Kildahl especially lauded the work of Sister Ingeborg, superior deaconess, and her self-denial and sacrifice at all times.</p>
   <p>Professor Kildahl, president of St. Olaf College at Northfield,Minnesota, a brother of the retiring rector, stopped on his way back to Northfield from Elliot, Ill., where he went to officiate at the dedication of a church, and was an honored guest at the banquet. "Times and conditions change," said the professor. "When the rector first came to Chicago he was 'Professor Kildahl's brother,' now it is the reverse, I am 'Rector Kildahl's brother.' So again it is, 'Honor to whom honor is due."</p>
   <p>At the close of the banquet Dr. Thornton, on behalf of all the guests, presented Mrs. Kildahl and Sister Ingeborg each with an enormous bouquet of American Beauty roses.</p>
