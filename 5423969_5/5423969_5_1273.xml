   <p>The board of directors of the Norwegian-American Line has made a wise selection in appointing Herman F. Gade, Norwegian consul in Chicago, as passenger agent for the United States. Mr. Gade deserves this appointment because he has been the finest worker that the Line has had in this country. The fact that over five and one-half million dollars worth of stock has been subscribed for in this country, is in great measure due to the untiring effort and personal popularity of Mr. Gade, and the confidence he enjoys all over [the country]. Mr. Gade is very busy establishing subagencies from coast to coast, and he has placed Birger Olsland in charge of the Chicago district. When the Line's first two boats sail, early next spring, there will certainly be a pilgrimage of those who will want to be on the Norwegian-American Line's maiden voyage. We predict success for this, "Our Own Line," both in the passenger and freight departments.</p>
