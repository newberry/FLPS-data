   <p>p.4............Nels Arneson president of the Central Mfg. Co., and vice-president of the Union Bank of Chicago, passed away on August 20. Rev. Anda, pastor of the Wicker Park English Lutheran Church, officiated at the funeral and Miss Tallakson sang. The G.A.R. Post served as a guard of honor while prominent Norwegian-American professional and business men acted as pallbearers. Mr. Armeson was born near Drammen, Norway in 1840 and came to American in the spring of 1861. In the fall of the same year he enlisted in the famous Norwegian regiment, the 15th Wisconsin, organized and commanded by Col. Hegg, serving three years and two months, though he did not return to Chicago till 1865.</p>
   <p>In 1908 his veteran companions honored him by presenting him, on his birthday, with a beautiful American flag. This flag covered his casket as it was lowered into the grave.</p>
   <p>Mr. Arneson entered the furniture business on Canal Street soon after his return to Chicago in 1865, continuing until wiped out by the Chicago fire in 1871. He later became affiliated with Johnson, Thorson and Tallakson in the manufacturer of furniture. These men eventually sold out to Mr. Arneson who at the time of his <pb facs="5423969_5_1295.jpg" n="2"/>death was the sole owner of the "office desk factory" known far and wide as The Central Mfg. Co., on Armour Avenue and Grand.</p>
   <p>Four months ago Mr. Arneson, accompanied by Mrs. Arneson went to Norway to visit the home of his boyhood days, returning to Chicago three weeks ago a very sick man; he came home to die.</p>
   <p>Mr. Arneson was well and favorably known as a man of business acumen, honest in all his dealings and a kind friend to employees and associates. He was one who will be mourned by all who knew him.</p>
