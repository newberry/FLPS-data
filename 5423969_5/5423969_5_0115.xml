   <p>Churches and temperance societies will join hands this year in celebrating the Norwegian independence day. For several years minor socials in commemoration of the Norwegian constitution day have been held in Logan Square district by various churches and societies. This year all the Seventeenth of May interests will be co-ordinated about one place.</p>
   <p>To start with, three churches have decided not to hold individual Seventeenth of May socials this year, but to join with other organizations for a worthy celebration of Norway's great day. The idea has won warm acclaim from temperance associations, business people, and other men in leading positions, as well as from the public in general...</p>
   <p>Callahan's large baseball park has been secured for the occasion..... This park is well kept; it will be well illuminated for the occasion, and it has a seating <pb facs="5423969_5_0116.jpg" n="2"/>capacity of more than three thousand. A large roofed-over stage is being built to give space for speakers and for a chorus of more than one hundred singers. Some of the most prominent leaders in the city and in our country will take part in the festivities here. It is hoped that all church people and others who might wish a celebration of the type indicated will participate. The celebration will not bear the seal of any individual religious group, and will in no way try to cast shadows on any other worthy celebration of the day.</p>
