   <p>The local chapter of the American-Scandinavian-Foundation held its annual meeting Friday, February 29, in the quarters of the Swedish Club. The President, Mr. Chas. S. Peterson read the report covering the activities during the past year.</p>
   <p>Several social gatherings had been held at which many prominent visiting Scandinavian were guests.</p>
   <p>The rather small attendance at the meeting he ascribed to the fact that only one-third of the "Foundation's" members in Chicago, are members of the local chapter.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the cause for this might be found in the somewhat"reserved position" the chapter has assumed with respect to the great public. Most of the above mentioned social gatherings have been held without giving the Skandinaven Press an opportunity <pb facs="5423969_5_1142.jpg" n="2"/>to either announce or report on them. On certain occasions it seems that the Swedish and Norwegian Press have been invited while the Dansk Tidende was overlooked.</p>
   <p>Mr. James Creese, Secretary of the American-Scandinavian-Foundation was present and spoke on various subjects. He mentioned the Fund for Study-Stipends which have been extended to more than three-hundred students.</p>
   <p>The new board of officers will consist of the following: Dr. Harry Pratt Judson, former president of Chicago University, Charles S. Peterson, Carl Antonsen, T. A. Siqueland, Birger Osland and P. B. Nelson.</p>
