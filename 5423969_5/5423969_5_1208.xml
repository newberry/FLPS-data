   <p>The Norwegian Morgenblad's correspondent in Chicago never seems to tire of speaking ill about this country, which he by his own free will has adopted as his own. This country received him with open arms and gave him the same privileges as any native has. It is rather hard for us Norwegians to see how a wonderful country has been feeding a snake. America does not need to be praised; we are satisfied to let facts speak for themselves, but to speak a lot of lies is a shameful act for any American citizen to do. What motive can this man have for spreading such lies about the U.S.A. to the Norwegian people at home. Someone must have paid him for scattering all this dirt and for painting America and its way of doing things in a laughable manner. Could any man, coming to this country to take advantage of all the benefits that it offers be so small as to lie, even if he suffers misfortune in his political career?</p>

   <p>We refuse to have our mother Country believe such trash as this correspondent is trying to give them. He attacks our state governments, our school, and politics in general. We feel cheap, especially when we think how enthusiastically Saren Jaabok, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, and Bergen Pasten speak about the U.S.A. For the sake of truth and for the sake of the U.S.A. we write these few lines to Norway and we stamp the correspondent a liar.</p>
