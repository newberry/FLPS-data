   <p>Long and faithful service is appreciated by all Norsemen. Again a Chicago Norwegian group meets to honor a willing worker. On April 1st, Mr. A. Nokleby, known throughout Chicago as "the eternally young Nokleby," was honored by members of Nordmendenes (Norsemen's Male Chorus) on the occasion of his 79th birthday. Mr. Nokleby is the only living charter member of Normendenes. When the chorus "tuned up" to sing for him, Nokleby stepped into his old place in the first bass section, singing with the enthusiasm and accuracy of his younger days, with a voice that-despite his advanced years-still has a volume and resonance that is the envy of many a younger singer. Mr. Nokleby is fully entitled to the name given him years ago as "eternally young," for the is the youngest "oldster" in Chicago's Norwegian colony and where younger men's hearts fail them, he is ready to step in and do what they have given up.</p>
