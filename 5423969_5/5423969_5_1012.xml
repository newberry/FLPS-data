  <body>
   <p>Professor Gessen of the Technical School at Trondhjem, Norway, recently visited Chicago. The professor was granted a scholarship in the amount of 3000 crowns, to finance his trip of inspection and research. The great manufacturing plants, their machinery and methods are being thoroughly studied by Professor Gessen, and the results of his trip will undoubtedly be in evidence in future industries throughout Norway.</p>
   <p>During his stay in Chicago, our Norwegian-American engineers, Holmboe and Neuman, arranged a trip through the Illinois Steel Works in South Chicago. The vastness of this enterprise stunned the professor, and although he had read of this plant, its magnitude was so far beyond his mental picture of it that he was left speechless. "Fact," he said, "truly is stranger than fiction, and reality-in this case-far greater than the idea or dream."</p>
