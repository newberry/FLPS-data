   <p>A well-known Chicagoan has departed. Harry Hansen, who has been living in Chicago for fifty-four years,passed away on Nov. 13 after a few days' illness. It was pneumonia that downed him.</p>
   <p>Hansen was born in Norway, near Flekkefjord, and started as a sailor while a mere lad. 1863 he came to Chicago where for many years he was working with the McCormick Company. During the late years he worked as a painter, and as such,he was mostly known by the younger generation.</p>
   <p>But it was in his church work that he set the deep marks. He had been deeply interested when Elling Ellingsen held religious meetings down at the Chicago river before the West Side had come to amount to anything much. At the meetings the accommodations were not much to speak of; people were sitting on boxes, and trunks, and pieces of planks, but the preaching and the singing and the testimonies took hold, and the crowd came in spite of the primitiveness of it all.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1242.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was buried from the Young Peoples' Christian Association on Kedzie Ave., and is buried at Mount Olive Cemetery. He was an interesting and vital part of a Chicago which is disappearing.</p>
