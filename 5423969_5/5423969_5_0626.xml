   <p>Rev. A. Haagensen was born Oct. 30, 1835, near Sarpsberg, Norway. In 1857 he was engaged in mission work. In the fall of 1857 he migrated to America, having been recommended by the superintendent of the Methodist Church. After taking the examination he entered the Wisconsin Conference, in 1857, the Norwegian Methodists had no church and no organization. There are now in Chicago eight Norwegian-Danish Methodist Episcopal Churches belonging to the Norwegian-Danish Conference in which he is still in active service as a minister. He was associated editor of several church papers. He was appointed president elder of the Chicago synod in 1887, which position he held for six years. In his pastorate he has served some of the most prominent churches.</p>
