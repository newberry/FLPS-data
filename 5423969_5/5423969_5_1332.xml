   <p>Dr. Niles T. Quales was born in Hardanger, Norway on January 17, 1831 and arrived in Chicago in 1859. He graduated from Rush Medical College in 1866 and has followed his profession in Chicago since that time. Dr. Quales has served on the medical staff of several hospitals and as City Physician. The Tabitha Hospital owes much to Dr. Quales both for professional services and for his wonderful work as a member of its Building Committee. In recognition of his conscientious service to various benevolent institutions he was, in April 1910, decorated as a Knight of the Order of St. Olaf.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales is not loved as a physician alone; he is loved first and foremost because of his kind-heartedness. His solicitude for the poor and the suffering have endeared him to thousands; this lovable old man is like a kind father to all with whom he comes in contact. In spite of his advanced age this friend of humanity is as active and mentally awake as a man half his age. Of this man we will, at his passing away be able to say "He has not lived in vain." Dr. Quales' entire life has been dedicated to the spreading sunshine and bringing happiness into the dreary lives of his fellowmen.</p>

   <p>Scandia, through this article, wishes to pay a special compliment to this grand old gentleman. When, eventually a history is to be written whose object will be to characterize outstanding men of Chicago's Norwegian Colony, who have contributed to the individual and collective betterment of our people, the unselfish, unobtrusive service of Dr. N.T. Quales will place him at the top of the list in our love and esteem.</p>
