   <p>It looks as if those going back to the old homeland this year are taking more money with them than was the case during the past two years. The travelers to Norway this year are drawing more money on leaving than they did last year, on the average.</p>
   <p>A reporter for Skandinaven visited the steamship agency, Hansen and Arnesen, corner of Harrison Street and Fifth Avenue, and there he found a large number of passengers waiting to be cleared for Norway and Denmark in connection with the Thursday excursion of the firm.</p>
   <p>Well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, with exteriors testifying to their prosperity, made the reporter, longing to go across, quite wistful as he saw these passengers, smiling and satisfied, attended by Mr. Arnesen, step on board the reclining chair cars at the railroad station.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The main Christmas excursion will, however, not take place until the second half of November and the first part of December," said Mr. J. Arnesen, "and there is quite a mass of correspondence which will surely lead to business as soon as Mr. McKinley is re-elected. Very satisfactory registration is taking place day by day; yet a number of passengers have conditioned their voyage on the re-election of the Republicans to the helm at Washington."</p>
   <p>Hansen and Arnesen have of late carried on an extensive correspondence relative to excursions to Cuba in December and January, and since the firm also has areas of fruit lands for sale in the southern part of Cuba at very favorable prices and conditions, it seems there is every reason to expect a large number of participants in the excursions, both of people interested in the lands and those traveling for their health or for the sake of pleasure....</p>
