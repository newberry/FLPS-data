   <p>Chicago's Norwegian colony, and Scandinavians in general, mourn the less of an outstanding Norseman, Martin Pjeld, who passed away at his home, 3405 Le Moyne Street, on January 8. Mr. Fjeld was born in Christiania, Norway. He graduated from the Central School of that city at the time the wave of radicalism was sweeping all Europe; it is said that here he learned "more than his A P C's". His was a wide-awake nature that absorbed everything new that came along.</p>
   <p>His liberal views created quite an opposition in some circles, though liberalism (ingrained) was a characteristic of Martin Fjeld throughout his life. He also possessed considerable talent for writing, and for some years was a correspondent for Verdens Gang (The World's Course).</p>
   <p>In America he was very energetic in his support of lodges, organizations, and the movement to preserve our Norwegian traditions, music, art, and handicrafts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1288.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Fjeld had not felt very well recently, though he never complained. The only feeling which he revealed was his longing to take hold of a number of things that were in a backwater eddy and needed initiative and guidance into the current of usefulness and accomplishment.</p>
   <p>A wealth of flowers and floral pieces gave evidence of what a host of friends Martin Fjeld had gained among the members of the Scandinavian colonies of Chicago.</p>
