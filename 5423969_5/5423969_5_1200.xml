   <p>The Editor, Skandinaven:</p>
   <p>"Having time and time again noticed and read with pleasure your many plain expositions and well-directed efforts to convince disbelievers and misguided persons as to the real political relations between Norway and Sweden, the writer, who is a constant reader of the daily issue of your paper, respectfully asks space for a few remarks on that vexed question.</p>
   <p>"The more immediate occasion for coming back to this matter is an announcement in the Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin for May 27, in which it says editorially, 'It was inspiring to see the "Swedish" flag floating from the peak of a vessel in the port of Milwaukee,' referring to the steamer 'Wergeland' which honored that city by laying to for a while outside the harbor on her late passage to Chicago. This comment seems very improbable <pb facs="5423969_5_1201.jpg" n="2"/>in the face of the fact that the 'Wergeland' hails from Bergen and is a Norwegian craft. There is no record that a Swedish vessel has ever been seen on these great inland seas.</p>
   <p>"But this is not the first time that that great and good paper, the Evening Wisconsin, has betrayed gross ignorance in matters of this sort, and made a laughing stock of itself. In its issue of November 28, 1891, space is given to a long communication which gives an account of the ancient Viking ship found at Gokstad 'on the Christiania Fjord'. This article was headed in large type: 'Out of a Swedish Mound'. This was refreshing indeed! When shortly afterwards the proper editors attention was called to this perversion of facts, he refused to make a correction in the columns of the paper, yet stated in writing, 'we do not hold ourselves blameless in the matter'.</p>
   <p>"It is no wonder at all that the small fry often fall into the pit when <pb facs="5423969_5_1202.jpg" n="3"/>great leaders set the example.</p>
   <p>"While our Swedish brethren have for generations back distinguished themselves in scientific and industrial pursuits, our countrymen, from the time of the Vikings, have been known as seafarers and navigators of the first order, and have sailed every sea, in advance of many other voyagers. When the little brig, "Sleipner", came to Chicago as early as 1862, the Inter Ocean of that day gave a full account of that notable event, describing the craft as 'a perfect gem of shipbuilding'. The Northmen yield to no other nationality in good seamanship, and their country stands third in rank as to amount of tonnage afloat."</p>
   <p>The ship "Wergeland" docked in Chicago last week, the second Norwegian ship ever to reach Chicago. The "Wergeland", sails under Norwegian registry, and is manned by a Norwegian crew, Capt. Wiese and first officer Amland.</p>
