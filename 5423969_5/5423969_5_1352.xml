   <p>Reverend Carl Adolph Preus, whose untiring activity has been a great factor in the upbuilding of the Norwegian Synod, was the first minister in Our Saviors Church here in Chicago. He was born June 29, 1814 in Smaalenene on Hobbels Prestegaard. [A Prestegaard was a farm operated by the minister of the Church, usually on the share-cropping system. The Prestegaard was, in most cases, owned by the Church and seldom by the individual minister, though he always kept the profits made by it.] In 1840 he became Candidatus Theologiae [a candidate for a theological degree]. In 1845 he was a teacher in the school at Kopervig, and five years later he was called to the church in Koshkonong, Wisconsin. He was one of the six ministers who organized the Synod, and in 1853 he was the first president of the group.</p>
