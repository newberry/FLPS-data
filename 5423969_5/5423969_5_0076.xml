   <p>May 17, will shine throughout the ages as a beacon-light commemorating the most glorious and far-reaching event in the history of Norway. The Norseman and his descendants, whether at home or abroad, will not, cannot, forget this day.</p>
   <p>In the celebration of May 17, we recall the valiant fight of a little country to free itself from the rule of a foreign power. We celebrate the adoption of a new constitution based on freedom and equality for all, and the right of a people to govern itself.</p>
   <p>Thus the day is a "day of the people," of equal importance to merchant, farmer, manufacturer, lawyer, and laborer. Under this constitution, all are equal. That is why we celebrate May 17.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0077.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To the clergy and the titled classes, May 17 has far different significance; one inherited from the period of Danish rule. To them, it means the end of power, of pomp and splendor, of might overcoming right, and of material and spiritual oppression. Their power and privileges have been taken from them, and the new conditions leave them stunned and weakened, mourning the loss of the glory that once was theirs.</p>
   <p>Since May 17th, 1814, Norway has advanced, as have few other nations in the world, so that she is on as high a plane economically and culturally as any democratic country. This new structure we have built on the foundation laid at Eidsvold on May 17th, 1814. That is why we celebrate May 17th.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0078.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>So far, we have progressed, and we cannot, will not, stop - we must advance. To halt means death, and the new life is too sweet; we must, we will go on to ever greater things, to a fuller life and perfect liberty. That is why we thank the men of Eidsvold and celebrate May 17th.</p>
