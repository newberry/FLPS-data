   <p>At the convention called by the [Norwegian Central] Association, twenty-four organizations were represented. The meeting was better than several other meetings that were held in the past year. The following people represented the different groups:</p>
   <p>The Tabitha Hospital Society, Dr. Carl Sandberg; Scandia Lodge No. 271, K. L. H., Mrs. Mary Monson; Ladies' Society Thora, Mrs. Bonsnes; Ladies' Society Mindet, Mrs. Lindberg; North Star Lodge No. 137, I. O. M. A., F. Nielsen; Nordmandenes [Norsemen's] Singing Society, Chas. Bergersen; Bjorgvin Singing Society, Julius Jaeger; the Norwegian Turner Society, Fred Keane; the Norwegian Sick Benefit Society Nordlyset, O. Holmont; the Norwegian Club, L. Hawkins; Leif Ericsson Monument Association, C. C. Christensen; Leif Ericsson Lodge No. 9, R. H. K., Edward M. Iverson; Society Nordlaendingen [North Landers], L. C. Olsen; Temperance Society Harmony, Hans Johnson; Society Sleipner, John W. Wold; the Scandinavian-American Prohibition Club, Carl Drolsum; Bethania Church, Anund A. Malum; <pb facs="5423969_5_0231.jpg" n="2"/>Court Normania Lodge No. 174, I. O. F.; the Norwegian Quartet Club, B. Osland; the Norwegian Sharpshooters, Lars Johansen; Jordenskjold Lodge No. 15, R. H. K. Reverend Alfred Johnson and E. A. O. Haarvig came as representatives of the Savior's Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sandberg, who was chairman of the Seventeenth of May committee, called the meeting to order. Elections were held and Dr. Carl Sandberg was elected chairman, and B. Osland was chosen as secretary. The chairman asked the delegates to give a report on whether or not their respective organizations would cooperate with the Central Association. The majority reported that their organizations were in accord with this important step. A resolutions committee was set up and began its functions at once. Another committee was appointed to work on drawing up a constitution and bylaws.</p>
   <p>One of the delegates made a motion that any Norwegian organization that had a few Danes or Swedes in their membership could become part of the Association.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0232.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This motion was carried. Just before the meeting was adjourned, a motion was made and passed, that a separate law committee be set up, to be appointed by the chairman. Dr. Sandberg appointed the following: C. C. Christensen, chairman, Carl Drolsum, Louis Hawlins, Lars Johansen, John T. Johnson, Julius Jaeger, F. Kean, Mrs. Lindberg, Anton Mehlum, and Fred Nielsen. It now looks as though a strong Association has been formed.</p>
