   <p>What, if anything, does Chicago intend to do? This question,regarding the 1914 celebration in Norway, has been asked repeatedly, and no answer seems forthcoming. We are at a loss to account for the apathy of our colony regarding such an outstanding event in the history of our people.</p>
   <p>North Dakota has appropriated $10,000 for the participation of the Norsemen of that State; Minnesota's Swedish governor is putting over a state appropriation of $25,000; and Wisconsin's Irish governor has promised the same amount for the Norsemen of his State. There is no doubt that these amounts are being appropriated, when we consider the advantages these states will win by advertising in the countries that furnish them with their most valued immigrants. This reason may prove refilling, however, in that the festivities are national rather than international and commercial.</p>
   <p>The contributions to the exhibition may take on an educational character or cultural one; the idea is to give Norway a comprehensive picture of the position of the Norwegians in America. There is to be an exhibit of Norwegian-American <pb facs="5423969_5_0990.jpg" n="2"/>art, music, literature, press, etc., and this exhibit will do more to create and maintain a closer relation and understanding between the two countries than a commercial show ever could.</p>
   <p>The great question here is, what will Chicago, the third largest Norwegian city in the world, do for a Chicago exhibit? Can anyone imagine anything that would be of greater interest than an exhibit portraying the Chicago Norseman in his environment of, say, fifty years ago, and <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> through the years to the present time? Such an exhibit would be an education in itself, and would open eyes both in Norway and elsewhere. Here is something for the Norwegian National League to work on; if they will take the initiative, we need not fear the results.</p>
