   <p>Every seat in the church proper was occupied on Friday evening at the Bethel Lutheran Church. The occasion was the revival meetings conducted in Chicago by the Norwegian United Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>The Lutherans have frequently been accused of being cold, ceremonious dogmatics who do not wish and even oppose vigorous, buoyant spiritual life; they have been accused of having but little use for prayer meetings and laymen's activities, and of being satisfied with time-worn formality and some form of rigid, traditional Christianity.</p>
   <p>It would be well if those who think this way would come to these revival meetings, so that they might be able to see and judge for themselves; then they would have a basis for estimating the teachings and practices of the Lutherans.</p>
