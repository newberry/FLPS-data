   <p>Skandinaven does not join in the fear or uneasiness professed by various parties as to the possibility for agreement on the nature of the memorial gift to Norway in honor of the centennial of Norwegian independence. The letters to the Skandinaven have been expressions of the attitude of the Norwegian people in America. Those who have read these letters will have noticed that the basic note in all of them is much alike, although the various writers may have very different opinions as to the form each wishes the gift to take, or what he wishes accomplished in Norway as a result of the gift. Most of the writers state that they will bow to the majority....</p>
   <p>Judging from the letters received, it would be easy to reach an agreement if a large sum is raised. It is not certain, however, that a very large amount can be collected, so that it may be well if our people would consider the <pb facs="5423969_5_1103.jpg" n="2"/>matter also on the supposition that a lesser sum will be raised.</p>
   <p>At some future time Skandinaven will give its own opinion in the matter of the gift, but the paper has not wished to prejudice the question as far as free expression of opinion from the Norwegian people in America is concerned. For that reason it has kept silent in the discussion. When expressions have been made from the various sides, it will be possible to begin to put them together, to arrange and analyze, until, as a result, one may be able to find the thought or proposition supported by the majority of the people.</p>
