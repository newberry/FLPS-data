   <p>The Eielsen Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church held its seventieth annual meeting last week. The first day of the conference was devoted to the election of National officers and a discussion on the future religious program.</p>
   <p>On Friday, the second day of the conference, The Christian Layity was discussed. It was resolved that Reverend A. L. Wiek, the editor, should have an increase in salary of $25 per month. It was reported that there was a deficit of $21.13 The reason for the deficit is that subscribers fail to pay their subscription fees in time and many do not pay at all. A collection totaling $77.65 was taken up to cover the deficit. A recommendation to change the bylaws was discussed.</p>

   <p>On Saturday the following elections were completed: board of trustees, Inner Mission board, and National Church board. The Inner Mission submitted a complete report.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to circulate the following petition:</p>
   <p>"May I call your attention to the following petition which is a plea in the name of humanity to stop the unprincipled exportation of arms and ammunition from this country to Mexico and Europe.</p>
   <p>"The American Humanity League and the Organization of American Women for Strict Neutrality have already collected several hundred thousand signatures for this cause, but we want millions in order to show our government that the great masses of the people are with us.</p>
   <p>"I beg you to lay this matter before Eielsen Synod, inviting everyone to help.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0370.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is distinctively a humanitarian movement in which we believe all churches will do their part.</p>
   <p>"With thanks to you, I am</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"Elsa Lang,</p>
   <p>Ladies' Executive Committee
   </p>
   <p>American Humanity League"
   </p>
   <p>A copy of this petition was sent to the United States Government.</p>
