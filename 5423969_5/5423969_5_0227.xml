<title level="a">[PIONEERS OF AMERICA HOLD BIENNIAL CONVENTION]</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>On Wednesday of this week the Norwegian Pioneers Association of America held their biennial convention in Chicago. However, the opening day's attendance was so small that there was some talk of giving up the biennial conventions that have always been such enjoyable affairs. This motion was held over until Thursday, which proved to have been the sensible thing to do, for the festival on Wednesday night drew such a crowd that the interest and enthusiasm for these meetings was completely revived.</p>
   <p>We trust that the Pioneers will continue to be with us for many years. Their meetings are real reunions which bring together men from every field which has served to make our country the greatest in the world. Gathered here are the veterans of wars at home and abroad, the intrepid seamen of the old sailing days, the pioneers who opened and developed our great western areas, the merchant princes who started in business with pushcarts or even with old carpet bags or bundles, and whose business now is nationwide, the country doctors who are now world-famous, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0228.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These are the pioneers--men, women and children who suffered privations, unbearable to us of today, to build our United States of America. Why should they discontinue these meetings, so rich in memories, traditions, and cold, hard, historical facts (authentic and valuable)? Long may our pioneers live to enjoy their well-built present and future.</p>
