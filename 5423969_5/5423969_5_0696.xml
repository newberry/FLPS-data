   <p>As an addition to the report from the meeting of the board of directors of the Deaconess Society last Thursday, it has been announced that Miss Marie Larsen and Miss Melisa Henderson have been chosen to take charge as deaconesses at the hospital in Crookston, Minnesota. There will also be sent two deaconesses from the Society here to serve at the orphanage of the United Lutheran Church in Beloit, Iowa.</p>
   <p>Following the annual conference of the United Lutheran Churches (Norwegian) this coming summer, the Reverends N. G. Petersen, Lisbon; A. Oftedal, Chicago; N. J. Ellestad, Holden; Halvor Fjelstad, Granite Falls, will travel throughout the northwest to collect funds for the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The report for the first quarter of the year 1900 shows that fifty-six patients with a total of 1398 days of hospital treatment have been cared for at the hospital. Of these treatment-days, 203 have been paid for in full by the patients; 417 days have been for half pay, and 778 days of treatment have been given free.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0697.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Forty-five operations have been made, of these, twelve very difficult ones. The secretary Reverend C. M. Weswig reports the following amounts received by him:</p>
