   <p>p.4.......Several thousands Lutherans were gathered Wednesday evening at Orchestra Hall and Strand Theatre for two large Lutheran festivals. Among the speakers was Dr. Gustaf Andreen, President of Augustana College at Rockford, Ill. His speech among other things contained the following pledge: "We, the Evangelical Lutheran Church," pledge our renewed allegiance to our country and, following the example of our forefathers at Valley Forge, Vicksburg and Gettysberg, we stand ready to obey the call of our President and willing to give the last token of our devotion to maintain the stability of our country and to defend its honor."</p>
   <p>The following beautiful words taken from the last issue of "Evangelical Lutheran Church Times."</p>
   <p>The clouds of war are hovering over our land. As its citizens it is our duty to obey the authorities, and to do our duty. But to us as christians our duties <pb facs="5423969_5_0343.jpg" n="2"/>carry a twofold meaning, and particularly to us of the Norwegian Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>The United States have received us and given us of her best. We have found a good home and everything called the wherewithals of life. We have also, and this is not the least, found liberty and opportunity to worship the Lord in accordance with our understanding of his Word and Will. These are blessings we must remember in the serious situation now confronting our country.</p>
   <p>As christians we have the privilege of the prayer, we have also the right to bring our country's welfare before the Throne of God. So, let us use this right, let us pray for our country and our people.</p>
   <p>That God will protect us with his Almighty Arm. That, He will give our Government wisdom and good advice. That, He shortens the conflict. That, He will use this visitation of evil as a means to help us turn our hearts and thoughts to Him. That, His will through us might advance for the betterment of mankind. "God bless our country, be patient with us for Christ, your Son's sake. Amen."</p>
