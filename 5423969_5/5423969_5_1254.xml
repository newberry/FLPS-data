   <p>The Chicago Norwegian colony has lost one of its most stalwart pillars--the eighty-four-year-old Dr. Niles T. Quales.</p>
   <p>Niles Theodore Quales was born in Kinservk, Hardanger County, Norway. Dr. Quales was of good old peasant stock; his father, Torgils Johnson Ovrequale, and his mother Guri Torgils Datter [Guri Torgil's Daughter], owned a large farm where Niles worked in summer. He went to school during the short winter days. He entered the agricultural college at Kvindherred [Kvind County]in 1848, and graduated three years later. In 1852 he managed the great estate of Garmon, at Utsten Convent, near Stavager, and in the same year he went to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he studied at the Royal Veterinary College, graduating in 1856. On his return to Norway, he was appointed county veterinarian in South Bergenshus County.</p>
   <p>In 1853 he immigrated to America with Ivar Lawson [the father of the founder of the Daily News]. He came to Chicago in 1859, and like all newcomers to the city, he struggled and suffered a great deal. In 1861, he joined the army and <pb facs="5423969_5_1255.jpg" n="2"/>served during the Civil War. At the end of the war, he entered Rush Medical College and graduated in 1867. Dr. Quales was a member of the County Hospital Medical Board until 1868, when he was appointed City Physician. He functioned in this capacity for two years. He was especially active in the Smallpox Hospital on North Avenue during the epidemic of 1868. In 1870, he was appointed head physician at the Marine Hospital which at that time was located on Michigan Avenue near Rush Street. Here he stayed until 1871, when the Hospital was destroyed by fire.</p>
   <p>After the Chicago fire he was appointed visiting doctor for the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, and was assigned to the old fourteenth Ward. In 1873, he purchased a home on Fowler Street near Wicker Park Avenue, where he resided until his death.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales was appointed head physician of the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital in 1891; he was elected chairman of the constitution and bylaws committee of the Tabitha Hospital Society in 1892. Later he was elected executive secretary of the Society and was a member of the building committee. He was a member of the new Hospital's medical board and was its first president.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1256.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He resigned in 1896, and became active in organizing the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged. He was elected chairman of the constitution committee, and became the Society's first president. He served in this capacity until about a year before his death, when he was elected honorary president of the Society. In 1906 he was appointed head physician at the Deaconess Hospital.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales was a member of the Illinois State Medical Society, the Chicago Medical Society, and the Scandinavian Medical Society, of which he was president and later honorary president. He was one of the incorporators of the Wicker Park English Lutheran Church which was organized in 1879, and for some years he was trustee and treasurer. Following are some of the other organizations to which Dr. Quales belonged: the Oriental Lodge, Thomas Post No. 5, G. A. R., honorary member of the Y.M.C.A., life member of the Deaconess Home Society and the Lutheran Children's Home Society, the Rush Medical Alumni Association, and the Cook County Hospital Association.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales traveled extensively in Europe, including Denmark, England, Germany, Belgium, and France. In 1910 he was made Knight of the Order of St. Olaf. In 1911, he was honored by his admirers at a banquet attended by several hundreds of people.</p>
