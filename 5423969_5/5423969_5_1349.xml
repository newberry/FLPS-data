   <p>Reverend A. Haagensen and his wife, Julia, celebrated their golden-wedding anniversary at their home, 2049 Maple Street, Evanston, Illinois, on Sunday, January 17.</p>
   <p>The celebration took place during the afternoon. Surrounded by seven children, thirteen grandchildren, and a large number of ministers and other friends, the golden-wedding couple received the congratulations at the success of their joint venture in life. The festivities were under the leadership of Reverend F. Ring.....Skandinaven's publisher, Mr. John Anderson, was among the speakers.</p>
   <p>On Monday evening there was a still greater festival in the Norwegian-Danish Methodist Church in Evanston.....The attractive, roomy church and its side <pb facs="5423969_5_1350.jpg" n="2"/>hall were filled with people, who, with great interest, listened to the well-arranged program...Speeches were made by Reverend O. L. Hansen, Professor N. E. Simonsen, H. A. Haugan, and Reverend F. Ring who presented the honored couple with a considerable amount of money in gold from the congregation and other friends. A large number of telegrams and letters were received, including a letter from United States Senator Knute Nelson.</p>
   <p>The festival was most successful and will remain as a pleasant memory with all who attended.</p>
   <p>Reverend A. Haagensen was born near Sarpsborg, Norway, in 1835....He came to America in 1857 and has been an active minister in the Methodist church for more that fifty-one years. He has held many positions of honor within the church; he has been district superintendent, editor, author of a number of pamphlets, and has composed songs and hymns.</p>
