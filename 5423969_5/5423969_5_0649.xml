   <p>St. Johannes Church, corner of Cortez Street and Humboldt Street [now Sacramento Avenue], celebrated its tenth anniversary last Sunday in the church building.</p>
   <p>Reverend Bleking told about the growth of the church, pointing out that the congregation had not grown as would have been expected because the church occupied such a small building, and therefore could house only a few people. But, as he said, "very soon the congregation would build a larger and more elaborate church".</p>
   <p>The congregation started in the early part of 1891, with Reverend Laritz Nissen as the first pastor. He resigned the same year. On January 7, 1892, Reverend Thomas Nilsson was called from a small rural church. After he became the pastor the congregation grew, and a few months later an old house was bought on the corner of Washtenaw Avenue and Augusta Street. While the house was being remodeled, the congregation met in a German school-house on Iowa Street.</p>

   <p>Reverend Nilsson functioned as pastor for about five years until in 1897 he was called to one of the Synod churches in St. Paul. His successor was the present pastor, Reverend Bleking.</p>
   <p>An active ladies' society was formed a few years ago, and we can thank this group for the excellent financial standing of the church today. new rectory is being built on adjoining lot, to be finished next year.</p>
   <p>...The church register shows that there have been 310 christenings, 115 confirmations, 71 marriages, 108 funerals, and an attendance of 667 at communion services. It was decided to hold services in English every Sunday evening.</p>
