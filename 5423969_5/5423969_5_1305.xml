   <p>p.4....Nicoloy Grevstad, the well-known editor of Skandinaven, celebrated his sixtieth birthday during the past week. Mr. Grevstad took over the duties as editor of Skandinaven in 1892 and from that time on this paper has been a Norwegian Publication in the fullest sense of the word. Norwegian literature, art, science, music, language and tradition has, in Skandinaven, found a staunch and willing champion thruout the years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grevstad has succeeded in keeping out of the paper everything bordering on personalities, not only in his editorial columns, but also in the contributions of its many correspondents. Petty bickerings and arguments of political and religious nature have been conscientiously barred; often contentions of this nature have been smothered by Mr. Grevstad, who, as an intermediary, has brought harmony among various warring factions. His friendliness is contageous.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven, now published bi-weekly, is outstanding among foreign language papers; it is a model for all our Norwegian papers.</p>
   <p>Norway too has a great deal to thank Mr. Grevstad for. Were it not for <pb facs="5423969_5_1306.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Grevstad's interest and untiring work for the preservation of Norwegian culture in this country, we and our people in Norway would soon be strangers to each other; with new arrivals becoming practically the only connecting link between the two countries which now (thanks to Mr. Grevstad and a few like-minded men) have so much in common.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grevstad is possessed of a wonderful personality, friendly and entertaining, that has always drawn Norsemen closer, awakened memories and recalled high ideals in the life and culture of Norway. The traditions and ideals have thru Mr. Grevstad been transplanted and preserved so that today our people thruout the country are being looked up to and truly appreciated as never before.</p>
   <p>Scandia hereby expresses a deep gratitude to Mr. Grevstad for all he has done for the mother country and for our people thruout the U.S.A., the we owe him a real vote of thanks for what he has done for our Norwegian colony in Chicago. Brother Grevstad, Scandia salutes you and wishes you continued success and happiness.</p>
