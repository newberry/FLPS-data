   <p>Iver Lawson was born in Boevoss, Norway, Dec. 21, 1821, and came to America before he had attained his majority. He was one of the pioneer Norwegian residents of Chicago, making his home on the north side, where he lived the rest of his life. With his brother, Knut he engaged in any kind of work to be had in those days and finally turned his attention to real-estate. By making shrewd investments in vacant property he soon acquired a competence and before his death in 1872 was accounted one of the most successful men in the city. The fire in 1871 destroyed a number of buildings owned by him in various parts of the north side and also rendered valueless much of the insurance, stock and other security held by him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lawson was one of the organizers of the First Evangelical Lutheran Church which in 1848 and a number of years after was located on Superior Street between Wells and LaSalle Avenue. He was a strong Republican and served as alderman from the old fifteenth ward on the north side from 1864 to 1867.</p>

   <p>Prior to that time and during the last year of John Wentworth's administration he was city marshal. While a member of the City-Council he took a prominent part in carrying out plans for purifying the Chicago river and improving the general health conditions of the city. In 1869 he was a member of the House of Representatives in the state legislature and was closely identified with the legislation which gave to Chicago its splended park-system. The creation of Lincoln Park in particular was due in great part, to his efforts. Iver Lawson was also one of the founders, with John Anderson and Knud Langland, of the Skandinaven in the success of which he took a deep interest. He died October 3, 1872, leaving a widow, two sons and a daughter. The widow Malinda Lawson died in Chicago October 16,1896. The eldest son Victor F. Lawson is the editor and proprieter of the Chicago Daily News.</p>
