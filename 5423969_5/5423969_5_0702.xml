   <p>"I can only reply that in my sermon I uttered no opinion on political expansion, that I did not mean to utter such and opinion, and that the council no doubt did not understand me to utter such an opinion.</p>
   <p>"The commonwealth in which expansion is a fundamental law is defined in the next sentence: The Kingdom of God. This should be, and is, clear enough to any impartial, half-way intelligent reader, except perhaps to reporters of a political paper, for they are phenomenally obtuse on all matters concerning the church and the Kingdom of God. I preached the gospel, not politics.</p>
   <p>"Yours in Christ,</p>
   <p>George C. Haas."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0703.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>[Translator's note: Reverend Haas was the preacher whose sermon the Skandinaven criticized in the editorial, "Lutherans and Expansion".]</p>
   <p>2. The General Council Says Nothing</p>
   <p>"The general council [of the Lutheran Church] has not, so far as I know, expressed itself either pro or con regarding the expansion policy of our government.</p>
   <p>"M. C. Ranseen President of the General Council."</p>
   <p>[The general council was accused of making certain statements, at their last meeting, on expansion.]</p>
   <p>3. Reverend Haas' Sermon</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0704.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Skandinaven reprints the part of Reverend Haas' sermon that caused the misunderstanding:</p>
   <p>"Whether it is in accord with the principles laid down in its Constitution and expedient unto the welfare of the country that this nation should be extending its domain over far distant lands and bringing under its sway a strange people, is a question now agitating the minds of many. But whatever be the position we take with reference to the policy of the land of our nativity or our adoption in the matter of expansion, we are by these facts reminded that we are citizens of a commonwealth in which expansion is a fundamental law, and the carrying out of the injunction, 'Make ye disciples of all nations,' a prime duty of every citizen. The Kingdom of God on earth, His holy church, is growing and will continue to grow, conquering nation after nation and extending its beneficent sway to the most distant climes. Unto Israel of old the evangelical prophet bore the message, 'Enlarge the place of thy tent,' and what was then enjoined in prophecy was fulfilled in fact with <pb facs="5423969_5_0705.jpg" n="4"/>the advent of the Lord, the establishment of the new convenant and birth of the spiritual Israel that embraced all nations and tongues."</p>
   <p>4. Skandinaven's Criticism</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven was impressed by the foregoing part of the sermon as follows:</p>
   <p>"Reverend Haas emphasizes, clearly and tersely, the dominant phases of the question; he treats expansion as a fundamental law of the land and of Christian civilization. The prophetic injunction, 'Enlarge the place of thy tent,' expresses the divine policy for the propagation of the gospel of salvation upon earth; and it likewise voices the law of national growth and the spread of human civilization.</p>
   <p>"The American people, buoyant with strength and vitality and mindful of their mission, have neglected no opportunity to fulfill the God-given command. 'Enlarge the place of thy tent' has been the guiding and the controlling principle <pb facs="5423969_5_0706.jpg" n="5"/>of American policy from the dawn even unto the dusk of the present century. Surely, expansion is a fundamental law of the land whether applied to our recent acquisitions or not, as expansion is, and must be, the fundamental law of our Christian-American civilization. For the only alternatives are stagnation, retrogression, and death."</p>
   <p>Reverend Haas states that he did not want to give the impression that he and the Lutheran Church were for expansion. But he did give that impression. He does not deny that the editorial is correct.</p>
   <p>The readers will remember his statement on expansion--political expansion, especially in reference to the Philippines. He then states that "no matter what stand we take in reference to expansion,....we are by these facts reminded that we are citizens of a commonwealth (republic) in which expansion is a fundamental law and the carrying out...."</p>
   <p>Reverend Haas must remember that expansion rests on the fundamental law;</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0707.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines were acquired on certain tracts that are fundamental law. The Reverend's expression is one thing, and his explanation is not necessary. The people of a commonwealth elects its own officers. The citizens of God's Kingdom do not elect their leader. The expressions, as they were made by a preacher, fit a republic, but are absolutely not appropriate to God's Kingdom; the Kingdom of God cannot be compared to a republic.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven does not feel that it needs to apologize. We have history on our side of the discussion. Expansion has, through the ages, been necessary in order to spread Christianity. Expansion is the fundamental law of the land, of Christianity, and of the entire Christian civilization.</p>
   <p>The president of the general council informs us that the council has made no statement regarding this matter. This statement was unnecessary; we have never claimed this.</p>
