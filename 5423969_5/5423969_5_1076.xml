   <p>At the meeting of the committee for a jubilee gift to Norway, held in Chicago in February of last year, it was unanimously resolved to collect fifty thousand dollars for a building for the Norwegian Association in Norway. The building was to be finished in 1914; for this reason the collection of money was to start early. It was also resolved to raise a fund of one hundred thousand dollars for the fight against tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>The president of the Norwegian Storting, Mr. C. Berner, who is also the president of the Nordmandsforbundt (Norwegian Association), on the occasion of these resolutions, sent a telegraphic message of thanks to Mr. Gade, the Norwegian consul in Chicago, who had formulated the unanimously adopted motion. The committee...could only assume, on the strength of the telegram from President Berner, that a building for the Nordmandsforbundet would be a highly <pb facs="5423969_5_1077.jpg" n="2"/>prized gift on the occasion of the Norwegian jubilee in 1914. In the meantime, Mr. Berner, according to an interview published in the Aftenposten, Christania, Norway, has now declared that the Nordmandsforbundet does not need a building at present, while it would be highly desirable to have a fund for the enlargement of the journal of the Association, and for scholarships.</p>
   <p>After such statements from the president of the Nordmandsforbundet, it is clear that the committee cannot continue with the mandate on the strength of which it was elected at the Chicago meeting. Surely, nobody will want to force upon the Association something which its president declares it does not need. It would be impossible to create sentiment for a gift of that kind.</p>
   <p>The resolution concerning a building for the Nordmandsforbundet is closely allied, however, with the resolution to raise a fund of one hundred thousand dollars for the fight against tuberculosis. The two resolutions were formulated and adopted as one. Under the circumstances, therefore, the committee cannot give up one part of the resolution while retaining the other; it can <pb facs="5423969_5_1078.jpg" n="3"/>only consider the mandate given to it as one which it can no longer carry through. Sacrificing time and money, the committee has tried loyally to execute the resolutions of the Chicago meeting. The statements by Mr. Berner, because of their significance for the jubilee gift, have tied the hands of the committee.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, we invite all those interested in the question of a jubilee gift for Norway in 1914 to a mass meeting to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 2 at 10 A. M., in the Mayor's Reception Room, City Hall. To this meeting any Norwegian society, any Norwegian congregation which desires, any mass meeting called for the purpose in any city or country district, any Norwegian-American paper, and any Norwegian-American school, is entitled to send two delegates. The present committee will withdraw in order that this mass meeting, which should become as representative as possible, may form a permanent organization, elect a board of directors, and decide the nature of the jubilee gift. In this manner, the present committee believes it has done as much as it is able to do for the advancement of the task which the jubilee gift presents.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1079.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The committee hopes that this mass meeting will succeed in determining a form for the jubilee gift which will be acceptable to at least a majority of the delegates, and for which all of the delegates will then agree to work loyally; that the form decided upon may be such as to appeal to at least a large part of the Norwegian-Americans, and a form which may be realized successfully.</p>
   <p>All those who wish to be represented should elect delegates in the month of May, and should inform the present secretary, Professor Wilhelm Pettersen, Augsburg Seminary, Minneapolis, Minnesota, of the result not later than May 25. In this way it will be possible to learn how many delegates will be present, and if it should be found that the hall now secured will not be large enough, a larger hall will be rented.</p>
