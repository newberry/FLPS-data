   <p>p.4............In the opinion of Frederic C. Howe, Commissioner of Immigration at New York, the United States each year sustain an economic loss of from $500,000,000. to $1,000,000,000. because of the drop in immigration due to the war. Mr. Howe bases his figures on the "working-value" of each immigrant placed at from $500.00 to $1,000.00.</p>
   <p>More than one million immigrants per year or about 100,000 per month passed through Ellis Island before the outbreak of the war two years ago, says Mr. Howe. And this constitutes 90% of our total immigration, thus making New York City, the World's greatest "port of entry." During the last two years only 419,981 immigrants were admitted, a few thousands less the number of which departed (440,716). One is safe in assuming, that at least 1,500,000 people have remained away, due to the war.</p>

   <p>The result of this has been a serious shortage in the labor-market, particularly of the unskilled class, in such fields as railway construction, highway and bridge construction and agricultural workers, that is common and skilled labor. In several sections of our country this labor shortage has been acute; to this again can be ascribed the steadily rising wages as well as the large number of strikes, which have been carried on to a succesful conclusion. Working conditions for the "unskilled labor" class are particularly attractive in the New England States, Pennsylvania, and the Central States where the munition factories corral all available labor at top wages. Agricultural workers are well nigh impossible to obtain, due to the higher wages paid in the cities. In the "West" day laborer's receive from $3.00 to $3.25 per day, and in the "East" day wages rose from $1.75 to $2.50. Commissioner Howe is of the opinion, that these favorable conditions will continue for a long time, if nothing unforseen happens. The money which comes into the country during these two years also begins to influence the industries, which otherwise were not affected by the war; and wages will continue to rise.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0902.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Reports from Federal, State and Municipal Employment Bureaus show that work can be furnished many thousands, but this does not seem to affect the scene. Our office receives hundreds of inquiries every day.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago two shiploads of Spaniards arrived at Ellis Island. The whole group obtained work at $2.25 per day as soon as they landed. Since then they have all left the first job for more remunerative work elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The present slump in immigration will last through the war. The only countries in Europe where emigration is not restricted are: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Italy Spain and Portugal. From the three Scandinavian countries immigration is considerably under normal, this also applies to Greece; from Italy it is about one half of the normal influx; from Spain and Portugal about the same as before the war.</p>
