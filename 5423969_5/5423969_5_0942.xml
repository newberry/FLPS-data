   <p>After a great deal of hard work and much trouble, I have at last succeeded....in arranging for a home for Scandinavian women who are seeking employment in this large city. These women frequently have no friends or homes to visit, especially during their first year in this country. The objective of this institution is to provide a place where such women may come at any time and feel at home. The Bethany Home is located at the corner of Erie and Noble Streets; it is a light and bright place, a real place for those seeking rest. An employment office is connected with the Home, and women who wish to rest from their work for some period, may have room and board for two dollars a week. But there is a time limit. A woman thus vacationing from her work may not stay continuously at the Home for more than three weeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0943.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There will be lots of good literature available for the women, and all the advantages of a home.</p>
   <p>American women have undertaken to pay the rent of the Home for one year. Our need at present is for tables, chairs, and groceries. Gifts, of the kind mentioned, from some kind hearted Scandinavian would be of especial help just now, since we are rather short of supplies. Dedication services will be held at the Home on Saturday evening, May 9, at 7:30 o'clock.</p>
