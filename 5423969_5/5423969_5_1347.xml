   <p>Whereas, In the death of Mr. John Anderson, an honorary member and faithful friend of our Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged, we feel an irreparable loss; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, His sterling character, his unselfish devotion to the needy, his strong support of fair and honest work, his wise counsel, his presence at our meetings and social events--all combined to make him a large factor in our work; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we express our high appreciation of his life, our great loss in his death, which has removed a foundation of helpfulness to our Society. Be it further <pb facs="5423969_5_1348.jpg" n="2"/>Resolved, That we extend to his family our deepest sympathy and commend them to the loving Father who cares for all; that we attend the funeral in a body, and that we send copies of these resolutions to the family and to the press.</p>
