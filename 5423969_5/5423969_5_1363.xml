<title level="a">50TH ANNIVERSARY OF REV. A. HAAGENSEN</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Rev. A. Haagensen, senior of the Norwegian Danish Methodist preachers in America, who for many years has served as minister in Chicago, celebrated his 50th anniversary as a minister at the annual conference of the church held in Forest City, Iowa, from Aug. 29, to Sept. 2.</p>
   <p>A large tent erected behind the church was filled to overflowing. On the platform, Reverend Haagensen was surrounded by members of his family and the Ministers of the conference. Reaching back into the past, Reverend Haagensen told a tale of the aims and purposes of the church which he is serving, the struggles he and other ministers, as well as the people, had to meet, especially during the early days, and also of the triumphs enjoyed as the flocks increased in district after district. Reverend Haagensen has served as preacher and minister for twenty-four and one half years; as editor of the Kristelige Talsmand (Christian Witness) eleven years; as district superintendent twelve and one half years. He also edited the paper, Missionaren <pb facs="5423969_5_1364.jpg" n="2"/>(The missionary), for three years, and was delegate to the general conference of the M. E. Church. In many other ways, he did literary and practical work that he deemed of value to the cause of the church.</p>
