   <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Andersen, who for many years served as Skandinaven's critic of music and drama, is leaving next week for La Crosse, Wis., where her husband is a prominent man of business, especially well-known in the Norwegian colony of that city. Mrs. Andersen served a tasty dinner to a number of her intimate friends as a farewell gesture and to show her appreciation for the kindness and cooperation they had accorded her in her touchy task as a critic, in many cases of past performances of her guests. Her guests, however, all spoke feelingly of the wonderful friendship and the absolute fairness of the criticisms by Miss Andersen, she was married recently, and expressed their gratitude for past friendship and their hopes for her future success and happiness.</p>
