   <p>p.8....Last Monday evening a police officer founda man peacefully asleep on the curb at North Clark St. and Chicago Ave. Something about the man struck the officer as being different from the general run of curb and park bench tenants, so he awakened him and took him to the nearby police station. Upon being questioned as to his identity and residence he slowly shook his head and from his pockets he brought forth $3,500 in currency, and a bank book with a $6,000 balance.</p>
   <p>The man was cared for at the station for the night and an investigation on Tuesday morning finally revealed that the apparent tramp was Torsten Isaacsen Rosgaard, born in Kongsberg, Norway, and that he had been in America fifty years. During this time he had been in the real estate business, in Minnesota and Dakota, and traveled far and wide as a salesman. By hard work, and thrift, he had saved this tidy sum for his old age; he is now eighty-one years of age.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_1483.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Haugan, Norwegian Consul, Chicago, conducted the investigation, and on Wednesday he was appointed guardian for Mr. Rosgaard. The Consul brought the old gentleman to the Tabitha Hospital for care and observation, and is endeavoring to locate relatives of Mr. Rosgard in the U.S.A. and Norway, to care for him. Should he fail to locate such relatives, he will be placed in an Old People's Home, where he will be properly cared for.</p>
   <p>When details of the case were reported to our police commissioner he said, with a dry little smile, "Chicago can't be so bad when an eighty-one year old man with $10,000 in his pockets can sleep, unmolested, on the city curbstones." We agree that this is unusual, to say the least.</p>
