   <p>For some time the Salem Evangelical Free Church has discussed the plan of opening a home for women in the vicinity of Humboldt Park. However, because of the fact that the congregation has been busy raising funds for the new church and rectory, the project was temporarily postponed. But now that the church has been completed, the plan is being carried out. The congregation donated its old church to a committee set up to promote the idea. The building is now in the process of being remodeled. The old steeple has been torn down; the auditorium, which has a room height of more than twenty feet, has been divided into two floors. After these alterations had been made, the building no longer resembled a church, but looked like something suitable for the purpose in view.</p>
   <p>It is high time that the Danes and Norwegians decide to organize a home such as this. With immigration at a high peak, it was found impossible to care</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0499.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>for the many young women arriving in Chicago. The Home as it is today will serve a twofold purpose: it will care for the young women who have neither friends nor relatives in Chicago; and it will keep them within the arms of the church.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Dahl (Dane) has been appointed matron, and a number of Danish and Norwegian girls have been employed as teachers, nurses, etc.</p>
