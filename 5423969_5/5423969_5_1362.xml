   <p>The new superintendent for the Chicago District of the Norwegian-Danish M. E. Church assumed his duties this past week. Wherever he has appeared in the congregations of Chicago he has been warmly received, and he has made a fine impression everywhere.</p>
   <p>Rev. Hall was born in Gudbrandsdalm, Norway, in 1870, and came to America when 20 years old. Here he attended the Northwestern University of Commerce and Finance, and after being employed in business for some time, he entered the Norwegian Theological Seminary in Evanston and graduated in 1897. The same year he became a member of the Norwegian-Danish M. E. conference. While minister, he continued his studies and graduated from Red Wing Seminary in 1900. Later he studied at Minnesota State University and Denver University. He holds Ph. B. and M. A. degrees from these schools.</p>
   <p>In October, 1904, he married Miss Clara Sakrison. They have one child, a girl.</p>
