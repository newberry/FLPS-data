   <p>Karl Ludvig Lehmann, the well known engineer, was born in Skjolden county, Norway, May 6, 1860. He spent five years at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, applying himself especially to engineering and mathematics and traveling extensively in France. Italy, and Germany during vacations. He was also assistant on the Indo-European measurements of degrees. At the age of 21 he returned to Bergen and gave private instruction in mathematics. In 1882 he came to America. As the times were very hard for engineers and for newcomers especially, he secured a position with the Cunard Line as clerk and interpreter at the same time teaching a few private classes. From 1887 to 1890 he was assistant to the bridge engineer of the City of St. Paul, superintending the construction of the high bridge and the Wabash Street cantilever bridge, both across the Mississippi River, the former being half a mile long. He is a member of the Civil Engineers Society of St. Paul. Returning to Chicago he opened an office for himself as Civil Engineers Society and architect. During the construction of the World's Fair he was employed by the engineering departments on most of the buildings designing among others the iron work of the Electrical <pb facs="5423969_5_1411.jpg" n="2"/>Building; the structural part with long trusses of the Forestry Building, built without the use of iron. In his private capacity Mr. Lehmann designed the proposed 600-foot World Fair tower of which only the foundation was built, time being too short to complete it. He has several patents on tower construction. The Tattersalls on 14th Street was built by him. He also designed and calculated elevated railways and draw brides and was the consulting engineer of two fire proofing companies during 1896; also contractor for iron erection in buildings. He was two years in Dawson City. In 1900 he was employed as chief designer of bascule bridges by the city of Chicago, being the first of its kind in this country. In 1902 he went into partnership with the city engineer, the firm's name being Ericson &amp; Schmann. In 1903 he took a four-month trip to Norway and after returning continued his business at once, designing the Oskosh draw bridge, the ironwork for a number of buildings and lately the Michigan Avenue Bridge, the longest bascule bridge in the world. He got a patent on his self-propelling river boat.</p>
