   <p>The committee on arrangements, selected last Thursday to prepare for a worthy reception of the Scandinavian veterans at the end of the present month, met last Saturday evening at Scandia Hall. The president, Mr. Balken, stated that he had advertised in the Skandinaven for bids from hotels in the matter of quarters for the Scandinavian veterans. It was reported that Captain Johnson, engineer at the Lake View crib, has invited the veterans to a steamer tour upon Lake Michigan. The president proposed the following resolution: "The committee hereby extends its best thanks to Captain Johnson, engineer at the Lake View crib for his kindness in offering a free steamship tour to the crib for the Scandinavian veterans sometime during their stay in Chicago in connection with the G. A. R. meeting to be held near the end of the present month."</p>
   <p>Mr. John Anderson moved that a vote of thanks be forwarded to Mr. C. A. Strand, the superintendent of Scandia Hall, for his offer to place Scandia Hall at the free disposal of the veterans for use as their headquarters during the convention.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_5_0794.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Both of these resolutions were adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Colonel C. R. Matson, the president and the treasurer were authorized to appoint a reception committee of at least twenty-five men. Mr. John Anderson was requested to invite United States Senator Knute Nelson to Chicago to participate in the festivities.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved that a tour in tallyho carriages be arranged for the veterans to view the city. All the eleven committee members are to function as a committee on finances to raise the necessary funds to meet the expenses.</p>
   <p>Mr. Isaac Rasmussen was chosen to inquire into the matter of the carriages and of decorations for the Hall. He is to report at the next meeting which will be held at Scandia Hall, on Thursday, August 16, at 7:45 P.M.</p>
