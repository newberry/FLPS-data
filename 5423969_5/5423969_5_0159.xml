   <p>The Viking Marine Band's Seventeenth of May celebration at Scandia Hall was very well attended. The Hall was decorated with flags and bunting in national colors. Starting at six o'clock in the morning, a music wagon, with loud-speaker, drove about the streets on the West Side, playing Norwegian melodies.</p>
   <p>The social in the evening opened with a potpourri of Norwegian folk songs by Reissiger, which, as well as other numbers in the program, was well executed. Mr. M. Pedersen played a cornet solo; Mr. Robert Sjogren sang "Four Leaf Clover," by A. Paulsen; and Mr. George Bass played a violin solo. All the soloists reaped well-deserved applause.</p>
   <p>The speech in honor of the day was delivered by Mr. Olav Bohmer. Another speech, in honor of the women, was given by Dr. Julsen.</p>
   <p>Attorney J. Owens spoke in honor of America. All the speakers received applause.</p>

   <p>After the public, led by the orchestra, had sung "Ja, vi elsker [dette landet]" (yes, we love this country), the room was cleared for dancing, which continued for several hours.</p>
