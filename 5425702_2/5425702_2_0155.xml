   <p>On October 16 a meeting was held in Bowen Hall, Hull House, to protest against the lynching of the Italians Angelo Albano and Castenzio Ficarotta in Tampa, Florida.</p>
   <p>The executive committee had engaged as speakers Attorney Di Stefano, Professor Leone, Giuseppe Bertelli and Miss Jane Addams.</p>
   <p>Speakers whose opinions differed were purposely selected in order not to impress on the meeting the stamp of any particular party.</p>
   <p>Dr. Albano Zito, a syndicalist, had been invited to speak, but he excused himself on grounds of professional duties.</p>
   <p>Before the program had begunacertain syndicalist declared that in spite of Hell and high water he would be the second speaker. The chairman, Mr. Orrico, rejoined genially and briefly.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0156.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Professor Leone, Attorney Di Stefano, and Mr. Bertelli stigmatized the cowardly lynchings.</p>
   <p>The next speaker should have been Miss Addams, who is very much admired in the Italian colony, but the syndicalist insisted on speaking ahead of Miss Addams, who then decided to withdraw from the meeting.</p>
   <p>The syndicalist said little about the lynchings but much about syndicalism and very much against the Socialist party and unionism.</p>
   <p>In short, he dragged into the meeting the disagreeable feature of partisan animosity, which should have been absolutely avoided.</p>
   <p>Comrade Bertelli retorted by condemning the speaker's talk and behavior, refuting one by one his insults to the Socialist party.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0157.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Perhaps the man's behavior was excusable, for he had arrived in America only a few weeks before and was in no position to pass judgment on his new environment.</p>
