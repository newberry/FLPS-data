   <p>The shameful trade in Italian children which has already made its appearance in several cities and been prosecuted more than once has also come to light here. Emmanuel Mallelo, an Italian, living at 527 S. Clark St. was subjected to a severe grilling in the Southside police station for alleged Slave dealing in Italian children. Here is what happened: A little boy, unable to speak English, was met by a policeman freezing and crying. The friendly night policeman brought the boy to an Italian man, to help out as interpreter. The little one told, that his father had rented him out to Mallelo for twenty-five dollars a year. For that he was obliged to walk daily through the streets with his harp on his back and play music. The money thus collected he had to give to his cruel master in the evening. It was too bad for him if he did not hand over a minimum amount to his torturer. He was then beaten and received nothing to eat. Often he was sent out again into the dark night to complete the sum. If he was again unsuccessful he had to look for another shelter or sleep in the open.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0078.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The court proceeding revealed that Mallelo was keeping eight boys in similar bondage. He gave the boys shelter and food for one dollar a week. Investigations are continuing. It is to be hoped that charitable people will be found to take care of the little Italian slave.</p>
