Merriam, who spoke against the defamers of Italy, the one-time candidate for mayor, Sweitzer, who was very much applauded when he said that the city had named a park after Columbus, and that a monument is to be erected to this great Italian, and Harry B. Millier, who represented Mayor Thompson, and expressed the Mayor's regret at being unable to attend the banquet. A. Gualano was the official Italian speaker of the evening. Judge B.
