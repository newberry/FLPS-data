<title level="a">PATRIOTISM OF LOUIS CARNOVALE IN THE VINDICATION OF HENRY TONTI</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The tireless efforts of Louis Carnovale of Chicago in behalf of giving due recognition to figures in American history of Italian birth or origin, came to light recently when he succeeded in having the apotheosis of "Henry de Tonti, Frenchman," promoted and prepared by the Illinois Society of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America and sponsored by the Chicago Historical Society, changed to an apotheosis of "Enrico Tonti, Italian." Carnovale has written a pamphlet in which he clearly states his research and discovery of Tonti's time and national origin. No other historian or man of letters has been capable of vindicating the Italian origin of Tonti as well as Carnovale, and of exposing the motives of justice and gratitude that should urge the Americans to honor and perpetuate the memory of the great Italian explorer, Enrico Tonti.</p>
   <p>In the pamphlet he refers the Society to the various sources substantiating his claims. Among them are Francis Parkman's La Salle and the Dixcovery of the Great West, and the biographical sketch of Tonti in the American <pb facs="5425702_2_0641.jpg" n="2"/>Encyclopedia, Vol. XXVI, p. 690.</p>
   <p>A copy of this pamphlet was also sent to the Chicago Historical Society, Mayor Dever, Governor Len Small, and the leading dailies of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Besides his efforts in affirming the Italian origin of Tonti, he also wrote a letter to Mayor William E. Dever of Chicago suggesting that Wacker Drive be changed to Tonti Boulevard. He made the same proposal to Governor Small.</p>
   <p>His patriotism did not obtain for him all that he desired, but he was able to have corrected a historical error, and the fact that the Chicago newspapers have recognized Enrico Tonti as an Italian is of no little consequence.</p>
   <p>At the last moment we learn from the authoritative source of the Couriere D'America (New York), that the proposal of Carnovale to give Tonti's name to one of the leading boulevards in Chicago has been seconded by Mayor Dever and that it will soon be a fact.</p>
