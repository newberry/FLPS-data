  <body>
   <p>His father died when Lawrence was under five years of age. He was educated in the parochial schools and then took a course at Joseph Medill High School. He went to work in a real estate office after leaving school, and soon acquired considerable business experience in the Italian colony. He spent considerable time educating the Italian people in the ideals of home ownership. For several years, he has been specializing in suburban property and in selling small houses.</p>
   <p>Many Italian families knew his father as their friend - a man whom they could trust with their savings, and who gave them sound advice in investment matters. They place the same confidence in his son Lawrence, who recommends the purchase of small houses with gardens in the rear.</p>
