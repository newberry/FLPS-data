  <body>
   <p>The trial of the Blackhands which is taking place in the Federal court, presided over by Judge Mack, continued yesterday with the deposition of Nicola Braccio, main witness for the prosecution.</p>
   <p>Under oath, the Italian told the following story: "Last year on the night of June 25, following the release of several members of the gang. I was standing in front of my residence and holding a baby in my arms, when a closed car sped by, and from the interior two shots were fired in my direction. Fortunately, both I and the baby were unhurt." Referring to the persecution to which he was subjected, the witness said: "I was notified to deliver $2,000 on the evening of July 11. Two members of the gang were to come to my father's home at 2625 Princeton avenue."</p>
   <p>The government agents who had been notified, were waiting in ambush for them and as the gangsters received the cash, they were arrested. Those who received the money were Nicola and Pasquale Zanniello, two brothers. The <pb facs="5425702_2_0058.jpg" n="2"/>twelve are: Frank Russo, indicted as the leader of the gang. Vito Petruzzi, Marco La Pena, Nicola Zanniello, Pasquale Zanniello, Filippo Martello, Eugenio Martello, Lucia Naponiello, Nick Salerno, Vito Rubino and Joe Rubino.</p>
   <p>The verdict will surely be given in the early part of next week.</p>
