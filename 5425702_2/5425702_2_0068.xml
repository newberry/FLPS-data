   <p>The Chicago Police are elated over the arrest of four Italians accused of being leaders in the so-called Black Hand organization in Chicago. The men are Carlo Morazzi, Guglielmo Lorenzoni, Giovanni Morici and R. Romacciotti, who was found in the home of Morazzi.</p>
   <p>Morici, Lorenzoni, and Morazzi, are thought to be the founders of the organization in New York, where they extorted thousands of dollars from wealthy Italians before the New York Police caught up with them. They were released on bail and immediately fled the country. On their return to America they continued their nefarious practices in Chicago until their arrest. Last week, police were notified that three were attempting to extort money from a wealthy Italian. On the basis of this information, they arrested Lorenzoni, who when questioned by the police, gave an evasive answer. While under this inquisition he made a dash for the door through which he ran, with policemen and detectives fast on his heels.</p>
