  <body>
   <p>The Supreme Convention of the Order of the Sons of Italy in America will be held at the Medinah Club from October 22 to October 26.</p>
   <p>This shows that the Grand Lodge of Illinois, headed by Grand Venerable G. Spatuzza, is held in high consideration by the grand lodges of the eastern States, where the Order has been firmly established for the last thirty years.</p>
   <p>The convention will be attended by delegates from every State in the Union and from Canada by the grand venerables of the State lodges, and by such distinguished personages as Attorney S. Miele of New York, supreme venerable, Judge Alessandroni of Pennsylvania, Attorney Catinella, and Judge F. Pecora of New York.</p>
   <p>The lodges of Illinois are cooperating with the Grand Lodge for the success of the convention, on the outcome of which depends the future development of the Order.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0479.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of Illinois is organizing a program of entertainment for the supreme officers and delegates in order to make their short stay in Chicago enjoyable and to alternate work with pleasure.</p>
   <p>The official banquet will be served on Sunday evening, October 24, at the Medinah Club and will be honored by the presence of the Italian ambassador, S. E. Suvich, the governor of Illinois, the mayor of Chicago, and a representative of the Federal government.</p>
   <p>On that evening every student of Italian extraction who has graduated in 1937 in Chicago or its vicinity will be an honorary guest.</p>
