   <p>Vincent E. Guarno, the son of Angelo and Jessamine Guarno, was born in Salerno, Italy in 1884, and came to Chicago in 1896.</p>
   <p>His education included music, in which he became exceptionally proficient, and this art is still his principal diversion from commercial life.</p>
   <p>Mr. Guarno became an active factor in the realty marts as a salesman in 1912, for the largest organization in Chicago. At the end of seven years, he had attained one of the topmost positions in the concern - an appraiser in the inheritance tax department of Illinois.</p>
   <p>For several years past, he has directed the operations of his own company, Vincent E. Guarno &amp; Co., handling diversified realty investments, including several highly successful subdivisions.</p>
   <p>The most noteworthy developments of his company comprise property in Beverly Hills, Marquette Park, Summit Park, Argo, Jefferson Park, Forest Glen, Deerfield, and his current improvement of Woodland Manor.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_1079.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>With phenomenal prescience, he has parceled tracts that quickly become intensely alive with home-owners and business houses. Marquette Park, completely sold out, has enhanced from 400% to 1,000% within three years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Guarno is a consistent participant in civic affairs. He is another laudable man of Italian nativity who forged his way to a position commanding the respect of the citizenry of all races.</p>
