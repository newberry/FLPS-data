   <p>Once more we have the opportunity to unmask to the ingenuous and honest public, the shameless hypocrisy of Reverend Teta and his satellites. For some time, the clerical element in this ward has busied itself soliciting donations in order to raise $2,000, which, added to the $8,000, promised by Monsignor the Bishop, would be sufficient to cover the cost of enlarging the church of St. Michael.</p>
   <p>We have occupied ourselves at other times with the unfair methods used by the unscrupulous local clergy in spearing from the pockets of the ingenuous public, some of those pieces of money which Reverend Teta loves with all his heart.</p>
   <p>But let us come to the point. For the past few weeks, we have noticed placards announcing; "Grand bazaar and raffle for the benefit of St. Michael <pb facs="5425702_2_0575.jpg" n="2"/>Church, from Monday October 6, to October 11,--1913; five valuable prizes will be awarded."</p>
   <p>Naturally curious, we hied ourselves to the hall, where we could be spectators to the dishonest drawing of the prizes. One prize, a piano,-still in the factory-, had the good fortune, by the will of God and the Committee, to be won by Father Giangrande, pastor of the Church of Saint Phillip Benizi. The second prize, a diamond ring, was won by the lady organist and director of the choir of this [same] church. Third prize, a lavaliere, was won by a reverend whose name escapes us. Before this evident mystification, the audience justifiably remonstrated to the committee. The priest, in words that were far from dignified, answered that luck so wished it. The man who had been extracting the winning numbers was removed and another put in his place. The last two prizes were then won by people other than priests, and so the public was satisfied. During the first nights of the bazaar, the attendance was rather heavy, and consisted of the faithful and devout, with <pb facs="5425702_2_0577.jpg" n="3"/>a following of young girls and boys drawn by the dancing which the priest had wisely made a part of the attraction of the bazaar. The hall was transformed for the occasion into a shop for the sale of church items, such as [replicas of] madonnas and saints, and other objects the committee had acquired by begging for funds among the zealous and devout of the colony.</p>
   <p>All these things were being raffled during the dance by certain young ladies of the church, the priest having been advised by someone with experience that this was the best method of acquiring contributions from youths who might otherwise be reluctant to contribute. Eh! bravo Father Teta; we must acknowledge your shrewdness and astuteness in this matter; you are not like your predecessor of bad [reputation] who, unwilling to adapt himself to the exigencies, bravely stripped saints and madonnas and went in search of a more profitable flock. You, instead, show yourself more humble and benign towards your sheep in order to better shear them.</p>
   <p>Truly, these are the tactics which you ought to use in all your enterprises; <!-- 5425702_2_0576 omitted, duplicate of 5425702_2_0578 --><pb facs="5425702_2_0578.jpg" n="4"/>but, unfortunately for you, we are always ready and on hand to unmask your underhanded actions.</p>
