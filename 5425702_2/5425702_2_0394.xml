   <p>The banquet sponsored by the Italian colony of Chicago, in commemoration of the birth of Rome, was held the evening of April 22, in the grand ball room of the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>The banquet room was crowded. Hon. Henry Horner, Governor of Illinois, delivered a wonderful speech in which he paid a tribute to the Consul General, Dr. Joseph Castruccio, for the new honor which was bestowed upon him by the Italian government which nominated him "Commendatore" of the Order of the Crown.</p>
   <p>Hon. Imburgio, our Supreme President, acting as toast-master, introduced the guests of honor and the speakers of the evening.</p>
   <p>Hon. Michael Rosinia, city prosecutor, representing the mayor of Chicago, Hon. Kelly, delivered a speech with a verve which distinguishes him as an expert orator, and he was followed by Prof. C. Decaro, teacher of languages at Northwestern University.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0395.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chev. Dr. A. Pagano made, in his speech, a brief review of the merits and military and diplomatic career of our popular Consul General, Dr. Castruccio.</p>
   <p>At the end the new "Commendatore," Dr. Castrauccio, moved by the tribute paid to him, in thanking everyone, expressed his gratitude to the Italian colony of Chicago and closed his speech extolling the king and the duce.</p>
   <p>During the banquet the well-known orchestra of Tony Nuzzo of radio station K.Y.W. entertained with a selected musical program. Mrs. Frida Savini sang a number of operatic arias. Tony Caboock, well-known star of N.B.C. entertained with popular songs.</p>
   <p>The banquet was followed by a dance.</p>
