  <body>
   <p>We have learned that many of our countrymen have manifested a desire to subscribe for the new loan floated by the Italian government. The Banco di Napoli (Bank of Naples) has arranged for subscriptions on the national debt, to be made through the First Dearborn National Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The conditions of this loan are very advantageous; therefore every Italian should profit by this opportunity to invest their savings in a manner that produces a good rate of interest, together with an absolute guarantee of their capital.</p>
   <p>Because of the high exchange rate on American money, investors will receive not less than 51/2% on their investments, which represents a rate of interest superior to that which is obtained from a Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>It is certain that the value of the Italian lire will be raised as soon as the war ends.</p>
   <p>Loan bonds purchased will considerably increase in value; in fact, do not be surprised if a bond of 1,000 lire, now worth $140.80, will later increase to $175.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0966.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The privilege of subscription is restricted to members of Italian nationality, so that the expenses in this historic period of its national life might be provided by its people and not by other foreign governments.</p>
