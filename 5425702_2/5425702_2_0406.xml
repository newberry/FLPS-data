   <p>That powerful organization, the Italo-American National Union, again took the initiative this year in the celebration of Columbus Day, October 12, with a patriotic demonstration at Navy Pier.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Vitelle, the indefatigable first supreme vice president, along with other officers of the organization, worked hard for the success of the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Hon. Bernard Barasa, president of the organization, acted as chairman, Speeches were made by the Italian consul general, by Professor W. L. Bullock of the University of Chicago, by Professor John Landescu of Northwestern University, by the Honorable F. Allegretti, judge of the municipal court, and by Professor Albachiara of Crane College.</p>
   <p>The musical program was rendered by the Ianu Band under the leadership of Maestro Terzulli.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the organization's hymn, composed by Dr. Sebastiano Ingrao, was <pb facs="5425702_2_0407.jpg" n="2"/>sung for the first time. The ceremony was attended by members of forty-seven lodges of the Italo-American Union and by representatives of other societies, by clergymen, by the Knights of Columbus, and by a large number of Italians from all parts of the city and from surrounding towns.</p>
   <p>This Columbian celebration was a great and important success and evinced once again the patriotism of the Italians of Chicago.</p>
