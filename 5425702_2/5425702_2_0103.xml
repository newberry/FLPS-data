  <body>
   <p>Under the Presidency of Chevalier Italo J. Canini the assembly offered the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, the purpose of the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago is to increase the Italo-American commerce and to create a better understanding between America and Italy, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the necessary campaign against crime in the City of Chicago and Cook County must be absolutely welcome to any decent citizen, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is reported from many sources that sometimes this campaign is degenerating into an unfair treatment to innocent Italian people, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the absolute and very large majority of the Italian people in Chicago and Cook County are law-abiding citizens worthy of esteem and respect, and</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0104.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Whereas, any race prejudice is against the real spirit of Americanism and of the American Constitution, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is unfair that for the faults of one per cent, the other ninety-nine per cent must suffer discredit and damage, therefore</p>
   <p>Be it Resolved, that this Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago is in accord with the authorities of this city and county for a fair and energetic campaign against crime and criminals, without discrimination of race, and</p>
   <p>Be it further Resolved, that this Chamber of Commerce invites the people of Chicago and Cook County to discriminate between law-abiding citizens and violators of the law, and to ask that the people of Chicago and Cook County continue to give their support to the Italian people, who in the majority of cases, are entitled to esteem and respect.</p>
