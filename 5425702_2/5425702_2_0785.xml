   <p>At one of the most solemn demonstrations of its kind, Italians in Chicago welcomed one of the many Italians, who, with "Il Duce", are taking Italy through a period of reconstruction, General Italo Balbo, Under-Secretary of Aviation in the Fascist Cabinet. He was accompanied by Italians, who are world famous in aeronautical science.</p>
   <p>It is not the responsibility of this Bulletin to chronicle this event, suffice it to say, that the crowd which filled the Grand Banquet Hall of the Palmer House to overflowing, clamorously applauded this Italian statesman and his fleet. It was also a personal ovation for the new Italian Consul, Chevalier Castruccio.</p>

   <p>The majority of the members of the Italian Chamber of Commerce residing in Chicago were present, as well as many Italian-Americans of the commercial and industrial world of Chicago. The Italians from the Chicago Civic Opera Association were Maestro Giorgio Polacco, and the singers Lazzari and Montesanto. Mayor William Hale Thompson and Governor Len Small sent representatives and the guest of honor were summoned by officers of the Army and Navy of the United States.</p>
   <p>Former Consul for Chicago, Conte Giulio Bolognesi, served as Toastmaster. Father Giovanni Peona, ex-Army Chaplain in the World War, offered a short prayer.</p>
   <p>The success for the celebration was due to the tireless effort of Acting Consul, Chevalier Antonio Ferme.</p>
