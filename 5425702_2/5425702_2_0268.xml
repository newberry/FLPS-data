  <body>
   <p>The commission also resolved to support bill S4352, introduced by Senator Medill McCormick, by which importers would be reimbursed to the amount overpaid as custom duty, when the new tariff was enacted, on merchandise actually arrived in the United States prior to September 22, 1922, and destined for a Port of entry other than the Port of first arrival, with a circular-letter sent to the Senators and Representatives from Illinois in Washington, begging them to give consideration and support to this bill. The following is the letter sent:</p>
   <p>Sir:</p>
   <p>We beg leave respectfully to urge your support of bill S - 4352, introduced by Senator Medill McCormick, to grant relief from unjust discrimination against importers at Ports of entry, other than Ports of first arrival, <pb facs="5425702_2_0269.jpg" n="2"/>under Section 319, of the Tariff Act of 1913, on merchandise actually arriving in the United States prior to September 22, 1922, and destined for a Port of entry other than the Port of first arrival.</p>
   <p>Interior importers who by reason of delays arising in transportation, and other causes, were unable to clear their shipments through their local Custom House before the new Tariff became effective, although the same had reached the Port of first arrival before September 22, 1922, have been placed at a disadvantage as against importers who entered their shipments at the Port of first arrival. In order to secure relief from this injustice, we therefore earnestly bespeak your approval of the bill in question.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>(Signed)Chev. John Rigoli, president.</p>
  </body>
