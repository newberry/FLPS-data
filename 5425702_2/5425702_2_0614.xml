   <p>An Italian youth, Mr. Mike Scarlata, after a course of instructions at Little Rock, Arkansas, has been named officer in the Infantry of the United States Army.</p>
   <p>The new officer is twenty-two years old and the son of humble people; he owes his success entirely to his initiative. He was drafted into the army as a simple private. After a period of time he was admitted to the officers' training school from which he was discharged with the rating of second lieutenant.</p>
   <p>We are sure that Mr. Mike Scarlata will honor his country and himself. His parents, Antonio and Filippa Scarlata, who are living at 480 W. 20th street, may well be proud of their son for whom we express our best wishes for a safe and victorious return.</p>
