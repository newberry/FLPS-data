   <p>The Italian Consulate in Chicago sent us the following notes on its recent activities:</p>
   <p>On the tenth of this month, Italian Consul Franco Fontana drew the attention of local authorities to two films, "Spain in Flames" and "Defense of Madrid," that were to be shown at the Sonotone Theatre and Olivet Institute respectively. Both contained scenes offensive to Italy.</p>
   <p>The steps taken by the Consul General had the desired results since from the film "Spain in Flames" the parts offensive to Italy were removed. Circulars which had been printed to advertise the showing of the production were at the time taken out of circulation. The circulars read, "Thousands massacred by Fascists with Hitler-Mussolini Help." Projection of "Defense of Madrid" was prohibited entirely.</p>

   <p>We wish to advise the Italian colony of Chicago that a dance is being given by the Italian Consulate of Chicago at the 131 Street Infantry Armory, 16th Street and Michigan Avenue, May 22nd.</p>
   <p>The dance is to celebrate the following events:</p>
   <p>April 21st: Birth of Rome</p>
   <p>May 9th: Proclamation of the Italian Empire</p>
   <p>May 24th: Entrance of Italy into the World War</p>
   <p>The net proceeds will be used for the teaching of Italian in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Royal Consul General</p>
   <p>Franco Fontana.</p>
