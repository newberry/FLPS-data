   <p>Lending money to your mother country is like lending money to yourself. Every good citizen should never neglect this impelling duty to national solidarity and least of all should never neglect the Italians in America, whom, fortunately, the war has not imperiled as it did our brothers in Italy, and consider, while everyone worked and prospered in America, away from all danger and received high wages without taking away any comfort from life, our brothers, fathers, mothers, and children were exposed as martyrs of hunger and the elements.</p>
   <p>Their lives were always in constant danger. Over the unarmed cities the disloyal enemy spread its snare every moment of the day. Our soldiers fought on all the fronts offering to the holocaust their youth and their lives as the sublime cost for a greater Italy and the realization of a greater national dream for which many generations have fought and suffered without having it realized. They did not spare anything but offered everything. If we were to give all that we had we would still be doing less than that which the others have done. We are still strong and flourishing in a land over which, wealth amasses rapidly and we are once more able to fly with the wings of prosperity.</p>

   <p>Italy does not ask for donations. She only asks for your cooperation while offering a good business opportunity. The Italian victory loan is a secure investment and protected with all the national resources of a young nation with a very brilliant future in every branch of its activities. The loan carries 6% annual interest and like other loans, it is free of any further taxation.</p>
   <p>Unlike other loans, however, it can be redeemed and converted into cash at the end of five years. Therefore, it will be safeguarded from the instability of the exchange.</p>
   <p>Do not neglect to give this proposal your deepest consideration. For further information apply to the Banco Di Napoli Agency of Chicago, 906 S. Halsted or to the Italian Consul, 72 W. Adams St. Every Italian should help his country as a duty to national solidarity.</p>
