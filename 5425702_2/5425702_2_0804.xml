   <p>Regarding the gifts which the Italian colony of Chicago is presenting to King Victor and the Duce, Mussolini, the Italian Consul General, Mr. Zunini, writes us as follows:</p>
   <p>"The gifts which the Italians of Chicago and the Middle West are offering to His Majesty, the King and the Head of the Italian Government, are completed. They are really magnificent. The laurel crown is of solid gold with ten authentic rubies and the ribbon on the back is of platinum.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0805.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The Roman sword is of solid silver, platinum plated. The hilt is surmounted by an eagle's head of solid gold. All artistically wrought. These two pieces of art were created and designed by the eminent architect-painter, Mario Zacchi of the Daprato Statuary Company."</p>
   <p>The crown was made by the well-known firm, Venetian Jewelry Manufacturing Company of E. Toniatti with a shop at 35 E. Wacker Drive and Wabash Ave. The sword was made by an American firm which made some modification in the original design, spoiling its original beauty. Both articles were exibited in a show-window of Mandel Bros. Department Store on State Street.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova in congratulating Mr. Zacchi and Mr. Toniatti for their artistic skill wishes them many artistic and financial successes.</p>
