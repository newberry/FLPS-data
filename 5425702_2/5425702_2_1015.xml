   <p>I take this opportunity to profit by the hospitality offered to readers of La Parola and call your attention to a matter which should be of interest to you in your position as consul.</p>
   <p>As you very well know, a group of Italian women prominent in our colony, has formed a welfare society. That is all to our advantage except for a certain fact which come to my attention through an article in a Philadelphia paper a few months ago. It seems that the Chicago correspondent had requested an accounting of the funds received and expended, and that this accounting had not been given or had been given in a manner which left much to be desired.</p>
   <p>I recognize, my dear consul, the willingness and the honesty of these women, but there is much truth in the saying that women are long of hair and short of brains.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_1016.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nevertheless I turn to you in the hope that you will intervene in such a way as to reduce the amount of discussion to a minimum.</p>
   <p>Please be informed, my dear consul, that the Italian Women's Welfare Society has on hand the sum of $2000 without the colony's being aware of the identity of the person to whom this sun is entrusted or whether this person has given a sufficient bond as security. I am wondering whether this money has gone the way of the $500 raised at a picnic for the purpose of erecting an Italian hospital in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We do not distrust any one; we merely desire that the colony shall be kept informed of the facts. We, therefore, hope that you will hasten to intervene in this matter.</p>
   <p>I hope that you will achieve the desired results.</p>
   <p>Giuseppe Orrico.</p>
   <p>P. S. My next open letter to you will deal with the street Arabs of Chicago. -G.O.</p>
