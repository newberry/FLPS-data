   <p>The House Committee on Immigration voted recently by an overwhelming majority to report favorably the Burnett Immigration bill, in practically the same form and phrase as that employed in the similarly named measure which passed the 62nd Congress, only to be vetoed by President Taft.</p>
   <p>President Taft's reasons for the veto were that the measure contained the objectionable literacy test for incoming aliens. This paragraph has been retained in the bill in practically the same form as in its predecessor.</p>
   <p>The statistics of the Immigration Bureau for 1911 show that, of more than 1,200,000 immigrants coming to this country, about 800,000 were of Slavonic, 400,000 of Latin and 70,000 of all others combined. The literacy test clause of the Immigration bill, therefore, principally affects the people of Latin and Slavonic nations. Many of these people have been denied the opportunity of learning to read, but this clean peasant stock, from the standpoint of the biologist and eugenist is preferable, from which to <pb facs="5425702_2_0675.jpg" n="2"/>propagate the future American, to the descendants of some of the inhabitants of the congested cities of Europe who like as not are afflicted with diseases incident to unhealthful occupations and to the vices of the underworld.</p>
   <p>More important than the literacy test is the Wasserman test of the blood. Mendel's law of heredity points to the importance of breeding the dominant rather than the recessive. Dominance in human breeding is not the result of literacy capacity but of a healthy, clean and honest heredity.</p>
   <p>It is better for the future generations to admit to our land the dominant, who cannot read, than the recessive who may come with the diploma of the best university of Europe in his hands. The sons of the former will be presidents of our universities; the sons of the latter, inmates of the alms-house, insane asylum, and penitentiary.</p>
   <p>Chief Justice Olson of the Municipal Court of Chicago, recently related the following story: A negro in Chicago, whose first name is Ike, used <pb facs="5425702_2_0676.jpg" n="3"/>to complain to me that he was born in slavery and could not read nor write. He had a good mind in a sound body and was capable and successful. Finding it frequently necessary to commiserate with him, I finally printed out to him that he was more fortunate than perhaps he realized. "Ike," I said, "if you were a stick of wood in the lumber-yard, which would you rather be, a piece of solid mahogany in the rough or a piece of polished mahogany full of worm-holes?" Ike saw the point and never complained again, but was proud of the fact that he was dominant.</p>
   <p>When a man came out in the steerage of a vessel from Europe to America one-hundred and fifty years ago, he was "a settler" or "a colonist," today he is called an "immigrant." Nobody ever proposed that "a settler" or "a colonist" wishing to land on American soil, should be excluded because he could not read nor write. Had such a ruling been enforced some generations ago, it would have nipped a goodly number of our best families in the bud.</p>
   <p>We do not know how far back in their family histories a majority of congressmen and senators would have to go before they ran into illiteracy, but <pb facs="5425702_2_0677.jpg" n="4"/>reasonable patience would reward them all with success at length. If this were a reflection upon anybody we should not mention it here. Since it is not, the reminder may serve a good turn. The most dangerous visitors from Europe to America are perfectly qualified to pass a test in reading and writing. Under the proposed law they will come and go at will while tens of thousands who seek only an opportunity to apply their industry in wholesome labor will be sent back over the ocean.</p>
   <p>We have a cure for illiteracy in our public schools, and in every immigrant family there is a passionate desire to embrace that opportunity. Exclude the physically and morally unfit, if you will, but do not put up the bars against the untaught of Europe who still look to America as a land of refuge and opportunity.</p>
