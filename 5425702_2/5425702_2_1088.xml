   <p>On August 23, an open meeting was held at Drills Hall, to select three delegates to the Colonial Congress in Rome. The following precedure took place at the meeting:</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Andrea Russo, Acting Chairman in the absence of John Zucca, who was ill. The minutes were read and the roll was called by the Secretary.</p>
   <p>The Italian Consul, Guido Sabetta, was then chosen Honorary President of the Committee, which select the three delegates for the Colonial Congress in Rome. It was ruled to do away with any applause to save time. The Italian Consul, Sabetta, then spoke of the benefit to be derived by the Italian colonists from the Colonial Congress.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_1089.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Russo explained the reason for the meeting which was to select three men to represent the Italian Colony at the Colonial Congress and what was to be expected of those men. He also mentioned the expense of the trip.</p>
   <p>The nomination for the candidates who are to go to the Colonial Congress in Rome was then opened by the Executive Council. Mr. Emanuelo, a representative of the Unione Siciliana Society, then moved that they have an informal way of voting which was seconded. Mr. Leone offered the name of Mr. Di Benedetto as a fellow delegate. This proposition was well received. Mr. Leone then proposed that the Secretary of the Executive Council be given some consideration for the work that he has done. Prof. Beduschi suggested that the Secretary to given the funds that might remain after all the expenses were paid. That proposition was also unanimously approved.</p>
   <p>Two other propositions were favorably accepted: 1. That the Executive Council remain in existence until the reunion which is to be held on the return of the delegates from Rome. 2. That the members of this same Council accompany the delegates as fellow delegates. The President added that if this proposal were to be approved, he would be pleased to join with the delegates of the Chicago Colony and take part with them in the Congress, and in consequence the delegates <pb facs="5425702_2_1090.jpg" n="3"/>to the first congress of Italians in foreign lands will be made up of the following:</p>
   <p>Official Delegates: Messrs. G. Mirabella, O. Mariotti, and C. Zangrandi.</p>
   <p>Fellow Delegates: Messrs. S. Benedetti, G. Zucca, A. Russo, G. Figali, F. Cuneo, M. Mastrogiovanni, Dr. A. Lagorio, and Dr. Camillo Volini.</p>
