   <p>After a silence of weeks caused by the lack of space, due to important articles which had to be published, I again turn to you.</p>
   <p>What do you think of the elections in Italy, Mr. Consul? Certainly you must have been satisfied, although not as satisfied as you would have been had the results been in accordance with the wishes of the Tribuna Transatlantica. Unfortunately it did not go that way, and even I am content. Nevertheless, I would have liked it otherwise to a certain extent. For instance, I wish that brave exiled rebel, Amilcar Cipriani, had been elected from Pissolati. That would have been a slap in the face to King Victor Emmanuel - who exiled him.</p>
   <p>And yet, Cipriani is one of those who has given us a fatherland - not one of those who today are enjoying themselves at the expense of the ignorant majority.</p>

   <p>It is time that the nationalists attribute a great merit to their king and call him the best crowned-head of any state in Europe. Further, they say that no other dynasty in Europe has done what the House of Savoy has accomplished in fifty years.</p>
   <p>I think I can give a practical example of the benefits which the Italian people have derived from the Savoy Government. On a railroad construction job in Illinois, three hundred Italians were employed. On payday they met at an appointed place and as each received his pay he signed his name on the register. Of the three hundred, only one, to the honor and glory of the Italian Government, could sign his name. Then the paymaster, in admiration of this one phenomenal worker, gave him a cigar. The others filled the register with crosses, until it looked liked a graveyard filled with crosses of the House of Savoy.</p>
   <p>Speaking of the civilization of the Arabs, I have this to tell you. A few years ago, 742 Forquer St. was occupied by a saloon, the owner of which was <pb facs="5425702_2_1007.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. Barase, a scoundrel with a false reputation for honesty and president of a number of societies. When I had occasion to pass by this place, I saw persons of both sexes enter; the women, for the most part, were old. I could not conceive what business might cause them to frequent such a place. One day my curosity got the best of me. I decided to enter and investigate for myself. I saw that these persons, instead of stopping at the bar, walked to the back - room. I presumed that someone was ill, and considering the reputation of that personage, Mr. Barase, decided that the sick person must be of his family. I asked him who was sick, but he, removing his hat, answered, "No one is sick, thank God; there is a statue of San Donato there and these people come here to say their prayers before it, since he is one of the most miraculous saints." I asked for permission to view the saint, and Mr. Barase graciously consented, so I entered. The room has been transformed into a chapel. A statue, weighing close to a half-ton, was placed on a table. At each side of the statue stood an unlighted candelabra. The only light was from an oil lamp set in a glass. Before the statue stood a spitoon not for the Saint's use, but to receive the alms of the faithful.</p>

   <p>For kneeling benches, two old macaroni boxes were being used. But what was more interesting was to see a screen which was set up to cover the statue. This screen or curtain, perhaps to give a sample of Italian and Catholic cleanliness, was a bed sheet, which from all appearances had not been washed for two months preyious to being removed from the bed. It had red and green spots, and had it not been for the grime it could have been used for an Italian flag.</p>
   <p>Since then, the location of the statue has been changed. It can now be found in the Bacigalupo Undertaking Parlors, at 753 Forquer St.</p>
