   <p>An Evangelical pilgrimage to Italy has always been our desire. We have received a circular from brother Rev. Moncada of New York which proposes a crusade to Italy, It meets with our enthusiastic approval and sincere praise.</p>
   <p>The event is not touristic in character. It gives Italians of any creed the opportunity of seeing again their charming and blessed land of origin, transformed by the strenuous efforts of a restoring government; to go back and see again and embrace your dear one; it has, above all, a great patriotic meaning since it will bring to light the Evangelists, who in accomplishing, in this country, their noble mission of faith, do not omit any opportunity to prove their sentiments of Italisnism.</p>
   <p>We share with pleasure this crusade of Christian faith.</p>
   <p>The circular received reads as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0753.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Evangelists! The voice of our fatherland and humanity calls us so that we may express our message of Christian salvation not as a rhetoric formula but as a regenerating power which will transform the present, corrupted and bewildered society and guide it toward the sublime summits of Christianity.</p>
   <p>The epic history of the Evangelic faith in our fatherland, is written in gold type.</p>
   <p>The Italians, always first in every branch of human knowledge, are taking the lead in the preservation of the Evangelical Apostolic thought.</p>
   <p>When others were groping in the darkness of Paganism, and when, Evangelists or Protestants were not in existence in other nations, Italy had its apostles who were not kneeling before "false and lying Gods" they, despite persecution, kept alive the flame of the Gospel.</p>
   <p>"LUX LUCET IN TENEBRIS" - the same light which still glitters from the Alps to Sicily, from America to Africa all enveloping with the warmth of holy love the <pb facs="5425702_2_0754.jpg" n="3"/>hearts and enlightening the minds and souls with its eternal saving truth.</p>
   <p>This faith is calling us to a common bond of flesh and spirit - the gentle latin blood and is painting for us the blessed land of our ancestors and of our fathers-Italy. There where St.Paul, in chains, gave his spiritual ideas, leaving a good memory of himself, and sealing it with the martyrdom of the splendid Christian faith.</p>
   <p>Our great Italy is leading,not only in Statesmenship, Science, and Art, but also with its men of Evangelical faith who throughout the countries have been a beacon light in the dark from the Apostolic Era to the present day, we have a large number of prophets, heroes and martyrs: Valdo, Achino, Savanarola, Vergerio, Curione, Carnesecchi, Arnaud, Giavanello and even Dante, Marsilio Da Padova, Mazzini and Cavour. Thousands of others were killed on the field of honor in the last war.</p>
   <p>From the valley of the Piedmont to the canals of Venice which hold the sighs of the martyrs; from the historical squares of Florence and Rome to the mountain of <pb facs="5425702_2_0755.jpg" n="4"/>Calabria, where are engraved the achievements of the heroic in faith; from the reefs of Syracuse, where rested the people's Apostle to the reefs of Quarto from which the "Hero of the two world's" (Garibaldi) weighed anchor in his conquest of Italian independence; it is the spirit of our ancestors which calls to us, which invites us.</p>
   <p>Evangelists - they are calling to us, they invite us to visit our Italy where is to be found their eternal spirit, where we can strengthen our souls.</p>
   <p>The Evangelical Pilgrimage planned for this summer, will start from New York July 19th and will return from Naples Aug. 30th. In all a trip of fifty-two days dedicated to a vacation, to rest, to the fatherland and to the faith.</p>
