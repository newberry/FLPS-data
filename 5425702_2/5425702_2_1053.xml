  <body>
   <p>This newspaper wishes to introduce to the Italian Colony the new Italian Consul, Count A. L. Rozwadowski. The Italian government has selected the new Consul and we accept him with very much satisfaction.</p>
   <p>He is courteous to everyone, and has pleasing ways. He is a perfect gentleman, and has everything necessary for a Consul, and in the end he will have everyone respecting Italy and its laws.</p>
   <p>Count A. L. Rozwadowski has a Polish name but is Italian by naturalization. He was born in Constantinople in 1850 and began his consular career in 1872. He was sent to Alexandria Egypt during the time of its revolution. He also held office in the Foreign Minister's Cabinet in 1882.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_1054.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was Consul in Susa and was transferred to Chicago from Sao Paolo, Brazil. He was given the choice of two posts, one in Havana and the other in Chicago. He chose Chicago.</p>
   <p>Count Rozwadowski is a member of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Commander of the Medidich Turks Order, Officer of Osmannieh, and also holds officer's grade in the Nesham Iftickar Turks Order.</p>
   <p>The Consul's family has accompanied him to Chicago.</p>
