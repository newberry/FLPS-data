   <p>Immediately after reading the exhortation to the directors of all Italian American newspapers and to all Italians living in America, Merritt Starr, who presided and who opened the commemoration of the six hundredth anniversary of Dante's death with his talk, "Dante Six Hundred Years After," the evening of January 3, 1921, at the Chicago Literary Club, wrote Prof. Luigi Carnovale the following letter:</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>February 24, 1921.</p>
   <p>My Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I am honored in receiving in 'de luxe' edition your very complimentary notice of the celebration by the Chicago Literary Club of 600th anniversary of the completion of Dante's life. I cannot say "and of his works" for though he rests from his labors, his works exert an influence which eternity alone can measure.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0416.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is eminently fitting for the upwards of two and a half millions of people of Italian blood who live in America, and of whom I estimate that above 80,000 live in Chicago, and the similar and even greater numbers of the American people who have read Dante with exaltation and found him their spiritual hero should unite to commemorate this anniversary. If the small group of scholars and lovers of literature who meet at the Chicago Literary Club may have promoted such commemoration in any degree, its members will be greatly pleased, and I gladly indorse your proposal that the President be urged to proclaim September 14, 1921, a holiday to be known as Dante Memorial Day. I am with regards,</p>
   <p>Very truly,</p>
   <p>(Signed) Merritt Starr.</p>
