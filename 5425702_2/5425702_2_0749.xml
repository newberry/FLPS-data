   <p>A few days ago the presidents of all the Italian organizations in Chicago, as well as many prominent individuals, were called to a meeting by the Italian Consul.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the meeting was to coordinate the various efforts made by the Italian community of Chicago to effect a successful result to the excursion which the Italians and Italian associations of the Middle West will take through France, Greece and Italy, leaving New York, August 16, on the Saturnia, one of the best boats of the very Italian Cosulich (?) Line of Trieste.</p>
   <p>The Consul and the presidents of the associations deliberated on the plan of taking the Italian and American flags, which will be solemnly dedicated on Capitol Hill by His Excellency the Governor of Rome. The Consul assured those <pb facs="5425702_2_0750.jpg" n="2"/>gathered at his bidding that, to satisfy the many requests, he would be present at the ceremony as well as participate in the ceremonial receptions which the authorities of the kingdom have planned for the visitors in the various cities on the itinerary.</p>
   <p>Lack of space forbids our giving a complete list of the associations representatives and the individuals present. Suffice it to say that the most important associations were represented and the most prominent Italians in every walk of life were present.</p>
   <p>The official steamship line is the Cosulich (?) line where all information may be obtained.</p>
