   <p>Mother Francesca Laveria Cabrini, the founder of the Order of Sisters of the Sacred Soul, passed away last week at Columbus Extension Hospital, one of the many hospitals founded by her. She was endowed with exquisite qualities, intelligence and kindness of soul.</p>
   <p>F. Cabrini, was born in Italy on July 16, 1850. She founded the first Order of the Sacred Soul in Codogno 1880, obtaining spiritual support from the Pope Leon XIII. She came to New York in 1890, where she founded the first orphanage.</p>
   <p>In America, there are fifty seven institutions founded by her. Among them, hospitals, orphanages and schools. Mother Cabrini was an authority, not only in ecclesiastic, but also in political circles. Those who were fortunate to meet her know that she was a wonderful woman, full of energy.</p>
