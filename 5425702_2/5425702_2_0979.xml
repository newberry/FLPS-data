   <p>The Executive Council of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, immediately following the catastrophe in Italy, appealed to the Italian colony to form a colonial committee for the purpose of collecting funds from the Italians of this city and suburbs, for the benefit of victims of the recent earthquake.</p>
   <p>A colonial meeting was held January 20, in the Crystal Room of the Sherman Hotel. A great number of Italians attended the meeting. The Italian Consul, Conte Guilio Bolognesi, presided. He opened the nomination of candidates for the Executive Committee. The following were unanimously chosen:</p>
   <p>Cavalier Frank Cuneo, president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce; Dr. Camillo Volini, vice president; Bernardo P. Barasa, treasurer; Dr. Lagorio and Mr. Giovanni Rigali, lawyer; Alberto N. Gualano, secretary; and Mr. G. Rodighiezo, assistant secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0980.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first donations from among those present netted $1,265. The following day this sum was wired to the Italian Red Cross, Conte of Somaglia, through the Fort Dearborn National Bank.</p>
   <p>So the same day the Executive Committee met to decide on ways and means of carrying on the collection of funds. Subscription blanks were mailed to various members. To date these members have collected more than $6,000 of which $3,000 was sent to the Italian Red Cross and the remainder deposited in the Fort Dearborn National Bank.</p>
