   <p>Two Italian soldiers have departed from Chicago with the War Troops.</p>
   <p>One is Mr. Alfredo Durante, 20 years old, who is from the 1st infantry regiment, I. N. G.,Company K. He is the brother of the manager of this newspaper.</p>
   <p>The other, Mr. Luigi Greco, 18 years old, is a soldier from the 2nd infantry Regiment, I. N. G.</p>
   <p>The troops will leave for camp on first occasion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alfredo Durante sends the following message:</p>
   <p>"Our regiment was the first to arrive. At present we are camped at the Manufacturing Machine Building, in the vicinity of the pass, two miles from Springfield. The others followed shortly after, and now while I am writing there are more than 9,000 of us.</p>
   <p>"I do not think we will work today, but following tomorrow we will commence manoeuvering every day.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0619.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"In every station our train stopped, from the smallest to the largest, crowds of people ran forward to cheer us in every way.</p>
   <p>"We made a short stop at Farmer City and were greeted with the Farmer City Band.</p>
   <p>"I do not know whether it will be difficult to read this letter, as I wrote it, sitting in the grass, with too much sunshine."</p>
