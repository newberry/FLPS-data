  <body>
   <p>In the stink that is being raised by the current investigation into the graft activities of the Chicago Police Dept., the name of an Italian is brought to light.</p>
   <p>The Italian, Battista Pizzi, formerly of 396 S. Clark St. is now serving time in Joliet for placing a minor in a house of prostitution which he and his wife operated.</p>
   <p>The investigators, having gone to Joliet to question certain inmates as to their knowledge of graft in police circles, cross-examined Pizzi, who revealed that he had paid certain members of the Harrison Ave. Police Station, $300.00 after his arrest, and for that sum was assured that he would not have to stand trial for the crime of which he was accused.</p>
   <p>He actually believed that he had bought complete immunity from any further <pb facs="5425702_2_0173.jpg" n="2"/>contact with the law. But what was his consternation at discovering that these same persons finding him fertile soil to cultivate, made other demands for money with the threat of allowing the law to take its course were he to refuse.</p>
   <p>Whether Pizzi could not or would not continue the bribing, the fact remains that he was brought to trial and sentenced to Joliet. His wife who stood trial with him was also sent to prison.</p>
   <p>We would like to ask our American colleagues their reason for continually harping on the existence of a Mafia and Black Hand Society among the Italians and over-looking the actual graft that exists in, what is worse, the department of law and order.</p>
