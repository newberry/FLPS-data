   <p>The mission of this magazine is not to give prominence to articles that chronicle misdeeds and crime. The publicity given such material in certain papers creates the impression that the Italians are knife-wielders, thieves, delinquents, and generally depraved.</p>
   <p>The American newspapers seem to be trying to outdo each other to pin anything detrimental on the Italian race. They have special reporters who spend their time in writing articles on the delinquent, not with the aim of showing a better way, but for the purpose of satisfying the appetite of readers who feed their intellect by reading of crime and criminals.</p>
   <p>We, modestly, would like to suggest to the Italo-American press that it should desist from printing stories of misdeeds and, rather, concentrate <pb facs="5425702_2_0106.jpg" n="2"/>on publishing articles relating the doings of the many Italians who are truly honoring their race and adopted country. For our part, we have been doing that and shall continue doing it, thereby hoping to encourage deeds that are useful and good for the people among whom we live.</p>
   <p>Send us today, dear readers, the name of some Italian whom you know and esteem.</p>
   <p>We of the Vita Nuova wish to diffuse the truth that for every delinquent Italian there are hundreds who are law-abiding, and for every misdeed committed by an Italian there are thousands of good deeds performed by others of the race. When will the Italian press in this country cease to chronicle the misdeeds and crimes of our people?</p>
   <p>We desire always to publish in brief biographies the story of those who honor the name of Italy and America.</p>
