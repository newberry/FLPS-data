   <p>The sessions at 256 West Grand Avenue are still notorious. The cunning G. Lombardi, who gave up work in order to undertake the more profitable vocation of making the Holy Ghost descend into the bodies of his proselytes, is doing a big business. The dignified and obese Francesconi, acting as sacristan, continues to expand and to mumble, "May His holy name be praised!" The simpletons and their money are flowing into the shop which the Holy Ghost visits every day.</p>
   <p>Two weeks ago a poor woman made her way into this sanctuary, armed with a revolver, and threatened to commit a massacre unless they would let her son alone.</p>
   <p>This young man, ensnared by these up-to-date apostles, was giving them his money while he loafed, said prayers, and left his family destitute.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0581.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the 17th of last month the daughter of the old "garibaldino" Iorio (one of our dearest friends) demanded the arrest of her husband, Pasquale Capone; for he too, ensnared by the apostles, prays and speaks in the language of Pentecost, and gives his money to the venerable Lombardi, neglecting his wife, who has taken refuge in her father's house with her two children.</p>
   <p>Policeman Longobardi has been entrusted with this matter, and it is to be hoped that the indecent comedy will soon end.</p>
   <p>However, we shall continue to fight for a complete exposure!</p>
