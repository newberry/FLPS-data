  <body>
   <p>A man has been sent to Chicago as Italian Consul General to take the position occupied until recently by a "shadow." It was truly high time to discard all hesitations and subterfuges and substitute energy and loyalty.</p>
   <p>To colonial life, the Consul should bring, besides personal integrity, character and irreprehensible morality, an efficiency that will inspire, respect, revive the soul of the masses and insure impartial judgment on the part of American community; judgment which will result in admiration, if our efforts deserve it.</p>
   <p>Leopoldo Zunini, outgoing Consul General, lacked such qualities, and the salutary remedy of the Italian Government has met with the unanimous approval of the majority and better part of our community in Chicago. They are very grateful <pb facs="5425702_2_0788.jpg" n="2"/>to Il Duce for relieving the colony of a useless weight which obstructed its progress, and giving to it instead a dignified Consul General, who has been awarded the Gold Medal, a Consul of whom it can be proud.</p>
   <p>In Dr. Castruccio we see a promise for the accomplishment of the steady, admirable, and vast program of the New Italy.</p>
   <p>We have a strong faith in a man who, in a short time, won the esteem and admiration of the Italians of the Consulate in Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
   <p>Because of the disorder left by his predecessor, the task of Chev. Castruccio is more difficult, but his intelligence and extensive knowledge will enable him to overcome the difficulties, and we believe that the Consul General, above everything else, will make our community conscious of its strength, which strength, in the past, was wasted.</p>
   <p>We would like to enumerate the qualifications and proven abilities of Chev. Castruccio which make him so well fitted for the office, but we refrain, <pb facs="5425702_2_0789.jpg" n="3"/>because we are confident that in the near future there will be added to his brilliant career, new successes and more cheers, and then we shall have an opportunity for such an enumeration.</p>
   <p>We offer our sincere co-operation to the man who replaced a shadow.</p>
