  <body>
   <p>Through the medium of a daily, The New York Call, we are informed that Luigi Parenti has had his sentence commuted on condition that he return, with his family, to Italy at his own expense.</p>
   <p>Our dear friend has accepted the decision, which permits ninety days in this country, at the end of which he must surrender to the authorities for deportation.</p>
   <p>In giving the happy news to our comrades, friends, and readers, we invite them to continue their contribution of financial help to our friend, since under the circumstances in which Parenti finds himself, he will need a considerable sum to cover the expenses of the journey for himself and family.</p>
   <p>Our subscription for Parenti, therefore, is still open; those who have not as yet sent in their offerings, are begged to do so immediately.</p>
   <p>The amount raised by La Parola to date is $94.89.</p>
