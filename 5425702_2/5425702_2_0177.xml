   <p>Luigi Zionetti was arrested on a warrant issued by Judge Waterman and charged with having had people vote illegally in last November's elections. Cesero Marano voted under the fictitious name of Domenico Bruno, in the 18th precinct of the 19th ward, and is now in jail for being unable to post $1,000 bail. The Grand Jury found Marano guilty of fraud.</p>
   <p>When called before the Judge to testify against Zionetti, he claimed that he voted under a fictitious name, and twice at the instigation of Zionetti. After this evidence was given, the case was renewed on the following Monday, and Zionetti was put under $2,500 bail.</p>
   <p>Found guilty also, were another Italian and two Greeks.</p>
