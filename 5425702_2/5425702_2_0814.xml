   <p>The Italian Ambassador to Washington, Prince Gaetani, the hero of "Col di Lana," while passing through Chicago on his way to California, stopped off for a few hours.</p>
   <p>At the Baltimore &amp; Ohio depot to welcome him were the Comm. Leopolo Zunini, General Consul; Chev. John Rigali, president of the Chamber of Commerce; Chev. A. Ferrari and Chev. Joseph Rossi.</p>
   <p>Ambassador Gaetani was guest of the Chamber of Commerce at a luncheon at the La Salle Hotel, at which were present the most prominent people of our colony. Among the guests were representatives of the Mining Engineers Institute, headed by Messrs. Garcia and William Wright.</p>

   <p>The Red room of the hotel was decorated with American and Italian flags and the Ambassador, on entering, was greeted with applause. Ambassador Gaetani spoke in English describing the real position of Italy in the way of reconstruction, relating what Mussolini's government has accomplished, stating that the present Italian administration is supported by 34 per cent of Italy's population, while the American administration is supported by only 24 per cent.</p>
   <p>His Excellency described briefly the history of the condition of Italy before the advent of Mussolini, who succeeded in putting a stop to party struggles which hindered the work of reconstruction. He treated, competently, the labor question and he asserted that the Italians workers are satisfied with the present form of government which established an equilibrium between capital and labor, ending strikes which often are more damaging to the labor class than to the capitalists. Mentioning the Italian public debt, which amounts to billions, he asserted that it was reduced to 700 millions in almost one year of sound administration by Mussolini's government. The Ambassador's speech was applauded by the audience.</p>
