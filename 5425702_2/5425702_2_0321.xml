   <p>The Senate in Washington has approved the bill introduced by Senator Dillingham for the reform of the Immigration Law of 1903.</p>
   <p>In this bill, Senator Dillingham has considered the immigration problem not as a clear and plain social phenomenon but as a real economic fact. In other words, the immigration question, according to Senator Dillingham, is a labor problem, and concerns the invasion by alien labor.</p>
   <p>The Senate was loyal and agreeable to the American Federation of Labor and to the American Protective Association and many other associations who despise the immigrants in general, and the Italians and Catholics in particular. The American Federation of Labor is an organization that includes all the working people of the United States and they are against the immigrant workers. The American Protective Association is an organization so antagonistic to the Catholics that it would willingly renew the massacre of the Irish as in the time of Cromwell, or the tactics of the Inquisition of Spain.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0322.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The bill approved by the Senate must be passed by the House of Representatives. Every Italian society and every Italo-American citizen should send immediately, a telegram to the Congressman of his District and another to the Hon. Bennet (Congressman of New York) who is the champion of the immigration cause and who will fight strenuously against such reforms.</p>
   <p>The text of the telegram to be sent to your Congressman should read as follows: "I would like to submit and register an urgent protest in behalf of---Society, against the preposterous and anti-American Gardner Immigration Restriction Bill, especially the so-called educational test. It is certain to arouse the just resentment of all loyal Italian-Americans."</p>
   <p>The other telegram to be sent to Congressman Bennet should read as follows: "Both individually, and expressing the sentiment of business associates and friends in this state, I protest against the enactment of the absurd and malignant Gardner Bill for restriction of immigration. The so-called educational test is a mere pretext to cover intended discrimination against immigration from Italy and other Southern Latin countries."</p>
   <p>Italians! Wake Up! Now is the Time!</p>
