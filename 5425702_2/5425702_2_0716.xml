   <p>The Italian Consul General of Chicago, Dr. Carosi, adhering to the desire of the Italian Government, decided to organize an excursion of Italians and Italo-Americans to Italy, which will be called "Pilgrimage of Victory."</p>
   <p>It is not out of place to mention that since the Ethiopian Victory, each Italian liner sailing from America, is carrying a large number of Americans anxious to visit and admire Imperial Italy, triumphant in the conquest of Oriental Africa.</p>
   <p>It is a duty of the Italians of Chicago, bound to Rome with the sacred tie of blood, to pay a tribute of respect to the mother-land in this occasion.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0717.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Following the desire of Il Duce a committee of various societies was formed, under the auspices of the Italian General Consul, to prepare, in cooperation with the travel and touristic bureau, a program for a pleasant and complete trip to Italy at a very moderate cost.</p>
   <p>The itinerary was so planned so that the tourist will reach Rome on May 9, the day of the celebration of the Anniversary of the Victory, thus commemorating the birth of the new Roman Empire.</p>
   <p>We think it is the duty of every Italian to cooperate for the success of this undertaking and to take advantage of the opportunity to go to Italy at a very small cost and to enjoy the concessions extended by the Italian Government.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0718.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The excursion will start from Chicago April 15, 1937, and the program will end in Rome on May 12. The cost includes the expenses of the return trip to Chicago. The time limit can be extended over a period of two years.</p>
