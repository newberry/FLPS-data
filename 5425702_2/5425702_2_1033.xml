  <body>
   <p>At this time we publish that the Legislature of the State of Illinois has voted the sum of $10,000, to aid victims of the earthquake in Sicily and Calabrici. Governor Charles S. Deneen signed the legislative decree, thus legalizing the appropriation. Therefore, $10,000 more will be sent to relieve the suffering of our unfortunate countrymen.</p>
   <p>Governor Deneen has appointed an Italian Committee to handle this generous offer of the State, in Italy. The committee is composed of : Dr. Camillo Violini, Mr. Oscar Durante, director of L'Italia, and Mr. Orson Smith, president of the Illinois Red Cross and of the Merchants Loan Bank. Governor notified Mr. Durante of his appointment by the following letter:</p>
   <p>Mr. Oscar Durante</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_1034.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Today I have appointed you a member of the commission which is to receive from the Treasurer of the State of Illinois, and give to the agents authorized to distribute the funds raised for the relief of sufferers in the earthquake areas of Sicily and Calabrici, the sum of $10,000 appropriated for that purpose by the 46th General Assembly.</p>
   <p>Enclosed you will find a form for the oath which I beg you to sign and return to me, following which you will receive an official appointment.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Charles S. Deneen</p>
   <p>Governor.</p>
