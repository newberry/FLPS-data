   <p>The Grand Jury held De Bartolo guilty of attempted murder and turned him over to the criminal court for trial. His bonds were set at $1,500. The trial is set for the next session of the criminal court.</p>
   <p>The act of which De Bartolo is accused took place at the De Koven Hall, Oct. 6, 1894. The readers are by now familiar with the case. On that evening, Mr. Durante as president was presiding at a meeting of the McKinley Club, and surrounded by many distinguished Italians and Americans. The audience was composed of several hundred Italian workers.</p>
   <p>The meeting was being carried on in good order when De Bartolo broke past the door-keeper shouting threats of Black Hand vengeance at Mr. Durante, went upon the gallery of the hall, drew a gun, and fired at him point-blank.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0182.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His shot missed the gentleman's head by a few inches. De Bartolo was set upon by those around him, disarmed and beaten.</p>
   <p>A warrant for his arrest was issued the following day by Judge Bradwell, but Mr. Wickersham, lawyer for Mr. Durante, had the trial set for Judge Everett's court. He was held to the Grand Jury which last Wednesday, found him guilty of attempted murder as we have stated.</p>
   <p>The West Side Italians were rejoicing in the hope that De Bartolo will find himself behind the prison bars for many years to come.</p>
