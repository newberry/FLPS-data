   <p>The Garibaldi Legion, one of the oldest organizations in our colony, is planning a celebration for the patriotic date of September 20.</p>
   <p>It was the initiative of the Garibaldi Legion that not long ago erected the monument of the hero of two worlds which is located in Lincoln Park. The following is the Legion's appeal for the cooperation of other associations in favor of September 20:</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
   <p>We would like to remind you that September 20, of this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Rome as the capital of Italy. The Garibaldi Legion which aims to keep the love for the mother-country in the souls of our people, resolved at the last meeting to celebrate this occasion with a big celebration which will mark another page in the history of our colony as a glorious event.</p>
   <p>The society that you represent is invited to attend a rally which will take place Sunday June 13, 1920, 2 P. M., at the offices of the Italian Chamber <pb facs="5425702_2_0423.jpg" n="2"/>of Commerce, Room 1612 in the Masonic Temple, to discuss in further detail the celebration of the patriotic date of September 20, and at the same time to nominate the Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>We very much desire that you be present at this rally and will give your full cooperation.</p>
   <p>I Remain</p>
   <p>Joseph Bacci, of the Legion Garibaldi.</p>
