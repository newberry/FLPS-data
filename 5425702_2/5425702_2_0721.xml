   <p>On May 24, in the Sherman Hotel, the entire Italian community of Chicago, in an atmosphere of Italianism, celebrated the conquest of Ethiopia. The banquet given for this event by our organization, the sentinel of Italianism in America, succeeded once again in demonstrating the affection of the Italians for their motherland. More than 2,000 guests were present.</p>
   <p>The Supreme President, Philip D'Andrea, with noble forethought, asked all those present to stand for one minute, in honor of the heroes who had fallen in savage Africa.</p>
   <p>Chevalier V. E. Ferrara acted as toastmaster and introduced the various speakers of the evening.</p>
   <p>The speech delivered by Mr. Victor Watson, a real friend of the Italians and an admirer of our culture, was alone worth the price.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0722.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Hon. Rosina, City Prosecutor, representing the Mayor of Chicago, in his speech extolled the glories of Rome and praised the conquest of the new Empire.</p>
   <p>Consul General Dr. Carosi had words of praise for the Italian colony which was always ready to cooperate with him in every patriotic event. He lauded the activities of the committee for the success of the celebration which made May 24, 1936, a memorable date for the Italian community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The orchestra of Maestro Bruno Beghe played during the banquet, and the soprano, Rita Desimone, and the Tripoli Trio sang many operatic and popular songs.</p>
