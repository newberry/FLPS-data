   <p>William Parrillo is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Pasquale Parrillo. He was born in Chicago on Mar. 10, 1903. He was educated in the Chicago public schools and the University of Illinois, and is a graduate of the Kent College of Law.</p>
   <p>In 1927, he was appointed an assistant in the United States district attorney's office, and at that time held the position of being the youngest ever so honored.</p>
   <p>Mr. Parrillo devotes his time to grand jury investigations, liquor prosecution, with special supervision over the bond department. He is a member of both the Chicago and Illinois Bar Association; the Justinian Society of Advocates; and is president of his own ward republican club. Besides his active participation in party matters, his efforts are devoted to local Italian benevolent movements, gratis.</p>
   <p>His ability as a leader, speaker and organizer has been recognized in the many calls for his services on committees, receptions to notable visitors, banquets and quasi-public celebrations, particularly his activity in the recent Italian Armistice Day demonstration. His remarkable progress is indicative of an illustrious future.</p>
