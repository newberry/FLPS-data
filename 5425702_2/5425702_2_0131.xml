  <body>
   <p>The police of the West Chicago Ave. station are investigating the real cause of the robbery at the Western Savings Bank, 618 north Western Ave., owned by Frank Rito.</p>
   <p>According to the statement given by Rito, himself, he was alone in the bank Thursday at 1 P.M., when a man entered and asked to use the telephone.</p>
   <p>Almost immediately another man came in. Rito was preparing to wait on the first when in walked two more.</p>
   <p>All four made for Rito and gagged him before he could defend himself or cry for help.</p>
   <p>Alone. the four bandits commenced to work at the safe, and on getting more than $2,000. they fled.</p>
   <p>It took Rito more than an hour to free himself and call for help to his wife, who was in their apartment above the bank.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His first action was to telephone the Insurance Company, then he called the police.</p>
   <p>The search until now has proved fruitless.</p>
   <p>The fact that Rito had the prudence to insure for $5,000. against theft, gave the police a new clew on a motive for the robbery.</p>
   <p>All the suspicion seemed to vanish, though, in face of the good reputation Rito possesses.</p>
   <p>Not more than twenty-four hours after the robbery of the bank, another Italian Bank was held up. The amount found here was more, amounting to $6,500. in cash and $3,000. in jewelry. This second bank is the Herbitans Bank, 154 W. 22nd St., and Henry R. Pontoruo is owner.</p>
   <p>It was about 9:40 P.M. and Pontoruo was preparing to leave when two men entered. They leveled their guns at Pontoruo and three others,- Mr. Pontoruo's nephew, Salvatore Andezzone, Giovanni Rocco, Janitor, and his son, Frank. They did <pb facs="5425702_2_0133.jpg" n="3"/>not resist and were pushed into a closet under the stairs.</p>
   <p>The robbers lost no time in opening the safe, where they got the money and jewelry.</p>
   <p>The bandits escaped just as Frank Rocco freed himself from the rope with which he was bound, and ran down to the basement, in order to call his brother, who lives in the building.</p>
   <p>Pontoruo immediately went to the police station at 22nd St., where he was questioned. He declared to the police sergeant that for several weeks he had kept the money in the safe and remembered that only a few days ago he had refused to cash salary checks for several police agents, claiming that he did not have enough money in the bank.</p>
   <p>He was silent for a few seconds and then excitingly stated: "Seems as though there is some doubt on the truth about the robbery. The police should search and question the thieves and not me, the victim."</p>
   <p>He claimed that after the robbery he had only $1,500 deposited in a downtown bank, but could not possibly face his depositors who put $5,000 in his care.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0134.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He added, however, that he possessed $200,000. in real estate, but needed time to liquidate the property in the present depression. He finally assured them that every cent would be repaid his depositors.</p>
   <p>In the attempt against the bank, the usual indication of the "Black Hand" does not fail to show. In fact, about three days ago, Antonio Ouesto, part owner of the building in which the bank is located, was fatally wounded in its neighborhood. To the police the injury of Ouesto and robbery of the bank seem to be closely connected.</p>
