  <body>
   <p>Abusing American hospitality, some English emissaries headed by Rev. William Temple, Archbishop of York, are conducting hostile propaganda against Italy in order to influence public opinion in this country in favor of England and the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>Against this unfair English practice, impudently spread against the expressed desire of the American people to observe strict neutrality in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, the Grand Council has protested in the name of the Sons of Italy in America, an institution whose scope is to maintain friendly relations between America and Italy, and also in the name of a body of loyal American citizens.</p>
   <p>We are pleased to reproduce the resolution which was published in the most important newspapers in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0726.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, being apprised of certain assertions uttered by the Rev. William Temple, Archbishop of York and Primate of England, here in this country on a visit, did on the 17th day of December, 1935, adopt the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, it has come to the attention of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, that the Rev. William Temple, Archbishop of York and Primate of England, is here in this country to deliver a series of lectures, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, during the course of his lectures the Rev. William Temple among other things said, "England has never resorted to arms to expand her territory. She merely resorts to arms to protect her interests.</p>
   <p>"Great Britain has expanded through a spreading out of her commercial fields. Then, to protect these fields, she brings out an army. With England it is a case of commerce first and arms second. With Italy it is arms first and commerce second.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0727.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I am in favor of sanctions, both economic and military. The League of Nations is doing what it can but it will never do all it hopes to do until the United States becomes a member."</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is the opinion of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, that the utterances such as above alleged, let alone the fact that they are not true, for history disproves them, tend to create propaganda in swaying public opinion against Italy and in favor of England, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is the opinion of the members of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America that the lectures delivered by the Rev. William Temple also tend to dictate the foreign policies of our country, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is also the opinion of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, that visitors who come to this country should not abuse its hospitality by engaging in propaganda hostile to a nation with which our national relations are those of friendship and good will.</p>
   <p>Be it therefore resolved: That the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of the <pb facs="5425702_2_0728.jpg" n="4"/>State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, go on record as protesting the assertions and conduct of the Rev. William Temple, and further go on record as protesting the action on the part of certain American organizations that invite and provide audiences of propagandists that come under the cloak of friendship.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved: That all those engaged in the publication of newspapers be urged to criticize the actions of the Rev. William Temple and of the other offenders of our country's hospitality, which step if taken will not only enlighten the American citizens on the true situation in reference to his assertions, but will serve as a warning to propagandists, that they should not come to this country for the purpose of spreading propaganda hostile to a friendly nation.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved: That this resolution be given wide publicity, and that it be published in the monthly Bulletin of the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved: That the Grand Venerable be, and he is hereby, authorized to sign this resolution for and on behalf of the Grand Lodge of the <pb facs="5425702_2_0729.jpg" n="5"/>State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America and attach the seal of this organization to be attested by the Grand Recording Secretary.</p>
   <p>Attest: George Spatuzza, Grand Venerable</p>
   <p>Paul Lonero, Grand Recording Secretary.</p>
