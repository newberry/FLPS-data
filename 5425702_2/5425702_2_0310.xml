   <p>The meeting was called to order by the president, Cav. Cuneo. Emilio Longhi, vice president and members Malato, Davia, Merando, Bragno, Mastro Valerio, and Formuca were present. The minutes were read and approved.</p>
   <p>Following the New York Italian Chamber of Commerce's suggestion and a motion made by Mr. Bragno, it was resolved to protest against the proposed law introduced by Congress which tends to prohibit the sale and consequently the importation in the United States of wines and liquors. It resolved to send a copy of this protest to the Congressmen and Senators of the states and to the President.</p>

   <p>The resignation of two members were accepted and it was resolved to add to the membership list, the "Societa Americana Cantine Marchese Fassate di Poggibonsi" recommended by L. F. Boseo of New York.</p>
   <p>A communication from the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, announcing the tour of Professor Orlando Fontana of Torino in the United States for propaganda purposes, was discussed.</p>
