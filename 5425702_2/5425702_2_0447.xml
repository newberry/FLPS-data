   <p>Under the auspices of the Giordano Bruno Club, the 20th of September, was celebrated in Hull House.</p>
   <p>At seven-thirty P.M., a musical program was given by the Fusco Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Prof. A. M. Lewis spoke in English on the significance of the 20th of September. He proved himself a very erudite speaker, and a profound scholar on the Roman Catholic Church. He was applauded when he stated that, had Spain driven out the priests, it would today be one of the progressive nations.</p>
   <p>He congratulated the members of the Giordano Bruno Club for their initiative and said that they would undoubtedly work for the good of the Italians in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0448.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was followed by Dr. A. Molinari, who recalled the historic epilogue of the Breach of Porta Pia (Rome). He deplored the modern patriots who did not give rightful recognition to this historic day in order to avoid hurting the clerical-sabandist (sic.) capitalist order.</p>
   <p>He said that patriots in good faith deluded themselves when they believed that with the fall of the temporal power of the popes, the clerical power was also destroyed. He spoke of the black-frocked party in Chicago which is insidiously spreading its propaganda in the schools, of its "pious" deeds, and of the need to fight this peril. He thought the Giordano Bruno Club was best fitted to fight the black-frocked propaganda.</p>
   <p>The evening was brought to an end at a late hour with dancing.</p>
