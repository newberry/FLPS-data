   <p>Because he had injustifiably beaten Stefano Albertini when the latter had drawn a gun on him in his room over the Roma Restaurant, 386 Jackson St., Clark, a Pinkerton service watchman, was fined $25.00 in court today.</p>
   <p>While asleep in his room over the restaurant, Albertini was awakened by a noise at the front door, at 4 o'clock in the morning, December 25th. Thinking that thieves were breaking into the restaurant, he picked up a revolver and made his way in the dark to the head of the stairs. The street door had been forced open and in the dim light he saw two men ascending the stairs. He levelled the gun at them before he recognized their uniform, that of the Pinkerton Service. The two men took the gun away from Albertini and forced him to accompany them to the quarters of the Service where, while awaiting the arrival of the police patrol which had been summoned by one of them, they mercilessly beat upon Albertini. The arrival of the patrol wagon was <pb facs="5425702_2_0192.jpg" n="2"/>really a Godsend for Albertini.</p>
   <p>In court the next day when asked to explain their presence in the restaurant at that hour of the morning, they gave the excuse that they had found the front door open and having gone in to investigate the possibility of a robbery, they had run into Albertini threatening them with a gun. Thinking that Albertini, who has the room over the restaurant with the proprietor's permission, and is there also for the purpose of keeping watch over the place at night, was the one who had broken into the place, they had valiantly disarmed and hauled him to jail.</p>
   <p>The proprietor of the Roma, and the many friends of Albertini attested to the man's good character, so the Judge freed him and fined Clark, the leader of the two Pinkerton men, $25.00.</p>
   <p>Had the positions been reversed, I wonder if Albertini would have gotten out of it with a $25.00 fine.</p>
