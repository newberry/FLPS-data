   <p>Crimes, like the one over which the press is still storming wildly, are most trying circumstances for the people of Italian descent.</p>
   <p>No one will ever understand how crucial these moments are, especially to organizations ruthlessly and unjustly accused and implicated.</p>
   <p>It is the favorite argument of the local press to mention the Italo-American National Union in connection with any sort of crime as if it were nothing but the lair of wild beasts in human semblance.</p>
   <p>Well, if that is the way the press feels why does it not ask for a rigid investigation into the affairs of our association? That would be too straight a way to the truth; their petty arguments would fall to pieces and all the air of mystery clarified. It would have to admit to be liars knowing of their being such. If the press is so <pb facs="5425702_2_0048.jpg" n="2"/>much on the inside of the Mafia or Black Hand, or Camorra, why not have them all arrested, prosecuted and condemned?</p>
   <p>We are not trying to defend the culprits of crime; we write to defend to the end the good name and reputation of the Italo-American National Union. If we side with public opinion in deprecating the unfortunate happenings of the last few days, we cannot side with the blazing and shameful local press. It was only yesterday that editors of the afternoon papers called in court to give reports on their detailed accounts in connection with politics and crime, told the judge, "We wrote only in joke." These jokes hurt and very much hurt an entire community, an entire people. That is legalized black mail and the public has the right to know the truth.</p>
   <p>Because some criminals have Italian names they are accounted for as <pb facs="5425702_2_0049.jpg" n="3"/>Italian and Sicilian types. Italians and Sicilians do not live only in Chicago and New York, they live all over the earth and nowhere else occurs what happens in these two cities. If the Sicilian was the criminal type described by the press, what should be happening in Sicily itself where about eight millions of Sicilians live?</p>
   <p>Crime in the whole of Sicily is at least ten times less than the crimes committed in Chicago alone. Some of the men that here become criminals have lived for thirty years a spotless life in their native land. Some, and they are in the majority, have been born here or have come here when in their teens. The immaculate character of the life of their parents bespeaks their surroundings. Why do they become criminals here? There is something rotten in Denmark, we mean to say there is something wrong, not in being Sicilian, but in living in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0050.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Now what are the underlying connections of our association with crime? None. If any newspaper or any private source of information can disprove this statement we are willing to cooperate with them to render everything public, and submit to the decision of any court of law. We have voted and deposited in the hands of the city authorities $1,000 for the ones who will bring to justice the offenders of the law and humanity in the Ranieri case.</p>
   <p>People who are offenders, unfortunately, may belong to our organization as to any other fraternal order or association existing in the country, the American Legion, Elks, Moose, etc. What of it? Since they pay their dues and keep their place as far as their relation with the organization is concerned, investigation of their private life is a police affair.</p>
   <p>Our association, founded June 10th, 1895, is a benevolent one. It pays <pb facs="5425702_2_0051.jpg" n="5"/>an insurance at the death of a member, it pays most of their bills when sick and in need. The aim of our association is to promote a true and friendly understanding between Italy and America and to help Italian immigrants become thoroughly good American citizens. Our worth is shown by the ever increasing number of members and their willingness in contributing to any and every one of our humanitarian enterprises.</p>
   <p>In fact we have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to help the needy and the victims of national disaster, calamities, cataclysms and war. We take hold of the new immigrants and become their guarantors and sponsors in getting them started in this nation, new to them, so that they will not be victimized by professional bloodsuckers or deviated from a straight life.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0052.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Still we cannot be held responsible for anything wrong they do. God gave us the benefit of life but is not responsible for our sins.</p>
   <p>We are an independent, self-supporting, rich organization. Our treasury has about $200,000 in its vaults. We do not have to recur to crime or be connected with it to grasp life. Any connection with crime, besides being repulsive to us, would be disastrous to our organization. We ask not to be believed such fools as not to understand this much.</p>
   <p>Now, since we aren't connected with crime, why should the local press repeat the same old charge without ever having proven it?</p>
   <p>Dr. Castruccio, Italian Consul-General, has efficiently pointed the way to erase the crime. It would not take two days.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0053.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Mussolini took six months to clean up Sicily, an island of about eight million inhabitants and hundreds of criminals. Here everybody screams and no one moves a finger. We wish every one could have read what the Italian consul wrote or said in his statement and we say that Mussolini did not play politics or sensationalism or sold extras.</p>
   <p>He did not even collect fees from criminals' bribes to keep his hands off. He did not even intimidate judges to obstruct justice. He did not wash his hands when it came to defend the safety of jurymen or witnesses. He did not even accuse any association.</p>
   <p>The result is that the whole of Italy is too hot for criminals of any kind.</p>
   <p>The executor of such crimes as kidnaping, extortion, bombing, "taking for a ride," is a secondary personage as far as justice is concerned.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0054.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>It is common knowledge that the executors are hired men. If you prosecute and convict them the same party that hired them will find many more fools to be hired. It is the "higher ups" that should be apprehended and brought to justice. It is the judge, allowing bail, who gives them a chance to avenge themselves by killing the witness, or gives them time to create a fund, through extortion for their defense.</p>
   <p>When a common offender is brought to court and hires a lawyer whose fee runs into the thousands of dollars, why not go and find the source of this money? Then our slanderous critics would have nothing to say against the Italo-American National Union. They would have to admit that much of the cause of the crime situation in Chicago lies in the local public institutions and in the local system.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0055.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Then they might be surprised to find that those who cry the loudest are implicated in the crime.</p>
   <p>We say to our slanderous critics: "Let us be honest and frank and cooperate in thorough spirit of reform for the welfare of humanity. Do not accuse others unjustly to shade yourself. Let us do something constructive and not destructive. Show us that besides lies and false braggings you really can do something."</p>
   <p>To stand this vexing propaganda would harm us twice; would destroy our good reputation, would make people believe that we are accomplices in crime.</p>
   <p>Patience, tolerance, magnanimity on our part, would be a crime of innoble suicide. That is unthinkable.</p>
