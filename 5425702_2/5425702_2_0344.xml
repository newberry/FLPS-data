   <p>Our Order, being a fraternal organization, is by necessity non-political, and accepts in its ranks members of different parties and creeds as long as they are believers in organized government, and in the Constitution of the United States. This is not to be understood that its members as individuals should not take part in the political life of their communities and of the nation. Both our by-laws and ritual are very explicit in this regard. On the contrary one of the purposes of our Order is (I am quoting from the ritual): "To spread among the brothers the conviction that active participation in the political life of this nation is a factor of social betterment. For this purpose the Order shall encourage, prepare and assist the brothers to acquire the certificate of naturalization and with it the right to vote."</p>
   <p>In other words, while politics have no place in the Order, each member has the moral obligation to belong to one of the political parties of this nation, and through his activities in the party to work for the realization of the ideal of the Order - "the recognition of our racial element." And in this endeavor we who come from across the sea, cannot very well succeed without cooperation and support of the young generation of Italian-Americans now coming of age.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0345.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They are our boys and girls, who have to bear the brunt of this struggle. We of the older generation had to contend with economic conditions upon our arrival on these shores. In the battle for the essentials of life we could not afford either time nor money for political struggle. It is the duty of our boys and girls to prove to the other racial elements that our race is second to none in intelligence and ability in the administration of public affairs.</p>
   <p>In the last two decades members of our race have asserted themselves and won prominent places in the industries of the nation. In commerce they stand with the best: in banking, printing, manufacturing, etc. In every kind of human activity they have acquired positions of responsibility and importance. Everybody knows and admits the contributions to the arts by our painters, sculptors, musicians, singers, and writers. We will not even mention the victories of our athletes; victories which were certainly a surprise to those who considered us an inferior race. But in politics we are forced to admit that we have not done so well. Our position in this field is the lowest of all and out of proportion with the number of our votes, and the results are entirely different from those obtained in other fields and not in accordance with the tradition of our race.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0346.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have only a few congressmen in Washington and no senator or governor of a state belongs to our racial group. Very small is the number of our senators and representatives in the state assemblies. In only three cities of any importance is the mayor of Italian descent. Here in this State of Illinois, where we are about one-tenth of the total population, no position of responsibility is filled at the state capitol by any one of our race; neither have we representation of any kind on the numerous boards and commissions of the state government.</p>
   <p>What are the reasons, may be asked, for such a condition of affairs? The answers are easy. First of all - the lack of unity among the different groups, and the lack of confidence in men who could assume leadership in a competent manner. This has caused misunderstanding among ourselves to the benefit of politicians of other nationalities, who after being elected to office by our votes, went to Washington to vote us out as "undesirables."</p>
   <p>What are the remedies for this condition which is so humiliating and marks us as inferiors in comparison with those racial elements, who for number, culture, and tradition cannot in any way compare with us? First of all it is absolutely necessary that there should be unity in all the different groups, harmony among <pb facs="5425702_2_0347.jpg" n="4"/>the leaders, a strong organization and, most important of all, that our boys and girls should take an active part in the political life of our communities. After all they are the ones that are going to be benefitted most in this struggle. It is for their sake that we, older men, are standing on the firing line today, so as to prepare the ground for them to achieve a victory tomorrow.</p>
   <p>They should be convinced that the fact that they are of Italian descent should not be a deterrent from entering public life, but an incentive. Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor of New York City, has shown the way. His indomitable courage has made him the chief magistrate of the most important city of the world. With him as an outstanding example, our boys and girls need not fear failure. He has shown that even racial or religious antagonism can be conquered.</p>
