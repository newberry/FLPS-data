   <p>From the annual report we read and gladly reprint in Vita Nuova the wonderful words pronounced by the Rev. Henry S. Brown, D.D., Superintendent of the Church Extension Board of the Presbytery of Chicago, referring to our director Rev. P.R. De Carlo: "Two other major building enterprises gladen all our hearts. A $10,000 addition now going up at Palos Park, and the wonderful St.John Italian Church, which was first used in April 1930, and which was dedicated May 1930." On Palm Sunday at this church which was packed, 40 people were added to Christ during the service. This church represents a value of at least $40,000, over $7,000 of which came out of the Loyalty fund and $30,000, of which Mr. De Carlo raised by his own personal solicitations. The major portion that Mr. De Carlo solicited came from one devoted friend of the Board's work. With all the other burdens that Mr. De Carlo so ably carries, this latest accomplishment of him is a remarkable piece of work and for it he should forever be held in honor.</p>
