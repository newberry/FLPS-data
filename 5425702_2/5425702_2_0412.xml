   <p>The Navy Pier was the scene of a banquet in commemoration of the 600th anniversary of the death of the great Italian poet, Dante Alighieri, on September 11, 1921.</p>
   <p>Italians and Americans filled the vast auditorium to capacity and listened to speeches made by Dr. Harry Pratt Judson, President of the University of Chicago, Senator Medill McCormick, and Commendatore Guido Sabetta, Charge D'Affaires at the Italian Embassy in Washington and at one time Italian Consul in Chicago. Dr. Judson spoke in English and Commendatore Sabetta in Italian. Both eulogized the great poet and also spoke of the great progress made by Italians in America.</p>
   <p>Following his speech, Commendatore Sabetta, in the name of King Victor Emmanuel of Italy, presented Mrs. Catherine Briggs with a medal and Marquis Eaton with the distinguished "Commenda Della Corona d'Italia" which conferred on Mr. Eaton the title of Commendator of the Crown of Italy. The new Commendator was honored for his good work, as head of the American Red Cross in Italy, among Italian soldiers in the World War.</p>

   <p>A guest of honor was Giuseppe Bottai, a young deputy from Rome. He spoke of the mission that had brought him to America, to raise money for the Italian soldiers blinded in the World War. A subscription was started which showed promise of acquiring large proportions.</p>
   <p>An orchestra under the direction of Maestro Vecchione supplied the music for the evening.</p>
   <p>Cavaliere Antonio Ferrari was in charge of organizing the celebration.</p>
