   <p>Another poor Italian family was helped by the Italian Women's Welfare Society. The Colini family is in mourning for the death of its beloved wife and mother. She left behind, five children, one of them an infant of two years. Mr. Colini is unable to work because of a physical handicap.</p>
   <p>This case was reported to the Italian Women's Welfare Society and immediate action was taken. The baby, Josephine, two years old, was taken to St. Vincants Orphanage. Filippa, thirteen years old, was taken to St. Josephs Home, where in time she will be adopted by a good catholic family. The other three children, Louis, four years old, Vincenza, seven years old, and Vincenzo, ten years old, will be sheltered in Fehanville.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank this society for the wonderful cooperation they have shown in helping the poor Italians of our colony.</p>
