   <p>Only in the last few years has a certain decorum manifested itself in the colony's celebration of historic days and birthdays of Italians. The commemoration of Constitution Day, by the Circolo Dante Alighieri, was free from the banality that one has found in like affairs in the past.</p>
   <p>The gathering took place at Drill Hall in the Masonic Temple, and though the crowd was not heavy, perhaps because of the intense heat, those present found much to their liking in the musical part of the program which had a violin solo by Vincenzo Gulotta, and one by Miss Varesi, who sang an aria by Puccini. The brilliant lawyer, Paolo Parise, gave an interesting speech which was much applauded.</p>
   <p>All through the evening the Commemmorative Shield by the sculptor, Romanelli, was on display in the hall. A copy of the shield was sent to Rome to be placed in the Pantheon, in the name of the Italian Colony of Chicago.</p>
