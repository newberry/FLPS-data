   <p>The Italo-American National Union has concluded an agreement with the Board of Education of Chicago, and with the United States Bureau of Nationalization, in order to facilitate the naturalization of its members and of Italians in general.</p>
   <p>It is well-known, that thousands of Italians, although living in America more than five years, are not yet citizens and are still undecided about becoming naturalized.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every immigrant to acquire American citizenship. The value of such a step is determined by various reasons:</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0207.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. The immigration law will be changed in the near future, and our immigration quota will be basically altered to the number of voters we have in America. If that number is large there is a good possibility that our relatives will be allowed to come. No individual who come to live in the United States can allow himself to be considered an alien always, and deprived of the rights which he deserves but which are bestowed only on the citizens.</p>
   <p>For the benefit of our American-born children, what will they think of parents, who after many years of living in this country, are still aliens?</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is our duty to become American citizens and learn the customs and laws which rule this nation, and in so doing we will increase the prestige of our Italian name.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0208.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Government of the United States has ruled that anyone who wants to become a citizen must pass a test. This test is not difficult but it requires some preparation, which can be obtained by frequently attending a citizenship school.</p>
   <p>Consequently the Italo-American National Union takes this opportunity to help the Italians residing in Chicago, in the following manner:</p>
   <p>The Board of Education will establish citizenship classes in various districts of the city and will furnish the teachers, and the Italo-American National Union will furnish one or more men to help the Italians, who wish to attend the schools, to obtain and fill all the applications and documents required by the government.</p>
   <p>Our organization is cooperating in this initiative for the good of the Italians, and will give all its help and work free.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0209.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Therefore, no expense will be necessary for the Italians who are willing to attend the schools mentioned, and who have the following requirements:</p>
   <p>1. The petitioner must have the first paper of declaration of intention.</p>
   <p>2. He must have had the first paper for at least three years.</p>
   <p>3. He must be a resident of the United States for a period of not less than five years.</p>
   <p>For more and better information go to the Italo-American National Union offices at 8 South Dearborn Street.</p>
   <p>Italians: In becoming American citizens we will benefit, as well as our children; we will become a real factor of this great nation and we can defend the interests of our mother-country.</p>
