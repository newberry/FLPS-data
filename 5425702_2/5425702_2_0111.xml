   <p>Giuseppe Maria Abate, a new Don Juan, was prosecuted in the Court of Judge David, on the charge of having raped Ninfa Lombardo, a 13-year-old girl.</p>
   <p>Giuseppe M. Abate is known as the "Celestial Messenger" because he claims to be the personification of God. For such a reason, he succeeded in compelling his followers to build him a church at 2021 De Kalb St., where he presides and is worshipped as God.</p>
   <p>The mother of the raped girl was one of the followers of the cult created by this Don Juan. In her blind faith, she allowed her daughter to frequent the church in order to be instructed in the Catechism.</p>
   <p>During vacation, the girl was more assiduous in frequenting the church, and it was during that period that the immoral and unclean man took advantage of their seclusion, and raped and abused the girl. He then ordered her not to mention the horrid intrigue to anyone.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0112.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But on September 6th, the mother noticed the grave condition of her daughter.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lombardo said, during the trial, that when she went to complain against the "Celestial Messenger," he asked her for forgiveness because he said - after citing many passages from the Bible, as a representative of God in this world, he had the right to do anything he saw fit to do - and what he had done was not a sin.</p>
   <p>The husband, Mr. Lombardo, said that he was compelled to leave his home three months ago, because he could not succeed in keeping his wife away from that church.</p>
   <p>The trial of the "Celestial Messenger" ended with a verdict of guilty and the jury recommended that the Divine adventurer be sent to an insane asylum because he was found abnormal and dangerous by the alienist who examined him.</p>
   <p>It is pitiful to see how many ignorant persons are easy victims for such intriguers - who know how to take advantage of the ignorance and fanaticism of narrowminded people.</p>
