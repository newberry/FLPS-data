   <p>Silverio Borrelli's trial for the attempted murder of Dominico Parente ends with a death sentence. Thursday morning at 10 A. M. Borrelli's trial took place in Judge Stein's court. The jury found him guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Ralph Apata, a suspicious character had been arrested for the crime but was given his liberty soon after Borrelli confessed his guilt. Maria Calantonia, Antonio Papio and Vincenzo Taglieri testified for the prosecution. Their testimony was instrumental in convicting him of the crime.</p>
   <p>The crime for which Borrelli was sentenced to death is the murder of D. Parente and was the result of an argument between the two in Parente's house. The argument started when Parente threw Borrelli out of his home because he objected to the latter's slapping Mrs. Borrelli's face, when she had come to call him home, saying that the baby was ill.</p>

   <p>Borrelli swore vengeance and a few days later, Parente was found shot to death. Borreli denied the shooting, although he admitted having attacked Parente with brass knuckles. Parente's widow was in court when the sentence was read, threw herself on her knees, and thanked God that justice had been done.</p>
