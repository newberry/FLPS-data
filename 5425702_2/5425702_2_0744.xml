   <p>The Italian consul general of Chicago has sent the following letter to the Italian newspapers of this city:</p>
   <p>Dear Editor: As you have been informed, the American people will solemnly celebrate, in 1932, the second centennial of the birth of George Washington. By order of the Senate of the United States a suitable commission has been appointed to formulate the program of these ceremonies, which will include an exhibit of all the contributions made by foreigners to the success of the American Revolution.</p>
   <p>It will doubtless be a celebration of great importance, and I believe that the names of some Italians should be included among those who did most to win liberty for this nation.</p>
   <p>I therefore pray that you will employ all the means at your disposal and make all possible researches which may lead to identification and commemoration of even a single Italian pioneer of the American civilization so that he may be nobly glorified along with Italian explorers, missionaries, and fighters for American liberty.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0745.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I am confident that you will send to me the data of your findings so that I may co-ordinate in complete form the results of all researches and so present them to the commission.</p>
  </body>
