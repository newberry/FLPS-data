  <body>
   <p>The day before President Wilson left for France, he gave a special hearing to Stefano Malato and Antonio Ferrari, who were delegated by the Italian Chamber of Commerce to present him with a petition signed by many thousands of Italians protesting against the intolerable and unjust claims of the Jugo-Slavs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malato protested against the hostility of the American press toward Italy and the President agreed that it was unjust in view of the sacrifices made by Italy during and after the war.</p>
   <p>The Italian delegates were fortunate in being received by President Wilson. They were the only ones he saw on that day.</p>
