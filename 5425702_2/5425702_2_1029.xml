   <p>The Italian Ambassador in Washington, May Des Planches and his wife, accompanied by Cav. Rovicoli, arrived in Chicago on a Pennsylvania train, Monday morning at 8:55 A.M.</p>
   <p>These illustrious visitors were received at the Union Depot by a group of Italians among whom were the Italian Consul Sabetti, Dr. Volini, E. Longhi, G. Garibaldi, L. Malato, S. Spagliari, A. Russo, A. Mastrovalerio, A. Broletti, Dr. A. Lagorio, A. Gualano, G. Parenti, M. Mastrovalerio, B. P. Barasa and C. Raggio. E. Longhi volunteered to pay the expenses for the automobile the ambassador will use. The ambassador was very pleased with the way he was received by the city of Chicago. Reporters rushed to the Auditorium Annex for interviews the moment he arrived. Chicago has one of the most flourishing Italian colonies of the United States.</p>

The Mano Bianca committee consisted of Dr. Volini, Dr. Crutrera, Attorney Trivisonno, Attorney S. Malato and G. Mirabella. He promised the Mano Bianca committee to help vindicate the Italian name with his influence and with his American and Italian Authorities to help extirpate the evil, and to the Chamber of Commerce committee he said that the purpose of this institution should be to facilitate commercial relations between the United States and Italy. In conclusion he said it is necessary to study Chicago's commercial situation and its surroundings to reveal certain substitution of products.</p>

   <p>Friday night the Italian Club Lovers of Italy gave a banquet in honor of the illustrious visitors.</p>
   <p>Tonight the banquet of the Chamber of Commerce will take place at the Auditorium Annex. The noted Italians and Americans of this city will be present. Speeches will be given by the following people: S. Spagliari <pb facs="5425702_2_1032.jpg" n="4"/>Governor Deneen of Illinois, Mayor Busse of Chicago, Italian Consul Sabetta, Mr. Zucca, Dr. Volini and finally the ambassador himself.
