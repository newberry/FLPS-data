   <p>Soon after the leaders of the Italian Socialist Party were informed of the tragic end of the Hon. Comrade Giacomo Matteotti, they called a meeting of protest which was held in the Hull House Theatre on Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>More than 250 of our countrymen were present. Comrade Matteoni was acting president and, after explaining in brief the meaning of the demonstration, he gave the floor to Comrade Serafino Romualdi.</p>
   <p>This speaker, with much emotion, re-invoked the person of Giacomo Matteotti and revealed the unanimous indignation which has hit all the proletarians of the world because of the tragic end of the comrade and Italian Deputy.</p>
   <p>He spoke of the immediate consequences of this atrocious crime in Italy, and hoped the sacrifice of this martyr would raise again the depressed spirit of the Italians in order to put an end to the dishonorable Fascist regime.</p>
   <p>He closed his speech by inviting all those present, in the sacred name of Matteotti, to renew the oath to go forward on the road of proletarian emancipation and final victory.</p>

   <p>At the end of the meeting, it was resolved to send a cablegram of sympathy to the family of the martyr, Matteotti.</p>
