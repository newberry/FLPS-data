   <p>The following communication was received by the Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Chamber of Deputies</p>
   <p>Rome, Dec. 9, 1921</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>Dear Comrades of the Socialist Party in America:</p>
   <p>In this you may hear the echo of the tragedy that has struck the Italian proletariat with the assassination of the Hon. Giuseppe Di Vagno. The proletariat of Puglia, (Italy) has lost one of its most able defenders, and is contemplating the erection of a statue in his honor with the help of all Italian proletariat.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0839.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The subscription, for the (necessary) expenses, has been authorized by the Directive Council of the Socialist Party and by the Directive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor. It is open, and we count on our friends in America to do their share in perpetuating the memory of the man who gave all for the common cause.</p>
   <p>You are authorized by them, therefore, to open a public subscription in the Parola Del Popolo, and to urge our comrades, as well as Americans, and those of other nationalities residing in America, to contribute their share.</p>
   <p>We beg you to address a special invitation to the comrades of the Directive Council of the Socialist Party - Whether for an individual contribution or for a group.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0840.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I shall be very thankful if you keep me informed of results. Address me at the Chamber of Deputies, Rome.</p>
   <p>With greetings of solidarity to all the comrades, believe me to be your most Socialistic,</p>
   <p>Arturo Vella</p>
   <p>In response to the appeal launched by Arturo Vella, the committee of La Parola has collected seven dollars to date.</p>
