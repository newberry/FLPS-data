   <p>L'Italia's position in the matter of naturalization has been repeatedly set forth in these columns in clear and positive form. We believe that it is not only the privilege but the duty of the alien to become a citizen. By doing so, he gives evidence of good faith: he openly throws in his lot with the fortunes of his adopted country and publicly declares his interest in the welfare of his community. He accepts the responsibilities along with the benefits of residence here.</p>
   <p>We are indeed willing to go so far as to enunciate the principle that naturalization should be compulsory. We hear a good deal nowadays of compulsory voting; why not compulsory naturalization? A man who has enjoyed the benefits and privileges of residence in this country for say, four years should not only enjoy the right to become a citizen but he should be forced to become a citizen or leave the country. This would be one of the just and effective ways of ridding the country of undesirables. It would be a fair test of the individuals desirability.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0232.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such a law would dispose once and for all, of the bogy of the literacy test. The place to apply the literacy test is in the naturalization courts. An alien who has resided here four years and has not learned to read and write deserves little consideration, whereas the newly landed from countries which deny many of the privileges of elementary education deserve all the consideration in the world.</p>
   <p>The immigrant has demonstrated beyond all dispute, his eagerness to acquire the rudimentary education which was denied him in his homeland.</p>
