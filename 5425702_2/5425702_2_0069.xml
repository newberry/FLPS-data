   <p>The police fired a few shots to which he returned fire with his gun. Running until exhansted, and seeing that escape was impossible he threw down his gun and put up his hands in token of surrender. On further questioning, he confessed to having written extortion letters and added that at the time he and his two companions fled America they had been paid $40,000 by various persons in New York.</p>
   <p>The police made the statement that secret service agents had been on the trail of the Black Hand for many months. This arrest is proof that the forces of law and order in our city are always on the alert.</p>
