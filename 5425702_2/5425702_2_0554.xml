   <p>Through the untiring efforts of the charitable man of God, the Rev. P. R. De Carlo, a new church named the Italian Presbyterian Church of St. John, was erected in the most populated Italian quarter of this city.</p>
   <p>This church, which has an enrollment of fifty-eight active members, and a Sunday School attended by one hundred boys and girls, is without question a model institution.</p>
   <p>I, as a member, can affirm with pleasure, that all members of this church belong to the real Christian faith. I have heard them in their prayers and in the various religious ceremonies and have read in their faces the revelation of their souls. I have watched the uneducated woman and learned man and saw no contrast because their faith was one, their hearts beat in unison.</p>
   <p>In admiring that sublime sight, I enjoy knowing that this new church is destined, like a bright beacon, to enlighten the thousands of our countrymen, <pb facs="5425702_2_0555.jpg" n="2"/>who I deeply admire the fecund efforts of the Rev. P. De Carlo, his activities and patience in spreading the Holy Gospel, and the happy accomplishment of his marvelous and holy achievements.</p>
