   <p>On the occasion of the soccer football game played between the Italian team, Brescia, and the American team, Sparta; the new Consul General of Italy, Cap. Dr. Joseph Castruccio, gold medal hero, had the opportunity of officially introducing himself to the Italian community of Chicago, the same day he reached this city.</p>
   <p>The new Consul General was introduced to the Italian colony by Capt. Dr. Anrelio Pagano at a banquet held in honor of the team, Brescia, at La Rosetta Restaurant on September 1st.</p>
   <p>Capt. Dr. Castruccio in wishing success to the brilliant Brescia team expressed his pleasure in having had, in so short a time, such a splendid opportunity to greet the Italian community of Chicago in which, under the protection of the Sabauda Monarchy and as the representative of a strong National Fascist Government, he will feel sure of fulfilling his mission.</p>
   <pb facs="5425702_2_0791.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Capt. Dr. Castruccio made a favorable impression and revealed himself as a man of thought and action, one well chosen to present the mother-country, Italy, and to ably protect her interests, in this metropolis.</p>
   <p>The most prominent people of the Italian community of Chicago was present, with the representatives of the "Fascio" and many veterans, who were glad to offer their respects to the illustrious Camerad.</p>
   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce was represented by its vice president, Mr. Ferrara, and by many members of the Executive Council.</p>
