<title level="a">WORKERS' STRIKE IN STOCK YARDS</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Several weeks ago there was a strike in Chicago stock yards as well as in other cities. The fight started because the meat barons wanted to lower the already very low wages. When the workers decided to strike, the employers started put strike breakers in their place. They called police to act against the strikes and asked court injunctions against strike pickets.</p>
   <p>The whole official apparatus is at the disposition of the employers. Courts and the police help them. The strikers are beaten up by the police for keeping 'order.'</p>
   <p>The workers persist in their demands. The strike breakers are not as effective as was expected.</p>
   <p>Work in the stock yards is held up. The meat markets cannot be supplied <pb facs="5420779_1_0206.jpg" n="2"/>with fresh meat. Many strike breakers leave their work, because the meat barons do not keep their agreements. The scarcity of workers is shown by the fact that old pensioned workers are called for work.</p>
   <p>Not only in Chicago, even in other cities, the pecking companies are not able to get workers.</p>
   <p>The meat bares are not strong enough to break the strikers. It looks as if the strikers will win in the end.</p>
   <p>The workers are united in this fight, and that argues for victory. The conditions of stock ward workers are under criticism. All the world knows about these conditions but nothing is done to better them. The families of the stock yard owners live in perfect luxury, and they want to cut further the miserable wages of the stock yard workers.</p>
   <p>Some of the workers get from thirty seven to forty five cents per hour for 48 hours work. Unskilled workers received for seventy-two hours work, <pb facs="5420779_1_0207.jpg" n="3"/>twenty-two and one half cents per hour. Women workers receive eleven dollars per week. Hundreds of women and girls work in the stock yards. They work ten hours per day for eleven to fifteen dollars per week.</p>
   <p>One working woman said: "I work hard, standing in water all day." She is forced to work in the stock yards because she is a widow with seven small children. Daytime she works, nights she keeps house.</p>
   <p>Compare the life of children of such workers' families and the life of the families of meet barons. There you will find a contrast which causes a feeling of bitterness. Because the children of meat barons are pampered in all possible luxury, the children of the workers have to suffer.</p>
   <p>Whoever knows and sees all that we said, must admit that the fight of the workers is justified, and should give them his sympathies.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0208.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The slaughterhouse workers are able to fight under good leadership. If they achieve unity they will gain victory.</p>
   <p>They also have to drag into the fight their women who work during the daytime in water and keep house nights. All sufferes must become united. That will end the absolute rule of millionaires in the stockyards as well as in other places of work.</p>
