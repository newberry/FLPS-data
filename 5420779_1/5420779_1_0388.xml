   <p>The great progress made by the Socialist party since previous Presidencial election can be seen clearly now that the election rush is over, and the results are known. This time the number of votes given to the Socialist party was 100% larger than in 1908. The Socialist party candidates in 39 states, and in 311 out of 397 Congressional districts.</p>
   <p>The party registered a splendid victory in Milwaukee, where the whole county ticket was won by Socialists. Twelve representatives went to the Legislature of Wisconsin also one congressman. Few socialist representatives went to the Legislatures of California, Massachusets, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>In the State of Minnesota the Socialists took Lake County and Cook County, in Ohio, Franklin County and Marshall County in Oklahoma.</p>
   <p>The Socialists received a majority in some ten of the city administrations.</p>
   <p>Many votes were received in Columbus, Ohio, and in Minneapolis, Minn., where by a margin of a few hundred the Socialist candidate for mayor lost. The party is called the "Public Ownership Party."</p>
   <p>A big gain in the Socialist vote is seen in Pennsylvania, especially in Pittsburgh and in Allegheny County. The Socialist candidate for governor received <pb facs="5420779_1_0389.jpg" n="2"/>in 226 Pittsburgh precincts 5,500 votes. Two years ago in all the 667 precincts there were no more than 7,000 votes altogether.</p>
   <p>In Pittsburgh as well as in Philadelphia the Socialist party received more votes than the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>It was shown that there is not one place in the United States where the Socialist party does not have adherents. In some places the increase is from 150 to 200 per cent.</p>
   <p>These first victories which opened to the Socialist party the doors of Congress, and of state legislatures, fulfill hopes expressed last May. By these victories the American proletarians secured for themselves a merited place in the ranks of the international Socialists.</p>
   <p>For us Socialists it is of great importance to know that our progress is due to class consciousness and socialist persuasion of all workers rather than influence of single workers, corruption, or money, as in capitalist parties.</p>
