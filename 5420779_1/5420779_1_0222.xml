<title level="a">THE BIG TAILOR STRIKE</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The big strike of the tailors is on the way -- to victory. In spite of intervention by the employers, in spite of misstatements by the capitalist press, in spite of the terror of the police, in spite of hunger, which is threatening the fighting masses.</p>
   <p>Yes, hunger is threatening! All other inconveniences are easier to overcome than hunger. We must overcome hunger, but that can be done only when all the workers rush to help the strikers.</p>
   <p>That will assure victory for the oppressed workers.</p>
   <p>The struggle continues into its fifth week. The tailors went into the strike unprepared, unorganized, without a union and without the main fighting means which is money</p>
   <p>The strikers, men and women, lack means for their subsistence. They need help of all working men and women.</p>
   <p>They deserve our assistance because they showed their fighting spirit in a five-week-long, extensive fight.</p>
   <p>Workers belonging to all different nationalities in Chicago are assisting.</p>
   <p>Not only unions and socialist organizations but also benevolent aid societies.</p>
   <p>In places all over the country workers are collecting money for the strikers in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0223.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the last meeting of the strikers of the Croat and Serbian nationalities a resolution was passed to appeal to all Croatian and Serbian benevolent and aid societies,to every worker and the public in general to help the garment worker strikers.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that all honest men and women will respond and help to overcome the meanest enemy of any strike -- poverty and hunger.</p>
   <p>A big excitement among the workers created the news, given out in "extras" by the capitalist press, that the President of their union, Rickert, entered in an agreement with the firm of Hart, Schaffner and Marx (which employed 15-20 workers before the strike). The "agreement" was nothing better than treason. The strikers refused such an agreement and Monday the shops were without workers.</p>
   <p>On account of that "agreement" Rickert will be ousted not only from the presidency but also from the union.</p>
   <p>In the strike there participated about 50,000 men and women.</p>
   <p>The Croat, Serbian, and other Jugoslav strikers, hold meetings each Monday and Thursday, 2 P. M., in National Fraternal All. assistance has to be sent to: Anderlon, 1650 Morgan St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
