   <p>It seems that for all <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> was, the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> the said it <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of social unrest, foreigners are <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> country.</p>
   <p>If there is a strike, it is the work of prisoners of foreign <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>This situation <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> are eager to leave this country.</p>
   <p>On the other hand <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> are treate <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> well ...to be the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> exploited.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0130.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This happened to <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in America. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> they came from countries there they were <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> brutally <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of a bureaucratic government.</p>
   <p>They did have to <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> their <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> who had the official position. <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>not only for the people <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> were picture <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> poetry, and as saviors of culture.</p>
   <p>It is easy to believe that our <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> by the fact that they <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> American officials. If they were hard driven at work, they <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> that, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. However, they agreed they were treated <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> country.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0131.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> better their <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> They <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in American <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> called <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>alcontent, unruly, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> could call the foreman by his first <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> they <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> everything was all right. Whatever the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> ways days <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> go.</p>
   <p>But conditions changed. In the foreigner one saw an enemy because America was at war with his country. America wanted to make patriots of foreign workers overnight, but you can't arouse patriotism in a man who has nothing. The hired workers do not possess anything and cannot feel like property owners who live well. Over<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> they wanted <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> rich and poor equal in deeds, words, and thoughts, but they failed.</p>
   <p>As it was to be expected, the foreign workers remained cool toward this <pb facs="5420779_1_0132.jpg" n="4"/>patriotic propaganda. Many workers, out of fear or other causes, declared themselves first class patriots.</p>
   <p>As soon as one part of the foreign workers was considered patriotic, the rage went against those who remained calm and were not swayed by artificial sentiment.</p>
   <p>The propaganda against foreign workers is in full swing today. In the lead for it is the American legion. The legionnaires are armed. They usurp the right to arrest people, to disband meetings of foreign workers, to demolish business place, destroy libraries and do similar acts of violence.</p>
   <p>The effect of all this is in contrary to what America wants to do for the foreigners, namely, the establishment of schools to teach them English and the meaning of American constitution.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0133.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>On one side they try citizens of the foreigners by education on the other the Legion tries the area by violence. The result will be that foreigners will hasten to leave America.</p>
   <p>The authorities are <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> conditions in America. If the workers are <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> look for the cause of that dissatisfaction, and there <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and Jail, lynch or deport them.</p>
   <p>In is well known that the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. From Gary some 8,000 <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> for <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> strike and bad treat of the employees.</p>
   <p>All over the world in will be <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. This is not <pb facs="5420779_1_0134.jpg" n="6"/>the way to <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> foreign <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> good Americans are not <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> bring a bad reputation for America.</p>
   <p>America must give <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> more order, and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> over the fate of the country to a chauvinis<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ic legion.</p>
