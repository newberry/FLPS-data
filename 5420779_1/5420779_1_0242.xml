   <p>The Communist Party Branch of Fraternal Order No. 57, Croatian Brotherhood Union (H. B. Z.), issued an unbecoming, lying circular written in an extremely low fashion, bitterly attacking in an ignorant style the answer to our query: "Who in the H. B. Z. are the agents of the Belgrade regime?"</p>
   <p>This foolishness was printed in Radnik. Judging by its style, silly expressians, number of grammatical errors and general ignorance, this foolishness must have originated on Radnik's offices. Once when it appeared as a circular it came out in Radnik's pages. It is understood that Radnik, according to the circular, discovered agents of the Belgrade regime in the Croatian Fraternal Union.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0243.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It also appears that the members of the Jugoslav Educational Association are Fascists, or Social-Fascists, and that Novi Svijet took in its defence Ga<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>dic and Jonic, president and secretary of H. B. Z.</p>
   <p>Their only argument is that Novi Svijet is against the special convention of H. P. Z. But our reasoning in <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to the special convention, no decent and normal person would come to such conclusion, never, only the Radnik, and its insane followers whose <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>irtues, sensibilities, honor and decency are darkened by fanati<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ism and stupidity.<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> are a few <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> from our writings concerning the affairs of H.

They will see who supports the re<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>dic and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> president and secretary of H.

   <p>In this work the agents of the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> regian uses various means. One is to influence the man in public life, such as newspaper owners and editors, merchants and professionals, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, who are thought to be influential in the colony and will <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to spread their idea and thereby justify the necessity of the present form of government in Jugoslavia. In pursuing their policy further, the higher representatives of the Jugoslav monarchy and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> decided to decorate the head officials of H. B. Z., and through them induct their poisonous propaganda into this benevolent organization. The confidence which workers have in their leaders should <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> with. It is dangerous to play hero of a bloody government at the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> expense. They have opened their eyes and learned from <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> understand the nature of <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> will not allow <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of their organization, either <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> or unconsciously, to serve the oppres<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> their brothers in the old country.</p>

   <p>Since <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> ever social and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> movement is forbidden, especially an opposition which is totally abolished.</p>
   <p>Jails in Jugoslavia are full of <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> awaiting trial. In <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> are reserved to, worse than in the dark ages of the Inquisition.</p>
