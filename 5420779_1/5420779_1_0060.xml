   <p>For a long time there has been a bitter fight between American authorities and merchants of alcohol to allow the sale of all stock of alcohol stored in places of business and warehouses.</p>
   <p>On January 16, 1920, the Prohibition Law will be in force and sale of any alcoholic drinks stops. Until that time it would be possible to sell, were it not for the restriction ordered during the war. Congress approved this restriction, helped by a decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>The only hope for distributers of alcohol remains with President Wilson. We is able to declare the mobilization finished, and allow the sale of alcohol until January 18.</p>
   <p>So it looks as though the sale of alcohol will be prohibited publicly, but it will be sold secretly.</p>
   <p>The Prohibition Law did not bring any good. It made secret the public sale of alcohol, allowing the dealers to make more money by selling "in secret."</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0061.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Besides, the prohibition law helps to cheat, since the cheated cannot complain, as the trade in alcohol is forbidden for both parties.</p>
   <p>It happens that many pay a great deal of money for a barrel of whiskey. Later they find that the whiskey is just on the top of the barrel, the rest all filled with water. That has happened very often lately, which shows how much badness there is in so-called civilized people.</p>
   <p>Many of such cheaters have a good reputation as citizens, but in fact are felons.</p>
   <p>A sequence of prohibition is the drinking of wood alcohol, which is nothing else but poison. Cases of alcohol poisoning through the year were many; in the last few days there were 200.</p>
   <p>People help themselves as well as they can just to have something to drink. They prepare their own alcohol or buy it, and after drinking it, they die.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0062.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During the Christmas holidays people wanted to have whiskey and bought it from poachers. The whiskey was poisonous and 15 persons died of it. Such news come from all states. It seems there will be more cases of this type.</p>
   <p>These poachers are men who are after profits and they do not concern themselves with the effects of their ware. Doctors and police work hard to prevent poisoning. Orders are given to close all places where alcoholic drinks are served. In official circles it is expected that there will be more deaths during the New Year holidays.</p>
   <p>We are neither friends of alcohol nor advocates of drinking, but it is a fact that prohibition was enacted against the will of the people, that people are eager to cheat the state and authorities wherever they are able to take hold of alcohol. That is the best proof that people are not for prohibition.</p>
   <p>The state did not score a success by proclaiming prohibit on, but rather opened a way for cheaters to poison people secretly. The American Congress passed the Prohibition Law, but this was not done in sincerity.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0063.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The newspapers have brought to light the fact that many rich supporters of prohibition provided themselves with alcohol for many years despite their readiness to deny drinking to the people. Whoever knows life in rich homes, knows that they drink plenty there.</p>
   <p>If that is true the prohibition law is hypocrisy and nothing else.</p>
