   <p>The workers struggle for freedom is possible only if it is organized, if our power is consolidated. The fight which the working class leads is the struggle for full freedom, so that nation does not oppress nation, man does not oppress man, husband does not oppress wife. Unlimited liberty for all the human race is the aim of our struggle. Only free mankind will develop to the fullest degree of humanity.</p>
   <p>All the working class should cooperate in this struggle of the oppressed, the women too. In fact, we don't believe in victory until our women are in the fighting ranks. A female proletariat who is subject to the same abuse, same suffering, should organize, and shoulder to shoulder with husband, brother, father and comrade, lead the class war for freedom.</p>
   <p>With this in mind we ought to make a start in Chicago. Therefore, Sunday, Oct. 24, at 2 P. M., in the Jugoslav Socialist Hall, 18th Street and Center Avenue, the first women's conference will be held.</p>
   <p>All sympathizers are invited, all who are against backwardness and darkness, <pb facs="5420779_1_0416.jpg" n="2"/>who are of free and progressive thought and will cooperate in the struggle in which already are millions of women, the class struggle for Socialism.</p>
   <p>Forward to the meeting.</p>
   <p>Committee Jugoslav Socialist Association.</p>
