   <p>The first Jugoslav Socialist Congress in America was called to order at 8 A.M. on July 3.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Interim Committee for the convocation of the congress the delegates were greeted by comrade Milan Glumac.</p>
   <p>The following were elected: Tomo Renenich, Allegheny, Pa., president; comrades Ivan Nasten (Croatian), and Frank Petrich (Slovenian), secretaries.</p>
   <p>Twenty-eight delegates belonging to four different Jugoslav nationalities: Slovenian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian were present.</p>
   <p>Comrade D. Ekonomoff spoke on the "Immigration of Jugoslavs and their status in America." The cause of the larger immigration of Jugoslavs to America is <pb facs="5420779_1_0394.jpg" n="2"/>their economical and political oppression in their homeland, he said. They emigrate to find their daily bread. But upon coming to America these immigrants are abused and their position is worse than that of other immigrants. Therefore, the speaker stated, a Jugoslav Socialist Union is necessary in order that the Jugoslav proletarians of this country may be able to fight against American capitalism.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were adopted to support all socialist federations here and abroad, and to organize a print shop for the Jugoslav Socialist Union. The print shop is expected to open on December first, this year.</p>
