   <p>Each nation possesses what we call, in general terms, national pride. For intelligent people "national pride" has the same significance as individual vanity and are proud of it because of their limited intelligence.</p>
   <p>Not a few citzens of this Republic who derive their origin of other nations rejoice in their own "national" traditions, customs, rules [of conduct] and characteristics. Each country creates for itself certain standards of morals, behavior, interpretation, and "national" culture.</p>
   <p>We, who have been in this country for a long time, have discovered that "national' pride," so-called, is well established in the United States. There is nothing of importance which the average American does not define as "American" or "un-American" according to his interpretation.</p>
   <p>Industry is an American product. The Army and the Navy are American. The <pb facs="5420779_1_0305.jpg" n="2"/>exploitation of workers by the rich is also American. Millionaires and billionaires are American products. Hundreds of such American products exist. Anything that favors capitalism and the prevailing system is American.</p>
   <p>It is un-American to disapprove of the Church or of religion, to find fault with the authorities, or to disagree with those who are the leaders of society. It is un-American to tell a thief that he is a thief, to tell a capitalist that he is an exploiter, or to tell a robber that he is a robber.</p>
   <p>There are many other such un-American things. Lately one of these "patriots" declared:</p>
   <p>"The open shop is American."</p>
   <p>Open shops and factories are those in which organized labor is not tolerated--in which strikebreakers work. That is American--it is in accordance with the <pb facs="5420779_1_0306.jpg" n="3"/>law, which grants to everybody the right to work for whom he pleases, and wherever he wants to work. According to this theory those persons are in the wrong who want to induce their co-workers to join unions and struggle against capital.</p>
   <p>If a factory stops work [because the employees have gone] on strike, the employers are allowed to hire strikebreakers, gunmen, the worst scum of society, to break that strike. All this is American and permissible and is sanctioned by custom.</p>
   <p>Some time ago Negro slavery was an American institution, and how! But it cannot for that reason be considered a sacred thing today. Yes, slavery was a sacred thing once, but today men wonder how it was possible to tolerate slavery at all.</p>
   <p>There is the electric chair, a first-class American institution. Nor must we forget the gallows, prisons, and lynchings as American products.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0307.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But who could enumerate all the American institutions?</p>
   <p>If a man appears who assails old and inequitable institutions in this country, his activity is classified as un-American!</p>
   <p>Atheism is of course un-American. But America produced one of the greatest and most eloquent of freethinkers, Robert G. Ingersoll. If Ingersoll had not been against church traditions, every Amecican child would know him. But he is avoided, and his works are classed as "un-American". Why? Because he proclaimed the truth about nature, religion, and customs, and that is considered "un-American".</p>
   <p>Another great movement, which appeared in this country is considered un-American, and that is socialism. Surely that institution does not belong here. It grew on foreign soil and in another climate. It cannot thrive in America. Here we have democracy, the right to vote, and that is sufficient. For socialism there is no place in America. That is the declaration of the <pb facs="5420779_1_0308.jpg" n="5"/>representatives of capital in the United States, of its agents and of all the factors which mold public opinion, and they think that any political movement or economic theory is defeated if it is declared "un-American".</p>
   <p>To this we reply that not long ago woman suffrage, was considered un-American, but it became the most American of institutions after long years of struggle and of persecution of those who fought for it, the men and the women who demanded equal political rights for the two sexes.</p>
   <p>So did things which were considered un-American became American, and vice versa. There are thousands of things considered American at the present time of which coming generations will be ashamed.</p>
   <p>Socialism also will become an American institution. When? That depends on the workers. But when it is extended over the country so as to influence the nation's life, it will attain the dignity of American citizenship.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0309.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>To promote the extension of socialism over America, a great throng of industrial workers and other exploited men are at work. A victorious socialism will become American in time.</p>
