  <body>
   <p>The bankers' oligarchy is preparing against a clash with the working class, which is inevitable on account of the economic crisis which is spreading over the states.</p>
   <p>In fear for their great profits, to be more secure, these bankers ordered through their organization (the government at Washington) the police to be organized as a military body. For this purpose the police have been drilled in the practice of using bombs, machine guns and rifles, to be able more effectively to kill the hungry workers.</p>
   <p>In New York 600 policemen were selected to be drilled for two weeks in a federal military camp, to be prepared to kill the workers in order to safeguard the holy democracy and the looting of our national wealth.</p>
   <p>That which is being done in New York is the rule and custom throughout the country.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0159.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All this shows that the bourgeoisie prepares for the coming crisis, to use it as a tool to do away with the movement of the working class and to accomplish an old wish: the open shop, and in connection with it to shoulder the losses of the coming crisis on the working class. The working class must become organized for the purpose of safeguarding its interests against the capitalistic class.</p>
   <p>Only through a strong, disciplined and revolutionary working class party is a successful defence possible. It is the for the workers to become organized in a Labor Party, which in the spirit of communistic principles will lead a fight against capitalistic exploitation and will liberate the workers.</p>
