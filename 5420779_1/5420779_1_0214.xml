   <p>All Jugoslav Socialist organizations in Chicago; Branches 1, <gap unit="words" extent="4" reason="illegible"/>  - are invited Sunday the 16th of this month at 9 A.M. to the National Hall (Corner Center avenue and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>th Street, to attend a workingmen's public Meeting for discussion of the strike of the copper miners in Michigan.</p>
   <p>All Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian and Bulgarian workers from Chicago and vicinity are invited to attend this meeting. To make our protest against the oppression of our working brethren the more powerful! To show to the striking proletarians our fullest sympathies. To show that their cause is our cause - the cause of the whole working class.</p>
   <p>At this meeting comrade T. Susnar will speak in Creation or Serbian, comrade Godina in Slovenian, organizers of the Western Miners' Union, comrades P. Paulsen and M.J. Reiley, in English.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0215.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The workers demand recognition of union standards of pay and working time.</p>
   <p>The strike in the newspaper business, that is, of pressmen, delivery-men and sellers of newspapers continues for four weeks.</p>
   <p>The police, the mayor, who sides with Hearst and his agents in Chicago, also the Courts were not able to make the sale of capitalistic newspapers normal. They are not sold on streets at all, and this causes heavy losses.</p>
   <p>The rumor goes around that three of the newspapers, Inter Ocean, Journal and Post will go bankrupt if the strike continues.</p>
   <p>The working men boycott the capitalist papers not only in Chicago but in the nearby cities, such as Joliet and Elgin.</p>
   <p>Many Chicago unions adopted resolutions in which they condemn the capitalistic press.</p>
   <p>These unions recommend to the workers to read the Daily World, and decree a fine of $5.00 or $25.00 for each member who as found reading a capitalistic newspaper whose purpose is to break up the workers' organizations.</p>
   <p>The working class is becoming conscious of the fact, who is and who is not its friend.</p>
