   <p>Some time ago, in the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of the State <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> bill was introduced to forbid the existence of the foreign <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> magazines.</p>
   <p>The high patriots of the state of Oregon tried to bite <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> themselves, if we believe the statement of professor <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> wegian origin, who was American <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>Professor Anderson says: "The people who speak just one <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> live in a house which was just one window: they live with one thought; just in one direction. The people who speak several languages have windows on all four sides of their houses and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in this world. The great German philosoph<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>."</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0122.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I do not sympathize a bid, said Mr. Anderson, with this <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>stericans agitation against foreign countries on foreigners."</p>
   <p>In America are about 1,800 newspapers and magazines, publisher in foreign Languages and the number of copies <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> eight millions.</p>
   <p>These papers represent thirty-two languages. They are published in every, one of the states. Of that entire press only belong to the socialists. Communists <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Communist or A<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>archistic. It is considered that 19 of this press is completely loyal and 96 anti-social. In this country there are not more than twenty openly radical news papers, Of which give are published in Jewis<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. The ultra-radical press is published in the English language in millions of copies and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> millions of readers.We do not now how accurse are the statements of Mr. Anderson, but one <pb facs="5420779_1_0123.jpg" n="3"/>thing seems to be important, that is, that the ultra radical newspapers are published in the English language <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> are read by millions of Americans. That means that the state of Oregon will have to prohibit also the English Language because mostly in that language the re<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ical propaganda is being spread. If that is the case, what is the use of destroying the foreign language press?</p>
   <p>If the foreigners are considered as radical, who vouches that they will not learn the English language and read newspapers published in English?</p>
   <p>Of course, these "hurrah" patriots, while raving against foreign and imported languages, forget that the English Language is also imported.</p>
