   <p>Sunday, December 25th, Eugene V. Debs was freed from prison. He was convicted because he was against bloodshed during the World War. Debs was held in the state prison in Virginia and then transferred to Atlanta, Ga., from where he was released. He was admitted to prison on April 13, 1919. Over one year after the armistice. Debs was in prison 32 months.</p>
   <p>Debs was released on the ground of the President's amnesty. Debs lost his citizenship. He declared he was a citizen of the world and does not care much at losing his American citizenship.</p>
   <p>Debs was called to Washington, D. C., where he spoke with President Harding and the Attorney General. Debs declared that he will fight for the same cause for which he fought many decenniums.</p>
   <p>He will fight for the political prisoners who remained in prisons of this country. Debs said that for his release he is indebted to the American working class. The entire American press writes about him. He <pb facs="5420779_1_0297.jpg" n="2"/>is known all over America.</p>
   <p>It is time for the working class to liberate the rest of the victims of bourgeois tyranny. We hope that Debs will take action to free all political prisoners regardless of their party.</p>
   <p>We are sure Debs alone will not be able to do that. To accomplish it, help is necessary from all organized workers, who must be influenced by meetings and the press.</p>
