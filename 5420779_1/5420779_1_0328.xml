   <p>Lately our women interested themselves in joining out Socialist party. They point out that it is necessary to fight together with their husbands, brothers and fathers. Every comrade should be glad to hear that, because we have to fight together indeed, because both sexes suffer equally under the unbearable capitalism.</p>
   <p>As we see it, it is not right for women to be organized in separate branches.</p>
   <p>Of course, they have the best of intentions, and think that being organized separately they will do better. But we must bear in mind that those who want to be organized are, in great majority, mostly wives of our members, while other women would stay out of the organization.</p>
   <p>A woman like a man becomes a real revolutionary only then, when she is confronted with capitalism. But a housewife also may become a good fighter for Socialist to rights.</p>
   <p>The management of a worker's home suffers much on account of bad social conditions. But the housewife suffers most. It would be best if each member registered his wife, mother or sister with the branch of which he is a member. Then they would be able to attend the meetings and lectures together and talk things over together. Of course it is necessary to have the women <pb facs="5420779_1_0329.jpg" n="2"/>instructed about the purpose and importance of our organization and not register them for something which they do not understand.</p>
   <p>What we said above was accepted by our women comrades on the 22nd of last month at a meeting to renew their organization.</p>
   <p>Our branch No. 6 decided that each woman member, girl, wife or widow, will pay a membership fee of twenty-five cents per month.</p>
   <p>Comrades, to work! It is up to you to organize your wives, mothers and sisters. Women belong also in the Socialist ranks.</p>
