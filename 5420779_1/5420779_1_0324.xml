   <p>If there are in your settlement five conscious workers you can easily establish a Socialist buanch and join the Jugoslav Socialist Federation.</p>
   <p>At the first meeting you get acquainted; then ask in writing the secretary of the federation for further information.</p>
   <p>Invite all people who you think are willing to become Socialist members; those who read our Socialist press you may consider as the best material for Socialist membership. They must be called for the first meeting.</p>
   <p>At the meeting one of those who is most able will explain the purpose of the Socialist branch. Then cards for joining the branch are distributed. Those who want to become members must sign the card and pay fifty cents registration fee. When that is over, a secretary, an organizer, and a financial secretary are elected from the registered members.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0325.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A president is elected from each meeting. The duties of the officials are explained in the by-laws.</p>
   <p>When the secretary of the federation receives the registration cards and fees, he will send all that is necessary for conducting a branch.</p>
   <p>The new branch will receive the charter from the Secretary of State. Thus the new branch is established and becomes a member of the Socialist Party of America, which is a part of the International Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>For badges, membership books, by-laws, and any information desired, write to A. Susnar, 803 W. Madison St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>When a branch is established, then the comrades may call a public meeting or lecture. If speakers are necessary write to the Secretary of the Federation.</p>
