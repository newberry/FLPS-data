   <p>Lately - in the United States - like mushrcams after rain, many patriotic societies come up with the purpose of saving the fatherland from the enemy.</p>
   <p>The last word in patriotic foolishness and ravings is the National Committee for Americanization. Behind this committee are capitalistic interests, its agents - newspapermen and unscrupulous politicians - are sold out.</p>
   <p>They think America cannot prepare for slaughter as long as thirteen million immigrants are here who are not citizens and have no deeper feelings for their fatherland. For that reason it is found that these foreigners ought to be educated and made over into citizens and impregnated with "ideals" of this free republic.</p>
   <p>These people are uncoordinated, dispersed all over the country, knowing neither laws nor language; they belong to different nationalities and religions.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0136.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As long as such diversity and ignorance prevails, these people will remain strangers to American conditions, and will be a great danger when there is the defense of our country at stake. For that reason they must become united; in their hearts must be planted love for country and common ideals against all external and internal enemies.</p>
   <p>We have no opposition to the state spending more money for education to teach the foreigners language and laws. But to reach that, the foreigners must have better working conditions and must not be met with contempt and arrogance.</p>
   <p>Then, too, the foreigner must not be shown institutions as ideal for which to escape he left his own country, as, for instance, the army.</p>
   <p>If the patriots think to unite the foreigners under the flag of militarism and defense, they will be disappointed.</p>
   <p>The unification of the working masses not only of America but of all the World will only be possible under the standard of Socialist democracy, international solidarity, brotherly love and holy peace.</p>
