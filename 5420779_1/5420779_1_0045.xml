   <p>Human knowledge is the fruit of evolution and does not in itself aid social and individual progress. Progress in itself suspends stability. It means change, flexibility, movement.</p>
   <p>In countries where the large majority of people think little or nothing about world problems and where the oldest traditions are adhered to, there is no orogress.</p>
   <p>All technical and other wealth, of which the 20th century boasts, was acouired as a result of scientific inventions and continuous change of old ideas.</p>
   <p>If the human mind had retained the same views predominant in the world two or three thousand years ago; if it had the same ideas about the iniverse and the stars, about the size and shape of the earth, about the various forces and phenomena,about the construction of his body and function of organs: if the man had not moved from old belief, we today would not have railroads, telephones, wireless, movies; not even the farm implements nor other industrial <pb facs="5420779_1_0046.jpg" n="2"/>machinery for production, or electricity. All this is the result of evolution of knowledge.</p>
   <p>But what are these -- petrified beliefs? All the ideas and conceptions that were established in prehistoric time, while the human mind was still in the cradle, were outgrown by experience, new life and general knowledge. These were the conceptions that could not stand even the weakest scientific criticism, but they existed so long that they <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in many cases hardened, immovable and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to reason.</p>
   <p>These ideas were handed down from generation to generation and but few changed outwardly, but the kernel remained identically the same. And because the man Dived with them so long, they created the feeling that their beliefs were holy, needed no changes; in fact, that it was sin and crime to even doubt its truth.</p>
   <p>The so-called dogmas, upon which all religions of the world rest, are nothing else but those petrified conceptions, and they are so firmly implanted in the <pb facs="5420779_1_0047.jpg" n="3"/>believer's soul that they guide him through the whole complex of life. According to him, even the future of humanity depends on them. Men that became victims of these dogmas are not capable of deeper thinking. they are narrow, superstitious, arrogant and brutal all who do not share their Beliefs.</p>
   <p>However, those that are reasonable and somewhat doubtful are not so <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>us. The worst ones are those who firmly believe that they are on the right track. And the more sincere the are the more <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> they become.</p>
   <p>People with petrified beliefs, which is a concept of superstition, are most inconsistent, They are today, willingly or otherwise, benefited by scientific inventions and forced to live according to new ideas of practical value. What they cannot understand is that their primitive beliers and dogmas are inconsistent with the new civilization of the 20th century. With this in mind, editors will devote time and special space in our paper for the benefit it of those willing to learn.</p>
