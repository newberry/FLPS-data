   <p>After the strike of 1919, when the strikers were beaten, the situation for the steel workers became worse every day. The wages became smaller, making it hard to live and support a family.</p>
   <p>The workers are not organized to lead a struggle for better working conditions. The employers know that the unorganized workingmen are not able to load a successful strike. Besides, the employers have different means to defeat the worker.</p>
   <p>Last year the bourgeois press was full of praise when the eight-hour day was granted. But these short hours are just for a small minority; the rest, or the big majority, work ten or twelve hours as before.</p>
   <p>It can be said that 75% of the steel workers work longer than eight hours. The wages are small, and it is hard to believe that families can live on them. A common laborer, if he works eight hours, makes $3.60 per day. If he works ten he gets forty cents more.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0271.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Ten years ago the Illinois Steel Company sent its agents to Mexico to bring more loyal hired slaves, who will never oppose the employers.</p>
   <p>The company knows that the conditions for the workers are terrible and that an outbreak is possible at any time. For that reason the Mexican workers were imported.</p>
   <p>When the Mexicans came nobody knew under what contract they were hired. Now it is known that in case of strike, the Mexicans will remain at work. The conditions under which the contract was signed were extreme. They were to perform the hardest work for the smallest wages. They all lived in the factory under one roof. The building had three floors, on which 1,500 workers lived. Those who could not be housed in that building were sheltered in sheds around the factory.</p>
   <p>At the start they did not pay for those quarters, but later on they had to move out and pay rent. They were obliged to buy food, clothing and pay rent from their low pay. They could not rent decent quarters <pb facs="5420779_1_0272.jpg" n="3"/>or buy clothing. For months they wore the same overalls in which they also slept. The employers know that the church is their faithful servant.</p>
   <p>The company built a church for which the workers had to pay afterwards. Instead of building a school for them, they built a church. All that was done to make willing servants out of them, so they will not protest against the employer.</p>
