   <p>Recently in America we have seen a tendency toward closer co-operation between Serbians and Croats. Moreover, so-called patriotic newspapers have begun to write articles about Croatian and Serbian unity and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>In many such cases the object is some material benefit for the writer of such articles or for the persons by whom the article was inspired. In the main the idea is good, and many persons have been found, especially among the working class, who acclaimed this attitude of the Croats toward the Serbians here in America, so much in contrast to the lack of tolerance between them in the old country.</p>
   <p>But conditions in Europe react upon America also. The people are unconsciously listening to their enemies.</p>
   <p>Many workers fall into the error of becoming exaggerated Croatians. Such a lost sheep sent us the following letter:</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0150.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Honorable Editor!</p>
   <p>"I call your attention to the fact that I subscribed to Radnicka Straza to be printed in my mother tongue and not in Serbian. For that reason I beg you not to send to me the paper printed that way. If you insist, I will return the paper, and you may return the [cost of my] subscription to me.</p>
   <p>I do not want to hear about Serbians, much less to read papers printed in their language.</p>
   <p>"With greetings,</p>
   <p>"Nick K., your subscriber"</p>
   <p>This poor workingman does not want even to hear about Serbians. That is the way he expresses himself in his letter. He speaks of his mother tongue and about a Serbian language, and they are one and the same.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0151.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In his sincere foolishness this child of a fierce patriotic education speaks with some hatred of Serbians.</p>
   <p>On account of a few lines in the Cyrillic alphabet printed in the Radnicka Straza, which is done to be of service to [our] Serbian comrades, this man refuses his newspaper, which constantly wages war against the enemies of the working class.</p>
   <p>Ill will in the ranks of workers is the greatest misfortune for the working man and the greatest blessing for his enemies.</p>
