   <p>The Slovenian delegate, comrade Frank Petrich, made the following report: The first Slovenian socialist club in America was established in Chicago on February 2, 1900. Later a consortium was organized to edite the paper Zora, which it expected would be the official organ of the Slovenian socialist union in America.</p>
   <p>In a short time club and paper were stopped for lack of funds. In 1903 another paper was started and the Slovenian club re-opened. As the publishers did not care for socialist teachings, Slovenian socialists decided to establish their own newspaper. The Slovenian socialist paper Proletarec was started on January 1, 1906 to become the official organ of the Slovenian Socialist Union including eleven active clubs.</p>
   <p>Report of the Croatian delegate, comrade Tomo Besenic: The immigration of Croats to America started some twenty years ago. The masses of the <pb facs="5420779_1_0391.jpg" n="2"/>Croatian people were exposed to abuses by crooked speculators and newspapers.</p>
   <p>In June 1903, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, the first Croatian socialist club was started to educate Croats by printing circulars and holding meetings. The club of Allegheny closed its doors in 1905, but was re-opened in 1906. In the South side of Pittsburgh a Socialist Club was founded by Serbians, but it did not prosper. In 1907 work was started in Chicago to organize the Croatians and to establish a Socialist newspaper, Radnicka Straza. After having their paper, socialist organizations of Croats were started in other places, totaling by now fourteen. Their future is assured if they join the Jugoslav Socialist Union.</p>
   <p>Report of the Bulgarian delegate, Dimiter Ekonomoff: The socialist movement of Bulgarians in this country, in comparison with other nationalities, is very small. The first Bulgarian socialist organization was formed in Chicago in 1907. The same year, organizations were established in St. Louis, Missouri; Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>In Chicago a socialist newspaper in Bulgarian was published for a short time. Bulgarians migrate often and that is the reason why their organizations become depleted in numbers and cease to function.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0392.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is expected that a great help in this direction will be the interlacing of the Jugoslav Socialist Union with other branches all over the United States.</p>
   <p>Report of the Serbian delegate, comrade Dusan Poporich: Serbian socialist organizations in the United States of America are very few and for that reason it is hard to maintain a Serbian Socialist newspaper.</p>
