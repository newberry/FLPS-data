   <p>The regular meeting of the committee was held November <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>th, 1924 in Croatian-Sokol Hall and it was approved to have a school for illiterate people. The Central educational committee has provided the hall and a teacher, and as soon as a number of illiterate people report, school will be started. All wishing to attend the school are invited to report to the secretary of C. E. C. as soon as possible, so that we can start the school as soon as possible. The Central Educational committee has also established a where all that wish to read, could conditionally use the books. But because the Educational Committee is in poor financial circumstances and is not able to buy a large number of books, they are asking all Jugoslav in America, to donate as many books as they can.</p>
   <p>Some lodges from both of our fraternal societies, for some reason are not yet in C. E. C. That bears heavily on the educational committee, whose aim is to spread enlightment in our co<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ony. More could be done. If there were a greater number of us to work and our effort would more successful.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0052.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Annual meetings are near, and the duty of all members is to take up the question of C.E.C. in discussion and act so that every Lodge joins in the Educational Committee, elects delegates or confirms old ones. Meetings are held every third Monday evening 8 P. M. in National Croatian and Sokol all 1907 South Racine Ave.</p>
