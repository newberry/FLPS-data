   <p>Many will ask, Why is America a problem? If we look deeply into it, we will find the answer. Everyone knows that America is a wonderful land, rich in natural resources. Under her surface are found coal, oil, gold, silver, and other metals and ores. There are great forests, rivers and lakes. Great industries have been developed.</p>
   <p>But this same country is in the hands of an imperialistic clique of millionaires who appropriated these riches for themselves and exploit the people for their own benefit. Amassing great fortunes, they invest their capital in other lands, and enslave other peoples. This clique represents a small percentage of the general population. While millions work for wages which allow them to live from day to day, but the least crisis puts them on the verge of starvation. Is this, then, not a great problem? Is it not a problem if a small band of lazy men have all the riches of society in their hands and dominate that society, compelling those who are creating riches to live in poverty, while the lazy bones <pb facs="5420779_1_0266.jpg" n="2"/>and the felons have all the luxuries? That is a great problem. Who works to solve that problem? The bosses, who are in control of everything, do not want to. They work to keep conditions as they are. But such a situation does not suit the workers in this country or in other countries. They are the ones who according to their historical position are called upon to change the standard of things. To the working class belong the future. The working class must rule society, introduce a system where there will not be room for exploiters.</p>
   <p>In order to perform its duty the working class must organize in workers' unions, cooperatives and in a workers' party. They must lead the struggle to establish a farmers' and workers' government as the first step toward a new social order.</p>
   <p>The methods of solving the problem. The American liberal intellectuals (among them Kathleen Noris), try to solve these problems. They work on these problems but without real determination to solve them. Just as this authoress writes on the equal status of women. She will never reach the <pb facs="5420779_1_0267.jpg" n="3"/>goal. Only the working class is able to solve class problems.</p>
   <p>Those who feel it necessary to work for the benefit of the working classes have to support workers' organizations against elements which try to keep up the exploitation system of today.</p>
