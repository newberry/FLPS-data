<title level="a">WHY WORKERS HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE SOCIALIST PARTY</title>

   <p>A few days ago the Socialist party of Chicago gave out its platform on which it will stand in the coming elections. From that platform it is easy to see why every worker in the coming city elections should vote for candidates of the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>Here is a short excerpt from the platform.</p>
   <p>Today the Chicago administration in an administration of speculators. The speculators prospered under the administration on account of the working masses. Dishonest politicians put in by these speculators govern the city. The Chicago administration shows plainly its contempt for the working class.</p>
   <p>Scoops of money were divided by politicians but there was no money left to do something of use for the working class.</p>
   <p>All the forces of the city administration were put at the service of the capitalist class, to master the workers.</p>
   <p>The workers of Chicago have an opportunity to decide now if they want an administration of Republicans or Democrats, speculators, or an administration of Socialists, like that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>The workers must be convinced that they can expect nothing either from the Republican party or the Democratic party. If the workers want the city <pb facs="5420779_1_0387.jpg" n="2"/>administration to take care of them, they have to elect and vote for men of their own class.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party of Chicago puts stress on the fact that nearly all its candidates are socialists.</p>
   <p>Each candidate of the Socialist party is bound - if elected - to fight for the welfare of the working class.</p>
   <p>Our final aim is that all the industries become owned by the people, where their exploitation will be for the benefit of all, rather than for private profit, as happens in the capitalistic order of today. The Socialist party and its representatives will support every effort, each step meant to bring us closer to a social democracy. Let us use every means to better living conditions for the working class.</p>
