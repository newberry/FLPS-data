<title level="a">EXPLOITATION OF STEEL WORKERS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Everybody knows that in the steel industry exist employer's organizations which have the purpose of making propaganda. These organizations are supported by the workers themselves. Here I will mention just the "Good Fellow Club."</p>
   <p>As soon as a worker starts to work, his boss wants him to join the club. Some say the workers are not obliged to join the club, but all of us know what would happen to a worker if he refuses to join.</p>
   <p>In the Illinois Steel Company's plant are about <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> men working. Each of them pays 25 cents per month to their club.</p>
   <p>In many mills they pay from 10 to 50 center per month. Bots of money come in at that rate. The officers of the club are elected, but not by the workers. The company nominates them.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0196.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The purpose of said organization is to make propaganda money for the steel barons. To the workers it is said that the purpose of such organizations is to help poor workers' families.</p>
   <p>The workers in steel industries are powerless because they are not organized.</p>
