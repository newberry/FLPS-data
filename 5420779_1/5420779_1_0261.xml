   <p>The first of May is known all over the world as the great day of labor. On this day the workers and farmers of all countries demonstrate that all who work are brothers and fellow fighters in the struggle against all masters and oppressors. May first is the day of the brotherhood of labor; the day of struggle for freedom.</p>
   <p>On May Day, 1927, especially, we must realize that the working people of all countries are brothers. Today the American government has sent thirty battleships and about nine thousand armed men to China to try to crush the Chinese people, who are fighting for their freedom. The American government is doing the dirty work of rich American bankers, who are afraid that if the Chinese people win their freedom, they will refuse to slave for them any more. In order to keep the Chinese people slaves to American bankers, the United States government sends battleships and <pb facs="5420779_1_0262.jpg" n="2"/>marines to bombard Chinese cities and kill Chinese men, women and children.</p>
   <p>The American soldiers in China are acting like the Hessians of the Revolutionary War, trying to keep the people in slavery.</p>
   <p>On May first we must show Chinese workers and farmers that we are with them and against despotic murderous bosses. The Chinese workers and farmers are our brothers. The American bosses and bankers are our most hated enemies.</p>
   <p>Celebrate May Day - the day of labor. The solid front of the whole working class, the older workers, the young workers and the workers children! One army in the fight for freedom!</p>
