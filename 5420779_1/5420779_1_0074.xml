   <p>Today this question is very actual because it is evident that moral bonds are loosening, ends that should bind the children to their parents. This condition brings confusion into the ranks of society.</p>
   <p>To hold any social institution intact and to develop it, it is necessary that all members not only live a life of unity but that they help one another with all their physical and spiritual force for the common good.</p>
   <p>Each family is a separate organism, which perform certain functions in the life of a nation, which in turn will be stronger materially and morally, the more all her members are strongly united for the common cause.</p>
   <p>In studying human history, we find that those nations survived, developed and became stronger, whose family life was stronger, and whose members worked conscientiously for the welfare of the whole family, thus indirectly affecting the progress of their country.</p>
   <p>On the contrary, the nations whose family life disintegrated, nations <pb facs="5420779_1_0075.jpg" n="2"/>where immorality and wickedness, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, disobedience and laziness predominated, where parental authority broke down, these nations soon lost their liberty, many of them disappearing entirely from this world.</p>
   <p>Today we will find, especially in big cities, conditions that threaten the disintegration of the family life. The family life is entirely neglected. Often the husband is wasting his hard-earned money drinking, which bring his moral and intellectual power down to the level of a beast and leads to crime with all of its bad consequences.</p>
   <p>The wife, mistaking the meaning of women's emaniciaption, often forgets her exalted calling as mother, becomes easy going, a prey of luxury, waste, and entertainment, neglecting the sanctity of her home life.</p>
   <p>Such a family life undermines the foundations of family ties and leads society to destruction</p>
   <p>Such conditions are contagious and influence the children who, according <pb facs="5420779_1_0076.jpg" n="3"/>to an inborn instinct, will sooner accept and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>it bad traits than good ones.</p>
   <p>For rehabilitation of such deplorable social ways of living, the existence of which is to be blamed on the world's war, we must reform and had better adapt our social institutions to deal with this situation.</p>
   <p>The present institutions are not suited to educate a generation, which will be cognizant of its duty to the family and society.</p>
   <p>To do that, the work must not be left for just "the proper agencies", in this work every one who has a spark of conscience and responsibility toward society and state must take part.</p>
   <p>These reforms must try to lay the foundations of morals and self-reliance in early youth and point out duties connected with family life and society in general.</p>
   <p>Such an education of our youth, in the first years of its life, will follow <pb facs="5420779_1_0077.jpg" n="4"/>a road which leads to happiness and contentment and will influence the family ties beneficially.</p>
   <p>From a concentrated action of all intellectual workers, we expect the renaissance of our society as well as a moral responsibility for parents and children.</p>
