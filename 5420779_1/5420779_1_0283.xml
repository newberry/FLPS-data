<title level="a">INCREASE OF OUR PARTY</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>During the first six months of 1924, according to reports of Comrade Ruthenberg, executive secretary of the Labor Party, five thousand new members joined our party.</p>
   <p>During the first six months of last year about three thousand members joined our party. These figures show that to working classes of this country the Communistic program is accessible. It also shows that the activities of the Labor Party, especially for its independent political action of workers, induced thousands under our revolutionary flag.</p>
   <p>Reports from different branches about our membership indicate that we have 27,500 members, but because of irregular payment of dues and other failures, the dues represent about 60% of the membership.</p>
   <p>The Central Executive Committee took measures to effect a 100% payment <pb facs="5420779_1_0284.jpg" n="2"/>of dues. The dues have to be collected by buying membership paying stamps.</p>
   <p>If we were able to get 5,000 new members without a campaign, that means that it is possible to double this number now, when we are conducting a campaign for new members, which aim is linked with the elections.</p>
   <p>Each branch has to mobilize all their powers for the cause and for getting subscriptions for our partisan press, especially for the Daily Worker and Radnik.</p>
   <p>The working masses who followed the Socialist Party have recognized its bankrupt nature and are leaving it in great numbers.</p>
   <p>In each issue of the Daily Worker we find some member of the Socialist Party leaving this party and joining the ranks of the militant Labor Party, which is the only organization in America which is founded on Leninism and Marxism.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0285.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With its upright standing in the class struggle, with its clear, determined revolutionary program, it attracts all bellicose workers, who indeed are willing to fight against capitalism. The outlook in our situation is that soon we may have a membership of 40,000.</p>
   <p>We must gather subscriptions for our press and propagate our revolutionary ideas.</p>
