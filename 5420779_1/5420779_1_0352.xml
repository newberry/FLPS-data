   <p>The Illinois Manufacturers Association is always watchful never omitting the opportunity to prevent the enactment of laws which may endanger the payment of dividends to its members.</p>
   <p>The following letter which was sent out to different Illinois manufacturers shows in what measure the exploiters of the workingmen are 'class conscious" and how they care for their interests.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen - the industry of Illinois is in great danger, which comes from the Legislature of Illinois, in session at Springfield now. The Workers' party in showing considerable activity. Many bills are submitted, which may strangle your business.</p>
   <p>If we do not all resist, at once, the industries of Illinois will be hit, not to recover for years to come.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Manufacturers Association is leading the fight, your fight, and has been doing so for many years. Why should you not take over some of this burden. Why not help an organization which defends your interests? We need your help. You need us. Send a check for fifty dollars -- ten dollars <pb facs="5420779_1_0353.jpg" n="2"/>initiation fee, forty dollars membership fee. Yours truly,</p>
   <p>I M. Glenn, Sec'y.</p>
   <p>From that any worker may learn something. First: you see how the capitalists organize to defend their interests.</p>
   <p>Second: how they fight, united, against laws introduced for the benefit of the working class, though some of them say, that the capitalists are friends and benefactors of the workers.</p>
   <p>Third; if it is good for the capitalist to get organized for common defense is it not more important and useful for the workers to get organized in the struggle against exploiters?</p>
