   <p>An American magazine wrote the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>tions the people in the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> every little faith in medicine. They laugh if you tell them that microbes, mosquitoes, flies, rats and other animals are able to spread <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. They think that sickness is not caused by any outside agency, but is sent by God. They say. If God sends us sickness and misfortune <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> knows best <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>That there are people in the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> that sickness is sent by God, we do not <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> He know the Balkirs <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> conceited Americans who imagine that they exce<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in civilization and that other people are just savages. Furthermore, we do not know which country is referred to in the above statements. In Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece people know how to appreciate a doctor's knowledge and believed in doctors, rather than priests.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0119.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In proportion there are not many doctors, and the people have no <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to profit from medical science. No <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> that people in their desecration depend on a priest, sorcerer or even a common <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>t.</p>
   <p>But now is it in America? Correse<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of culture think that the situation is better were. But a cared scrutiny will show different results. In the same <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> that the police arrested members of a church <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> City, Illinois, on account a immorality. They were lying on their backs, claiming to be possessed the only <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>st.</p>
   <p>In the United States there is a special religious a <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> called the Christian Science. They believe in immorality, but reject any medicine. When they get sick, they pray, but never call a doctor. Where not see way these people are more intelligent than those in the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> who believe sincerely that God sends all good as well as and things.</p>
   <p>We, who lived in the Balkans, never <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> anybody say that be is possessed of the ' <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Ghost' as is the case in <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>ion City, a town in the center of American civilization, in the state of Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0120.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In America religious hypocrisy is far <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> in the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> number of American universities serve religion, force students to attend churches and sermons.</p>
   <p>Why, indeed, do is imagine that <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> is better than over there; that Americans are freethinkers, that the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>alkan people are victims of fal<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>cies, mistakes are a constant occurrence, fed and <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, on the other s<gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>e egotism and greed of those two want to profit from church and religion.</p>
