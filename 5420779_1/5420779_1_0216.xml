<title level="a">STRIKES IN CHICAGO</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The strike of freight handlers, who load and unload freight on depots, is continued and will spread to other points reached by twenty-four railroads from Chicago.</p>
   <p>The R. R. companies are not able to hire the needed strike-breakers, and those who do the disreputable work of strike-breakers are not fit to do the work efficiently.</p>
   <p>It happened that cars destined for Chicago were found in Seattle, Washington, or in same small town in Texas or in other far away towns.</p>
   <p>On account of the strike the freight traffic lags in Chicago, which causes great losses to the merchants, who demand the railroad companies settle with the freight handlers in some way.</p>
   <p>Last Monday a strike broke out at the firm of B. Kuppenheimer and Company. It is not known yet whether the workers of other tailoring firms in Chicago will join the strike or not. But the situation warrants this possibility.</p>
   <p>Misusing their victory of the last year over the garment makers, the capitalists little by little lowered the wages and working conditions to an unbearable standard.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0217.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The workers demand recognition of union standards of pay and working time. The strike in the newspaper business, that is, of pressmen, deliverymen and sellers of newspapers, continues for four weeks.</p>
   <p>The police, the mayor, who sides with Hearst and his agents in Chicago, and also the courts, were not able to make the sale of capitalistic newspapers normal. They are not sold on streets at all, and this causes heavy losses.</p>
   <p>The rumor goes around that three of the newspapers, Inter Ocean, Journal and Post, will go bankrupt if the strike continues.</p>
   <p>The working men boycott the capitalist papers not only in Chicago but in the nearby cities, such as Joliet and Elgin.</p>
   <p>Many Chicago unions adopted resolutions in which they condemn the capitalistic press.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_1_0218.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>These unions recommend that the workers read the Daily World, and decree a fine of $5.00 or $25.00 for each member who is found reading a capitalistic newspaper whose purpose is to break up the workers organizations.</p>
   <p>The working class is becoming conscious of who is and who is not its friend.</p>
