  <body>
   <p>That the Kaspar State Bank enjoys great popularity among our countrymen is best proved by the bank's growth.</p>
   <p>The auditing department has been moved to the second floor, one half of which was remodeled especially for this purpose. On the main floor, which also was remodeled, a bond department has been established where anyone who is interested may receive valuable information about how to invest money in state, city, or county bonds bearing from five to seven per cent interest.</p>
   <p>The foreign department has also been considerably enlarged. From this department any amount of money can be sent to any part of Europe. This department also takes care of all matters concerning the voyage to and from our old homeland. The connections with the banks of Czechoslovakia have also been considerably improved, assuring quicker and safer delivery of money orders.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0096.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bank deposits during the past year show an increase of more than $2,500,000, and therefore the bank's resources reached an unprecedented height of $13,500,000. Out of this, the security of the bank, directed by experienced and honest officers, is apparent. The bank is under state, national, and Chicago Clearing House Association supervision. The bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve Bank, and therefore is one of the most powerful banking institutions in Chicago, and may be considered one of the foremost Czechoslovakian banking institutions in the United States.</p>
