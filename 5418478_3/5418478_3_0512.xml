<title level="a">ANNUAL CONCERT OF THE CAPEK VIOLIN SCHOOL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>On last Wednesday evening occurred the annual concert of the Capek Violin School, in the recital hall of the Auditorium Building. This year's program was the best ever presented in the school's annual concerts. The best composers were represented, such as Smetana, Ondricek, Laub, Kadlec, Drdla, and Mlynary.</p>
   <p>In the first group of violinists were Misses Beatrix Jonas, Irene Martin, Georgiana Rudis, and Ione Wisa. The audience listened in attentive stillness to the end of each performance, giving generous rounds of applause. The second group of artists consisted of John Ferna, Milan Lusk, Samuel Kryty, and Charles Novy. Mrs. Augusta H. Capek, wife of the director, provided the piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>As usual, the concert was free, but a collection was taken up to defray expenses; <pb facs="5418478_3_0513.jpg" n="2"/>no one objected to this, and all contributed liberally. We are now looking forward to another concert to be given in the near future, before the next regular annual concert.</p>
   <p>Bouquets were presented to the graduating pupils. To show his appreciation, Mr. Capek then announced that he was pleased to turn out annually graduates from his school, and that he hoped to continue to do so for years to come. The Capek Violin School is located at 1803 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
