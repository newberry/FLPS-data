  <body>
   <p>Now that Czech Day, held in Mandel Hall at the University of Chicago, is an accomplished fact, it may justly be said that we have achieved a success which will be of the greatest significance for our future. We have introduced ourselves to the American public in a most dignified manner; we have demonstrated our cultural maturity and sustained our right to stand among those nations which have, under more favorable circumstances than those of the Czech nation, worked their way to the crest of progress.</p>
   <p>It is fitting that we acknowledge the efforts of those men who expended their energies for this accomplishment. Professor Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University of Chicago, is to be mentioned first, for he made the realization of the initial Czech Day idea possible. Incessant <pb facs="5418478_3_1440.jpg" n="2"/>work followed a conference held last May between Czech leaders and representatives of the University headed by President Judson. The ultimate fruit of this meeting was Czech Day.</p>
   <p>This event really began the day before yesterday with the opening of an exhibition of old and rare Czech books, which were procured by the efforts of Mr. Vojta Beneš and the Reverend Pokorný, and lent by Mrs. Anna Jankova of Ely, Iowa, as reported in the description of the exposition in yesterday's issue of this paper. Paintings and sculptures by contemporary Czech artists were added to this collection. Works from our modern literature were also on exhibit. An intense interest in these departments was manifested not only by students of the University, but also by large numbers of the American intelligentsia, and to no lesser degree by our own fellow countrymen, who were leisurely but thorough in <pb facs="5418478_3_1441.jpg" n="3"/>their inspection of the exhibits.</p>
   <p>Sincere curiosity was awakened by the objects in the department under the auspices of the Slovácký Vzdělávající Klub (Slovak Educational Club) where embroideries, porcelain painting, wood cutting, and other articles, products of Slovak home industry, were shown. They were arranged according to the various Slovak districts, and thus reflected the indigenous artistic tendencies in various parts of the Slovak homeland.</p>
   <p>Works of modern graphic art, lent by Mr. Šerpán of Omaha, Nebraska, enriched the collections considerably.</p>
   <p>The exhibition was a sort of prelude to the Czech Day proper. Many people <pb facs="5418478_3_1442.jpg" n="4"/>from our community were unable to attend the performance because of the long distance; we hope that they will be given an opportunity to see the exhibit in the near future.</p>
   <p>The Czech Day program was opened by President Judson at 8 P. M. The speaker defined in plain words his attitude toward the Czechs. He lavished praise upon them and told the audience about the time when he began to feel attached to our nation. While he was a professor at the University of Minnesota, he became attracted by the talents and ambitions of two students, and upon learning that they were Czechs, he naturally turned his attention toward their nation. One of the students became Professor Železný of Yale University, and his brother is a professor at the University of Minnesota.</p>
   <p>President Judson further related how the Czechs have stood up for liberty <pb facs="5418478_3_1443.jpg" n="5"/>since time immemorial--liberty such as they found under The Star-Spangled Banner of America; how they are showing their appreciation and have become valuable citizens of this country. Needless to say, these words were received by us Czechs with hearty acclaim. They filled us with pride and surely left a lasting impression upon the native Americans present.</p>
   <p>This introductory address was followed by the "Trio in B-flat Major" by our immortal Antonín Dvořák. Miss Florence Forst played the piano, Mr. Rudolph Fiala the violin, and Mr. A. V. Černý the violincello. The three performers, who are well known to Chicago audiences, won full recognition.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five girls, members of various Chicago Sokols, created a pleasant surprise by the gracefulness with which they executed light athletic drills <pb facs="5418478_3_1444.jpg" n="6"/>under the direction of that untiring worker among Sokol societies, Jarka Košař. The girls and the Dělnický Pevecký Sbor (Workingmen's Singing Society) drew the greatest applause among the performers of the entire program.</p>
   <p>Male Sokol members gave an excellent exhibition of drills. They performed under the direction of Jarka Kosar and were rewarded by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The Workingmen's Singing Society sang "Kdož Jste Boži Bojovnicí" (Ye Soldiers of the Lord), an ancient chorus dating from the time of John Huss, and some other Czech, Czech-Moravian, and Slovak folk songs. "Teče Voda, Teče" (Water Is Flowing), a Slovak song, gave Mr. Karel Malík an opportunity to render the tenor solo part. The pieces were sung under the direction of Mr. Houdek.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1445.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Professor J. J. Zmrhal, principal of Herzl High School, gave a picture of the history of the Czech nation, of the sufferings endured, and of its three-hundred-year-old struggle for liberation. He drew a comparison between those times and the situation of the people since the outbreak of the World War. He told about the Czech soldiers in the Austrian Army who refused to fight those by whom they expected to be liberated, but surrendered to the Allies. Professor Zmrhal proved that the Czechoslovaks had a clear claim to independence, and that this independence is one of the necessary concomitants of the peace negotiations. The peace treaty must be made at the expense of Austria, which has never been anything but a toy of Germany. The speaker finally read utterances of prominent men, from which their attitude toward Czech independence may be ascertained. He quoted President Wilson and President Judson of the University. The audience demonstrated its fullest accord with the <pb facs="5418478_3_1446.jpg" n="8"/>words spoken by Professor Zmrhal, who may be very well satisfied with the effect produced on the audience and the work which he has performed in behalf of the good cause.</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting numbers consisted of Slovak dances directed by Miss A. Špaček. They were executed in the colorful costumes of the Slovak land and breathed the whole gamut of moods from exuberant joy to deepest mourning.</p>
   <p>The concluding piece on the program was Dvořák's cantata, "The American Flag," sung by 150 members of the Ustřední Pěvecká Jednota (Central Singing Union), with Mr. J. Houdek on the conductor's stand. Mr. Jos. Hurt sang the tenor solo, and Miss Xenia Weicher played the piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>Thus, Czech Day ran its course at the University of Chicago. Though the <pb facs="5418478_3_1447.jpg" n="9"/>program took a comparatively long time, protagonists of the Czech cause will surely wish for an early return of an event such as this, for its expediency and efficacy cannot be doubted.</p>
