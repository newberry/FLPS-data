   <p>"A Poor Girl" was given by Ludvík's theatrical troupe last night, but the play did not reflect poverty. On the contrary, this burlesque evoked a merry mood in the audience. It has not been presented on our Czech stage for a long time, though it is as popular as "Pražské Svadlenky" (The Prague Seamstresses), which is on the same order--adaptable for the average audience. It has the same nice music and as much fun as can be crammed into six acts.</p>
   <p>"A Poor Girl" was given by the Ludvík troupe twenty-three years ago and has lost none of its refreshing charm. It employs numerous characters whose traits were well portrayed by the Ludvík players. Miss Libby Zdeněk's singing and Mr. Skalický's droll characterizations were among the main attractions. Mrs. Ludvík was the stage director, and Professor Čapek conducted the music. The public showed its appreciation for this entertainment, which lasted fully three hours.</p>
