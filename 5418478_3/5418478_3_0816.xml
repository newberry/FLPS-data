   <p>A memorial service was held last night in the Svatopluk Čech hall in memory of Mr. Jindrich Mosna, member of the Royal National Bohemian Theatre of Prague, Knight of the Order of Francis Joseph I., who died May 6, and is the never-to-be forgotten patriot of the Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>This occasion was arranged by the Ludvik Dramatic Company, in order that the Bohemians of Chicago might have an opportunity to pay tribute to one of the greatest and oldest sons of Bohemian Thalia.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ludvik, director of the Ludvik Dramatic Company, opened the exercises by welcoming the gathering, and referring to this funeral service as befitting the darling of the Bohemian theatrical Muse. Mrs. Ludvik then introduced the speaker of the occasion, Dr. Jaroslav Vojan, who at length, introduced significant data from the life of the deceased. Following this, Mrs. Ludvik read a letter which Mr. Mosna sent on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary jubilee of the actor's life. Mr. Ludvik had invited Mr. Mosna to come to Chicago upon this occasion.</p>

   <p>The contents of the letter were followed with great interest by everyone, and there were many with tears in their eyes.</p>
   <p>The singing societies, "Cesko Delnicky" (Bohemian Workingmen's), and "Karel Marx," which had promised to take part, failed to arrive. The ceremony was ended at this point.</p>
