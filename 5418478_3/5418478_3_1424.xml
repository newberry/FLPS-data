<title level="a">A MESSAGE TO CZECH CATHOLIC FORESTERS AND MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC WORKMAN</title><title level="a" type="sub">(From the Committee on Bazaar tents)</title></bibl>

   <p>Brothers: Great, glorious days for Czech Chicago are drawing near. The Bazaar, sponsored and arranged by the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, will be in full operation within two weeks.</p>
   <p>The Order of Catholic Foresters will conduct its own tent. The Catholic Workman has joined the Foresters in this undertaking. Many things are needed to run this tent. It is the duty of every Catholic Forester and Catholic Workman to contribute his share.</p>
   <p>Many brothers have delivered their gifts, but many have not done so as yet.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1425.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To this latter group we turn at a time when it is a question of "to be or not to be" for our nation, and when a war to the last ditch is being fought between the oppressed and the oppressors. This Bazaar will help to provide financial means in the fight for Czech independence! It will also help to support families of our soldiers and the widows and orphans of our volunteers who have given their lives while fighting in the Czechoslovak Army.</p>
   <p>Our old homeland calls, and all good sons hasten to provide succor. Czech soldiers are fighting in France, Russia, and England. Many of them may be dead by now. Czech and Slovak prisoners of war, after they had to fight on the Austro-Hungarian side, are flocking under the banner of the Czechoslovak Army, and so are the American Czechs. Our brothers and sisters in Bohemia are appealing to us, for they are depending on the aid from Czech America. We who were so fortunate to come to this land of liberty must not shrink from financial sacrifices.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1426.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Brothers, we implore you to support the Bazaar with all your power. Do not wait until members of the committee come to solicit your help. Bring or send your gifts for the tent of the Catholic Foresters and The Workman to any of the addresses given below.....</p>
   <p>B. Milota, chairman;</p>
   <p>J. Bily, treasurer;</p>
   <p>J. Rimnac, secretary of the tent committee, 2540 South Trumbull Avenue.</p>
