<title level="a">MAJ SINGING SOCIETY GIVES CONCERT</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>The Maj, a singing society composed of young Czech-American ladies, gave a concert last night which was crowned with great success. The club was founded by pupils of the singing school of the Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Czech Workingmen's Chorus). The new club introduced itself to the public as a body independent from the elder organization; judging from the impression their youthful endeavor produced upon the public, this performance shall not be the last one. The hall of the Plzensky Sokol [Sokol gymnastic society of the Pilsen district] was crowded by a receptive and grateful audience.</p>
   <p>The lion's share of credit for the accomplishment is to be adjudged to Mr. Joseph Houdek, who is one of our best music directors. Not the Maj (May) alone, but the singing school as well, prospers under his baton.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0916.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Maj sang two numbers of the program, "Nasim Zenam" (To Our Women), by Malat, and a trilogy of very effective songs. Assisting at the concert, the Czech Workingmen's Chorus rendered a medley of folk songs. The pupils of the singing school appeared with a number of songs, each of these drawing fervent applause, especially "Rodna Ma Vesnicka" (The Little Village Where I Was Born), "Kdybych Mel Houslicky" (If I Had a Little Fiddle), and "Hle, Prijde Maj" (Behold! May is Coming), all three by Mr. Houdek whose name as a composer is firmly established; we are certain to meet very often with his compositions in the future.</p>
   <p>Miss Xenia Weicher, pianist, graduate from the Prague Conservatory, played Liszt's "Dance of the Elves," and "Capricioso," by Brahms. Miss Rudis offered the "Faust Phantasy," for the violin, by Sarasate.</p>
