<title level="a">OLD CZECH COUNTRY FESTIVAL A SUCCESS</title></bibl>

   <p>The Staroceske Posviceni (old Czech country festival) held on Sunday by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) met with such success as must have warmed hearts of all who were interested in the progress of our Bohemian school system. The Sdruzeni has for a number of years endeavored to keep the system up to a high level, and this was not easy when we consider that it involved great expense--debts which were liquidated chiefly by contributions made by our patriotic societies.....</p>
   <p>The festival was to provide more of such support for those educational institutions of ours which are so important to our national life. Those countrymen who attended it were not only highly entertained but, at the same time, discharged their duty towards these schools in which a national feeling is aroused in our children, and where these children have an opportunity to learn the language of their parents.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1255.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The festival proper was preceded by a parade which started from the Vojta Naprstek School, crossed 26th Street and proceeded to Pilsen Park where large crowds of our countrymen had assembled. Soon the festival was in full swing. The festival committee provided various attractions such as booths in which all kinds of delicacies were sold; and it need not be emphasized that there was much buzzing activity around these places, just as at an old country festival. The committee deserves full recognition for their great work; thanks also are due to those who in any way contributed to the success of the venture.</p>
   <p>It is indeed desirable that those people who derived so much pleasure from this festival last Sunday continue their interest in the welfare of our schools and aid the work which the Sdruzeni is doing so that it might continue to develop.</p>
