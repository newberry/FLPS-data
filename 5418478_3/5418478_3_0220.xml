   <p>Chicago Czechs are progressing satisfactorily in every sphere of endeavor, and Czech banks can be classed among the best managed and most successful. This group of banks has just been enlarged by a new one, which bears the name, "Southwest Savings Bank", The proprietors are two young, but tried and proved countrymen. They are Messrs. Louis J. Krejčí and Joseph J. Kroupa. Mr. Krejčí, up to the present time, had a prosperous real-estate business on the premises which the bank is taking over, by which he gained many business and personal friends. Mr. Kroupa is a capable lawyer and gained much valuable banking experience in his long association with the oldest Czech banking institution. [The Kaspar State Bank.] Both young bankers were born in Chicago, enjoy general popularity and confidence, and it is quite certain that their banking business will flourish and grow. Everyone who turns to them will be served quickly, accurately, and honestly. In the savings <pb facs="5418478_3_0221.jpg" n="2"/>department, deposits of one dollar or more are accepted and interest is paid at the rate of three per cent.</p>
   <p>The real-estate business will be continued. Loans will be made with the most advantageous conditions; mortgages and insurance will be sold--in fact they will handle all transactions of this nature.</p>
