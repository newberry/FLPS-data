   <p>Last Wednesday was the day scheduled for the Svatovaclavska Pout (St. Wenceslaus Pilgrimage) for the benefit of the Utulna Svateho Benedikta (St. Benedict Old People's Home.) It was held under the auspices of the Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (District Federation of Czech Catholics) in Pilsen Park on West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. After the lively publicity given the Pilgrimage by the Svaz it was to be expected that the attendance would be most satisfactory, and consequently a considerable profit will be added to the coffers of the institution.</p>
   <p>Even before noon a multitude of people began flocking into the Park, which in the early afternoon took on the appearance of a true pilgrimage place, so filled with people that they were like bees in a beehive. They were walking hither and yon between the rows of stands and booths abundantly <pb facs="5418478_3_1288.jpg" n="2"/>supplied with useful household goods donated by our generous businessmen, and very few articles had to wait long for a buyer.</p>
   <p>The afternoon was filled with an interesting program consisting of musical selections most successfully presented by a band of pupils of St. Procopius College of Lisle, Illinois. Also interesting was the drill of the youth of the several participating parishes performed under the leadership of local teachers. Before dusk, the place became the goal of friends of those actively participating and the general public, so that the Park became filled to overflowing.</p>
   <p>The evening program was held in the pavilion and pleased everybody. It was opened by Mr. Tesar, director of the office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Federation of Czech Catholics), who delivered a short and most fitting address on the significance of the day's celebration. His talk was followed by a musical selection after which a dance number by a wee <pb facs="5418478_3_1289.jpg" n="3"/>little girl fascinated the audience, and was rewarded by enthusiastic and well-merited applause.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker of the day was the Reverend V. Mikolasek of Lankin, North Dakota, who in kind response to the invitation by the Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku undertook the long trip in order to make his contribution to a good cause. He is one of our very best speakers. His speech centered in the appreciation of the fine work done by the Utulna Svateho Benedikta and the plea to our public for not only occasional but continued support of the organization.</p>
   <p>The principal number of the whole program was the appearance of our well-known and popular violin virtuoso, Miss Hedvika Kovarik, who undertook a long journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to contribute to the success of the day. She had been stopping in St. Louis while on tour with a group of artists whom she joined some time ago. We have written about her on other occasions, <pb facs="5418478_3_1290.jpg" n="4"/>and today we cannot do more than again to stress the fact that our public may be justly proud of having in her an accomplished artist who will no doubt have a very brilliant future. Accompanied on the piano by Miss Moser, she presented a number of musical gems that were most enthusiastically received by the attentive audience.</p>
   <p>The Pout was an occasion for a contest of collections by the various participating parishes, the money to go to the Utulna. It was managed by the tireless worker and zealous leader, Reverend F. Bozek, chaplain of the Parish of St. Cyril and Methodius. As in the case of everything he ever undertakes, it turned out a fine success, and will bring the Utulna a considerable amount of cash. The St. Procopius parish was first, the second in generosity proved the Parish of Sv. Anezka (St. Agnes), the third, the Parish of St. Cyril and Methodius.</p>
   <p>Our account would not be complete if we were not to mention the splendid <pb facs="5418478_3_1291.jpg" n="5"/>work of the organizing committee and the tireless efforts of the ladies who have done all they possibly could to assure the success of the affair. They have every reason to be fully satisfied.</p>
