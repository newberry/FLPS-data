   <p>The Český Umĕlecký Klub (Bohemian Arts Club), which was founded in January, 1912, will complete ten years of activity this month. It is the first club of its kind among the Bohemians of America that can boast of such an anniversary. Among its active members, the club numbers sixty artists and painters, sculptors, architects, musicians, and literati, as well as playwrights. There are two honorary members on its membership roll--one of them, Count Luetzow, died recently; the other one is the president of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomáš G. Masaryk. (In the diploma issued to him in the spring of 1916, the club expressed its unalterable faith in Czech independence, and that occurred during the days when such independence was thought by many to be impossible). Besides these men there is a large number of contributing members. During its first decade, the club has arranged four art exhibitions; a small exhibit at the University of Chicago in cooperation with the Českoslovenakĕ Národní Sdružení (Czechoslovak National Alliance); <pb facs="5418478_3_0600.jpg" n="2"/>various soirees and concerts to honor the memory of Mikuláš Aleš, to whom the club also sent an honorary gift of money. It also honored the memories of Shakespeare, Vrchlický, and many others. The club arranged a concert by Boza Umirov and an exhibit of the works of Alfons M. Mucha, etc.</p>
   <p>At a meeting held on Wednesday, January 18, the post president of the club, Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, called the attention of the members to the anniversary, advising them to commemorate the occasion by heightened club activity during this current year.</p>
   <p>At an election immediately thereafter, the following men became members of the executive committee: Frantíšek Horlivý, president; R. J. Pšenka, vice-president; Josef M. Mrázek, secretary; Čestmír J. Svoboda, treasurer; K. L. Jež, archivist.....</p>
   <p>A letter of thanks was sent to Mr. Šuster, manager of Newcomb, Macline, and Company, for his active interest in care of the last exhibit which the club</p>
