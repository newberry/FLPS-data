  <body>
   <p>The managing board of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) has arranged a splendid bazaar, the proceeds of which will be used for the preservation of their own hall located at 1126 West 18th Street. The many friends of this historically famous old building should visit it. The Spolky hall is one of our oldest nationalistic and club centers, in which our public and social life was concentrated for many years. It has fond memories for a great many of our countrymen and club workers, and there is a lively interest to preserve the historic institution for future times. The board of managers of the Spolky hall is tireless in its efforts to retain it for all the important nationalistic and charitable activities of our Czech organizations, and these efforts ought to be fully appreciated by every one of our countrymen. It is therefore anticipated that the bazaar which is given for the benefit of the Spolky hall will be well attended.</p>
   <p>.....The bazaar is well equipped with a great number and variety of beautiful <pb facs="5418478_3_1250.jpg" n="2"/>and valuable objects, and, as an additional incentive for attending, there are many entertaining items on the program. The question of questions now is the one which will be answered by the award in the form of a beautiful American flag. Which one of the societies will win the award? The bazaar, which has been on for several days, will terminate tomorrow night with a splendid ball. The admission to this last event is fifty cents.....</p>
