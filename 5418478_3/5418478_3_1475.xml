   <p>The greatest Czech-American patriotic enterprise ever arranged was the Bazaar of the Czech National Alliance in Chicago from March 3 to 10. The idea originated in the branch of the Czech "California" district. A committee of three had been chosen in the year 1916, and it was enlarged so that the first meeting held on November 4, 1916, was a remarkable success. The county committee of the Czech National Alliance took up the idea, and a large-scale affair was expected to be planned. Mr. Benes suggested inviting Mr. J. Doubrava of New York, and after the latter's arrival here, the original plans for the bazaar were changed. Expectations rose, and within a short time all of Czech Chicago was under the spell of the bazaar idea. Organizations and individuals began to work for the bazaar feverishly; they became so numerous that our limited space does not permit mention of them, however well known they may be.....</p>

   <p>Reservations for stands and tents poured in so fast that the floor layouts had to be redrawn several times...</p>
   <p>There were many attractions, such as the Bazaar Queen, the cabaret "Black Cat," and countless others. The scene of the "Black Cat" will surely be remembered a long time by the visitors. In it one found an endless variety of entertainment: singing, orchestral music, dancing, and recitations. Our most talented artists offered their services....</p>
   <p>The cabaret, under the direction of Mr. R.J. Psenka, was located in the cozy tearoom where young Czech girls acted as Japanese waitresses under the guidance of Mr. John A. Cervenka, the Bazaar Queen. Her election was a spectacular event, and after being pronounced Queen, the popular lady exclaimed: "If I should be so fortunate as to see the Czechs liberated, I would undertake a pilgrimage to their country as if to worship at a holy shrine!"</p>

   <p>Many beautiful objects won in the raffle were returned by the lucky ones to help fill the chest for the national cause. A great deal could be written about the generosity of our people at the bazaar.....</p>
