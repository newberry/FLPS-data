   <p>To the Czech singers, whether they belong to singing clubs or not! The Czech National Alliance is making preparations for the "Czech Day" at the University of Chicago on November 7 of this year. Czech song is to be one of the main features on that occasion. The cantata, "The American Flag," by Antonin Dvořák, has been selected for presentation, because it has a deep meaning for both Americans and Czechs.</p>
   <p>The Czech Central Singing Union has already begun to rehearse the composition, but a larger attendance is needed in order that the singers can appear before the Americans in impressive numbers.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, the Czech National Alliance and the Czech Central Singing Union are appealing to all Czech singers, in or outside singing circles, to <pb facs="5418478_3_0899.jpg" n="2"/>appear at the rehearsals which are conducted by Mr. J. Houdek. All those who harbor a trace of love for Czech song in their hearts must join this project.</p>
   <p>We have always prided ourselves upon the triumphs of Czech song achieved all over Europe, whether it be in Paris, France, or elsewhere. Let us prove our enthusiasm for music which surges through our veins with inherent power!</p>
   <p>Let us attest to the beautiful phrase in Smetana's opera "Dalibor": "Where, indeed, is the Czech who would not like music?" Our great composers--Smetana, Bendl, Dvořák, Novák, and others--wrote the music because they knew there would be people to sing it. They did not compose by the grace of, and for foreign lands; they did it for the Czech people.</p>
   <p>The next rehearsal will be held in Mr. Sokolovský's hall, 18th Street and Laflin Street, at 8 P.M. The question of whether or not "The American Flag" will be sung depends upon the attendance at this rehearsal. If the decision should be negative, it would certainly indicate a sad state of affairs.</p>
