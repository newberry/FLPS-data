  <body>
   <p>A thrift campaign has been launched in Cicero by the Western State Bank, a Bohemian banking institution, located at 56th Avenue and 22nd Street. The purpose of the campaign is to secure more than one thousand persons who would be willing to open a savings account which is connected with life insurance. It is an excellent plan which has withstood the test in other states, and there is no doubt that the advantage of it will be recognized by Bohemian citizens of Cicero.</p>
   <p>According to this plan, a monthly deposit of approximately $7.67, depending on the person's age, will open a savings account for the depositor. The account will be payable in ten years, including savings and interest, and at any time in case of death, the sum of one thousand dollars will be paid to the survivors. It is a so-called "victory account". Any person between ten and fifteen years of age may open such an account at any time at the Western State Bank.</p>
