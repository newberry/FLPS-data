   <p>p.1.--When, four years ago, the first stone was laid for the building of the Pilsen Brewery, we suggested in our report that it would greatly enhance the prospect of the enterprise if the remaining lots were used for the creation of a park along the lines of the beer gardens in the city of Prague which serve as social recreation centers. The well meant hint was appreciated by the Pilsen Brewery which has now begun with the preliminary work, progressing so rapidly that next year there will be opened the new Czech park on 26th street and Albany avenue. It is to bear the name of Pilsen Brewing Park, and is expected to become a center of social gatherings unique in its kind.</p>
   <p>The capacity of the park is calculated at fifteen thousand persons. It is to be noted that the entire enterprise is not only planned by Czechs, but owned and conducted by them; every contract involved has been awarded to Czechs.</p>
