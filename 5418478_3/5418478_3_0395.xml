   <p>It will be ten years, next spring, since the blond-haired "king of the violin," Mr. Jaroslav Kocian, was among us. Much has happened since that time not only on the chessboard of the world but likewise in the field of art and music. Here in America, for instance, one may feel the influence of Auer's New York school, a school which gave a start to several highly talented musicians. New names appeared on the American music horizon, names such as Zimbalist, Elman, Seidl, Heifetz and other virtuosos who, thanks to their art and sound publicity, fill the houses with eager audiences whenever they give a concert.</p>
   <p>But the man who has not undergone a great deal of change during the decade is our man Kocián, a pupil of Anton Dvořák and Professor Ševčík, and former formidable rival of Jan Kubelík. The former [Kocian], in spite of the new rivalries, remains a master of the divine instrument. It may be that his <pb facs="5418478_3_0396.jpg" n="2"/>playing lacks the former youthful vigor which characterized his previous appearances--his first and second American tours--but otherwise by his lyric, his violin technique, and by his interpretation, he still retains the place of honor and distinction which he gained previously. Such, at least, was the unanimous opinion of those who attended his concert yesterday in the Sokol Chicago Hall. The attendance was so great that not a seat was left unoccupied.</p>
   <p>An artist of Kocián's type belongs, of course, to the realm of the [Chicago] Loop....and yet his playing in the Czech neighborhood of the city did not in any way detract from his artistic worth. The artistic level, the enthusiastic audience, and a critically analytical and professional evaluation of his playing were all to be found even here.</p>
   <p>Although the program was to start at 2:30 P.M. it was not until past 3 P.M. that our master appeared on the platform. He was greeted with a veritable storm of applause. Kocian chose for his opening number the unusually <pb facs="5418478_3_0397.jpg" n="3"/>difficult composition of his own teacher Anton Dvorák, the "Concerto in A Minor". This choice was an exceedingly happy one, for there are few works which would offer an opportunity to an artist to use all of his artistic qualities. Dvorák's concerto gives such an opportunity. Kocián played all three of the movements, and when he reached the closing bars of the allegro, and effectively finished the coda with a brisk passage of his bow....the audience voiced its approval by a great demonstration. There were four or five curtain calls and still the applause continued.....</p>
   <p>After a respite lasting only a few minutes Kocian reappeared, this time to play Mendelssohn's "Concerto in E Minor," consisting of three movements which its great sentimental author filled with so much musical beauty and techincal difficulties, that it remains to this day in spite of belonging to an earlier romantic period, the gala number of many a violinist.....Other numbers that deserve special mention were some of the works of the great genius Bach--a minuet, an andante, and a prelude. Without undervaluing the works of other violinists, we may say that Mr. Kocián is without doubt one of the greatest <pb facs="5418478_3_0398.jpg" n="4"/>interpreters of Bach's music. This part of the program was played by Kocián without piano accompaniment; such a venture may be undertaken only by a confident virtuoso. This was so pleasing that he was obliged to give two encores.</p>
   <p>The numbers which followed were Dvořák's Slavonic dance, [Translator's note: The report does not specify which.] Suk's "Poem" arranged by himself, and Ševčík's "Holka Modrooká" ("Blue-eyed Wench") in which the world famed music teacher gave a shining example of the great possibilities which a simple folk song offers to a violin virtuoso who desires to display his violin acrobatics--the double and triple harmonics, etc. All these possibilities were displayed by Kocian in the best sense of the word.</p>
   <p>An artist of such high caliber as Kocian must have an artist also for his piano accompaniment. This was Mr. Vladimír Polívka, who, though modest in all of his ways, is an artist of the highest type. Mr. Polivka played several solos, such as the "Jarní Píseň" (Spring Song) and the Slovak folk <pb facs="5418478_3_0399.jpg" n="5"/>song, "Muj Máj" ("My May"), both composed by Novák, and Suk's adagio.</p>
   <p>To inject greater variety into the concert, our Česko-Dĕlnický Pĕvecký Sbor Lyra (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society "Lyre") contributed several splendid and poetic renditions of famous Bohemian choral masterpieces by Smetana and Malát.....</p>
