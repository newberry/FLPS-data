   <p>Yesterday was a memorable day for the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Bohemian Dramatic Association). Throughout a full score of years, the Association has been active in our Bohemian-American metropolis, and yesterday an opportunity was offered to our public to show its appreciation of the sincere efforts and untiring, diligent work which the Association has devoted to the promotion and development of Bohemian dramatic art in Chicago. Out of beginnings beset with difficulties, doubts, and disappointments, an important national institution has been constructed of which all true theater lovers may justly be proud. To start a permanent theater, and what is more important yet, to keep it going, is not such an easy task. In fact, with the exception of the Germans, no other national group in Chicago has succeeded in this endeavor--and the Germans had infinite difficulties with the upkeep of their truly artistic theater. Even a few years ago there were grave fears that their regular performances--at that time the theater played only on Sundays--would have to be discontinued in spite of the fact that the Germans are the strongest group of immigrants in Chicago. But our people cling to the <pb facs="5418478_3_0804.jpg" n="2"/>theater with true love and realize its value as one of the most important and effective national institutions. This fact was in the mind of the founder of the permanent Bohemian theater in Chicago, Mr. Frantisek Ludvik, and of his self-sacrificing, always active wife, both of whom have given years of hard work and persistent effort to keep their theater going and raise it to the highest possible degree of perfection. Yesterday's celebration proved that the sincere endeavor and tireless toil of this group of actors has achieved greater success than its founders may ever have dreamed of.....</p>
   <p>As we have already said, yesterday's anniversary was a general success, complete beyond the highest expectations. The public which filled the Garrick Theater in the afternoon and Thalia Hall in the evening was thrilled by the faultless performance.....</p>
