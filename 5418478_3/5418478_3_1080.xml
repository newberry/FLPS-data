  <body>
   <p>A theatrical performance by the children attending our Free Thought schools was given yesterday afternoon at the Sokol Chicago Hall, and in spite of the fact that hot weather prevailed, the attendance was large. Those who attended were entirely satisfied, for they enjoyed a beautiful children's play that was excellently presented, and had the satisfaction of knowing that they had financially helped our schools.</p>
   <p>The young amateurs, under the direction of one of their teachers, Mrs. Eliska Racek, presented a great scenic play called "Honza" (Johnny), with songs and dances; many of the school children participated. The play was smoothly presented. There was a number of girls charmingly dressed as fireflies, large groups of court ladies and gentlemen, many little dancers dressed in national costume, picturesque groups of villagers--this entire variegated group of <pb facs="5418478_3_1081.jpg" n="2"/>children created a deep impression upon the audience. The dances and the songs were taught and drilled by Miss B. Duda, teacher; the stage manager was Mr. Hanus Farsky, teacher; the excellent children orchestra was conducted by Mr. Alfred Kovar. The audience enjoyed a pleasant afternoon by witnessing a fine performance of the young amateurs. The people were pleased by the accomplishment of the school children, and it is only to be wished that they support every project of our Free Thought schools and thereby encourage them to a further activity.</p>
