<title level="a">FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF THE SVOBODNA OBEC (BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT COMMUNITY OF CHICAGO)</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday the auditorium of the Husuv Jubilejni Dum (John Huss Memorial Building) witnessed an unusually enthusiastic audience of our countrymen and their children who came in large numbers to prove that they are interested not only in the success of the fiftieth anniversary celebration itself, but also in the success of the bazaar which is arranged in connection with the celebration. The celebration was scheduled to last three days, and yesterday, Sunday, the main event was held.</p>
   <p>Long before the afternoon program started, people began to arrive from all parts of the city, and soon the Husuv Jubilejni Dum, 4236 West 22nd Street, was filled to capacity. Before the program started, a picture of all the members of the Svobodna Obec was taken by Mr. Maly, photographer, whose studio is located at Ridgeway Avenue and 26th Street. Mr. Joseph W. Egermayer then opened the program with a brief speech. After his speech, the children attending the <pb facs="5418478_3_1315.jpg" n="2"/>Maticni Skola (a Bohemian Free Thought school), under the direction of their teacher, Miss M. Eliska Zeman, sang a number entitled "Vitezna Cechie" (Victorious Bohemia). This was followed by a tableau.....</p>
   <p>The program continued with an address by the principal speaker of the afternoon, Mr. Vaclav V. Petrzelka, official orator of the Svobodna Obec. Mr. Petrzilka, in a lengthy speech which attracted the attention of the audience, discussed the significance of the two pioneers and leaders of our freethinkers in America, Professor Ladimir Klacel and Frantisek Boleslav Zdrubek. The speaker recounted the difficult period of the beginning of our Free Thought movement in America. He also pictured the hardships and sufferings of those who, being directed by the motto of our never to be forgotten Klacel, "Osmelme se zmudreti" (Let us be not too wise), propagated his teachings and philosophy, and who often reaped only ingratitude for their good will. Following the lecture, Mr. V. Carhoun and Mr. A. M. Grill rendered a violin number, "Pozdrav ze Sumavy (Greetings from Bohemian Forest), which was faultlessly executed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1316.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The afternoon program was followed by the bazaar, the center of which was a booth decorated with a number of valuable articles, attracting the attention of prospective buyers from all parts of the building. The bazaar activity veritably hummed as though touched by a magician's wand, drawing to it all those who were present. Judging from all this activity, the proceeds of yesterday's bazaar were assured, and it is only to be desired that the profit be as great as possible since the purpose of the bazaar--the amortization of a mortgage which still encumbers the Husuv Jubilejni Dum--requires it.</p>
   <p>The evening program opened with a piano solo, presented in an artistic manner by Miss B. R. Tichy. This number was followed by a solemn recitation by Mrs. A. Stajer. The well-known national and association worker, Mr. Joseph Jurka, then spoke on the future of the Free Thought movement. Following Mr. Jurka's speech, the activity around the booths was resumed in a lively fashion and articles on exhibit were rapidly sold. Liveliness and feverish activity reigned until late into the night when the visitors finally betook themselves to their homes, determined that today, Monday, they would go to <pb facs="5418478_3_1317.jpg" n="4"/>the Husuv Jubilejni Dum again to listen to a beautiful program and to spend a few more dollars for the benefit of their representative building, their only Free Thought bulwark in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Svobodna Obec, which celebrates this significant anniversary of its foundation, accomplished much for the Free Thought movement during the time of its existence. After being founded through the efforts of Ladimir Klacel him-self, it experienced hard times in its existence, and today it stands as one of the vanguards of the aforesaid movement. By erecting the Husuv Jubilejni Dum, about five years ago, the Svobodna Obec made it possible to establish a Bohemian Free Thought school in its building, a school which is now attended by about thirty pupils. The teacher in the school is Miss M. Eliska Zeman, our well-known countrywoman from Pisek, Czechoslovakia, who, for a period of thirty-five years, taught our children to learn our mother tongue, and whose only modest desire is that our Bohemian parents, all adherents of the Free Thought movement, will at last become conscious of the fact that it is not only in their own interest, but in the interest of the children themselves <pb facs="5418478_3_1318.jpg" n="5"/>to speak the tongue of their forefathers fluently, and therefore finally recognizing this truth, will send their children to this school.</p>
   <p>The Svobodna Obec has, according to the report of its president, Mr. Joseph W. Egermayer, approximately two hundred members. Mr. Vaclav V. Petrzelka has been its third official orator during the fifty years of its existence.</p>
