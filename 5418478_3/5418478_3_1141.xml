   <p>One of the most successful New Year's Day celebrations was held at Sokol Chicago Hall on Kedzie Avenue, where the parents and friends of the pupils of the Vojta Naprstek Free Thought School met to witness a stage play and a mass drill dance with song accompaniment; both were successfully presented.</p>
   <p>The play is called "King of the Lilliputians," and was written by Frantisek Pravda.</p>
   <p>It is very interesting, and is instrumental in giving those who take part in it a good opportunity to speak Bohemian. It also points out the simple truths which are easily understood by children.</p>
   <p>The first act shows the accords and discords of children when at play. The second act takes us to the land of the Lilliputians, where a shoemaker's <pb facs="5418478_3_1142.jpg" n="2"/>apprentice is made a king of the Lilliputians, and a carriage driver, for his misdeeds, is forced into slavery.</p>
   <p>This changing of the social station of the players in this fairy tale gives the children a lesson in the necessity for sociability and equality. The children in this play were drilled and directed by their teacher, Mr. B. Hladky</p>
   <p>The next number on the program was a dance, during which the dancers sang while in an oriental whirl. The young ladies danced with a grace quite natural to young girls.</p>
   <p>After the curtain went down on the play, a dance called "The Dance of the Flowers" was performed by forty-two young girls. This dance was directed by the girls' teacher, Mrs. Hulka. The performers were given a wonderful ovation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1143.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Both teachers received gifts from their pupils. Miss Dolezal made the presentation to her teacher, Mr. B. Hladky, and gave a little presentation speech, and Miss M. Krametbauer made the presentation to her teacher, Mrs. Hulka.</p>
   <p>The large hall was well filled with the parents and friends of these pupils, and the management committee deserves praise for this most enjoyable celebration.</p>
   <p>The following young ladies took part in the second act: Lillie Dolezal, Marie Batek, Libuse Zavrel, Libuse Kanak, Helena Vach, Antonia Veprek, Matilda Iastovicka, Emilie Nemec, Ella Zoubek, Helena Zid, Emilie Lupinka, and Sylvia Krametbauer.</p>
