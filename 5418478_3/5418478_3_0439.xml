<title level="a">MUSICAL SCHOOL CONCERT IN MORTON PARK</title></bibl>

   <p>Yesterday afternoon we attended a concert given by Mr. Prcal's music school. The audience which attended in large numbers was agreeably surprised at the mature performance of all these students of music.</p>
   <p>All the performers were Mr. Prcal's pupils, and they certainly deserve credit for their fine playing. They are a credit to their teacher.</p>
   <p>Every number played was a confirmation of the good reputation of Mr. Prcal's school. There was playing in concert by the pupils; there were also many soloists.</p>
   <p>We also had the pleasure of listening to two professional musicians not members of Mr. Prcal's class; they were Mr. Justin, a trombonist, and Mr. Zima, a pianist, who played Lack's waltz for the piano. Both artists were excellent and were applauded. The teacher played two piano compositions technically very difficult.</p>

   <p>The pupils of Mr. Prcal's School of Music received a chance to be heard publicly, and the large audience received a musical treat. Taken all together, this concert will long be remembered both by the pupils and by the audience. Applause without stint was given to the young musicians.</p>
   <p>Besides the concert numbers played the following school soloists were on the program: Miss Edna Trafalet, Alois Uridil, Jan Seidl, M. Reuter, B. Zbetovsky, Jan Cerny, Emil Andrlik, Karel Topinka, Milton Reuter, Bertram Zbetovsky, Josef Chroust, N. Svoboda, Miss Frances Smutzer, Jiri Zirzow, Miss Ruzena Staab, Miss Emma Cimera, and Miss Libuse Bernasek.</p>
