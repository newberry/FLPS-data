   <p>A hard to believe, but probably true report came yesterday to the relatives of Mr. Vaclav Cervenka, the well-known manufacturer, who recently started upon a trip to visit the old country which he never forgot and for which, in the often times bitter struggle for an existence, he continued to yearn. He left for the old country several weeks ago with his family. The readers of Denni Hlasatel have enjoyed reading his letters from Bohemia, in which as a keen observer, an experienced and intelligent man, in a clever style, he described conditions in Bohemia, writing not only about various districts, cities, and memorable places, but also that which was interesting to him.</p>
   <p>His brother, John Cervenka, Clerk of the Probate Court, suddenly received a cablegram with the following contents: "Father dead, the rest of us are well. Send five hundred dollars immediately."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0236.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The cablegram was sent from Lipsko by the son, George. It carried a return address as follows: Bayarische Strasse, 18, Lipsko. Mr. John Cervenka sent the requested money without delay to the address given, and at the same time requested that he be sent more detailed information as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Cervenka family left Chicago on May 25. The residence is at 1659 South Millard Avenue.</p>
