   <p>P.2, Col.1--This organization held it's seventh annual consecutive meeting and exhibition, yesterday, at Pilsen Park, 26th St. and Albany Ave.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon (Sokol) Mr. J. Pokorny led the younger members in their exhibition of flag, pole and club drills, also several exhibitions on parallel bars and horses. Later they gave a mass drill in general physical exercises. They performed in perfect unison and accuracy, winning for themselves great applause.</p>
   <p>In the evening the adult Sokols were directed by Mr. R. Zak and Mr. A. Barcal. Their first number was a drill, with indian clubs, performed by the women Sokols with great success. The second number performed by the men, consisted of difficult physical exercises on the bar and parallel bars. First, performed individually and later, in a combined demonstration of great physical feats, on all gymnasium apparatus in perfect harmony to music, furnished by the present band of Mr. V. Kriz. The closing number was a general drill by both men and women Sokols, which was vigorously applauded.</p>

   <p>The rest of the evening was spent in dancing to the excellent music of the band.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian people are famed for this notable organization of Sokols, which teaches its members the rudiments of physical development, beneficial towards health.</p>
