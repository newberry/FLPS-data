   <p>The growth of Bohemian building and loan associations in Chicago is certainly surprising. Out of the twenty million dollars on deposit in all building and loan associations in Chicago, the Bohemian associations are responsible for eleven. The Bohemian building and loan associations are managed conscientiously and honestly, but just the same, once in a great while, cases of dishonesty occur which excite the whole Bohemian community and undermine the confidence which the Vypomocne Spolky (building and loan associations) have built up through long years of successful activity. How these isolated cases can be prevented and what reforms should be introduced in order to safeguard the depositors' money against any possible danger, was the subject of a most interesting discussion at a conference of a large number of officers in Bohemian building and loan associations. This conference was attended by a number of state officials connected with the building and loan associations' bureau. As far as we could ascertain, there were present: the chief clerk of that bureau, Mr. Porter; the assistant state auditor, Mr. Fish; the inspector of building and loan associations, Mr. J. F. Bambas; as well as Messrs. Rudolf <pb facs="5418478_3_0188.jpg" n="2"/>Mulač, Karel V. Janovský, A. Macal, F. J. Petru; Attorneys Joseph Z. Kleňha, Michal, and Václav Kleňha; Bankers Frank G. Hájiček, B. Hák, K. Kopecký, J. L. Novák, J. Janda, F. Mencl; Messrs. Rousek, Pohl, Švehla; and finally, the representatives of the four Chicago Bohemian dailies, Denní Hlasatel, Svornost, Národ, and Spravedlnost. The conference was held in the Pilsen Auditorium and was preceded by a banquet which again confirmed the splendid reputation of Mr. Falta's cuisine.</p>
   <p>The discussions were inaugurated by Mr. J. F. Bambas, who had made all the arrangements for the meeting. He introduced Mr. Porter, who, after greeting all those present, came straight to the point. He explained that he was thinking of calling a meeting of representatives of various building and loan associations which would devise and agree upon means of making the associations still more secure than they are at the present time. The meeting will be called in the near future and a large Bohemian group is expected to participate.</p>
   <p>[The article contains a rather detailed report of the discussion of proposals <pb facs="5418478_3_0189.jpg" n="3"/>made by several men present regarding various ways of safeguarding moneys entrusted to building and loan associations.]</p>
   <p>It was close to 11:00 P.M. when the meeting was adjourned by Mr. Bambas.</p>
