   <p>Capek's Violin School is progressing successfully this season and among the pupils are found many of promising talent who through periodical appearances on the concert stage have already proven their ability in violin playing.</p>
   <p>Among this year's more advanced pupils are found Miss Annette Kalbach, Miss Bernice Glenn, Miss Ruby Smith, and Mr. Martin Novacek.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alois Trnka, known to the Bohemian and American public as a talented violin virtuoso, is progressing diligently in his studies under the direction of his conscientious teacher, Prof. J. H. Capek. Mr. Trnka has been engaged as soloist for the concert and entertainment which will be given Tuesday evening, February 19, in the Arcade Theater at Pullman, Illinois, in the interests of the Public Library.</p>
   <p>Professor Capek's violin school is located in the Fine Arts Building at 203 Michigan avenue, Rm. 713. Professor Capek also teaches at his home, 5821 Jackson avenue, Hyde Park.</p>
