   <p>Mr. A. J. Zima has been active for a considerable time in the dramatic section of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, known as the Sdruzeni Ochotnici (United Amateur Actors), and at last night's performance the public took advantage of the opportunity to show its gratitude to him. It was a benefit evening for Zima, and the auditorium was almost completely filled. A large number of visitors came from the ranks of the Sokols.</p>
   <p>"The Galley Prisoner," a very sentimental play, was given. It offered the actors a wide field for the display of their specific talents. Mr. Zima played "Jean Renaud," sergeant in the French army. Mrs. Anton Cervenka appeared in two roles: the sergeant's wife and a duchess' ward. She gave ample proof of her histrionic ability.</p>
   <p>The acting of the entire cast was good throughout the performance. Mr. Zelina conducted the music.</p>
