   <p>Last night was a real Bohemian night at the Coliseum, a beautiful night which gave us much to consider and think over about how different things could be among us if we wanted them to be and if we at least showed more interest. Last night proved that among us there are not only foundations upon which further building could take place, but that there is material here with which to build. A structure built upon these foundations and with this material would not be a structure of temporary beauty, but would arouse interest and attention and be so strong that it would be impossible to destroy it under any circumstance or by the simple caprice of a few individuals.</p>
   <p>It is impossible for us to write about yesterday's concert from a musical standpoint. We are not expertly trained musicians, and our superficial knowledge of music in no way suffices for strict criticism, whereby we would be fooling not only ourselves and our readers, but we would be jesting about <pb facs="5418478_3_0985.jpg" n="2"/>the whole affair.....Therefore we will content ourselves not with any criticism, but with a simple reference--with a plea that our readers accept it as such.</p>
   <p>We doubt that since the time when the Sokol Day was held six or seven years ago, the Coliseum has witnessed such a really Bohemian demonstration as the one last night. The attendance was not as large as it was on that above-mentioned occasion, nor was it as large as it could have been were it not for our carelessness and indifference. However, the demonstration was equally Bohemian, genuine, and sincere, and it would seem to us even more noble and beautiful because Bohemian art, Bohemian song and music in all its strength and beauty, was presented for the spiritual pleasure of Bohemian and non-Bohemians as well.</p>
   <p>Last night was the first of such nights set aside by the management of the Coliseum for music-and song-loving people who live in Chicago. The first <pb facs="5418478_3_0986.jpg" n="3"/>of these evenings was reserved for us Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The Česká Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) took charge of the arrangements for the evening. Credit for the success of of the concert goes to Mr. Anton Vanek, president of the Česká Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota and to Mr. J. Kalaš, their leader.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Česká Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota on its success, and we thank it in the name of our readers for the genuine holiday treat in Bohemian song and music which it brought to all of us.</p>
