   <p>An important and highly honorable task is awaiting Czech singers of Chicago. They have been asked to prepare to appear at and take an active part in a certain event which will show that the Czechs of Chicago are united and conscious of the duty which is imposed upon them in these times of great historical importance. They are expected to heed this call in a manner and intensity which will make this occasion as conspicuous as possible.</p>
   <p>This event is to be extraordinary. It will make every Czech heart thrill with joy. Thousands of our people will convene at one place, and the event will be of such magnitude that it will overshadow even the big event in preparation now, i. e., the Bazaar, which is expected to draw the attention of this whole country.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0415.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our singers have always been first to prove that they are Czechs. Now there will again be an opportunity for them to take the lion's part in a brilliant spectacle which will be inscribed in blazing letters in the history of the struggle for independence of the Czech nation.</p>
   <p>In order to make the participation of Czech singers as intensive as possible, the Central Singing Unit is issuing this call not only to members, of whom every one is expected to appear under any circumstances, but also to our Czech public. The Unit also urges members of other singing organizations and non-members who have had experience in singing to attend the rehearsal, which will be held in Shedd Park, Lawndale Avenue and 23rd Street, Monday evening. The pavilion in Shedd Park is excellently adapted for the rehearsals which will be held there not only by the Central Singing Unit, but by the assembled Czech singers of Chicago. The rehearsals must begin at 7:30 P. M., since the pavilion closes at 10 P. M. On to Shedd Park! Let us meet there with the greatest congregation of Czech singers America has ever seen!</p>
