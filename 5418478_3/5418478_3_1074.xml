   <p>Our great, active, and indefatigable club worker, Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, was honored last Wednesday evening. Mrs. Cervenka is a worthy theatrical amateur, and the public greeted her on this occasion with great enthusiasm. She was literally snowed under with the many flowers brought by her faithful fans. This benefit performance was, as usual, given for purely charitable purposes. The play was "Lydie," a romance of a Russian nihilist woman,..... and Mrs. Cervenka was given the title role, which she played beautifully, giving stress to certain emotional characteristics of the heroine....</p>
   <p>The difficult role of Lydia's father was played by Mr. Janous, who endeavored to do justice to it.....The stage management was in the able hands of Mr. Jindrich Weidner, and the success of the play was partly due to his talent and Zeal.....</p>
