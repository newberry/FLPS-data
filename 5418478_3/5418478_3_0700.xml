   <p>We must use these words so often misused to indicate the success enjoyed by the Homan Theater, located at 26th Street near Homan Avenue, in presenting to our people a Bohemian vaudeville program. The best proof of its success is that the house is always sold out whenever such a program is given on Saturdays and Sundays. The present management of the theater refuted the idea that there is no place for Bohemian vaudeville in Chicago. It is, no doubt, necessary that the program be of high artistic quality to attract the greatest number of theatergoers. In this the management was successful to such an extent that today the Homan Theater is solidly entrenched in the affections of our people. The solo numbers, presented mostly by our foremost vaudeville actors, were supported this week by a one-act comedy which is so funny that you will "split your sides" laughing. Whoever has not seen the Homan show is missing an opportunity to spend time pleasantly which otherwise might hang heavy on his hands.</p>
