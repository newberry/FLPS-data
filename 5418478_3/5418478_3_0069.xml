   <p>A recent number of Leslie's Illustrated Weekly contains an interesting article by Harry A. Mount, entitled "The Ancestors of a Jazz Baby," which deals with the importance and popularity of dolls not only in America but in many other countries, and goes into the history of dolls as far back as ancient times.</p>
   <p>This article is of unusual interest to us Czechoslovaks because the doll and toy industry offers a means of support to thousands of our brothers in the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Such articles as this are being carefully followed by the press and information department of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce because they lead to ideas for the opening of new markets for goods manufactured in the old country.</p>
   <p>In addition to other popular types of dolls in America, there is the latest model called the "Jazz Babies". These dolls are being used as prizes in <pb facs="5418478_3_0070.jpg" n="2"/>all kinds of fairs, amusement parks, and other establishments, instead of the formerly popular candy, cigars, cigarettes, and other small articles. A booth or stand in a Coney Island" or in a "Main Street Pavilion" is much less attractive if it has not a sufficient number of "kewpies," "vamp dolls," and other boy or girl baby dolls. It is not unusual to see all the members of a large family, not excluding "pop," return from a joy ride with one or more dolls each. Their popularity is indicated also by the fact that such dolls are on exhibition in all American homes, right alongside of valuable articles and family souvenirs from photographs to great-grandmother's wedding presents.</p>
   <p>There were fifteen million dollars' worth of American-made dolls sold in America during the last year, in addition to considerable quantities imported from Germany, France, and Japan. The declared value of these imports was $8,000,000. Hence it may be safe to say that the American public consumed eighteen million dollars' worth of dolls last year. No doubt this fact is worth considering by a nation which could secure a large part of this <pb facs="5418478_3_0071.jpg" n="3"/>market if it could make the American public acquainted with the various kinds of dolls, from the simple ones to the most perfect and complicated ones, manufactured in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce of Chicago is doing everything in its power to prepare the field for the importation of various goods from Czechoslovakia, but it lacks both time and money to do so efficiently and at the right time and place. Effective work of this kind requires money and the services of able and experienced men who can devote all their time to the study of the American markets and their development, trends, and tendencies, and who are in a position to make this information available to manufacturers in Czechoslovakia at the earliest moment, and tell them what would be the right time, place, and method of their attack.</p>
   <p>Among so many Czechoslovaks in America, particularly in Chicago and suburbs, there should be enough businessmen and private individuals who are willing to make an effort in behalf of the movement to establish a fund that would assure the continued existence of the Chamber of Commerce, and help in <pb facs="5418478_3_0072.jpg" n="4"/>maintaining a sample room where Czechoslovak manufactures would be on permanent display and receive the attention they deserve by being kept before the American buyers. All this will be discussed in the coming meeting and public lecture to be held Friday night, October 14, and all those who are in any way interested in this matter are invited to be present.</p>
   <p>The speakers of the evening will be members of the Chamber of Commerce who have recently returned from Czechoslovakia. They have promised to give us a true picture of conditions in the new Republic as they have seen them personally. They will discuss business, currency, and other matters, and those who want to get firsthand information on these topics should be sure to come and bring their friends with them. Admission is free. Watch our daily papers for current news from the Chamber, and now be sure to come. The meeting takes place in the Pilsen Park pavilion.</p>
