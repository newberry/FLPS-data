   <p>If the financial success of the first chamber music concert was not entirely satisfactory on account of the inclement weather, the very opposite can be said of the second concert held in the Masonic Temple, Millard Avenue and 23rd Street yesterday. The audience was one of discriminating taste, fully capable of digesting, and so appreciating, the exquisite musical fare offered. The proceeds of the affair will go to the wounded soldiers on the battlefields of France, and to the families of the fallen. Judging from the lively advance sale of the tickets, and the crowded hall, it is apparent that our people are beginning to fully grasp the importance of the financial aid to be extended to the suffering.</p>
   <p>The concert was again under the artistic direction of the well-known pedagogue, Mr. A. V. Cerny. Our popular singer, Miss Jessie Zeman, <pb facs="5418478_3_0433.jpg" n="2"/>and the prominent violin virtuoso, Miss Ruth Ray, were the soloists. The former sang the air from Ichajkovsky's "Maiden of Orleans," with accompaniment of the orchestra, and also a song of Dvorak, "Kdyz Mne Stara Matka" (When Old Mother- -) in perfect form and with great beauty. Miss Ray established her name as an artiste with four numbers: "Prelude and Allegro" by Pugnani in the arrangement by Kreisler; the "Prophet Bird" by Schumann, arranged by Auer; a "Slavonic Dance" by Dvorak, arranged by Kreisler; and finally "Zapadendo" by Sarasate. Mr. Herbert Butler was an excellent accompanist.</p>
   <p>The piano quartette by Dvorak which opened the concert was played by Miss Florence Foerster, Mrs. Ed. J. Freund, Albert Belsan, and A. V. Cerny. Several other numbers of classic and modern music, besides those already mentioned were rendered to the delight of the <pb facs="5418478_3_0434.jpg" n="3"/>audience, which was testified by enthusiastic applause to their willingness to further support the artistic enterprises, so much more as it serves the noble purposes of charity.</p>
