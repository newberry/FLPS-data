   <p>Many of our people crowded the Thalia Theatre last night to acknowledge the art of our foremost dramatic actress Mrs. Otilia Splavec. The artist appeared in one of her great roles "Carmen," which is better known in opera than in drama; the latter is less effective than the opera, but it happens to serve as an excellent vehicle for Mrs. Splavec's unusual talent. The actress recently suffered a heavy blow through the death of her husband. She has recuperated, however, and was able to impart to the character all her artistic passion and power; stormy applause, and floral offerings were her reward. The cast of the Ludvik group played very well under the able stage management of Mrs. Ludvik. Professor Capek had prepared a musical overture and he also furnished other incidental music.</p>
