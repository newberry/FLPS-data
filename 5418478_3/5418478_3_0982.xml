   <p>This year's theatrical season, fortunately, has emphasized operettas. In previous years, an operetta was a rarity in our theaters and was limited mostly to New Year's Eve performances of singing societies. This year however, we have seen three operettas, and all three in the short space of a few weeks. Therefore, it is that much more gratifying to state that their quality was above the average, especially when one realizes that our societies have few singers among them. Last night the České Divadlo (Bohemian Theater) introduced the popular operetta, "Mamzel Nitouche," which many of us certainly remember from the visit of Mrs. Ziegler [a very popular and gay light opera singer from Prague]. The operetta was presented under the name "Slečna Svatoušek" (Miss Saintliness) and was given for the benefit of Mrs. Lhotský....who has reason to be pleased with the moral and financial success of the evening.....</p>
