  <body>
   <p>Bids for the work on the projected building of "Sokol Chicago" were opened at yesterday's meeting of the Building Committee under the chairmanship of Alderman Anton J. Cermak. However, because of the many notations which accompanied the bids, no decision was made. A special committee was appointed to meet with the architect to study the bids. The committee is to report its findings at next Monday's meeting, at which time further discussion will take place.</p>
   <p>(List of bidders is given)</p>
   <p>It is evident from an estimate of the bids received that the construction of the building will cost in the neighborhood of $60,000, which is considerably more than had been expected.</p>
   <p>On the suggestion of architect Novy, the mason work will be divided, and new bids sought. All other bids will be discussed on Monday.</p>
