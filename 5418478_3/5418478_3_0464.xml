<title level="a">NEWS FROM THE WORLD OF ART</title><title level="a" type="sub">The Noted Bohemian Tenor Otakar Mařák is Active With the Chicago Grand Opera</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Before the beginning of the last season of the Chicago Grand Opera, it was announced by the management that the artistic director of the opera, Cleofonte Campanini, succeeded in securing for the season, among other great artists, the renowned Bohemian tenor Otakar Mařák, a former member of the Bohemian National Theatre of Prague, the Comic Opera Company of Berlin, the Court Opera Company of Vienna, and the Royal Opera of Budapest.</p>
   <p>When this report became public, the local Bohemian colony felt happy in the expectation that they would meet a new Bohemian artist whose renown spread rapidly all over the world.</p>
   <p>We all had been looking forward to meeting Mařák, but in vain.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0465.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The season was on, and many operas were produced; but here in Chicago the much advertised Mařák was not seen, simply because he was not billed to appear in any of these performances.</p>
   <p>It was surmised that perhaps he had not left Europe, that his engagement here had been canceled; but that such conjectures were all wrong was proved by an article in "Musical America" of April 18, 1914, where on page 22 we meet with this interesting paragraph:</p>
   <p>"Portland, Oregon, April 6. Last night the Chicago Grand Opera ended here the most successful season of any opera company's performances up to this time.</p>
   <p>"In all, five operas were produced. The first night's performances consisted of: 'Cavalleria Rusticana' and 'Pagliacci,' and the following evenings 'Parsival,' 'Aida,' and 'Tosca'.</p>
   <p>"In 'Parsival' the leading roles were sung by Minnie Saltzman-Stevenson and <pb facs="5418478_3_0466.jpg" n="3"/>Otakar Mařák, both of whom scored tremendous success.".......</p>
   <p>The contents of this report show that Mařák is here in America, and that he is singing with the Chicago Opera Company; and we hope to see him, if not this season, then surely in the next.</p>
   <p>Mařák excels with a most beautiful high tenor voice of a refined timbre and a sweetness almost without equal. He is musically well trained, and no matter where he sings, he never fails to move his audience deeply. He has a repertoire of a richness seldom found among present-day singers.</p>
   <p>[Kocián To Be Here Next Fall]</p>
   <p>Jaroslav Kocián, next to Jan Kubelík the greatest violinist, will again visit us in Chicago next fall, and with this city as a starting point will conduct a concert tour through all of these United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0467.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Kocian will be here from October to April of next year. He now is booked for fifty concerts.</p>
   <p>At present Jaroslav Kocian is in Russia, where he is the recipient of great ovations in artistic circles. His success, we are told, exceeds that of such artists as Schumann-Heink, Paderewski, and Amato.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kocian's art manager and next season's local impresario will be the wellknown trombone virtuoso Mr. Jaroslav Cimera.</p>
   <p>[J. Schubert with Ringling Brothers' Circus]</p>
   <p>Another interesting piece of news has been told us: that our young countryman, J. Schubert, an ex-member of Sokol Chicago, whose parents live at 2704 South Troy Street, has been an artist with the Ringling Brothers' Circus for the last three years. Mr. Schubert is the "Boneless Human Serpent" with <pb facs="5418478_3_0468.jpg" n="5"/>the Ringling Brothers' Circus.</p>
