   <p>make special sacrifices in order to bring about the jubilee performance. The brilliant success of yesterday evening showed that their efforts were not in vain. The moral and financial results showed the esteem in which the work of these pioneer Czech players in America is held.</p>
   <p>No more than a handful of the members of the original group is left today. Besides the late director's widow, Mrs. Bohumla Ludvik, there were Mmes. Betty Kozlansky, Elisabeth Novak, and Christine Horlivy. The latter came to Chicago with the troupe, while she was still a child of tender age, and she appeared in such roles. The three were the only ones whom some of the audience could greet, as they did on that afternoon and evening when the actresses first appeared before Czech Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are certain that among the older people in the audience, there were none who did not think back wistfully to the days of Frantisek Ludvik, that goodhearted director and patriotic pioneer of the theater, or Karel Novak, that excellent artist; Bozena Krikava, tragedienne; the unforgettable Karel Splavec;</p>

   <p>Mrs. Fanuse Lhotsky; and all the others who prematurely had to depart from our first scene. Their places were taken by others, but the memory will ever live in the hearts of a grateful public.</p>
   <p>The management had selected a play characterizing peasant life, Stroupeznicky's "Furianti" (Blustering Fellows). An address by Mr. F. Horlivy, in which the importance and significance of the Czech theater was given a prominent place and emphasis, evoked stormy applause. The "Star-Spangled Banner" was then sung with the accompaniment of the orchestra, directed by Professor Capek, who used to furnish the music for the earliest performances of the Ludvik troupe.</p>
   <p>When the curtain rose, it revealed a genuine stage setting for a Czech village. There were salvos of applause during the first act. During the first intermission, Vojta Benes appeared on the stage to express best wishes for the troupe, and to urge all Czechs to stand firmly behind the President and his administration, and to prove their loyalty by buying Liberty bonds and war-saving stamps.</p>

   <p>A tremendous ovation was given to Mrs. Ludvik after the second act. This meritorious and excellent artist, this sterling soul of our Czech theater, has also been an untiring worker in our Czech national life in America. The presidents of several of the foremost Czech ladies' associations presented her with beautiful gifts and voiced their high esteem and appreciation of her work. The Czech Artists' Club paid high tribute to the achievements and artistic zeal of the Ludvik troupe. Mrs. Ludvik thanked them amidst bouquests of flowers and outbursts of applause, which became tremendous after the third act when the likeness of the late director, F. Ludvik, was shown on the stage.....</p>
