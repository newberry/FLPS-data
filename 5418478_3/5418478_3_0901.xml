<title level="a">CZECH MILITARY BAND FOR UNCLE SAM</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>About two months ago, we called the attention of our readers to the newly formed band which consists of Czech-American musicians. This body known by the name of "Ceska Kapela" [Czech band], offered its services to Uncle Sam and was accepted. It functions as the military band of the Thirty-eighth Infantry regiment, stationed in Syracuse, New York, now.</p>
   <p>A large number of the musicians of this Czech band comes from Chicago. Their performances are highly appreciated by the authorities and and the public as well. This is borne out by a letter sent by a member, Mr. J. Simandl, to his parents, who live at 5006 West 30th Place, Chicago: "We are making a hit; the officers have taken a liking to us as a result of which we have been assured that we shall not be divided as has happened to other bands..... We are improving rapidly, for we have every full morning at our disposal for rehearsals. We give a concert performance every other day. No service of any kind is required of us in the afternoons, and we enjoy our leisure by playing games, or lounging about the tents. Our camp is located ten miles <pb facs="5418478_3_0902.jpg" n="2"/>from town, and so we are in a regular summer resort; we are even developing rosy cheeks! Everything is lovely, and the goose hangs high. Pretty soon we won't be longing for our homes any more."</p>
