<title level="a">FAREWELL CONCERT BY JAN GREGOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It was with a decided feeling of satisfaction that the many guests came away from yesterday's program at Zdrubek Hall on North 40th and Eastwood Avenues, where the youthful Jan Gregor gave a farewell concert prior to his departure next week for the old country. He is going there to complete his violin studies at the Prague Conservatory of Music. Master Gregor, who is only thirteen years old, demonstrated at his appearance yesterday that he has really unusual talent. He proved this in the rendition of several compositions, among which were the "Concerto for Violin in D Minor," by Bruka; Dvorak's "Humoresque," and "In the Twilight" by Fibich.</p>
   <p>Gregor is certainly a talented violinist, and much can be expected of him.....He received his early training in the violin school of the well-known teacher Vaclav Machek, and more recently he attended Mr. J. Hruší's school. Mr. Hruší provided the piano accompaniment for yesterday's concert.</p>
