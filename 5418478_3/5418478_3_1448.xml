   <p>"No matter with what remarkable successes we immigrants have met in business, industry, and politics, there is unquestionably a task of considerable importance left before us, i. e., to acquaint the American public with our achievements in the realm of cultural endeavor. Of these America knows the least, in spite of the strenuous efforts which have been made by us in this direction. Until recently, the Americans knew very little about us, even in the topographic sense; and they knew comparatively nothing of our ambitions in literature, art, and in all those fields of a higher order from which the true intellectual level of any nation may be judged. Systematic work and a specific medium will be needed if we are to know how to use every opportunity and exert proper influence when contact is established with representative men who are sincerely interested in our cultural propaganda work.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1449.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"A real change in these conditions began only recently, at that memorable conference held in May of this year at the University of Chicago. Preliminary plans for Czech Day were discussed there by leaders of the Chicago Czechs and by professors of the University headed by Professor Harry Pratt Judson, president of that institution. Real contact between the Czech element and representative men of American intellectual fields was made at that time, as a result of which we may fairly claim that we have today more sincere friends and protagonists of our ideals, in one of the foremost seats of higher learning on the American continent, that we have ever had before. This success grows in importance when we consider the large number of professors and the ten thousand students who are working at the University. A vast field is offered there for propaganda efforts of the Czechoslovak people--a field abounding with favorable possibilities and auguring splendid results.</p>
   <p>"Through the good offices of President Judson, the Czech National Alliance succeeded in obtaining accommodations in Mandel Hall, one of the most spacious auditoriums on the University grounds, for the display of exhibits and for <pb facs="5418478_3_1450.jpg" n="3"/>performances on Czech Day. The strains of Czech song and instrumental music will fill the air; there will be Sokol gymnastics, the realization of the ideals of our two modern heroes, Fuegner and Tyrs [originators of the Sokol societies]. The students of the University will be given a view of our cultural achievements. This will be done at the exhibition which is limited, true enough, because of lack of space and for other reasons, but which will nevertheless fill its purpose to a perfectly satisfactory degree.</p>
   <p>"This exhibition contains everything that we can proudly point to before other nationalities. In the first place, there is old literature, mostly Reformation literature of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. It was not easy to procure books such as these. They came from Mrs. Anna Janka, of Ely, Iowa, who hails from an old family of scribes. Vojta Benes and the Reverend Pokorny were instrumental in procuring these rare books for the exhibition. There are such works as the Bible Kralicka (Kralitz Bible) and Postilla, as well as some other writings by Jan Amos Komensky. Then there are The Travels of Christoph Harant; The Voyage to Palestine and Arabia; Apology of Czech <pb facs="5418478_3_1451.jpg" n="4"/>Citizenry; Protest against the Ferdinands (written in 1621); and Kancional, a book of Protestant church songs which was rescued from anti-Reformation police and destruction by a Protestant housewife who hid it in dough and baked a loaf of bread around it.</p>
   <p>"There are books written by Melantrich, some from the Veleslavin printing shop, and prayer books in hand printing with artistically executed initials and embossed covers. They represent priceless, irreplaceable antiques. One very old book is The Messenger of Czech Events by Beckovsky. These books create an atmosphere of times long gone by; they are symbolic remnants of old Czech history. The old books section ought to awaken the interest of all the visitors, particularly Czechoslovaks. There is hardly any book in Czech literature which could be deemed worthy to stand beside The Travels of Christoph Harant. The author, who may fairly well be called 'our Czech Marco Polo', paid with is life for his defiance of the Austrian government; he died upon the scaffold in front of the city hall in Prague.</p>
   <p>"In contrast with this department is the exhibition of modern graphic art with <pb facs="5418478_3_1452.jpg" n="5"/>works of Bilek, Ludek Marold, the unfortunate Benes Knuepfer, and the entire new generation of Czech artists. Most of these works were lent by the bibliophile Stanislav Serpan of Omaha, Nebraska."</p>
   <p>Czech literature is represented equally well. The works of outstanding poets and writers appear, some of them in de luxe editions. There is also Ottuv Slovnik Naucny (Cyclopedia), a monumental work and the acme of perfection in language and print.</p>
   <p>Czech painting takes a prominent part in the exposition. It boasts of names of renown, like Mucha, Manes, and others.</p>
   <p>"The part of the exhibition under the auspices of the Slovacky Vzdelavaci Klub (Slovak Educational Club) creates a particularly friendly atmosphere. Large quantities of embroidery and similar hand work of a quality which will fill every connoisseur with admiration will be on display. They are some of the best examples of home industry, of which the Moravian Slovaks and those from the colorful Tatra mountains may justly be proud. There is also painting on <pb facs="5418478_3_1453.jpg" n="6"/>porcelain, some dating back several centuries. Two such plates were painted in 1689. There are also countless eggs with artistic coats of paint....."Numerous mural paintings are to be exhibited; they are the kind which the Slovaks in the old country use to decorate their houses.....Ladies in native Slovak costumes will supply the visitors with necessary information.....</p>
   <p>"We are already in a position to declare that the exposition is a pronounced success, and that it has fulfilled its mission. Although it was formally opened only yesterday, there were throngs of visitors, mostly from the circles of students of the University; it will close November 15. Every fellow countryman should visit the exhibition. It contains values with which we should like to display before the outside world, and which should fill our own hearts with pride."</p>
