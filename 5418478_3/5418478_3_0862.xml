   <p>Our singers, united in the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Bohemian Central Singing Society), appeared before our people in a popular concert held at the Harrison High School auditorium, 24th Street and Marshall Boulevard, yesterday--and it is not the fault of the society that the concert was given almost at the end of the season. Originally the date of the concert was set for April 25 but had to be postponed, as were many other projects, on account of the strike of school attendants. Fortunately the success of the concert was not threatened by this postponement.</p>
   <p>The spacious high school auditorium was host to a large number of people who do not miss an opportunity to hear beautiful voices and music, and it is only proper to state that no one in the audience was disappointed in his expectations, although most of the numbers on the program are generally known to our people. The opening selection was a short choral composition by Dr. J. Greif, a former <pb facs="5418478_3_0863.jpg" n="2"/>Chicagoan who now resides in sunny California. This composition, "Pozdrav Vlasti Cechoslovaku Americkych" (American Czechoslovaks' Greetings to the Native Land), was the only new number on the program. It was presented by a mixed chorus of eighty voices. The singers were greeted by a storm of applause, which of course was the best encouragement to them. This introductory number was conducted by Mr. Joseph Houdek, under whose capable direction the musical beauty of this composition was brought to full prominence. What especially caused a pleasing impression was the splendid uniformity of voices.</p>
   <p>When the last chords of this composition died away, the attention of the audience was concentrated upon the male chorus of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota which sang Tovacovsky's sublime choral, "Vlasti" (Native Land). The singers gave proof of their sincere efforts to express the feeling of warmth which is so essential for this composition. The Cesko Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) sang Vogel's composition the "Cikani" (gypsies), which was the most sympathetically received number on the program.</p>

   <p>There was a long storm of applause, and the audience called for an encore.....</p>
   <p>All in all, it may be said that the concert increased the number of projects--projects which fully satisfied not only the promoters but also the audience--and that they may indeed be called successful.</p>
