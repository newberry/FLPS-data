   <p>There was much activity in the theatrical field during the Christmas holiday season. On some days plays were presented in five different halls, and all of the performances were well attended. Although most of the performances were given by amateurs, most of the acting was remarkably good and the plays were well selected.</p>
   <p>Amateurs rarely repeat their performances, although learning lines and characterizations require much work and time. Amateurs, don't you think that better use should be made of your work and that your rewards might be greater? Would it not be advantageous to you if you did not limit yourselves to only one performance, after having gone to the trouble of studying?</p>
   <p>Suppose the theatrical group in the Pilsen district paid a visit to the little theatre of the Tabor district, to "Bohemian California," or Town of Lake? If these visits were returned, if the groups frequently exchanged <pb facs="5418478_3_1202.jpg" n="2"/>friendly visits, thus fostering a co-operative spirit, we believe that the theatre interests of the individual Czech settlements of Chicago would derive lasting benefits. In this way, the amateurs could offer a more varied, colorful, program with alternating performances. They would not have to study too many new plays in one season, and thus they could conserve valuable time which they could apply to the penetration of characters and the painstaking mechanics of staging.</p>
   <p>This suggested collaboration would naturally have to be worked out systematically, and all the Czech amateurs of Chicago would have to join forces for the creation of one large theatrical family.</p>
