   <p>The Chicago City Council recently appointed a committee to investigate the reasons for continuous rent increases, which must be paid by all who want to dwell in decent quarters.....</p>
   <p>Among others summoned before the committee last Saturday was our well-known countryman and building contractor, Joseph A.Holpuch, who unhesitatingly stated for the Chicago building contractors that the main reason for the increase in rentals is the laziness of women and men, who, while setting up housekeeping, do not look for such rents as were in demand sometime ago; instead, for their own comfort, less housekeeping work, and other reasons, they look for one-room or, at the most, two-room apartments. When the owner of a house which consists of larger flats sees that tenants are willing to <pb facs="5418478_3_0117.jpg" n="2"/>pay one hundred dollars a month for one or two-room apartments, he comes to the conclusion that he is losing money by not getting as much or more for his five or six-room flat. For this reason, then, the owner increases the rent. Mr. Joseph A. Holpuch himself knows only one remedy, and that is that the people build houses for themselves only, that is, bungalows, or two- or three-story apartment houses with flats as large as were in demand until recent times.</p>
   <p>From his own experience he then related that, in the past six years, the Chicago building contractors have been erecting mostly one, two, or, at the most, three-room apartment buildings. In the past year the demand for one-room apartment buildings was the largest. If such conditions continue, then he does not know what the results will be. He himself is convinced that in the near future, people will not care to live anywhere else, but in tents, public parks, etc....</p>
