   <p>P.1--A concert was given in the Auditorium Recital Hall yesterday evening, by the pupils of Prof. J. H. Capek's School of Music, which pleased a large concert loving audience, proving clearly, the esteem in which Capek's school is held. The program was divided into two parts, both of which were remarkably executed. The second part of the program was especially well liked and the audience showed its appreciation with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was a violin quartet, composed of Milan Lusk, Sam Kruty, Elmer Capek and Karel Novy. They played the Larghetto by Spohr.</p>
   <p>The second number "Souvenir" by Drdla was played by Miss Iona Wyse.</p>
   <p>Miss Beatrice Jonas, John Fernow and Elmer Capek then played several solos. The entire school played several orchestral selections.</p>
   <p>It should be said, that the concert was very succesful; the performance of various individuals of the entire group was proof of the energy and efforts of Mr. Capek.</p>
