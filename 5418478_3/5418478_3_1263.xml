   <p>The Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage), which was held last Sunday for the purpose of raising a fund to purchase a Sokol athletic field, was successful above all expectations. It proved to be highly satisfactory to the committee on arrangements and to all our countrymen who attended. The Pout proper was preceded by a parade which started in the afternoon in front of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs; it passed up 27th Street to Crawford Avenue, then over 26th Street to the Pilsen brewery. During its entire course, the parade was greeted by thousands of people who followed its gay pageantry of paraders and floats with interest. The parade was headed by three brave lads on horseback, dressed in peasant costumes. Following them came Mr. Rubringer's band, then the police, the members of the Slovacky Vzdelavajici Klub (Slovak Educational Club), and finally a number of decorated automobiles and floats. One of the allegoric floats was decorated by the Slovaks, another by the Czech Postal Card Club; both of these floats were distinguished by their picturesqueness and the splendor of the allegorical groups. Before the parade reached its destination--Pilsen Park--it drew great <pb facs="5418478_3_1264.jpg" n="2"/>masses of spectators; the crowd continued to grow so that in a short time the spacious park was crowded and buzzing with activity. Gaiety prevailed everywhere.</p>
   <p>The booths attracted special attention. There were many of them, each more interesting than its neighbor, but all of them enjoyed much popularity among the visitors. Our [Czech] butchers had their booths where they sold hot wieners; they were hard put to satisfy the demands made on them. Another booth, put up by the Vcelky (Little Bees [ladies auxiliary of the Czechoslovak National Alliance]), sold pickled cucumbers and herring. There was a booth selling gingerbread, managed by the Cicero [Bohemian] ladies. Booths were also operated by the Slovak ladies' auxiliary, the ladies of the Pilsen Sokol, the members of the Pohlednicovy Klub Svornost (Travel and Postal Card Club Svornost [Concord]), the Pamatnik Odboje (Revolutionary Memorial), etc.</p>
   <p>Later in the afternoon the grounds were visited by United States Senator Medill McCormick whose visit we mentioned in yesterday's issue; it goes without saying that he attracted wide attention. The Senator arrived in Chicago on <pb facs="5418478_3_1265.jpg" n="3"/>Sunday afternoon and was met at the station by a committee of our Chicago countrymen who took him to the park. He made a brief speech to the visitors at the Pout and was applauded enthusiastically. He could not stay very long for he had to return to Washington on the same night.</p>
   <p>As already stated, the Pout was organized for the benefit of the Sokols and the purchase of a summer athletic field; in this the committee handling the affair was greatly successful, for we may expect that the financial gain will be considerable.</p>
