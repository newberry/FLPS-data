   <p>p. 1--Pelikan Brothers, who own two of the most modern drug stores in the Bohemian settlement, have just bought another store at Twenty-sixth street and Lawndale avenue.</p>
   <p>This store will be remodeled and stocked with high-class drugs and merchandise of the standard always maintained by Pelikan Brothers. Their new store will be managed by Mr. O. Pelikan, the third brother of the Pelikan family.</p>
   <p>A drug store like this has been needed in the vicinity of Twenty-sixth street and Lawndale avenue, since this community is growing rapidly.</p>
   <p>Another reason for establishing it is that the Bohemian population of Chicago is spreading out and settling in this section of the city and naturally prefers to have a Bohemian druggist in the neighborhood.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0286.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Drugs will be available at all hours, day or night, at this store, so that it can serve suffering people at all times.</p>
   <p>Pelikan Brothers hope that the public will patronize this new store as they patronize their other two pharmacies.</p>
   <p>They promise efficient and reliable service in every department of the store, especially in the prescription department, in which only drugs of the highest quality will be used. Prescriptions will always be filled by Mr. O. Pelikan or by a registered pharmacist who will assist him.</p>
   <p>With the permission of Mr. O. Pelikan, one of the largest Bohemian Benevolent Societies, Borivoj, will maintain a branch office in his new store.</p>
