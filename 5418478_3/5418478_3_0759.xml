   <p>It is hard for the average visitor of the theatre to explain the wave of popularity for Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" rising from our present era of moving pictures and burlesques. It is, nevertheless, cheerful news that there was not one seat empty in the Thalia Theatre, where this immortal tragedy of love was represented by a group of actors under the direction of Mr. Ludvik last night From the artistic point of view, it must be said that Shakespeare has not often had easy sailing upon our stages, which circumstance accounts, perhaps, for the comparative rarity of performance of his plays. The public can however, fully content itself with what was offered last night, thanks to the long time devoted to study and rehearsal and to the stage management's great care of the historical atmosphere and detail. The title roles of Romeo and Juliet were, <pb facs="5418478_3_0760.jpg" n="2"/>of course, the cynosure of attention, but it was Mrs. Horliva's Juliet which rose to considerable heights, for it was played with the whole gamut of tender feeling and youthful passion that make this character so difficult to draw. Mr. Dvorak's Romeo became prominent chiefly through the actor's attractive stature and the evidence of hard study; otherwise the figure was lacking the fire we are accustomed to expect in this role. There was a pleasant surprise in store for us in the vivacity and smoothness with which Mr. Stach treated his role of Mercutio; his was not a main role, but he may well consider it one of his best. The playing of the rest of the actors was satisfactory in general; the arrangement of the drama by a certain Miss Marlett may have had something to do with it. A musical entertainment closed the evening.</p>
