   <p>p. 1, col. 3 - The Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society's school of singing and violin playing arranged a concert for their pupils last night at Sokol Chicago Hall on Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street. The purpose of this concert was to show the public that the Bohemian parents are proud of having their children attend this school. The pupils likewise are proud of this school and of their parents who pay the tuition.</p>
   <p>The concert started at 8 o'clock and lasted two hours after which the hall was given over to the public for dancing, which continued till midnight. Mr. Kalas, the director of the violin class, announced that there will be held another concert in the near future; we therefore will be looking forward to the next concert, as this one was certainly enjoyed by all. Mr. Kalas was congratulated for his violin class.</p>
