   <p>p. 1--The annual exhibition of gymnastic exercises by the pupils of Pilsen Sokol, was given yesterday evening, free of charge to the public, at the Pilsen Sokol Auditorium.</p>
   <p>It was to show their accomplishments during the year of training, and much credit was extended to their instructor, Mr. Haller.</p>
   <p>Mr. Haller made strenuous efforts to make excellent gymnasts of his pupils. The pupils performed their exercises with precision and were greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>Mr. Haller was congratulated on his good work as their instructor.</p>
   <p>The exercises began at 8 o'clock in the evening. On the stage stood a big, tall Christmas tree, richly decorated. The two hundred pupils were happy to perform their exercises in the presence of a well represented audience, consisting of their parents and pupils of senior classes.</p>
