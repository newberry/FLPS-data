  <body>
   <p>P.2--All businessmen who have already applied for membership to the Bohemian Ice Association and also those who have not applied as yet, but are forced to buy their supply of ice from the trust are urged to be present at our meeting to-morrow evening at 8 P. M. in Polacka's hall at 535 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>Property has already been purchased at Lake Marie, and the contract for transportation with the railway company drawn up, assuring us all that the trust can no longer offer any resistance to the progress of our enterprise.</p>
   <p>Everything now depends upon the businessmen who are interested in this organization and wish to put a stop to the unfair treatment to which they have been subjected by the trust in previous summers.</p>
   <p>Become members in this association while the membership is still open! The books will be closed next week.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0290.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The construction of ice-houses will also begin next week, and the ice will soon be cut and put into storage, to be used during the summer months by the members of this Association.</p>
   <p>We hope that all businessmen who are interested in this organization will be present at the meeting, which will be the last one before the election of regular officers.</p>
