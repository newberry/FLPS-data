   <p>Yesterday we mentioned the fact that this year is the year for Bohemians in Chicago to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Bohemian amateur theatricals in Chicago. According to some of us, the first performance in Chicago took place March 17, 1863, which date is given in Mr. Václav Lenoch's "Pamĕti" (Memoirs), and will be found even in some of the old records of the Slovanská Lipa [name of the oldest Sokol unit in Chicago--meaning Slavonic Linden Tree]. It seems, however, that our historians of the theater have made an inadvertent error. Announcements in some of the preserved issues of contemporary newspapers indicate that the first performance was given February 22 of that year in the former dance hall on Canal and Van Buren Streets. Of course, they had no stage scenery at that time, and no doubt many other necessary properties were missing. But in spite of all this, the show was a success, which is proved by the fact that several more were put on during that season.</p>
