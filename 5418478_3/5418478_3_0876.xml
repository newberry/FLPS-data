   <p>Miss Mary Kryl, a Czech-American artist who is still in her 'teens, gave a recital in Cohan's Grand Opera auditorium yesterday. The splendid success of this affair causes us some embarrassment, because we fear that in reporting this event truthfully, we will have to resort to superlatives.....</p>
   <p>This was the adolescent artists' first big concert, and she selected a long series of classic and modern compositions for the program....Miss Kryl seems to prefer Chopin, and she won stormy applause for playing his "Sonata No. 36" with its famous funeral march. Compositions by Bach and Schumann were alternated with shorter works by Chopin, among which we must mention "Polonaise No. 53," a touchstone for expert pianists. Shorter numbers, "Caprices" for the violin by Paganini in the arrangement for piano by Liszt, concluded the program. Loud acclaim and floral offerings were showered upon the young lady. Miss Kryl is the daughter of Boh. Kryl, a well-known Chicago Czech orchestra leader and virtuoso on the cornet.</p>
