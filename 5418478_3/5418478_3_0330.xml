   <p>The Building and Loan Societies, whose chief merits are that they have enabled the majority of our countrymen to acquire property, and in that way comparative independence, are finding more and more favor among our people, while among other nationalities, they are declining and vanishing, as is shown by the report of the State Auditor, under whose supervision they come. The main reason for this, lies in the fact that the Bohemian Building and Loan Societies are managed and conducted with small expense.</p>
   <p>During all the time they have existed among us, only two went into the hands of a receiver, and one of these eventually paid ninetyfive percent. The other, through the fault of individuals, paid only fifty percent. In spite of this, the belief in Building and Loan Societies does not weaken. Our people are convinced,that not only can they save money more easily, but that loans made from them can more conveniently be repaid. They themselves have supervision over them. The law gives them this right.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0331.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Building and Loan Societies are under the strict supervision of the State Auditor, to whom the executive officers are answerable because they are under bond. Therefore the Building and Loan Societies are a safe place for everyone's savings.</p>
