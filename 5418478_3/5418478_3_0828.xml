   <p>p. 1--The role of Denis in "Mamzell Nitouche," operetta, was played by Marie Ziegler yesterday at the Garrick Theatre.</p>
   <p>She is a famous Bohemian opera star who has delighted the royal families, as well as people in large cities of Europe, with her wonderful singing and acting.</p>
   <p>Marie Ziegler celebrated her triumph by proving that she really is a great opera star. Her performance fulfilled all expectations to the great satisfaction of the audience.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0829.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>She acts and sings in a natural way, with confidence in herself at all times while on the stage. Marie Ziegler played her role perfectly. Her singing and acting was outstanding.</p>
   <p>Other roles in this operetta were played by Bohemian actors, but their performance could not be compared with that of Marie Ziegler.</p>
