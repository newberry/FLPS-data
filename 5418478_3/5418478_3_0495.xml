   <p>Bohemian-Chicago is enriched by a new Institute of Music, which was established by the young, though distinguished, musicians (artists we should say): Mr. J. V. Soukup, and Mr. Joseph Hladky. Mr. Soukup is a violin virtuoso, a former pupil of Professor Ottakar Sevcik, at the time-honored Prague Conservatory.</p>
   <p>We have had the opportunity to hear his music and admire his art. Mr. Soukup will teach violin according to Sevcik's method, and there is no doubt that his pupils will soon acquire a thorough musical education.</p>
   <p>Piano will be taught by Mr. Joseph Hladky, a former pupil of the famous pianist, Ottakar Malka. Mr. Hladky will teach the method of the <pb facs="5418478_3_0496.jpg" n="2"/>famous piano teacher, Theodor Leschetizky, whose method is the best on earth, without contradiction.</p>
   <p>This new institution is located at 1842 West 47th Street. A branch will be located at Kedzie Avenue and 23rd Street. Pupils are now being accepted, and instruction will begin this week.</p>
