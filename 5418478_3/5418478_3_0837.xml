   <p>The "Passion Play" in Bohemian was presented by the Ludwik Theatrical Company last night at Thalia Hall, Eighteen Street and Allport Avenue. The different scenes of the passion week, the last supper, the betrayal in the garden, the trial before Pilate, the crucifixion, and finally the resurrection, were depicted with great care by the large company of Bohemian players. The part of Jesus Christ was taken by Mr. Horlivy, who was attired in a blue and white robe and wore long hair and beard as represented in the paintings by old masters. The apostle John was impersonated by Miss Splavcova, who wore the yellow hair of a Raphael angel, Judas was arrayed in yellow.</p>
   <p>The audience was deeply affected by many of the scenes, and there were sobs and tears at the parting of Christ from Mary Magdalene and at the crucification scene. The play will be repeated every night this week. The Ludwik Company is composed of actors from Bohemia who present a play every Sunday night at Thalia Hall.</p>
