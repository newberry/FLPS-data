   <p>Last Wednesday, in the regular annual meeting of the well-known Bohemian financial institution, the Kaspar State Bank--a bank which enjoyes a fine reputation not only among our own folk, but also among the Americans and the foreign-language groups--an announcement was made of an increase in capital from $750,000 to $1,000,000. This was done chiefly because of the long-cherished wish of the founder and president of the bank, Mr. William Kaspar, now an aged gentleman. Mr. Kaspar always hoped that some day his bank would become a million-dollar institution. It was also announced in this meeting that the surplus totals $250,000. The news that all employees of the bank will receive a five per cent bonus on July 1, 1922, was accepted with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>During the course of the meeting the indefatigable and steady work of its founder, Mr. William Kaspar, was recalled. The speakers, far from wishing <pb facs="5418478_3_0056.jpg" n="2"/>to flatter him, simply mentioned this fact and, to show appreciation for his efforts, some visible token of it was needed. The board of directors, acting in accordance with the above, presented the aged gentleman with a platinum watch chain and pen knife. Mr. Kaspar, who may be considered one of the youngest and most active workers in the bank, was visibly touched, and thanked the board for its gift. The meeting ended in very good humor and with the knowledge that this Bohemian enterprise will continue to grow, thanks to the support given it by the Czechoslovak people in particular......</p>
