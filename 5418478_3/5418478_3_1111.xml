   <p>Last night Sokol Chicago celebrated the twenty-first anniversary of the foundation of the Vojta Naprstek school, in its hall on South Kedzie Avenue near 24th Street. The program consisted of three parts: J. Srp, a pupil in the fourth grade of the school, recited a prologue; Miss R. Martinek recited a poem, "Magic Whistles"; and the fairy tale "Pernikova Chaloupka" (Gingerbread Hut) was presented in dramatized form and in verses. Albert J. Havranek [news writer], who has interpolated numerous Czech folk songs, arranged the fairy tale.</p>
   <p>The tale tells about two broomstickmakers' children, who, having broken a pot of milk, were sent to the forest to gather strawberries as a kind of punishment. They lose their way, and are caught and held by a witch in a gingerbread <pb facs="5418478_3_1112.jpg" n="2"/>house, who wants to roast and eat them. The children save themselves by their wits: they shove the witch into the oven.</p>
   <p>The school children who made up the cast performed commendably. A chorus of 130 children, all pupils of the school, sang the folk songs. Dances were also presented by the children under the direction of Miss M. Krametbaur.</p>
   <p>The teachers of the school deserve to be singled out for praise for their task of training the children, for the performance was not an easy one. Mr. F. Vlach, one of the staff, bore the brunt of the hard work.</p>
   <p>The house was sold out, and the performers were rewarded with heart-felt applause.</p>
