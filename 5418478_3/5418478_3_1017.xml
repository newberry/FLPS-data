   <p>P.2, Col.1--Brousek's Army Band, celebrated its triumph last night. The concert was held at the pavilion of Pilsen Park, located at 26th St. and Albany Ave. Without any doubt it can be classed among the best and most enjoyable evenings which the music-loving public has witnessed this season.</p>
   <p>The finest selections were played, and executed in perfect harmony, to the satisfaction of all those present. The pavilion was filled to capacity with music-lovers, many of whom, were prominent musicians. We can safely state that, even the most severe critics of music were pleased with the excellent performance of the band.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brousek, the young conductor, is a very talented musician. He plays the cornet as well as any of the finest musicians, (cornetists) of Chicago, and proved this in his performance. His baton is in full control of his band of 35 men, composed of all instruments required for a good band. He also does his own arrangements for each instrument, which is by no means <pb facs="5418478_3_1018.jpg" n="2"/>an easy task.</p>
   <p>The first number on this wealthy program was Rossini's, "Semiramide." It is a composition which is unusually hard for perfect harmony. But this time it was executed by musicians, who are individually, masters of their own instruments, together with the expert conducting; resulting in a performance of perfection and precision never previously attained.</p>
   <p>Before the echoes of the great applause died down, the band began the second number, which was very familiar to the Bohemian and Slovak people, insomuch as it contained Slovak dance tunes written by the famous Bohemian composer Dvorak. Following this, selections from Faust were played, which won the approval of the audience.</p>
   <p>Next came the overture, "Libuse," written by Smetana, another well-known Bohemian composer. The Bohemian musicians like to include an overture into every concert, otherwise they believe the concert would lack something very essential toward its success. This practice has proved the Bohemians' ability to play an overture better than any other nationality.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1019.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After a short intermission, the band played several military marches, by Beyer. Then the concert proceeded successfully with several solos by a cornet, a double bass and as an added feature a special solo by the harp.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program consisted of compositions by, Straus and Dalberg, in which there are many varieties of difficult harmony, but since these compositions were well rehearsed and perfectly conducted, they were played excellently. At the conclusion of the concert, a storm of applause brought on many encores. The conductor Mr. Brousek, was presented with many bouquets of flowers and was requested by all those present, to conduct more concerts of this nature.</p>
   <p>It was also suggested for the band to hold several concerts in the park during the summer months to acquaint other nationalities with Bohemian music and with the achievements of Bohemians in the musical world.</p>
