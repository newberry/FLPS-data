<title level="a">BOHEMIAN GROCERS OF CHICAGO ORGANIZE WHOLESALE HOUSE.</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>p. 1.. A wholesale grocery house will soon be added to the already large number of wholesale establishments which have recently been organized by our Bohemian countrymen. Among Bohemian grocers this idea has been much discussed and has advanced so far, that at the last meeting held, a temporary board of directors and officers were elected.</p>
   <p>They were given the task of continuing the work already begun, and thus bring the enterprise to the proportions it should have. Co-operating grocers, of whom there are about fifty, look forward to this undertaking with great expectancy and are convinced that the greater the number of grocers participating, the greater will be the benefit to themselves and to their customers.</p>
   <p>The grocers participating in this association are almost all known in the circle of their countrymen as active, enterprising businessmen and, therefore, it is expected that their idea of organizing a wholesale grocery business, where they can buy everything they need in their business, will meet with success.</p>
   <p>The idea originated from a small group of grocers in Bohemian California who agreed that they would buy all their necessities collectively in large quantities. <pb facs="5418478_3_0296.jpg" n="2"/>Purchasing commodities in this manner they soon discovered the great advantage to be derived from such action. They were convinced that through co-operative buying they were able to make a considerable saving and consequently were enabled to sell their merchandise at lower prices. Having become acquainted with this fact, they endeavored to enlarge the association as much as possible in order that quantities purchased would be as great as possible and that the advantages enjoyed by large establishments might accrue to themselves.</p>
   <p>This endeavor led Bohemian grocers to the organization of a strong company which would concentrate as many grocers as possible and thus direct the advantages enjoyed by the big wholesale houses downtown into their own channels.</p>
   <p>The idea is an excellent one and much depends now on how the grocers who are not yet members of the association will welcome it, that is, whether or not they see any benefit in it for themselves. The participating grocers will hold a meeting next week at which steps will be taken to incorporate and issue stock. Only active grocers will be allowed to own stock in the company.</p>
   <p>Temporary directors elected at the last meeting are: Vojt, Vyduna, James Berk, Frank Vojak, Jos. Kalina, Frank Suchy, J. Fitchner and Ant. Tittl. The following named officers were elected: Frank Suchy, president; Ant. Tittl, <pb facs="5418478_3_0297.jpg" n="3"/>secretary, Vojta Vyduna, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The majority of the members have already paid in their subscriptions and will receive stock. Mr. V. C. Kryda was chosen to act as temporary business manager.</p>
