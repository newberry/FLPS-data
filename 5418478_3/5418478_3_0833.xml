   <p>p. 1, col. 5.. Yesterday's performance of the first Bohemian vaudeville and operatic theatre in the Sokol Chicago hall should be ranked as one of the most successful, because a really remarkable opportunity for enjoyment was given to the public, in fact, every number of the program was well liked by the public.</p>
   <p>It was the toe dancer, young Alice Warburton, first solo-dancer, who especially evoked the admiration of the public. Julia, Bohemian gymnast, astonished with her performances. She is a finished artist in her sphere and rightfully gained full recognition from the public. Mr. J. Sulc as usually drew peals of laughter from the audience with his irresistible humor. Augusta Odillonova, appeared in the garb of a dashing rider and received several encores.</p>
   <p>The wrestling match received the closest attention. The contest was between the well known Town of Lake Sokol, Frank Svaicer (Butcher-boy) and the equally well known New Tabor Sokol, Joseph Peroutka. They are both good, clever wrestlers, and for that reason their match was of great interest. There were three rounds to the match which were held during intermissions. The first round <pb facs="5418478_3_0834.jpg" n="2"/>lasted eight minutes and the winner was Mr. Svaicer, who defeated his opponent with an arm lock. The second round was undecided. In the third round which was the deciding one, both contestants fought as lions. At times victory pointed first to one and then to the other. However, after nine minutes and sixteen seconds, Svaicer again won with an arm-lock. Peroutka asked for a return match, to which Svaicer agreed.</p>
   <p>Prodana Iaska (Bartered Love) was the source of ceaseless laughter. The leading role was played by Miss Olea Mark, who was well liked and who received a bouquet. Miss Mark played with verve and her emotions were becoming to her dramatic appearance. Mr. Sulc played his part in an unsurpassable manner. Other participants in the one act play were Mr. Keclik, Miss Opava, Mr. Sverak and Mr. Wagner, all of whom played their parts excellently. Mr. F. Hladky's orchestra furnished the music for the occasion and rendered several concert selections.</p>
   <p>Briefly speaking, yesterday's entertainment was one of those which will long be remembered by the public. It was the kind of performance the public always eagerly awaits; when it has the opportunity it fills the theatre to capacity.</p>
