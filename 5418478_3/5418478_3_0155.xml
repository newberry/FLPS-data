   <p>Almost one-half century has passed since the family of the Lállas came to our city. They hailed from the romantic little town of Bechynĕ near Tábor, Bohemia. The elder Lállas were people typical of old time Czech stock, with an earnest desire for rearing their children to be decent men, good citizens, and to remain sincere Czechs. They did not labor in vain. Their little ones grew to be a cause of pride and joy for the parents; after the latter had betaken themselves into the great unknown, the orphans still continued to do honor to their name.</p>
   <p>One of these children was John F. Lálla, who by hard, honest work and perseverance in business, won for himself a prominent place among his fellow-citizens. He had been brought to Chicago at the tender age of ten, and, not having the means for an educational development of his talents, drifted into business. He soon discovered that a great field of profitable activity offered itself to the Czech commission merchants. He did not hesitate to enter that branch <pb facs="5418478_3_0156.jpg" n="2"/>of business, and in 1895 founded the house of John F. Lálla and Company, of which he was the president, with Messrs. Krupka, Lisý, and Štastný as partners. The firm, with headquarters located 809 W. Randolph St., grew by leaps and bounds, finally becoming one of the biggest commission houses of our city. Accordingly the finances of the concern were in excellent shape.</p>
   <p>In the midst of prosperity Mr. Lálla remained a sincere Czech; at the same time he was also an ardent member of the Catholic Church in which he had been brought up. His liberal support of Czech-Catholic enterprises will be remembered for a long time.</p>
   <p>He had been ailing lately, and was bedridden for the last six weeks. At 4 A. M., yesterday, the crisis was reached, and he died at the age of nearly sixty years. He leaves his widow, Mrs. Barbara Lalla, and three sons and <pb facs="5418478_3_0157.jpg" n="3"/>three daughters. The funeral of the deceased, who was a member of the St. Joseph Association, will be held at Ascension Church, Van Buren and Clarence Sts., Oak Park; the place of the burial will be the St. Adalbert Cemetery.</p>
