   <p>Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, the well-known realtor at 3341 West 26th Street, is certainly lucky in his selections of sites which he wants to add to our expanding community. The building sites, which he will offer for sale, lie in the most beautiful location, have all conveniences, which are as assurance that they will rapidly and steadily increase in value, and that beautiful homes will be built upon them, in which will live happy, satisfied people.</p>
   <p>Let us look back upon that part of Bohemian California lying between Hamlin and 40th Avenues, and from 26th to 23rd Street. A short three years ago, there was nothing but a prairie there. Mr. Hajicek took over the sale of these grounds, and today there lies the finest section of our community. There are only a few lots left in that section. Everyone will be acting for his own benefit who buys any of these lots. Lots in the Morton Park subdivision are rapidly being sold out. There are also to be had all conveniences, and the lots are sold on easy <pb facs="5418478_3_0262.jpg" n="2"/>payments. Anyone who can make a deposit of five dollars and set aside a small sum monthly, can become the owner of valuable property upon which they can build a home.</p>
