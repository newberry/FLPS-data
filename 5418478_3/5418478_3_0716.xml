   <p>The auditorium of the Sokol Chicago Hall, although spacious, could hardly accommodate the great throngs of people who came to pay homage to Mrs. Bohumila Ludvík, directress of the Ludvíkovo Divadlo (František Ludvík's Dramatic Association) and artist, who should be given credit primarily for the fact that it has been possible to maintain a permanent Bohemian theater in Chicago. Since the time Ludvík's group first stepped upon American soil until today, Mrs. Ludvik has been the soul of the whole enterprise and with her indefatigable perseverance and untiring diligence she has managed it over all obstacles with a firm hand. Besides the heavy duties as directress of the theatrical enterprise, Mrs. Ludvik devotes herself to social and national activity with earnest enthusiasm; therefore, her friends are to be found among all classes of our people. That her merits are recognized was proved by the large attendance, by the enthusiastic applause with which she was greeted, and by the many floral pieces and gifts given to her by her friends. Mrs. Ludvík selected for this benefit performance an old but beautiful play, "Dědictví z <pb facs="5418478_3_0717.jpg" n="2"/>Kalifornie" (An Inheritance from California), which is known to our theater-going public from past seasons, and which was once again received with gratitude.....</p>
