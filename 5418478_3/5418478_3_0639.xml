   <p>p. 1. col. 7--The tavern of Mr. John Cervenka, president of the Pilsen Brewing Company, was recently decorated by a beautifully painted picture.</p>
   <p>The picture is the work of the talented painter, Mr. Vladimir Samberk, who has his studio in Hoerber's Hall, on Blue Island avenue at 21st street.</p>
   <p>It represents vanity. A beautiful woman reclining upon a couch. At her feet she has money strewn, a crown and sceptre. But all this she scorns, conscious of the power of her beauty. In this painting is crystalized a great idea and brought to perfect expression. It is one of the best of Mr. Samberk's paintings; Mr. Samberk of late, has been more interested in painting than in acting. His paintings have adorned several public places in our Pilsen. Mr. Samberk's paintings are gaining deserved recognition, and we are beginning to patronize our Bohemian artists. Czech painters up to the present have been dependent upon a foreign clientele, but it is gratifying that those among us are sufficiently prosperous to afford the purchase of a piece of art are beginning to give preference to our own Czech artists.</p>
   <p>"Vanity" measures 4' x 7' and its value is estimated at $250.00.</p>
