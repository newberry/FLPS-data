<title level="a">KUBELIK AT THE BOHEMIAN CLUB</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Bohemian Club, members of which among other things are musical virtuosoes, arranged an exclusive ball last night, such as is always considered best during the winter season. Even this time the sponsors took pains to have the ball surpass all preceeding affairs, and they were successful in the fullest sense.</p>
   <p>The cozy locality near "Libuse", 934 West 12th St., was richly decorated with greens and other ornaments for the occasion. Shortly after nine o'clock, the invited guests began to arrive. So many visitors came that the large hall and gallery were soon quite full. The reason for such a large gathering was to be found in the announcement, that the celebrated virtuoso, Kubelik, would be present. It was a little before ten o'clock when our distinguished young countryman arrived, escorted by his secretary, Mr. Skrivan, and the American correspondent of the Vienna, Neue Freie Press, Mr. Baumheld. Kubelik was warmly welcomed by his countrymen the moment he stepped into the hall. He bowed, smiling in all directions, heartily greeting all who were introduced to him. Among those present and distinguished in our public life, there were the Mayor Carter H. Harrison; the lawyer, Elliot; Justice of the Peace La Buy; <pb facs="5418478_3_0554.jpg" n="2"/>Alderman Ed. J. Novak; School Board Member, Vopicka; former School Board Member, Kristian Walleck; Assistant Chief of Police, Ptacek; Police Judge Sabath; and many others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kubelik watched the Grand March from the balcony, while holding a lively conversation with those standing near him. Then with all those present he was photographed.</p>
   <p>After he had inspected the club premises of the Bohemian Club and enjoyed himself among his new friends, he returned to the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The balance of the guests,who cane to the Bohemian Club's Ball, continued their merry-making late into the night, to the accompaniment of Tesinske's excellent band.</p>
   <p>Yesterday Jan Kubelik was the guest of the Austrian Vice-Consul,H. Schwegel. Today he is to be taken on a tour of the Union Stock Yards. In the evening his first concert will be given. On Friday at one o'clock in the afternoon, he will participate at a banquet in the Auditorium.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0555.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For today's concert at the Auditorium in which besides Kubelik, Miss Maria Victoria Torrilhon (piano), and our countryman, Rudolf Friml, will take part, the following program has been arranged:-</p>
   <p>"Concerto for Violin, D. Major", by Paganini, Jan Kubelik.</p>
   <p>"Etude de Concert and Hungarian Etude", Miss Torrilhon.</p>
   <p>"Aria from Bach", "Andante from Lalo", and "Praeludium" from Bach, Jan Kubelik.</p>
   <p>"Rhapsodie Hongroise" No. 8, Liszt, Miss Torrilhon.</p>
   <p>"Slavonic Dance", Dvorak, and "Russian Carnival", Wieniawski, Jan Kubelik.</p>
   <p>As to when Kubelik will be able to visit among the rest of his countrymen, will be discussed by the committee and his Secretary, Mr. Skrivan.</p>
