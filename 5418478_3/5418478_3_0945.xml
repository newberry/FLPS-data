   <p>A week has passed since the great singing contest was held under the auspices of the well-known Polish singing society Filareci in Riverview Park. The singing societies of all nationalities represented in Chicago were invited to this contest, all but the Germans--naturally enough--whose presence was out of the question because the contest was held for the benefit of war-destroyed Poland. Because of our bitterness over, and dissatisfaction with, its outcome, only a short article about the contest was published in one of our previous issues, but that article does not seem to be quite sufficient now. We are therefore returning to the discussion of the contest and we are doing so after having cooled down, considered and reconsidered the matter, and read what has been published about it in other newspapers, particularly the American ones, which after all, should be considered by all of us as the <pb facs="5418478_3_0946.jpg" n="2"/>most important ones.</p>
   <p>Among those invited by the Poles were the Bohemians. They were best represented by the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies). A very large number of our people arrived in Riverview Park with the Ustredni Jednota, a good many of our lovers of chorus singing among them, in fact so many that in some sections of the Park nothing else was heard but the Bohemian language. Thus it may be said that the contest caused the assembling of the song-loving part of our elite who did not mind the expense and damages, which no doubt the ladies found to be considerable the following morning when they inspected their dresses and slippers, which were soiled by the flood and stained by mud and sticky loam into which they had been conducted by the hosts and in which they stood for several hours.</p>
   <p>Our people were willing to suffer these inconveniences in the definite <pb facs="5418478_3_0947.jpg" n="3"/>expectation that these would be compensated for, in the satisfaction of seeing our Ustredni Jednota win one of the best prizes of the contest. This was a general expectation, because the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota sang their chorus--one which we have heard them sing many times--especially well, with new zest and liveliness, and with a freshness of feeling which was apparent in the beautiful way the leading voices rounded up the phrasing of the composition. Everything in the singing showed that Conductor Hess did all that he, or anybody else, could do to make the presentation an unqualified success. Aside from this, the Sdruzeni sang a chorus which, in beauty of vocal distribution and volume of tonal qualities, excelled the performances of all the other contestants whom we heard.</p>
   <p>We heard the Croatians, the Lithuanians, the Ukrainians, but not until we heard the Swedes, in their Glee Club, did we warm up. They sang very nicely. There were not many of them, but what vocal material they did possess! Their voices were rather evenly distributed, even if the tenor department <pb facs="5418478_3_0948.jpg" n="4"/>was somewhat weak, a shortcoming that seemed to be the Achilles' heel of all the choruses in the contest. The songs rendered by the Swedes was not the happiest choice, but we liked the precision and liveliness of their presentation. They were followed by the Russians, the Serbs, and finally the Bohemians. We tried to suppress the feeling that it was our countrymen singing, in order to form a truly unbiased opinion and listened for minor deficiencies and weaknesses where there were, perhaps, none in fact. But in spite of that we could not avoid a happy emotion which seized us after the first few bars. We were surprised by the quality of the vocal material, the high degree to which the voices were trained, and both the emotional and dynamic phrasing,for the latter of which Mr. Hess merits a special congratulation. We thought that one of the best prizes was "in the bag". All we wanted to know was which one it would be, and we listened, therefore, with increased attention to the choruses which followed. They were the Slovaks, the Poles, and the Norwegians.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0949.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Poles did rather well, the number of singers was very large, and there were paid, professional singers among them; they sang a very beautiful composition, but in spite of all this we couldn't grow enthusiastic. We much preferred the Norwegians, although the quality of their voices prevented them from achieving complete success.</p>
   <p>From our observations we thought the prizes would be divided between the Swedes, the Bohemians, and the Norwegians. We never gave the Poles a thought, because we did not expect them to be so tactless as to compete for a prize in a contest they had arranged for their guests, who should have been first in their consideration, a fact which should also have been borne in mind by the jury which made the final decision. The jury was anything but impartial. This was proven by their decision, which flattered the Poles quite out of any proportion to their achievement.</p>
   <p>The results of the contest were announced at 9 P. M. Prior to the <pb facs="5418478_3_0950.jpg" n="6"/>announcement there was a concert in which other choruses as well as Polish were permitted to take part. Ours used this occasion to show their mettle by presenting Dvorak's beautiful "Veno" (Dower), which, of course, could not be considered in the result of the competition because at that time the gentlemen of the jury were digesting their sumptuous dinner on the porch of the Casino and their verdict had already been agreed upon.</p>
   <p>The first prize went to the Polish society Filareci. The displeasure caused by this decision was apparent immediately after it had been announced. The Swedes and the Bohemians tied for the second prize, each receiving three votes. None of the jury would yield, and the issue had to be decided by a draw. Mr. Hess and the conductor of the Glee Club were each asked to take a number from a box. The Glee Club conductor's number was the smaller so the second prize went to the Swedes and a gold medal, which was announced as second prize, but which was actually third prize, went to the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota. The Norwegians had to be satisfied with an <pb facs="5418478_3_0951.jpg" n="7"/>honorable mention.</p>
   <p>Well, never mind. Disregarding the tactlessness of the Poles, we have received recognition. The Ustredni Jednota can well be satisfied with the experience it has gained. It should be particularly pleased with the remarks made about it by the music critic of the Chicago Herald. There is no question about its ability and artistic capacity. These will always match the qualities of the Poles, and the Ustredni Jednota should therefore untertake to arrange a singing contest itself. We are certain that this contest would arouse still greater interest, and that the Jednota would not act as the Poles did. We know its tact.</p>
