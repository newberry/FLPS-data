   <p>In the last number of the magazine Musical America, there is a very flattering report about a young Bohemian-American artist, Mr. Robert Dolejsi of Chicago. This report refers to a grand concert in the new Vienna Conservatory in Vienna, where Mr. Robert Dolejsi was the principal artist. Among other references, the report gives an account of the first concert held in this new conservatory, which was just finished in January of this year. The date of this concert was March 10.</p>
   <p>The program of the entire concert consisted of the compositions of the rising young composer, Josef Marx. The audience was composed of selected groups of art critics and some of the most prominent musicians of Vienna. Mr. Robert Dolejsi was chosen as a soloist for this concert. Mr. Dolejsi, a pupil of Professor Ottokar Sefcik, played the "Fantasy and Fugue in A Major" for violin <pb facs="5418478_3_0470.jpg" n="2"/>with piano accompaniment. Mariana Lederer, a pupil of the renowned Professor Godovsky, was the accompanist.</p>
   <p>The success of young Dolejsi was phenomenal, and his rendition of the difficult modern composition marked him as a mature, finished artist, and the critics were unanimous in their praise. Mr. Dolejsi was praised for his broad tone, his brilliant attack, and his assurance in overcoming technical difficulties. After the concert, the director of this conservatory and prominent critics looked up the young man's teacher, Professor Ottokar Sevcik, to congratulate him for sponsoring so talented a young man, for whom a great future is assured.</p>
   <p>The reference to Mr. Dolejsi in this local magazine devoted to the arts is a distinction and an acknowledgment of the true worth of this young man. He and his parents, who live here in Chicago at 1420 South Sawyer Avenue, should feel very proud.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0471.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From the young man's parents we learned that Mr. Dolejsi, after arranging a number of concerts throughout Europe, expects to tour the United States, giving concerts in our principal cities. For public interest, we must note that Mr. Robert Dolejsi was a public of that well-known violin virtuoso and great instrumental pedagogue, Mr. Vaclav Machek of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We congratulate Mr. Dolejsi and wish him much success in his future ventures, and we offer our felicitations to the young man's parents. To his Chicago teacher, Mr. Vaclav Machek, we tender our sincere respects.</p>
