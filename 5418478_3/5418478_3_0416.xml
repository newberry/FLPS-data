<title level="a">CZECH WORKINGMEN'S CONCERT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>

   <p>The Česko-Dĕlincký Pĕvecký Sbor (Czech Workingmen's Singing Society) has made a good name for itself during the many years of its activity. The Association's reputation has been growing steadily, so that today it ranks among our best societies. The credit for this is equally due to the members and leaders of the chorus. Mr. Joseph Houdek, the present conductor, merits the attention of our public. He began to work with the association during a crisis, but brought the group to a high level of artistic accomplishment. This is due to his manifold musical talents which he employs not only as a conductor, but as an instrumental virtuoso and an expert in the selection of numbers for his programs.</p>
   <p>This year's spring concert was given in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago, South Kedzie Avenue near 24th Street, yesterday. The choruses were chiefly the light and merry kind. The last one of these was Antonín Dvořák's, "Hymna Českĕho Rolnictva" (Hymn on Czech Agriculture). It was sung by the Society, by pupils of the Pĕvecká Škola (Singing School), and the singing club Máj.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0417.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The piano accompaniment was rendered by Miss J. Červenka and Mr. Jaroslav Soustka. The Máj (May) is a club composed of music-loving ladies. It presented four numbers for female voices. Three of them were sung very beautifully; the fourth, however, Štrebl's "Kytička" (Little Flower), the most charming of all, was disappointing, because the sopranos sang off pitch at times. There was a great variety of choruses and solo numbers. Mr. P. J. Filipek, tenor, sang "La Donna E Mobile" from Verdi's opera, "Rigoletto". Miss Jennie Cervenka played two pieces for piano--Rebikoff's "Waltz" and Mac Dowell's "Rigaudou".</p>
   <p>Mr. Houdek may well be satisfied with the performance of his singers. The attendance was not too large, yet acceptable, and consisted of those old friends of the Society who for many years have never failed to make an appearance at the concerts. In summary, the concert was pleasant and refreshing.</p>
   <p>During the intermission, the Third Liberty Loan was not forgotten, and its promotion was advocated in patriotic words by Dr. J. P. Pecival.</p>
