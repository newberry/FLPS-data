   <p>At the special meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago), held August 13, it was resolved that support be given to the Bohemian Free Thought School Teachers' Association, which association took over the arrangement of the Posvicenska Slavnost (Country-wake Festival). The association will arrange the same festival under a new name, the Ceskoslovenske Posviceni (Czechoslovak Country Wake), for the benefit of our Free Thought schools and with the co-operation of the Bohemian Free Thought people of Chicago. In the name of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol, we appeal to all our societies, lodges, organizations, and to our Bohemian Free Thought people of Chicago in general, to work harmoniously for the benefit of the schools. We are convinced that none of the societies or the Bohemian Free Thought people will refuse their co-operation, because the progress of our schools is a mutual goal of us all. We also appeal to all the representatives of our <pb facs="5418478_3_1299.jpg" n="2"/>societies, who were appointed by them and who were in charge of the Posvicenska Slavnost, to attend a meeting which will be held Wednesday, August 17, at the Vojta Naprstek Bohemian Free Thought School.</p>
   <p>Our principal organizations are requested to erect and supply, if that is possible, their own booths and our societies, without exception, are requested to work and put forth their best efforts and see to it that the Ceskoslovenske Posviceni be crowned with success. We hope that our organizations, our societies, and our Bohemian Free Thought people will put their shoulders to the wheel, and, although the time is limited, if we say to ourselves that we are willing to work and that we will use our energy, which is inborn in us Bohemians, then the Ceskoslovenske Posviceni must meet with success. For that reason we request your co-operation, for that reason we invite the Bohemian Free Thought people of Chicago to come to Pilsen Park, August 21, and attend the Ceskoslovenske Posviceni.</p>
   <p>For the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu:</p>
