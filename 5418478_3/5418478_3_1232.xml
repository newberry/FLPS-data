   <p>Last Wednesday the Libushka Ballet School gave a performance in the hall of the Sokol Chicago. The concert and ballet were managed by Mrs. Libuska Bartusek-Brown. The audience was a select one. Miss Milada Krametbauer was a co-operating artiste. It was an unforgettable evening, truly beautiful, for the pupils' performances bear proof of the great industry devoted to the art of the ballet by the directoress. Everybody in the audience recognized the fact that much intelligent and painstaking labor must be spent to bring forth such amazingly fine results, particularly as regards the very young tots whose number exceeded the rest of the ensemble in precision and grace.</p>
   <p>The reason that the Libushka Ballet School is so very popular is that our Bohemian parents take great pride in having their youngsters trained, and we <pb facs="5418478_3_1233.jpg" n="2"/>cannot take up this space to name every single performer, however great their merit may be.....</p>
