   <p>The theatre season is at an end, the footlights blazed on our stages for the last time Sunday. It cannot be contended that this season was a particularly successful one, either productively or financially.</p>
   <p>News about the theatre is naturally limited to those from the old homeland but under the conditions prevailing there, not much is being written now. Consequently, our own stages did not offer any novelties. For this reason, unquestionably, the audiences were lagging behind those of former years. There are still other causes: the depressed economic conditions, the chronic insecurity, a none too hopeful outlook, and finally, the keen competition of the photoplay theatres.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding these handicaps we had two stages, on which performances were given at regular intervals. Besides this, there were numerous incidental <pb facs="5418478_3_1131.jpg" n="2"/>dental theatrical affairs. In general, the results of the season may be termed fairly satisfactory, and that is something of which few immigrant nationalities can boast. There are, for instance, the Germans in Chicago who are unable to maintain a single permanent stage, though their numbers are incomparably larger than ours. Every effort on their part of arrive on a more stable basis failed almost invariably.--Even the fact that Czech audiences were small, this season has one brighter side, our theatrical groups deserve full credit for having held out in the face of adverse circumstances.</p>
