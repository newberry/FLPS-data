   <p>The board of directors of the Oriental Commercial Exposition of Bratislava, Slovakia has requested the Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Komora v Chicagu (Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce of Chicago) to inform the commercial interests in its vicinity that the second Oriental Commercial Exposition will take place during the week of July 9-16, 1922. We deem it our duty, therefore, to inform all our countrymen who are about to leave for their old homeland to visit this exposition and to spend a few days in Bratislava. By so doing, they will gain experience and valuable information on the quality and advantages of such commercial contacts as they will be able to make on this occasion. According to the information received by the Komora, all kinds of goods will be exhibited at the aforesaid fair, and many of our countrymen will have an opportunity to make valuable business contacts which promise to bring mutual advantages.</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the exposition requested us, at the same time, to <pb facs="5418478_3_1285.jpg" n="2"/>ask our local manufacturers and businessmen to send their catalogues and other commercial literature in case they could not attend the fair personally. We advise our countrymen, therefore, not to omit doing so, and to take advantage of this invitation, for businessmen from all parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa will meet at the Oriental fair, and it will be possible to make good contacts with them.</p>
   <p>We are further requested to furnish reviews, periodicals, and other pertinent literature. Our countrymen may mail this literature, no matter whether it has been read or not, to Orientalsky Trh (Oriental fair), Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. Our problem is to develop this important institution, and every one of us should put his shoulder to the wheel to make this possible. Let us endeavor to make the fair as famous as the Prazsky Vzorkovy Veletrh (Grand sample fair of Prague), so that it may attract all the businessmen of the world. We shall thus be rewarded with the knowledge that we have helped to develop the Republic of Czechoslovakia into a commercially self-sufficient state to which others will <pb facs="5418478_3_1286.jpg" n="3"/>look with confidence. Do not forget that it is still necessary to be on guard so that the fruits of our independence may not be plucked by the enemies of our republic. Their hostile propaganda is very active, and we must therefore meet it with every possible resource. And do not forget that the Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Komora v Chicagu performs its duties faithfully.</p>
