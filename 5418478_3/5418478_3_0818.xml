   <p>"Bordynkari," ("The Boarders") by R. Jaromir Psenka, a portrayal from the life of Chicago-Bohemians, in three acts, with songs adapted from the humoresque by F. J. Skaloud, was repeated again last night on the stage of the Ludvik Theatre.</p>
   <p>"The Boarders" is not new upon the Chicago-Bohemian stage anymore. The house was sold out to the last seat yesterday. Because of reports of the previous success, every one who has not yet seen the play is anxious to do so, and there are many of such persons. Therefore, "The Boarders" will, no doubt, be repeated next Sunday. Yesterday's presentation was probably the most successful of the series.</p>
   <p>It would be a mere repetition of previous criticism to say that the star was Mrs. Ludvik, who played the part of the boarding-house mistress. Messrs. K. Splavec and F. Lhotsky, in the roles of the Texas farmer, and his son, respectively, were particularly suited for their characters. The same applies to all the other <pb facs="5418478_3_0819.jpg" n="2"/>players.</p>
   <p>Professor J. H. Capek, director of the theatre orchestra, prepared an excellent program for yesterday, so that the audience enjoyed some very fine music between the acts. It is expected that the theatre will be filled to capacity again next Sunday.</p>
