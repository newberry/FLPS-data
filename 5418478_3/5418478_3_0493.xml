   <p>Prof. Joseph H. Capek, the well-known virtuoso of the violin, and teacher of music who is a graduate of Prague Conservatory, and who was severely injured a short time ago, has recovered to such an extent that he will resume teaching in his music school at 1803 Blue Island Avenue. The many friends and pupils of Mr. Capek will receive with joy the report of his early recovery, and return to his calling.</p>
   <p>Joseph J. Kovarik, violin virtuoso, professor of violin at the National Conservatory in New York, and soloist with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, is in Chicago at present with Victor Herbert's orchestra, during the "Piano Trade Exhibition," which is being held in the Coliseum this week. Mr. Kovarik has gained general recognition in New York's musical circles, and is known as an ardent propagator of chamber music, especially Bohemian. In America, he studied under the supervision of Prof. J. H. Capek, and in Prague, he was a pupil of Professor Bennewitz, and Anton Dvorak.</p>
