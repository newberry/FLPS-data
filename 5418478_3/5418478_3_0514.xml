   <p>P.2--Mr. Machek conducted a concert last evening, given by his forty-piece violin orchestra. It was held in the Pilsen Sokol Hall, and according to comments made by music-lovers, it was very successful. The great hall was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>The concert consisted of fifteen numbers, several of them solos, others by the orchestra. An added attraction was a harp solo by the well-known virtuoso Mrs. M. Jiskrova, who played Godefroid's Reverie.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian public is very proud of Mr. Machek's accomplishments and promises him its whole-hearted support in all his undertakings. Our compatriots know his qualifications and have never been disappointed by him. He has developed many noted violinists in his school and at present, has some remarkable talent under his supervision.</p>
   <p>Many musicians, artists, and other professional persons attended the concert.</p>
