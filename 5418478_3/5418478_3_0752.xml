   <p>Our professional actors made Raupach's "The Miller and His Child," in Czech translation, the vehicle of their art in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago, South Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street, last night. One may look upon the dramatic qualities of this play as one will, but it is still a box office hit. It has become assimilated completely with the taste of the theater-loving masses--or rather, the masses with it. The play has become a sort of sentimental holiday event not only upon the amateur, but also upon the legitimate, professional stage of large theaters. It presents plain, simple action embroidered with ornate artistry. It has assured a large audience for itself practically everywhere, even though critics may be at variance in trying to explain this fact.</p>
   <p>Last night's performance drew a large crowd; every seat was occupied. The mood of the audience corresponded perfectly with the intentions of the author of the play.</p>

   <p>The title roles were played by Mr. V. E. Zalovsky and Mrs. Slavka Svoboda. Mr. Lhotsky played "Conrad"; Mr. Suva, "Jonas," the gravedigger; Mr. Hospodsky played the innkeeper; Mr. Jindrich Weidner played "Dobromil," the pastor. Mr. Jurena directed the orchestra. The stage management was under the expert supervision of Mr. Weidner.</p>
