   <p>p. 3-- Students of Professor J. H. Capek's Violin School, gave a successful concert last Friday evening, April 19, 1907.</p>
   <p>It took place at the large Grand Boulevard Hall, on the south side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The concert program was very well performed and pleased the large audience immensely. All numbers on the program were well practised and rehearsed, thus assuring a perfect performance. Girls as well as boy students took part in the program. They played solos, duets and other various combinations so as to make the concert more interesting. Several difficult compositions were played by the more advanced students who played to the accompaniment of Mrs. J. H. Capek on the piano.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1027.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Students of Professor J. H. Capek are constantly requested to play at other concerts and at various social gatherings. This proves that he is an excellent teacher of the violin.</p>
   <p>Professor Capek's Violin School is well known in Chicago. It has done a great deal toward the cultivation of talent and the production of violin artists among our people.</p>
