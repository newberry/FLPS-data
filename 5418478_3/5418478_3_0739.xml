   <p>There are events in the theatrical world which defy description, where stereotype reporting proves utterly inadequate. One such phenomenon during our season was the presentation of Smetana's comic opera, "Prodaná Něvesta" (The Bartered Bride), by the Chicago singing society, Bedřich Smetana. Yesterday's performance in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago was their third. It was presented under the same propitious conditions as the two preceding ones. The house was packed with people filled with eager anticipation, who demonstrated their enthusiastic appreciation with thunderous applause and jubilant acclaim. ....All tickets had been sold a week before the performance, and several hundred additional seats had to be provided.</p>
   <p>A fourth performance will be given next Sunday, and a fifth on March 24, the latter for the benefit of a patriotic organization, the Czech National Alliance. <pb facs="5418478_3_0740.jpg" n="2"/>More performances are expected to follow. The admission price for these is likely to be lower. Considering the lively interest for tickets, it is being predicted that the opera will remain on the repertory until the end of the season.</p>
