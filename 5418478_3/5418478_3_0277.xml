   <p>The house No. 44-48 N. Peoria street, between Lake and Fulton streets, was a busy place early morning yesterday; in it the Chicago Butchers' Packing Company is located.</p>
   <p>Several hundred butchers had come to make purchases for their own stores. The wholesale business was opened yesterday and the employees had strenuous work on hand in order to satisfy the customers as best they could.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Butchers' Packing Company is a strictly Czech owned concern, the stockholders being butchers of Czech descent owning individual stores.</p>
   <p>This combination grew from small beginnings into the concern whose home and implements represent a capital of $150,000. Considering that everything has been paid for to the last cent and no debts have been incurred, the success of the enterprise seems assured.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0278.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>About six years ago the Bohemian Butchers' Association opened a small store on Paulina and Twenty-second streets. The business was managed properly, and after four years the initial capital of only $10,000 was raised to $150,000. The name of the business was changed for valid reasons. Czech butchers have become independent merchants by a single stroke. They believe that their success is assured, first, because the quality of the meat will be painstakingly kept upon a high level, and also because the owners are all full-fledged butchers who know what good meat is.</p>
   <p>They will not be a playball of capitalistic whims any longer; for this last reason they will be more liberal toward the individual customer.</p>
   <p>This Bohemian company has a slaughter-house of its own and keeps two cattle-buyers. The building is fitted out with the last word in machinery, implements and utensils, all acquired with guaranteed safety for the workingman in mind.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0279.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The eminent feature of the establishment is cleanliness carried out in a punctilious way.</p>
