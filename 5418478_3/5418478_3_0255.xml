   <p>The youthful, but already successful real-estate dealer, Mr. Louis J. Krejci, has a remarkable method of doing business, and by which he surely will enlarge the circle of his customers and increase his success. He promises no one anything which he might not be able to perform, but with figures and facts he proceeds to prove that he can offer real bargains and splendid advantages.</p>
   <p>In another part of this paper he has an advertisement entitled "Houses and Lots Cheap," in which he introduces a list of prices of properties, which everyone must admit are real bargains. Mr. Krejci has many more such properties.</p>
   <p>He is a man whose word is as good as an oath. In his dealings, he is pleasant and willing, and everybody who knows him predicts a great future for him.</p>
