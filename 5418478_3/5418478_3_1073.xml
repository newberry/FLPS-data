   <p>Had Svatopluk Cech, who is one of the greatest poets of Bohemia, written only his one epic poem, Lesetinsky Kovar (The Blacksmith of Lesetin), that alone would have assured him of immortality. One proof of that is the great popularity which this work enjoys among all strata of our society. One may say that it became a part of us. Its popularity became so great that it led to its dramatization.</p>
   <p>It is this play, then, which at present is being diligently rehearsed by the foremost amateur actors of our Bohemian settlements, under the direction of the well-known countryman Mr. J. Kukal. The play is to be given to-morrow at 8 P. M. by the Bohemian Branch of the Sdruzeni Katolickych Lesniku (Catholic Order of Foresters) in the assembly hall of the Svata Ludmila (Saint Ludmila) School, Albany Avenue West 24th Street. The play is essentially Bohemian and nationalistic, and those who desire to become acquainted with it should attend.</p>
