   <p>P.1--Vivid and lasting impressions were received by music-lovers at the great concert recently presented in Kimball Hall by the American School of Violin, under the directorship of the well-known artist and teacher Mr. Joseph Vilim. The concert was well attended, a fact which attests the popularity and prestige of the school, which has functioned for many years.</p>
   <p>The program was arranged in such a manner that it was bound to fill with enthusiam even the most fastidious epicure in music. The performers, the pupils, the graduating students, and the artists outdid one another in accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The gem of the performance was saved for the end of the program. It was the overture to Rossini's opera, William Tell, in the rendition of which string-orchestra, flute, organ, and piano took part. Here the greatness of the creative genius of Rossini was shown in its full glory, and the highly developed technique of the artist-pupils of the American School of Violin as well.</p>
