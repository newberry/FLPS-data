   <p>Yesterday, the cozy Libuse hall on 12th Boulevard (sic) was the scene of a concert by two Bohemian-American artists who succeeded in delighting their audience both by their judicious musical selection and by their very accomplished performance. They were the violinist, Mr. Karel V. Hrych, until recently a pupil of the well-known school of Mr. J. F. Pribyl, but today a serious artist who has entered the arena of artistic competition, and the already fully recognized piano virtuoso, Mr. Eduard Vlaciha.</p>
   <p>The concert was arranged with astute artistic understanding, the program bearing witness to Mr. Hrych's serious aspirations. His rendition of Pablo de Sarasate's "Gypsy Airs" was received by a veritable storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlaciha's technical accomplishment was best shown in Haydn's "Elf Dance", and also in Dvorak's rapturous "Andante".</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0957.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This was followed by Mr. Hrych's rendition of Ambrosius' melodious "Canzonetta" and Musin's "Concert Waltz" and "Mazurka".</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlaciha played two short compositions by Chopin, Leseticky's "Mazurka," Lialow's "Music Box," and crowned his performance with Wieniawski's "Valse De Concert," which is a real jewel of piano music.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded by Mr. Hrych who pleased the audience with the somewhat sentimental "Souvenir" by Drdla, and Sevcik's bizarre variations on the Bohemian folk song "Holka Modrooka" (The Blue-Eyed Girl).</p>
