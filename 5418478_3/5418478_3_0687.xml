   <p>Last night a benefit performance was given by the Ludvikova Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvik Bohemian Dramatic Association) in honor of one of our foremost actresses, Miss Zdenek. The performance itself deserves mention as one of the most outstanding in our repertory this season. Miss Zdenek is an excellent singer and actress, and it is natural, therefore, that she should have chosen for her own evening of honor the operetta "Byl Prvni May" (Maytime). Because of its charming melodies, it will long be remembered....The plot begins in 1842 and ends in 1920. Miss Zdenek played the part of a young girl in the first act, then the role of a married matron, and finally that of an old woman whose long cherished dreams come true. The entire group of players of the Ludvikovo Divadlo acquitted themselves nobly on this occasion....</p>
   <p>The play itself comes to us as a novelty that is well known in the American stage, and as such it has for a considerable length of time drawn large <pb facs="5418478_3_0688.jpg" n="2"/>audiences. It is, therefore, a very coveted role, but a difficult one at the same time. Nevertheless, Miss Zdenek's presentation was faithfully performed and she demonstrated her great ability as a singer and as an actress.....</p>
