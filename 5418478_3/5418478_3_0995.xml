   <p>Last Friday night the successful activities which the Farragut High School Social Center conducted during this spring season were concluded with an evening devoted to music and lectures. The great hall was filled by our Bohemian public--mostly residents of the "California" district--when the first number on the program, a piano solo by the thirteen-year-old Anezka Blafka, was presented. Mr. Vaclav Prchal, a well-known violinist, played two selections and was accompanied by Mrs. Rose Smetanka. Mr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka talked on "Politics in Bohemia and in America". His talk was simple in style and easy to understand, just as it should be on such occasions. The lecture was followed by a presentation of folk dances by the girl students of the Farragut High School, including our "Besed" [a popular square dance]. The school principal thanked the Bohemian newspapers for keeping the public informed about the work of the Social Center, and Reverend V. Vanek asked the audience to rise as a token of appreciation for the kindness shown by the Chicago Board of Education in <pb facs="5418478_3_0996.jpg" n="2"/>keeping the school open for the Center's evening gatherings. Thanks were also expressed to Mr. J. B. Dibelka, a member of the Board, for his efforts in founding the Farragut High School, and to the School principal, Mr. Morse, for his most helpful co-operation.</p>
   <p>Considering all circumstances, the activities of the Social Center were a great success. All the lectures were very interesting and useful, and all of them were well attended. After the summer vacation the Center will resume its work with redoubled energy.</p>
   <p>Among those in attendance was Mr. J. B. Dibelka, who expressed his pleasure on the achievements of the Social Center and extended his good wishes for success in the future.</p>
