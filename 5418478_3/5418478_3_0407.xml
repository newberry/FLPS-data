   <p>A new Bohemian singing society, the Pevecky Sbor Ozvena (Echo Singing Society), was founded in our Bohemian settlement in Irving Park about six months ago. Last Sunday, for the first time, it introduced itself to the public. According to the information received from Mr. Frank Misar, the Society was founded on December 16, 1920, and Mr. Joseph Snabl, graduate of the Conservatory of Music of Prague, Czechoslovokia, was appointed its conductor. The concert was arranged under his direction and was given in the Frantisek Zdrubek Bohemian Free Thought School. The program was excellent and the new Society may be proud of it.</p>
   <p>The opening number of the program was Bedrich Smetana's "Veno" (Dedication), after which the Society sang several Bohemian and Slovak folk songs. Miss F. Adamek then sang an aria from the Bohemian opera, "Rusalka", and was so well received that she was compelled to give an encore.....</p>

   <p>The concert showed that the new organization is composed of capable singers, and their next public appearance will be anxiously awaited by the Bohemian people of Irving Park.</p>
