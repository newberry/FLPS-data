   <p>P.2, Col.4--The stockholders of the new Bohemian state bank held a meeting in the Pilsen Sokol hall on Sunday, December 18, 1910. The purpose of the meeting was to hear preliminary reports on the location of the Bank, to decide what its name shall be, and to request the State Auditor to grant a charter for the institution. Almost all the subscribers were present. Mr. John Karel, formerly a banker of Kewanee and Chicago and also American consul at Prague and consul general at St. Petersburg, was elected chairman. Mr. J. F. Stepina was elected secretary. After a lengthy debate it was decided to name the bank the American State Bank.</p>
   <p>Premises for the bank were rented at the sharp corner of Loomis Street and Blue Island Avenue, where it will use the space now occupied by Pelican Brothers and other business enterprises. The interest taken by the subscribers in this movement is shown by the fact that subscriptions for $200,000 capital and $150,000 reserve were obtained without advertising or agitation. Mr. Stepina said the subscribers applied voluntarily. The future <pb facs="5418478_3_0269.jpg" n="2"/>of this undertaking is guaranteed by the names of the men who participated in the meeting, for they enjoy a good reputation among us and among Chicagoans in general as bankers and businessmen. The bank will open late in February.</p>
