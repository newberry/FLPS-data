<title level="a">CZECHOSLOVAK WORKS OF ART PURCHASED BY CHICAGO CZECHOSLOVAKS AND PRESENTED TO THE CHICAGO ART INSTITUTE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>When Messrs. Josef Hak, Josef Biciste, and Adolf Schreiber of Prague, Czechoslovakia, arrived in Chicago about six months....ago to advertise the recently published work, "Krasy Republiky Ceskoslovenske" (The Beauties of the Republic of Czechoslovakia), several of our local countrymen noticed that the afore-mentioned gentlemen brought with them the sample copies of the volume as well as a number of valuable Czechoslovak original paintings and sculptures, the works of some of our outstanding artists. When our observant countrymen realized that these masterpieces would probably not be purchased by our local wealthy Bohemians due to a lack of understanding on their part and also because the masterpieces themselves were rather expensive, they conceived the idea of a way to secure these originals by some other means so that we of Chicago would profit by the acquisition. That idea took root. It was believed that some of our local countrymen could <pb facs="5418478_3_0581.jpg" n="2"/>contribute at least some money for the purchase of several of these valuable art creations, and that subsequently these works could be presented to the local Art Institute as a gift from our Chicago Czechoslovaks.</p>
   <p>To start the ball rolling, two of our foremost local Czech artists, Professor Albin Polasek and the painter, Professor Antonin Sterba, were taken into confidence and their counsel was sought. Both of these gentlemen became enthusiastic over the proposed plan, and after having examined the works of the Czechoslovak artists, [particularly] those pieces which were chosen to be given to the Chicago Art Institute, and having assured themselves that they are truly worthy of being called works of art, they sanctioned the project, but not until they had also approached the Institute authorities. The two men were told that such a gift of the Chicago Czechoslovaks would be most gratefully welcomed by the Institute. This led to immediate activity.</p>
   <p>It was on October 10, 1921, that the following [form] letter, bearing the <pb facs="5418478_3_0582.jpg" n="3"/>signatures of our two great artists [Albin Polasek and Antonin Sterba], was mailed to our local institutions and individuals. Its tenor was as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our Honored Countryman: As people who are in constant contact with the local Art Institute, a place of which Chicago may justly be proud, we wish to call your attention to the fact that the work of Czechoslovak artists is not well represented in our galleries, at least not as it should be or as it deserves to be. One may find, of course, several artistic creations there, but neither in number nor in artistic value do they approach the greatness and purity of the painter's brush or the sculptor's chisel which characterize the masterpieces of our young but dearly beloved Czechoslovak Republic. If our Chicago Art Institute counts among its collections many foreign art works, why should it not include....the products of Czechoslovak art too? If such artistic creations found their way into the collections, would they not bring honor to us? Would not their inclusion permit us to be proud?</p>
   <p>"We recently learned that Messrs. Hak, Biciste, and Schreiber, who arrived <pb facs="5418478_3_0583.jpg" n="4"/>here from Prague to promote Czechoslovak art, have in their possession some great masterpieces of lasting value. They brought with them some original creations of such great masters as Marold, Mucha, Uprka, Sucharda, Amort, Maratka, and others. We would be very happy, indeed, if at least some of their works became the permanent possessions of the Chicago Art Institute, whose collections would thus be enriched. But the Art Institute itself is, at the moment, unable to make purchases because of a shortage of funds. Could there not be found among our Chicago Bohemians at least a small group of men who would prove that they are true admirers of art, and who would care to see the best Czechoslovak art represented among the other foreign art productions in the galleries of the Institute?</p>
   <p>"We know that you have the reputation of being interested in all things that are beautiful and artistic, and that you amply contribute to all those activities which deserve to be supported. According to our judgment, the present project is worthy of your generous support. It is our intention to <pb facs="5418478_3_0584.jpg" n="5"/>gather a few friends of art among our people and ask them to be benevolent enough to contribute some amount for the purchase of the masterpieces which are to be presented to the Chicago Art Institute in the interest of such propaganda that Czechoslovak art will be able to create in the aforesaid Institute. If you contribute to this project, you will have the distinction of having supported Czechoslovak art in a big way. Your meritorious act will likewise benefit the Chicago Art Institute, which will be grateful to you for anything that you might do in this respect. In regard to the actual transfer of the masterpieces to the galleries of the Institute, that remains our own personal duty and pleasure.....</p>
   <p>"The Masters Uprka, Marold, Mucha, Sucharda, Maratka, Amort, and other great artists have a great significance for Czechoslovakia. Do you desire to aid us in our work so that at least some of these masters' works may reach our galleries, which are numbered among the greatest in the United States? If you do, then send us your contribution; we ask it in the interest of that <pb facs="5418478_3_0585.jpg" n="6"/>Czechoslovak nation which gave origin both to you and to us. Your gift shall be gratefully mentioned in our daily press, and not only that, it will be gratefully acknowledged in the hearts of the entire Czechoslovak nation. Anticipating that our pressing request will find a ready response and that you will help us to accomplish this really great task which will bring lasting benefits to the Czechoslovaks in America, we thank you in advance and remain,</p>
   <p>"Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Albin Polasek and Antonin Sterba."</p>
   <p>This letter was then sent to various Bohemian enterprises, institutions, as well as to individuals from whom help was expected. The contributions began to arrive, of course, but they came very slowly. Even to this day, the cumulative results of the project are not as great as was expected.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0586.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The following corporations and individuals contributed: [There follows a long list of contributors and the amounts given.] The total amount received up to the present time is $1,450.</p>
   <p>Dr. E. Salaba Vojan has written a short sketch describing the selected art works and their authors, and this sketch will be delivered to the director of the Chicago Art Institute. The masterpieces selected for the permanent collections of the Art Institute and presented as a gift of the Chicago Czechoslovaks are the following: "Setkani" (A Meeting), by Ludek Marold; "Kyjovanka" (A Peasant Wench of Kyjov), by Jozka Uprka; "Praha A Vltava" (Prague and the River Moldau), which is a bronze plaque superimposed upon a marble base, by Stanislav Sucharda; a bronze statuette, "Zizka Na Koni" (Zizka [Hussite Warrior] on Horseback), V. L. Amort.</p>
   <p>The committee on presentation was appointed beforehand. It consists of the following gentlemen: Messrs. Anton J. Cermak; the well-known national worker, <pb facs="5418478_3_0587.jpg" n="8"/>Karel V. Janovsky; the enthusiastic and zealous local Czechoslovak priest, Reverend Fr. Bozenek; Dr. E. S. Vojan, and Louis Solar. The members of this committee also affixed their signatures to the previously mentioned sketch written by Dr. Vojan, and it was decided that all of them and Messrs. Hak and Schreiber deliver the masterpieces to the director of the Institute, Mr. Harsche. This group was to deliver the gift on Friday morning, but since only one member--Mr. L. Solar--was free on that day, the presentation was made by him in the company of the two Prague gentlemen, Messrs. Hak and Schreiber.</p>
   <p>As reported by Mr. Solar, they were very graciously received by the director of the Chicago Art Institute, who informd them that he had already been advised by Mr. Polasek that the gift was to be delivered. He then examined the art works and praised them in very flattering terms. He recognized Uprka's work as that of an old acquaintance and added that although he knew Marold and his work, he had little opportunity to get acquainted with him. He was <pb facs="5418478_3_0588.jpg" n="9"/>amazed by the facility [and ease] with which Messrs. Hak, Biciste, and Schreiber brought such masterpieces to America.</p>
   <p>We may also add that the director accepted these works temporarily for the committee on acceptance. The latter body will receive the gift officially after some of its members return from abroad. His thanks, however, were profuse, and he asked permission to exhibit the masterpieces in the forthcoming international watercolor exhibition which the Chicago Art Institute is organizing at present. The permission was given. Finally, Mr. Harsche requested that the thanks of the Institute be sent to all of the givers.</p>
