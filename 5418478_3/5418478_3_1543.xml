   <p>The usefulness and, in many cases, indispensability of such an institution as the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) was clearly demonstrated again in recent weeks when Chicago was getting ready to make arrangements for a huge athletic festival called Olympic Games. Neither our Sokols nor our singers, both of whom should have been among the first to be asked to take part in so important a demonstration of an international character, had been invited to participate.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar however, arranged for the best day of the festival, the first Sunday afternoon, to be reserved for the Sokols and for our singing societies. The principal expenses for preliminary arrangements and music and other incidentals will be refunded by the management. The Bureau has kept Chicago English newspapers supplied with releases concerning the <pb facs="5418478_3_1544.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian nation in general and the Sokols in particular, so as to prevent erroneous bits of information and absurdities from being published in the accounts of the Games--a thing which only too frequently has happened in the past on various other occasions. The Press Bureau also made preparations for all Bohemian newspapers in Chicago to continue giving the necessary publicity throughout the period before and during the Games, thus keeping up the interest both of those who were to participate actively and of the general public. A majority of the English language newspapers used some of the Bureau's material, and all of them printed advance releases about the Slavonic Day. And, what is perhaps of still greater permanent value, there was none of the usual misinformation in their own articles.</p>
   <p>The Slavonic Day was a brilliant success for Bohemian Sokols and singers. In spite of the terrible heat, many thousands of people came out to the Stadium, and the lake front down to Michigan Avenue resounded continuously with either Bohemian song or applause which rewarded the performances of Bohemian Sokols and singers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1545.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The two morning papers with the greatest circulation gave enthusiastic reports of the celebration. Monday's Tribune, which also carried several photographs of little Sokol girls, had in its report, which was placed in the most prominent space on the first page of the second section, five subtitles, of which four referred to the Slavonic Day and one, the last and smallest one, to the Swedish Night which followed. "Slavonic Feats Inspire Public;" "Beautiful Drills in Grant Park Attract Crowds;" "Sokols Start Parade;" "Calisthenics and Gymnastic Dances Part of Rich Program;"--these are the first four subtitles of the report which starts, "Ten thousand people assembled yesterday in Grant Park to attend the Slavonic Day and honor the thousands of performers who demonstrated various kinds of Slavonic gymnastics and calisthenics." The report, over half a column long, ends by saying, "During the performances of Bohemian singing societies, thousands of passers-by on Michigan Avenue stopped to listen to the music which was clearly heard."</p>
   <p>The Examiner wrote: "Chicagoans who could not be present at yesterday's Games at Grant Park missed not only the coolest spot in the city, but also the <pb facs="5418478_3_1546.jpg" n="4"/>opportunity to see the most beautiful group performances of Slavonic athletic and gymnastic associations ever shown in these parts. It is not often that one can see three hundred girls less than fifteen years old in perfect drills which caused envy among the mature, most capable performers of similar drills and calisthenics which followed." And: "Fully two hundred girls appeared on the field--strong, young Amazons who surpassed men in their feats and whose pyramids brought the biggest applause heard at the Olympic Games during the last two days." Or: "I should say that these examples of what the Slavonic people are capable of accomplishing truly surprised all those present."</p>
   <p>These are excerpts from English language newspapers.</p>
   <p>Our Sokols, as well as our Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies), may be fully satisfied with the success of this great day.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar is adding June 29 to its list of achievements, thus proving that an institution of its kind is often absolutely necessary.</p>
