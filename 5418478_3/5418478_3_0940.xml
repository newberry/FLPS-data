   <p>It seems that we are gradually getting old. Perhaps we may not be noticing it so much in ourselves, but the facts talk to us in a dry and unmistakable language of heartless figures that remind us of our age and force us to turn our thoughts again and again toward the past, and to see again the march of our own acts and the events of the past. These acts and events come to us from far away, from the springtime of our lives, and lead us in our memories to the less distant summer, which the autumn of our earthly pilgrimage is more likely to recall with exactness, and is therefore in a comparatively better position to pass judgment, basing judgment on experience, and projecting it into the future that leads us, slowly but surely, into our winter. If the judgment passed by the autumn of our life on the deeds of the spring and summer is unfavorable and unsatisfactory, the approaching winter creates a feeling of displeasure with ourselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0941.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But if we are in a position to recall that we have accomplished at least a few things that are worth while, the winter does not deprive us of the ability to go on and do some more, it does not deprive us of the zest of life marked with accomplishment, it does not kill the love and enthusiasm which bless our work; our spirit remains young, and its blossoms, though late, frequently ripen into wholesome and fragrant fruit in our fall.</p>
   <p>This aging does not apply to individuals only. It is the same with the whole, including its various associations and organizations. This we see very well in the life of Bohemian America. Of course, it is not yet old but we feel that it is getting aged. There were several indications of it last year, very definite indications, when a number of our national institutions commemorated, not their twenty-fifth, but their fiftieth anniversaries. Bohemian America is aging; with it are aging its institutions, and with them are aging we ourselves.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Pevecka Spolecnost Lyra (Bohemian Singing Society Lyra) is aging <pb facs="5418478_3_0942.jpg" n="3"/>also. This fact it had a splendid opportunity to realize last Saturday night when it recalled in a dignified celebration at the Libuse hall that it has existed in Chicago for full forty-five years. But it could also realize that, notwithstanding the years, it is not old and that, having done such a great deal of good for the cultural life of Bohemian Chicago, it is sure to be looking in youthlike freshness to new accomplishments in the future.</p>
   <p>Lyra has always been a good and willing worker, and because it has succeeded in overcoming many an obstacle and difficulty by a love of art and by enthusiasm , both of which continue to grace it to the present day, it is certain to celebrate, rejuvenated by its aging, not only its golden jubilee, but several more to follow.</p>
   <p>Lyra's beginnings go into the seventies. They were not exactly the most auspicious, but the patience and enthusiasm which the society put into its work have easily overcome all obstacles and have kept on improving its own <pb facs="5418478_3_0943.jpg" n="4"/>conditions. Its first conductor and instructor, R. Pitte, was followed by many others, each of them leading the society to new successes which were particularly impressive during the time when its membership was greatly increased by the absorption of the Damsky Pevecky Sbor Lada (Ladies' Singing Society Lada), and a school for young singers was founded.</p>
   <p>But later on the Lyra had to go through stormy periods, overcome new, grave obstacles. Doubling up on the work, it succeeded again and has arrived where we find it today, rich in membership, not only active but also contributing. Lyra's president is now Dr. L. Wedeles. Its vice-president is Mrs. Marie Mueller; secretary, Mr. F. Mayer; treasurer, Miss A. Radous; librarian, Mr. J. Lukes; and financial secretary, Mr. V. Tesar.</p>
   <p>We should fail in our duty if we did not mention some of the greater works with which Lyra has made our public acquainted: "Toman A Lesni Panna" (Toman and the Woods Maiden--a Slavic Mythological character, a sylph), "Svanda Dudak" (Svanda--name implies humor, fun--the Piper), "Slib Za Peci" <pb facs="5418478_3_0944.jpg" n="5"/>(Promise behind the Oven), Svatba Pri Lucernach (Wedding with Lauterus, or Storm Lights), "Zadny Muz A Tolik Devcat" (No Man and so Many Girls), "Fatinica," "Girofle-Girofla," "Kral Oedip" (King Oedipus), "Vilem Tell" (William Tell), and "Zvonky Cornevillske" (Bells of Corneville).</p>
   <p>Saturday's concert ran comparatively smoothly under Dr. J. D. Novak's baton...</p>
   <p>It is well to mention that Vitezslav Novak's magnificent choral composition "Nescasna Vojna" (Unfortunate War) was produced in Chicago Saturday for the first time.....</p>
   <p>After the concert a supper was served....during which...speeches and musical selections kept those assembled entertained....</p>
