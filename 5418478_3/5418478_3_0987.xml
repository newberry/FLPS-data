<title level="a">ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CESKA USTREDNI PEVECKA JEDNOTA</title></bibl>

  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In what was formerly Radous Hall, now owned by Mr. A. Zima, at the corner of Laflin and 18th Streets, there was held last Saturday the annual convention of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) to which the following singing societies belong: Pevecka Spolecnost Lyra (Lyra Singing Society); Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), together with its women's section, Maj; Pevecky Sbor Karel Bendl (Karel Bendl Singing Society); Pevecky Sbor Karel Marx (Karel Marx Singing Society), together with its women's group; Pevecky Sbor Dalibor (Dalibor Singing Society); Pevecky Sbor Volnost (Volnost Singing Society); Pevecky Sbor Stvrty Wardy (Fourth Ward Singing Society); Hrvatske Pevecky Druzstvo Zora (Croatian Singing Society Zora); Pevecky Sbor Lumir (Lumir Singing Society); Pevecky Sbor Dvanacty Wardy (Twelfth Ward Singing Society). These twelve societies of which the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota is composed sent their accredited delegates to the convention which filled the lower hall to capacity shortly after 8 P.M.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0988.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The convention was brought to order by the temporary chairman, Mr. Oldrich Harnach. The election of convention officers then followed, and Mr. Harnach was elected chairman by acclamation; Mr. Frank Zivny of Lyra was elected vice-chairman; Mr. K. Kratochvil of Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor was elected secretary.</p>
   <p>The next order of business was the reading of communications. Dr. Bilek, a member of the Delnicky Pevecky Sbor, sent his best wishes to the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota for its concert in the Coliseum and regretted that, since he is twenty-five hundred miles away, he will be unable to participate in the joint appearance of the Bohemian singers.</p>
   <p>The following proposals which were discussed came from individual societies. The Karel Bendl Sbor proposed that societies reject applications for membership from persons who have been suspended from other societies for nonpayment of dues. It also made a motion that societies belonging to the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota should not arrange entertainments on conflicting dates. [The reason for the first proposal was that] some members have been known to <pb facs="5418478_3_0989.jpg" n="3"/>leave one society because they have not paid their dues and then seek admittance into another society. It was resolved by the convention that every applicant for membership in a society belonging to the Ustredni Jednota be asked what society he had formerly belonged to and whether or not he left in good standing.</p>
   <p>In the matter of not arranging entertainments on the same date, it was decided that projected entertainments would be announced by the various societies by agreement with one another.</p>
   <p>The Croatian singing society Zora introduced a motion to the effect that with the aid of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota there be organized a Pan-Slavonic Singing Society. After some debate it was resolved that each nationality organize its own singing society and from these various groups there should then be organized a Pan-Slavonic Central Singing Society. It was left to the future officers to work toward that goal, and a call is to be issued by the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota to all Slavonic people in Chicago to organize their own singing societies, and when this has been done, <pb facs="5418478_3_0990.jpg" n="4"/>to create from them a Slavonic Central Singing Society.</p>
   <p>The convention committee made a motion that a charge be made by the Federation or individual societies when they are asked to make a public appearance. The motion was adopted, and it was decided to notify the various societies that the Federation already governs itself accordingly.</p>
   <p>Upon the recommendation of the convention committee, it was resolved to create a model Bohemian singing society. From each society belonging to the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota, the best singers are to be selected and a model Bohemian singing society created which is to serve as a sort of representative body of Chicago Bohemian singers. As to the financial support which will be needed for this purpose, it was decided to leave the matter in the care of the technical committee which will have charge of providing the necessary funds. It was further decided that any one wishing to be a member of this model organization must be a member of one of the regular societies belonging to the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0991.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The indifference of the societies was criticized by many delegates who sought recognition. The central committee exerts itself in every way possible, and during the past year it inaugurated with feverish activity many fine entertainments in co-operation with various societies. It arranged a splendid program in the Sokol Chicago hall, and now it announces the arrangement of another fine program at the Coliseum.</p>
   <p>The central committee therefore has done everything possible, but the individual societies are not taking as much interest as they should and are not trying to find out what is taking place in the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota. The accredited delegates of the various societies are not attending regular meetings of the central society, and this indifference is a great obstacle. Our singers lack three things: love for the cause, Bohemian song; strict discipline; and the fulfillment of their duties as well as the fostering of a spirit of brotherhood among them. All class distinctions among us must cease and true brotherhood must appear. Only then will Bohemian singers occupy the same relative position among our Bohemian-American people as is occupied by our Sokols. It was decided to cultivate better mutual understanding <pb facs="5418478_3_0992.jpg" n="6"/>and fraternity among our singing societies.</p>
   <p>The reports of the secretary and treasurer were then presented. There remains in the treasury the sum of ninety dollars. Because of the late hour, the convention proceeded to the election of an executive committee, and it was decided to let all of last year's committee remain in office.....</p>
   <p>The Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota requests the Bohemian people of Chicago to attend its concert in the Coliseum and thereby help in making the occasion a Bohemian demonstration.</p>
   <p>The convention ended at a late hour, after which the delegates were served refreshments.</p>
