   <p>Our legionnaires did not work and hope in vain. The first day of their Bazár Svobody (Liberty Bazaar) has proved that their efforts will be crowned with success and that their hope to eliminate the misery of widows and orphans of their fallen comrades will not only be fulfilled, but also surpassed.</p>
   <p>Although yesterday was only a weekday, although our working people long for a rest after the day's struggle, nevertheless, the attendance was great and gradually will be larger and larger until it reaches its climax on Sunday, when it will surpass anything that Pilsen Park has heretofore witnessed. The bazaar is such a colossal, such a perfect enterprise, that there has been <pb facs="5418478_3_1343.jpg" n="2"/>nothing like it among us before. Whoever visits it once will go back every day. He will also bring his friends and relatives along, and he will work for this project to the best of his ability. And at the same time he may rest assured that he is agitating for a project which is most meritorious--a project which is the best project ever arranged by the Bohemians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to write a great deal about what there is to see at the Bazaar. Everybody should come and see it for himself.....</p>
