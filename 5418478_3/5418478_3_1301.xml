   <p>It is generally known that the Bohemian Catholics of the city of Chicago established, with the permission of the Most Reverend George W. Mundelein, archbishop of Chicago, the so-called "Domov pro starce a stareny" (Home for the Aged). This home, which was most urgently needed, is located in Ceska Plzen [a Bohemian district in Chicago], at Paulina Street and Eighteenth Place, near St. Vitus Church. In order that the Home shall meet all modern requirements and that it be really a shelter for our aged men and women, where they can spend the last days of their lives in contentment, it has been necessary to repair the building thoroughly. The work on these repairs was started in June of this year under the supervision of the well-known Bohemian architect, Mr. Vaclav Rezny, who has promised us that next month the work on the building will be so far advanced that our Home for the Aged may be opened for its intended purpose.</p>
   <p>The repairs and the inside equipment will cost a good deal of money--about <pb facs="5418478_3_1302.jpg" n="2"/>fourteen thousand dollars--which amount we hope to scrape together, as soon as possible, from our numerous patrons and philanthropists and at the Svatovaclavska Pout (St. Wenceslaus Pilgrimage), which will be arranged by the Chicago district of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) for the benefit of the Domov pro starce a stareny. It will take place on St. Wenceslaus Day, September 28, in Pilsen Park, at 26th Street and Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>All our Catholic societies, courts, and lodges--of both sexes--are represented in the Chicago district, and we are convinced that the officers and the delegates of these societies, courts, and lodges will put forth their best efforts and will see to it that the Svatovaclavska Pout meets with success.</p>
   <p>The program of the festival will be very dignified and interesting for us--the Catholic Czechoslovaks of Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1303.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>An excellent band, composed of students from St. Prokopius College of Lisle, Illinois, will participate in the program, and famous Bohemian speakers will deliver suitable speeches.</p>
   <p>The afternoon program will be given by the children of our Catholic schools and by Catholic Sokols of both sexes. The members of our women's societies will take care of the booths, which will be filled with various useful articles, and the members of our men societies will try their best to quench the thirst of those who will be thirsty.</p>
   <p>The admission tickets to the Svatovaclavska Pout can be bought at any parsonage in Chicago and vicinity, or at the office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe, 3205 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>From this day on, let the following be the motto of all the Bohemian Catholics of Chicago and vicinity: "Everything for our aged men and women at the Svatovaclavska Pout, September 28!"</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1304.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Zdar Buh! (May God prosper it!).</p>
   <p>With countrymen's greetings,</p>
   <p>The Reverend Frantisek Bozenek.</p>
