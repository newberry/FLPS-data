   <p>A splendid concert under the baton of George Hrusa, was given in the Masonic hall, 23rd Street and Millard Avenue, by the well-known Hrusa school of music, of which the conductor Mr. Hrusa, is the head. Mature pupils, reinforced by members of the Chicago Federation of Musicians, played orchestral pieces such as the "Overture to Allessandro Stradella" by Flotow, and pieces by Liszt and Rameau. They also furnished the accompaniment to the piano "Concerto in C minor" by Beethoven, played the the excellent pianist, Miss Hattie Kovarik, and for "Ach Jaky Zal" (O, what sorrow ) from the opera "The Bartered Bride" by Smetana, sung in grand style by Mrs. Louise Topinka.</p>
   <p>The George Hrusa school of music occupies a high place among the institutions devoted to the study of instruments, composition and conducting. Its head is a former pupil of the Conservatory of music in Prague, <pb facs="5418478_3_0431.jpg" n="2"/>Czecho-Slovakia.
