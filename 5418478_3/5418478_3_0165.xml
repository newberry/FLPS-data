   <p>The Association of Bohemian Tavern Owners in Ceska Kalifornia (Bohemian California), a district in the west part of Chicago, held a meeting on January 20 in Mr. J. J. Vodak's Hall, at the corner of Sawyer Avenue and 25th Street.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, which was very well attended, the discussion centered around the question whether the Spolek Ceskych Hostinskych should function independently and ask the Hlavni Teleso (Supreme Council)for a charter, or join the existing Spolek Ceskych Hostinskych.</p>
   <p>It was agreed to request the Hlavni Teleso for a charter, and request the now functioning organization for its co-operation, explaining that this organization has no intention of working against their organization; on the contrary, the Spolek Ceskych Hostincu, under existing conditions, is concerned primarily with the organizing of all Bohemian tavern owners who are not members of any organization; it also wishes to contact those who do not want to join the already <pb facs="5418478_3_0166.jpg" n="2"/>active organization, for the purpose of showing a united front to combat the menace of prohibition, and to further the business of tavern owners.</p>
   <p>It was also agreed to send references of meetings to newspapers, and to advertise the meetings in these publications.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held Thursday, February 3, at two o'clock in the afternoon, at the Vojta Naprstek School. All tavern owners who do not belong to the organization are invited to this meeting.</p>
