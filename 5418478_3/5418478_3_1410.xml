   <p>This is going to be a day of real excitement for men and women who compete for the honor of being elected "Mayor" or "Mayoress" of our Chicago Czech community. An additional inducement to enter the contest is found in the beautiful prizes which will go to the winner. Several of our organizations have held subelections, and the primaries today will decide on the men and women in the finals.</p>
   <p>The first prize is exhibited at the bazaar today. It is a chairman's gavel, a hammer donated by the Czech Jewelers' and Clockmakers' Association. The gavel is a genuine work of art, made of ebony, ivory, and 14-carat gold, and is studded with twenty-two cut diamonds, which by themselves represent a value of several hundred dollars. A plaque is inserted on which the winner's name will be engraved, the name of his organization, and the date. Two more hammers belong to this first prize. They are replicas of the first except that <pb facs="5418478_3_1411.jpg" n="2"/>they have no diamonds. One of these will go to the organization to which the winner belongs. The other will be sent, after the war, to Bohemia and presented to the museum in the City of Prague. It will be an everlasting token of the faith with which Czech-Americans have made sacrifices during this war. Numerous prizes for contestants nearest the winner will be distributed.</p>
   <p>More about the Opening Last Saturday</p>
   <p>The Hindenburg statue was one of the prime attractions last Saturday. The first two nails driven into it brought in $60. Mrs. Cervenka, the "queen" of the last bazaar, delivered the opening address at 8 P. M. She was vested in her regalia. The keynote of her speech pointed to duty in these portentous times, toward victory and liberty. The "Star-Spangled Banner" was played and sung with fervor. Shortly after the anthem was finished, Mrs. Cervenka again appeared on the stage, this time in soldier's khaki, and called out:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1412.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I have shed my regal cloak, and now, as director of the Trench Restaurant, I invite you heartily to join me there!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Martinek, chairman of the bazaar committee, declared that the bazaar was officially opened; he thanked all his co-workers for their support. "Hej Slovane!" (Ho, Slavs!) followed.</p>
   <p>The next number on the program was one which evoked genuine mirth and merriment. It was the unveiling of the statue, representing the "most famous man in the world," General Hindenburg. We shall not describe the statue; even a picture could not do that. It was cut out of the trunk of a willow tree by the sculptor Vojtech (Adalbert) Lukas. A spiked helmet sits upon a physiognomy which reminds one of the little animal of which name rhymes with "fig," "dig," etc.....</p>
   <p>The act of unveiling was performed by Mr. Psenka, chairman of the program committee, assisted by Mr. Kubec, head of the "Czech California" section, <pb facs="5418478_3_1413.jpg" n="4"/>and six delegates of the C.S.P.S. (Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost--Czecho-Slav Aid Society) who had been appointed to guard the prisoner. The ceremony was brief but touching. The speaker called aloud:</p>
   <p>"Which is the most beautiful quadruped of the world?"</p>
   <p>The multitude in chorus answered:</p>
   <p>"Hindenburg!"</p>
   <p>"Who ordered a dinner to be eaten in Paris and has not yet arrived to eat it?"</p>
   <p>And again the chorus:</p>
   <p>"Hindenburg!"</p>
   <p>"Who is winning battles and losing the war for the Kaiser?"</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1414.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The same answer.</p>
   <p>"Who loves the world as he loves malaria and the measles?"</p>
   <p>"Hindenburg!"</p>
   <p>"Into whose body would every one of us gleefully stick a fifteen-inch-long shingle-nail?"</p>
   <p>"Into Hindenburg!"</p>
   <p>"And who is going to help us to make dollars for the liberation of our motherland and for the defeat of Prussian militarism?"</p>
   <p>The exultant crowd:</p>
   <p>"Hindenburg!"</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1415.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"Into whose ribs and other parts of his anatomy are we going to drive nails?"</p>
   <p>"Hindenburg's!"</p>
   <p>"And who will reveal himself to our gaze when the shroud is removed?"</p>
   <p>Before the crowd could respond "Hindenburg!" again, the statue stood there in its hairy beauty, the likeness of Hindenburg in full military regalia. Within a split second the band began to blare in such uncanny tones that one might have imagined that a thousand Hindenburgs were engaged in a scuffle. The public meanwhile approached the statue to see who should be honored with driving in the first nail.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Cervenka proved himself a master auctioneer by over bidding himself until the amount of $30 was announced.</p>
   <p>"I'll take the second nail for $30 also".</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1416.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Thus the first two nails brought in $60. The amount of $76.40 was collected from the statue. When our people have become accustomed to Hindenburg, the nail-driving will be more intense, no doubt.</p>
   <p>The artistic part of the program was of high quality. Miss Annette Marchand, French singer, received a clamorous greeting. The cabaret was conducted by-Director J. Weidner of the Sokol Chicago Theater. Mr. Joseph Mach recited some of his sprightly poems. Miss Elsie Gavmond danced the "Habanera" from the opera "Carmen". Our Miss Zeman sang "Kdybych Se" (If I Should Ever) from Smetana's opera "The Bartered Bride". Our Mrs. Slavka Svoboda sang choice morsels by Hasler. Mr. John Cervenka Raffled off many beautiful objects between performances.</p>
