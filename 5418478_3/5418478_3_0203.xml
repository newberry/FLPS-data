   <p>In compliance with many requests for information concerning the contest for contributions or prizes offered by our company, we submit the following explanation:</p>
   <p>The Pilsen Brewing Company offers to our public a plan which it is hoped will find the full approval of all those who are interested in our national charitable organizations. With every purchase of our famous Olympia beer (to be taken home), the buyer will receive from the seller--a restaurant, tavern, etc.--a ballot on which the name of one of the four organizations mentioned below, plus the name and address of the purchaser are to be written. The ballot should then be put into a mailbox. An amount of $650 donated by our company will be divided into four prizes to be given to the following charitable organizations: Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage); St. Joseph's Orphanage; Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association); Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital).</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0204.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The prizes will be awarded as follows: The organization receiving the largest number of votes will receive the first prize of $300. The organization with the second highest number of votes will receive the second prize of $200. The third organization will be given a prize of $100; the fourth organization, $50. The dead line for this contest is July 5, 1913.</p>
   <p>In order to compensate our customers for their efforts and to stimulate interest in this contest, the following prizes for individuals are being offered: Four prizes of $25 each to be given to four individuals sending in the highest number of votes for any one of the designated organizations and signed by the individual--total $100. Four additional prizes of $15 each for customers sending in the second highest number of votes for any one of the four organizations--total $60. Four prizes of $10 each for customers sending in the third highest number of votes for any one of the four organizations-total $40.</p>
   <p>Only ballots containing the name of one organization are valid. All ballots <pb facs="5418478_3_0205.jpg" n="3"/>are stamped for immediate mailing.</p>
   <p>The American State Bank has been appointed referee in this contest, and each of the four designated institutions has the right to nominate one person to supervise the counting of ballots. These persons will get $25 each for their work.</p>
   <p>The form of the ballot is published in the newspapers. Ballots are available on all premises where our Olympia beer is sold.</p>
