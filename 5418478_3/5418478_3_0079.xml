   <p>Cicero is the seat of a new Bohemian enterprise which was recently incorporated under the name of the Suburban Real Estate Improvement Company. This new company will devote itself exclusively to the erection of homes in Cicero and vicinity. The well-known Bohemian architect and builder, Mr. Thomas M. Filas, heads this new enterprise. Mr. Filas has had ten years of experience in every phase of the building and real-estate business. He built for himself an organization of experienced men who can assure a bright outlook for the future success of the company.</p>
   <p>The company at the present time is completing the erection of the last thirty-five homes in the new Clydedale Subdivision at 25th Street and 61st Avenue. This subdivision was pronounced by experts as one of the most advanced as far as architectural and building perfection is concerned. In order to enable the company to work on a larger scale, part of the stock will be sold to the public at ten dollars a share. All other details regarding this new company are published in <pb facs="5418478_3_0080.jpg" n="2"/>another section of this newspaper. There is no doubt that the company, under the direction of experts, will be a success and a benefit to the district which it intends to serve.</p>
