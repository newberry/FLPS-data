   <p>Our Chicago Czechoslovaks have greeted with great satisfaction the appearance of one of our countrymen who, though he calls himself De Rubini, is a native of Moravia, Czechoslovakia. His real name is Evzen Plachy. Mr. De Rubini, who is also known as "the man with the sixth sense," performed before a Czechoslovak audience at the Lawndale Masonic Temple yesterday. He performed such unheard of feats of telepathy that his audience was left astounded. His performance was preceded by a few simple folk songs sung by Miss Annie Lukes whose marvelous soprano fully earned her the great applause she received. She was accompanied at the piano by Miss Anezka Blafka whose efforts were no less commendable....</p>
   <p>After a few pertinent introductory remarks concerning the phenomena of telepathy <pb facs="5418478_3_0670.jpg" n="2"/>in general, the management introduced the much anticipated De Rubini.....His first feature was the so-called "mail". Here De Rubini delivered sealed letters with addresses lacking to their correct addresses whom he, of course, never met personally.....He also was able to find certain well-concealed objects such as pins, watches, etc. It should be mentioned at this point that whenever new tasks were to be imposed on him by the audience and the management, he was closely watched by a guard consisting of four men who locked him up in a room far removed from the actual place where the conference was going on. He was given several humorous assignments all of which he performed well. He proved himself to be a master of hypnosis, of suggestion, of automatism, and left the audience convinced that there is no greater master in the manipulation of animal hypnotism than he.</p>
   <p>Our people will be interested to know that the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvik Dramatic Association) arranged its evening program at the Sokol Chicago Hall in such a way as to give Mr. De Rubini a chance to use the greater part <pb facs="5418478_3_0671.jpg" n="3"/>of the evening for another performance before his countrymen.....</p>
