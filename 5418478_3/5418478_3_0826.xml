   <p>p.2--The Lidove Divadlo, (Peoples Theater) has concluded a successful season last Sunday, by presenting a lively comedy named, "Third Ringing," written by a Bohemian writer, Mr. Stech. This play is really one of the finest and most amusing Bohemian comedies.</p>
   <p>It was presented in a faultless way and therefore the large audience which was present enjoyed it immensely. This farewell performance by the Peoples Theater was presented just as remarkably well as their first play of the season.</p>
   <p>The entire cast of this theater consists of talented Bohemian actors, many of whom are genuine artists in that field.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0827.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is hoped that we shall have again the opportunity to enjoy the acting of these artists during the next season, and that the management will again prepare a choice repertoire.</p>
