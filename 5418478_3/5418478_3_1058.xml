   <p>As we have mentioned briefly before, the amateur-photographer members of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni are organizing a gala night which will be held sometime next month and at which the distribution of prizes of a photographic contest will take place. It will be the first night of its kind in Bohemian America, and the prizes awarded will be well worth preserving by all their winners.</p>
   <p>There will be an entertaining program arranged for the evening, and the whole affair will be a social event of the first order, perhaps the red-letter day of our social season.....</p>
   <p>Following are the rules of the contest. All our photographers should clip them out and save.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_1059.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Rules of the Contest of Bohemian Amateur Photographers</p>
   <p>The contest will take place in the second half of the month of November.</p>
   <p>The prizes that will be awarded to the exhibitors of the best amateur photographs are:</p>
   <p>1) A silver cup and the title of champion of Chicago Bohemian amateur photographers. The cup will be the winner's property.</p>
   <p>2) Travel camera, value, at least $15.</p>
   <p>3) Bronze trophy.</p>
   <p>4) Field glass.</p>
   <p>5) Enlargement and framing of the photograph awarded this prize <pb facs="5418478_3_1060.jpg" n="3"/>Photographs to be submitted must be the work of countrymen from Chicago and vicinity who have never been professional photographers.....</p>
   <p>The prizes will be awarded by a jury consisting of Bohemian professional photographers and members of the building arts committee of the Cesky Umelecky Klub (Bohemian Arts Club).....</p>
   <p>The net profit of the contest and the whole evening at which the prize distribution will take place will go to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) as a gift of Bohemian amateur photographers and of those countrymen who are donating the prizes.....</p>
   <p>All communications should be directed to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni at 3639 West 26th Street, at the corner of Millard Avenue.....</p>
