   <p>The performance of the three-act burlesque "Svec Baronem" (The Cobbler Becomes a Baron), which took place in the Sokol Chicago hall last night, gave the unusually large attendance ample chance to testify to the popularity of our soubrette, Mrs. Slavka Krejci. It was during the past season that the artiste grew into a member whose collaboration is well-nigh indispensable.</p>
   <p>The play was written by Fr. Hlavaty, who wrote two other comedies, "Mlsni Kocouri," (The Finicky Tom-Cats) and "Bila Miska," (The Tiny White Mouse). These plays have crossed the footlights of our stage some time ago. "The Cobbler" is not Mr. Hlavaty's best creation, to be sure, but it contains a part which fits Mrs. Krejci's talent and temperament to a point, it being the role of "Stazka Terinkova." Mrs. Krejci and the rest of the cast delivered themselves of their task very <pb facs="5418478_3_0914.jpg" n="2"/>expertly.</p>
   <p>The last performance of this season will take place on May 6, On that day, Mr. Jindrich (Henry) Weidner will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of his activity as an actor, and his fifth year as director of the theatre. "Monte Cristo" will be given on that occasion. [Transslator's note: Name of theatrical group is not given in report]</p>
