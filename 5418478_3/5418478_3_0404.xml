  <body>
   <p>Our well-known local violin virtuoso and music teacher, Mr. Jiri Hrusa, presented a concert yesterday afternoon in the hall of the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol V Chicago (Bohemian Sokol Association in Chicago). The co-operating artist was Miss Jane Cervenka, a soprano. The symphony orchestra consisted of about fifty members. Although the hall was well filled, it may be said that the attendance could have been better, for such an occasion as this deserves the support of our people.</p>
   <p>The concert began with Franz Suppe's overture, "The Poet and Peasant". The musicians were pupils of Mr. Jiri Hrusa and our well-known and excellent cellist, Mr. Jaroslav Gons. The bass viols were played by Mr. Vaclav Jiskra, Mr. Frantisek Kryl, and several members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra which is one of the foremost musical organizations in this country.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0405.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hrusa conducted the orchestra and demonstrated that he is a good reader of the score and that he can follow the musical nuances and rhythms as well as each musical phrase, allowing the full beauty to stand out in every way. Hrusa also proved that he is an able conductor not only in the use of his baton, but also by using his eyes as a control medium. Other numbers on the program were: The "Larghetto" from Beethoven's Second Symphony; Fibich's "Poem"; Suk's "Menuetto"; Toselli's "Serenade"; a dance from Smetana's opera, "The Bartered Bride". The concert ended with Strauss' "Blue Danube" waltz.....</p>
   <p>Miss Jane Cervenka's numbers were as follows: Arditi's "Waltz"; an aria from Mascagni' opera "La Cavalleria Rusticana". Her sympathetic manner of presentation was rewarded by thunderous applause, so that she was obliged to sing several American songs as encores. Her voice is very good, and it is our honest opinion that with her fine voice, coupled with our Czechoslovak musical culture, which has a great variety of fine songs and excellent operas, <pb facs="5418478_3_0406.jpg" n="3"/>Miss Cervenka has a chance to use them in her repertory. She could even sing them in the English language, but as a Bohemian-American she should realize that one may not exclude Czech songs from one's repertory. Her beautiful voice would then come into its own, especially when accompanied by an orchestra. For the rest, however, we must say that both she and Hrusa may be proud of success of yesterday.</p>
