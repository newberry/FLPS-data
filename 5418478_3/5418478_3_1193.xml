   <p>The Amateur Circle, "Josef Kajetan Tyl," of Town of Lake, in February of last year, offered two prizes for the best Bohemian-American comedy and a portrayal of life. Four works were entered in the competition, two plays from life and two comedies.</p>
   <p>A five-man jury composed of Messrs. Otto R. Fuerst, editor of Denni Hlasatel; Jos. Jiri Kral, editor of Spravedlnost; F. L. Hotsky, a member of "Ludvik's Theatre"; R. J. Psenka, editor of Svornost and Dr. Jar. E. S. Vojan, manager of C. A. T. K. (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), disqualified both comedies, "Anarchists," and "Pulnocaci," (Night Owls) as being unsuitable. In the case of the other two works, the judges decided to accept them for the competition, because they show exceptional merit, and are assured of great success upon the stage.</p>

   <p>Neither one of them is perfect, both will need rewriting in some parts to heighten the scenic effects, and neither is so deeply Bohemian-American as to cut into our life and show some characteristic trait, but both have many good parts, and more than once Bohemian-American influence appears. As a result, both prizes, fifty and twenty-five dollars, were awarded to these two works. "Obeti Jpadku" (Victim of Defalcation) received first prize, and "Za Velkym Cilem" (High Aims) received second prize. The authors of these plays are requested to send their names to the secretary of the Circle, (Mr. Jarda. V. Burian, 1502 West 18th Street, Chicago), at their earliest convenience, so that the names may be announced to the Bohemian-American public, which has followed the contest with sincere interest.</p>
