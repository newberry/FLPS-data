   <p>The second day of the convention of building and loan associations was devoted entirely--with the exception of a luncheon in Mr. Falta's restaurant--to business....</p>
   <p>The morning session, which more than two hundred delegates attended, was opened by President Frank G. Hájíček.....Most of the time was taken up with reports of committees....The financial report was very gratifying.....The part of that report dealing with Chicago associations shows that there are now in Chicago 214 building and loan associations, of which 103 are Bohemian. All together they represent the sum of nineteen million dollars, of which ten million belong to Bohemian associations, proving that the Bohemian associations are the best, most progressive, and most successful of all.....</p>
   <p>The net income of the Bohemian associations amounted to $1,023,000, and the <pb facs="5418478_3_0216.jpg" n="2"/>benefits paid out to members was $2,782,000 during the past year. That period showed a net profit of $325,000.</p>
