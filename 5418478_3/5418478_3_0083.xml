   <p>To the Bohemian people: Last week, in the month of February, our Bohemian newspapers reported on the sale of a building known as the Pilsen Auditorium, which, until recently, was owned by the Vypomocny Spolek Borivoj (Borivoj Building and Loan Association).</p>
   <p>In reference to this above-mentioned report, the board of directors of the Vypomocny Spolek Borivoj hereby proclaims that the offer of the Lawndale Amusement Company was the first actual offer which could have been considered. There is no proof whatsoever that a real offer was ever made since the year 1915. Offers and inquiries as to whether the Association would be willing to exchange the building for vacant lots and second mortgages could not have been taken into consideration, even if they were given in good faith. It is true that in the course of the negotiations, other offers were made; but the offer of the Lawndale Amusement Company was the most advantageous for the Association, and therefore it was accepted. Any other conjectures and assertions are groundless.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0084.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As far as the financial condition of the Association is concerned, the board of directors may truthfully state that by selling this building, it not only saved the Vypomocny Spolek Borivoj from disaster, but also the fact remains that because of its security and profits, the Association may be ranked today with all of the best-governed and most prosperous building and loan associations. The recently matured series showed a profit of seventeen dollars per share. Therefore, even after the deduction of losses, the members will receive not only their deposits in full, but also almost 5 per cent interest on their savings. Those people who became members of our Association after November 24, 1916, that is, after the adjustment meeting, will suffer no losses whatsoever and will receive all their savings and a full share of the profits as in any other building and loan association.</p>
   <p>The present members of the board of directors cannot be blamed for losses suffered in the past, and therefore they have no reason to conceal anything. It is a fact that there were losses, and that it was high time that something should have been done about it, because otherwise the members would have lost much more.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_3_0085.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The present board of directors did have sad experiences, but thanks to its farsightedness, honesty, economy, and energy, it saved the Vypomocny Spolek Borivoj from complete disaster.</p>
   <p>The members of the board of directors extend their gratitude, at this opportunity, to all who helped in any way to make this difficult task more agreeable. They also thank all those who, according to the best of their abilities, strove to make this task more difficult for us . The latter group acted unfriendly because of the former, and for this we are grateful for having learned something about human nature.</p>
   <p>For the board of directors of the Vypomocny Spolek Borivoj,</p>
   <p>A. V. Vesely, secretary.</p>
