   <p>The first stage appearance of the theatrical group with which Mr. Arno Mario Hess is working to arrange for regular theatrical performances, was made on Wednesday evening at the Sokol Chicago Hall. Because our Bohemian stage is busy on Sunday, these theatrical performances were dated for week days. This change in itself is something new and unusual for our people. And unusual was also the first performance. Instead of a regular three-act play the program consisted of three one-act plays and to that was added something which may be called an operatic scene. These one-act plays were very old but because our people are not accustomed to anything like that, it meant something new for the majority of the audience.....</p>
   <p>Taking into consideration that the performance was presented on a week day, the attendance may be called large. But otherwise, it is to be hoped that next time this group of actors will surprise us with something much better and more worthy.</p>
