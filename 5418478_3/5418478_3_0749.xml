   <p>The Ludvik theatrical group returned to the Thalia auditorium, where it gave Moliere's classic play, "The Miser," last night. A large audience welcomed it at this performance, which is its first this season. Mrs. Bohumila Ludvik, widow of the former director, was in charge of the stage management. The play is a novelty as far as the Chicago Czech stage is concerned, although it is a product of the seventeenth century. It is a play that requires detailed acting in order to please the audience as much as it does the reader.</p>
   <p>The performance was evidently a success, judging from the frequent applause. This was good proof of the care that the performers took to depict this classic.</p>
   <p>Harpagon, the title role, was played by Mr. J. Skalicky, who has again appeared after an absence of several years from our stage. He was greeted as a skillful actor who is again to be a valuable asset to the group. He presented a character into whose traits he had delved very thoroughly; it is really the only <pb facs="5418478_3_0750.jpg" n="2"/>important role of the play, though other figures are also depicted in an interesting fashion. These other characters were cleverly represented by Mmes. Splavec, Ludvik, Horlivy, Novak, and Stetina, as well as by Messrs. Dvorak, Stach, Klapka, Horlivy, and Brejla. Professor Capek directed the orchestra. The audience had to pay the war tax for the first time, and did it with obvious pleasure.</p>
