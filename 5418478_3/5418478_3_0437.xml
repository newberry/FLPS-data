<title level="a">THE SECOND CONCERT OF CHAMBER MUSIC</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The efforts exerted to raise chamber music to a higher level have passed the trial stage, and today there is no difficulty in getting an audience for this type of music.</p>
   <p>The best proofs of this are the concerts arranged at Stiles Hall on Millard Avenue and 22nd Street. The second concert of the season was held there yesterday, and, like the first, had an attendance which filled every seat in the hall with an audience appreciative of artistic creations.</p>
   <p>To Mr. A. V. Cerny, who figuratively is the very soul of these musical recitals, all thanks are due for his careful arrangement of the program.</p>

H. Capek, Jan Kalas, and the late Bohumil Holub.</p>
   <p>The Dvorak Trio was rendered brilliantly, and the artists were heartily applauded. Miss Libuse Zdenka sang Smetana's "Mekamenujte Proroky" (Do Not Stone the Prophets), Friml's "Zastavenicko" (Serenade), Vymetal's "Me Drahe Dite" (My Dear Child), and an English song, "The Old Fashioned Home," by Squire. Miss Zdenka's presentations were the best in the second and fourth numbers; Mr. Cerny was the accompanist.</p>
   <p>Trnecek's Capriccio, Opus 2, a trio, was a real gem. It was played by the</p>
