   <p>P.1--We finally had the opportunity yesterday to hear and appreciate our well-known Chicago compatriot, Mr. Alois Trnka, the talented young musician who left us several years ago and returned as an accomplished virtuoso, assigned by critics to a place among artists of the first rank. He aroused attention even at that time, appearing here as a pupil of Capek's music school, and music critics predicted certain success for him.</p>
   <p>Therefore it is not to be wondered at that Mr. Trnka's return from the Prague conservatory was eagerly anticipated, and that every one desired to know what progress he had made under the tutelage of the famous master Sevcik. The spacious Pilsen Sokol hall was filled to capacity yesterday, when our young artist appeared to demonstrate how his remarkable musical talent has developed in the course of several years. If Mr. Trnka had formerly attracted attention, he aroused admiration this time.</p>
   <p>Mr. Trnka's opening selection, with which he appeared for the first time <pb facs="5418478_3_0533.jpg" n="2"/>before the Chicago public as a virtuoso, was Bach's difficult Sonata in G Minor, which he played faultlessly.</p>
   <p>The experience of last night at pilsen Hall was indeed a pleasure. The public on departing was lavish in its praise, and satisfaction and joy were everywhere manifested that a virtuoso of our own race is acquiring so great a reputation.</p>
   <p>After the concert many of the artist's friends presented themselves to congratulate him and to shake his hand. Mr. Trnka was highly pleased to find such favor among his own people and to have so large an audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alois Trnka will remain here only until next Sunday. He will then leave for Rochester, New York, where he will reside.</p>
