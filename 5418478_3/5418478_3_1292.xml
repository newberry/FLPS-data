   <p>Countrymen! The Pamatnik Odboje (Memorial of Insurrection), which is a department of the Ministry of National Defense in Prague, has sent to America a collection of documents pertaining to the activities of the Czechoslovak Legions, and forming an exhibition which will be open for public inspection in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on Lawndale Avenue and 26th Street from October 25 to October 28, 1921. This historically very valuable collection constitutes a visual description of the formation, development, and activities of all our Legions on all fronts of the World War. It is being sent to this country in order that our countrymen may see how our Legions lived and fought while the whole of Czechoslovak America was helping in such a substantial way in the liberation of our old country. The Czechoslovak Legions know how to appreciate the immense work done by Czechoslovak America for the independence of our old country, and the sending of the above-mentioned collection to America is an act by which the Legions want to show their gratefulness for the help that <pb facs="5418478_3_1293.jpg" n="2"/>Czechoslovak America has been giving to make our revolution on the soil of the Allies successful.</p>
   <p>In order that the exhibition of the Pamatnik Odboje may fulfill its mission it must have as large a number of visitors as possible. It is therefore the national duty of all Czechoslovak organizations in and around Chicago to use their influence in promoting the attendance at the exhibition. In that way they will prove that they have in grateful memory all the heroic deeds and sacrifices of our boys who did not hesitate to give all, including their lives, in order that our nation might be liberated.</p>
   <p>We suggest that all our organizations to whom admission tickets to the exhibition have been sent sell these tickets in advance among their memberships, and if need be, order an additional supply from the office of the exhibition committee at 3646 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois. Organizations which for some reason or other have not received a supply of these admission tickets should send their names and requirements to Mr. Vincenc Vrdsky, secretary of <pb facs="5418478_3_1294.jpg" n="3"/>the committee. For the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Fellowship of Czechoslovak Legionnaires) in Chicago, Jan Vosatko, president; Vaclav Ruml and Ant. Wagner, organizers of the exhibition of the Pamatnik Odboje; Dr. J. F.
