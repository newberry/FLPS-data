   <p>p. 1 - col. 3.. The Bohemian gymnastic organization branch at Sokol Chicago Building has been active for the past (14) fourteen years in physical development of Bohemian men, women and children.</p>
   <p>Yesterday this organization gave a public gymnastic exhibition at their gymnasium located at 24th Street and Kedzie Avenue. During the afternoon program the young Sokol boys and girls gave their exhibition, consisting of various physical drills, which they performed perfectly. The evening program consisted of exhibitions by older boys and girls who performed in various flag, club, bars and pole drills which were very colorful and interesting.</p>
   <p>Following were drills by the Sokol men and Sokol women on bars, horses and other gymnastical equipment. The feats which they performed were indeed examples of skill in physical art.</p>
   <p>Sokol Mr. J. Jirousek, the instructor, was presented with floral offerings, after the exhibition, for his devotion to this work and for the wonderful exhibition which he personally conducted. The exhibition was a great success.</p>
