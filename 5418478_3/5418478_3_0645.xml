   <p>The works of two Bohemian Artists, living here in America, are known to us, that is Miss Koupal of Chicago and the newest work of Mr. T.B. Melzer of Detroit.</p>
   <p>Miss Koupal's paintings which are exhibited in private and public exhibitions, and one a portrayal of a gypsy woman which was also shown at the State Exhibition, are being highly praised in American Art circles and the Lady is recognized as having remarkable talent.</p>
   <p>Recently we had the pleasure of seeing a large portrait painting done on canvas by Mr. Melzer, who spent some time in our city. It is a portrait of our fellow-citizen, Louis Pregler. The portrait shown is a bust figure about one-half life size. It shows Mr. Pregler in the uniform of an Officer of the United States Army, The artist was very successful in the painting of the portrait, which is at present on exhibition at the place of business of Mr. Ant. Pregler, 440 Jefferson St. The portrait proves the extraordinary skill of the young Artist, scarcely 26 years old, and we congratulate Mr. Melzer and heartily wish him success in his future efforts.</p>
