   <p>Ice-cold weather and blizzards certainly are not conducive to theatergoing. Again yesterday we had one of those days when one dislikes to leave the cozy corner near the fireside at home. This was the reason why not too many people had to be turned away from the box office of the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Ludvik's Theater) at Thalia Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klapka is the most popular actor appearing in comedies on our Chicago Czech stage. The evening was for his benefit and should have, as usual, been overcrowded.</p>
   <p>Samberk's "Elektricka Ruka Pani Haty" (Mrs. Agatha's Electric Hand), known also by the name "Kulaty Svet" (The Round World), was selected by Mr. Klapka. This piece offers great opportunities for Mr. Klapka as the janitor "Motak," and also for Mrs. Ludvik (directress of the theatrical group), who played "Mrs. Hata". Mr. Klapka's humor and histrionic skill, as well as his adeptness <pb facs="5418478_3_0745.jpg" n="2"/>at singing couplets, are known to our theater-loving public.</p>
   <p>Last night's performance went off very smoothly. Some of the more important roles have changed hands. Mr. Horlivy was entrusted with the character of "Samec," Mr. Skalicky played "Mrinka," Mrs. Splavec "Crescence". Other players were Mrs. Kozlanska, Mr. Novak, Miss Fric, Messrs. Stach, Dvorak, Ludvik, Brejla, Kubovy, and Lerch. The stage management was in the experienced hands of Mrs. Ludvik.</p>
   <p>The spectators evidently enjoyed the evening very much. Professor Capek, who with his orchestra presented an artistic program, deserves part of the credit for the success of the evening.</p>
