   <p>The Ludvík's Bohemian Dramatic Association [known as Ludvíkovci] concluded its activity for this season by presenting "Jarní Vody" (Springtime Waters) in its hall on 18th and Allport Streets last night. This three act drama, the work of Albert Jaroslav Havránek, has never before been presented on our Czech stage in Chicago, although it met with success when it went across the footlights of several theatres in the old homeland a number of years ago. It certainly was entitled to a presentation more than many other plays which appear annually in our theatres. Mr. Havránek depicts in it Czech student life very impressively.</p>
   <p>The performance was given for the benefit of Mr. Anton Wagner, that able and assiduous young actor, to whose popularity the audience testified by its frequent and enthusiastic applause, an abundance of floral offerings, and many other tokens of approval. The beneficiary appeared in one of the <pb facs="5418478_3_1133.jpg" n="2"/>main parts, that of "Bohuš Březina." He played with genuine emotion and remarkable skill. Messrs. Prokop and Dvořak played "Černík" and "Bíza," the two students, rivals for the love of "Boža," this part being rendered by Mrs. Horlivý, who proved again that she is an adornment for the troupe. Mr. and Mrs. Ludvik, Mmes. Splavec, and Kozlansky, as well as Messrs. Sverak and Horlivý, gave an excellent account of their ability in the other parts. The staging was perfect.</p>
   <p>No small credit for the success of the evening is due to Professor J. H. Căpek, conductor of the theatre orchestra, which furnished the music between acts. The troupe is going to leave in a few days for a number of performances in Nebraska.</p>
