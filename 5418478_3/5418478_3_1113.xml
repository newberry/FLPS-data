   <p>The auditorium of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, South Lawndale Avenue near West 22nd Street, was the scene of two separate patriotic events. The first of them was the big reception for our guests, the two delegates of the French Government. It was held yesterday afternoon and is reviewed in another page of this paper. The second was a performance by the theatrical group of the amateur actors of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. These two events were similar in purpose and differed only in that at the reception, the hall was packed with people, whereas only a handful attended the theater. This latter fact points to a glaring and woeful neglect of our plucky amateurs who are doing everything within their power to help the cause of patriotism and charity. Their performance last night was given for the benefit of Czech soldiers in France. This circumstance alone should have been reason enough for our people to fill the hall to capacity. We hope that this will be done at the next performance.</p>

   <p>"Roztomila Baruska V Zakopech Francie" [Lovely Barbara in the Trenches of France], a burlesque prepared for the Czech stage after the pattern of a French comedy by Xaver, was given by the amateur actors. The piece is full of wit and lovely tunes. Mrs. Slavka Krejci played the title role, that of a graduate of a finishing school for daughters of exclusive society people. She engaged in charitable war activity--cooking for soldiers in the trenches. She is wooed by officers and rookies alike, among them a volunteer of the Czechoslovak Army in France.</p>
