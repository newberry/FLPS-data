   <p>In Chicago there was held a march of protest in which tens of thousands of residents of the Lawndale district participated in last Wednesday afternoon. The demonstration was staged to call the attention of the great American public to the massacres of innocent Jewish women, old men and children in Poland and Roumania.</p>
   <p>The demonstration was practically called into existence overnight. It was an outburst of anger, at the blood orgies reported to be taking place in Poland and other eastern European lands. Not the least impressive feature of the parade of protest was the appearance of line after line of Jewish jackies and doughboys fresh from the fields of France who led the procession, followed by grey-bearded patriarchs, mothers and even little children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0512.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One word from America will stop the outrages of which Jews in Europe are today suffering. That word, we are confident will be spoken and thus the Jew in America will have another reason for loving this great land with ever greater intensity than he does at present.</p>
