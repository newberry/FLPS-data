   <p>The sad tidings of the death of I. L. Peretz in Warsaw will arouse deep sorrow in the hearts of thousands of his admirers. It will not be exaggerating to say that his death is a great loss that cannot be replaced very soon, as few poets can be found among the Jews. This is because they lack a broad national life. Peretz was a Jewish poet, writing about Jews, for Jews, and if necessary of the Jewish situation, pointing out only a few Jews from which he drew his divine influence. Morris Rosenfeld, for instance was a significant poet, a Lithuanian, who drew most of his impressions from the Lithuanian Jewish life, the same can be said of Ehuash. I. L. Peretz ranked highest in writing about Chassidism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0617.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From it he derived his inspiration, and Chassidism permeated his writings, on the basis of mysticism, which is very seldom heard from other poets.</p>
   <p>Peretz died at the age of 64. He wrote a great deal during his life time, in Hebrew and Jewish, and everything that he produced with his pen had a literary value. Many of his poems will be immortal, and will sooner or later be translated into other languages.</p>
   <p>He was very active as secretary of the Jewish community in Warsaw for many years.</p>
   <p>May his memory remain dear to the Jewish people whom he served so devoutly, and to whom he devoted the best efforts of his poetic soul.</p>
