   <p>A distinguished and brilliant assembly of Jewish women, numbering 300, was held by the Council of Jewish Women Monday afternoon in the Florentine Room at the Congress Hotel. The subjects brought up for discussion on were of broad scope.</p>
   <p>Of great significance was the presence of a distinguished official of the Zionist movement, a member of the Actions Committee, Dr. Shmerie Levin, who was the main speaker. This was perhaps the first time that women of Chicago aristocracy ever listened very attentively to words spoken in the name of a Jewish nation, of Jewish national hopes and perhaps the first time that they had heard an urge to stretch a helping hand to Palestine, not in the name of charity, which is their ideal, but in the name of Jewish national unity, as the Jewish people look upon Zion as their hope.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of equal, and even perhaps more importance, was the talk given by Mrs. Rosenwald as to the effect that Zionism had upon her.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rosenwald, who in the last few years, has been deeply interested in the Jewish question and in the Jewish national movement has done a great deal of thinking and studying concerning the struggle, lasting two thousand years, for an ideal; and she asked herself if it would not be proper to take a hand and help this Jewish movement.</p>
   <p>"I am not a Zionist," she cried from the platform, "but I feel that the Zionist movement has done a good deal in awakening in us Jewish race-consciousness. As long as we exist as a separate Jewish race, we must face that fact and give our energy in upbuilding the Jewish unity and Jewish culture."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0626.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Every word in her introduction is true except the first five words, "I am not a Zionist." Mrs. Rosenwald is mistaken. She speaks highly commendable true Zionism, and she thinks she is not Zionist? Besides, what's in a name? The main thing is the action, and she performs her work just like a Zionist. She is unconsciously being led to the Jewish national movement and its immortality. Let us hope that she will follow that path and find the ideal for which she seeks.</p>
