   <p>I suppose that you have already heard the news: the name of the new chief of the Zionists of the Middle West is Harry Lipsky. He is the greatest Zionist in Chicago. He is six feet and a few inches tall and he is now the first Zionist in the Middle West. Anyone who knows Harry Lipsky personally, knows that the Zionists made no mistake when they elected him as their leader. He is a highly educated man, a fine man, and a conscientious man. He is a man who has a clear understanding of men and events, and he understands what is happening in his community. He is a good speaker, full of charm and graciousness. The Zionists of Chicago and the Middle West will not have to apologize for making him their chief. Neither do they have to be afraid that he will not be industrious, that he will not work. I am his next-door neighbor and when I see that he is getting a little lazy, I will not be ashamed to prod <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0947.jpg" n="2"/>him a little. So you see, he will not have any choice in the matter--he will have to be industrious. However, I do not envy Mrs. Lipsky at all because during the next twelve months, she will seldom see her husband in the evening. As the leader of sixty-five Zionist cities in the Middle West, all of which clamor for attention, he will be kept busy.</p>
