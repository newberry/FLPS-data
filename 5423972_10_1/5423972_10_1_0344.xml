<title level="a">MENDEL BAILIS GREETED WITH STORMY OVATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A large crowd of men and women came to the Ashland Auditorium yesterday afternoon, to honor the Jewish martyr, Mendel Bailis. The honored guest, whom the audience greeted with a stormy ovation, thanked the audience in a brief and impressive speech, for the warm welcome and the honor accorded him. He expressed his wish that Chicago Jews, as well as the Jews of the whole world, should never again have to greet a Jewish martyr; that the Jewish nation should become established in its own country, and should never again hear of ritual murder or other such trials.</p>
   <p>In his opening address the chairman of the evening, Mr. B. Horwich, gave a summary of the Kiev trial, and stressed the heroism and bravery shown by Mendel Bailis during his imprisonment and trial. He pointed out that Mendel Bailis had endured many temptations, and that his conduct had saved the Jewish nation from the greatest calamity that could befall it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0345.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber spoke about the "ritual blood" trials in Jewish history and about the great sufferings that they have caused. Mendel Bailis was introduced to the audience by Mr. Z. B. Komaiko, one of the members of the arrangements committee of the Ashland Auditorium meeting.</p>
   <p>An extraordinarily fine musical program was also presented at the meeting. The well-known Jewish violinist, Victor Young, played various Jewish and classical compositions. His performance received an enthusiastic response from the audience. He was accompanied on the piano by his sister, Miss Young.</p>
   <p>Miss Florence Bernstein, the gifted singer, sang "Eli Eli" and "Jahrzeit" very beautifully. She was accompanied by Miss Stern. Cantor T. Greenberg of the Kehilath Jacob sang a folk song and "Etz Chaim" [Translator's note: Etz Chaim is a song from the Jewish Liturgy]. He was accompanied by Miss Stohl.</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: The next paragraph deals with Mr. Bailis' visit to Milwaukee. It is, therefore, omitted.]</p>
   <p>Tomorrow evening, at six o'clock a banquet will be given in honor of Mendel Bailis, at Gold's Peompeian Room, 812 West Roosevelt Road. All those who wish to be present may reserve plates by contacting the treasurer of the reception committee, Mr. A. Hackner, 129 South Market Street, or Mr. Z. B. Komaiko, Insurance Exchange Building, 175 West Jackson Boulevard.</p>
   <p>After the banquet, Mendel Bailis will be the guest of the Kiev Relief Verein at a meeting that has been arranged in his honor at the Liberty Hall, 3420 West Roosevelt Road, where his countrymen will extend him a hearty welcome.</p>
