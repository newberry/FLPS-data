   <p>In the meantime, the "Farm in Palestine Society," is doing some fine work. The plan, as is well known, consists of getting together a group of a thousand-members of which each one is to pay ten cents a week, in dues. The work of collecting the dimes should be done by forty voluntary members. Each of the forty collectors to be responsible for twenty-five dimes every week.</p>
   <p>In course of one year, about five thousand dollars would accumulate in the group's treasury. Then a drawing would be held, and the member drawing the lucky number, would receive out of the organization's treasury, a farm in Palestine, together with all necessary farm implements and traveling expenses for himself and his family. All the money that the society is to spend on him, should be repaid by the beneficiary, in the course of ten years, without interest.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0150.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Until the full amount ispaid back, the farm is to belong to the society. However, in case the lucky winner will be unable, or will not be ready to go to Palestine, he may choose any one he desires, to go there in his stead, but on the same conditions.</p>
   <p>The society made fine progress in such a short time. It has a large membership already, and they are very enthusiastic about the plan. They work untiringly to increase the membership to its full quota, so that they may be able to fulfill their plans. The Farm in Palestine Movement, can be instrumental in starting one of the strongest movements to colonize thousands of Jews in Palestine</p>
