   <p>Professor Albert Michelson, the world famous Jewish professor of physics, who last Thursday celebrated his seventy-seventh birthday, has resigned as the chief of the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Declaring that due to his illness, he is forbidden by the doctors to proceed with his duties in the university, he pleaded to be released from these duties by the end of the fiscal year in June 1930.</p>
   <p>His resignation came unexpectedly and no one was aware of this until the board of trustees anounced last night, that they have accepted his resignation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0843.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Together with Mrs. Michelson the famous scientist will go to Bermuda Islands before spring. The Professor is also planning to go to California to proceed with his light experiments.</p>
   <p>"And after I will have that completed," said the Professor, "I will take life a little easier, I may retire then." So declared the man who gave fifty-four years of his life to scientific work.</p>
   <p>Accepting his resignation, the board of trustees sent the Professor a letter thanking him for the great advantages gained by the University of Chicago, through which he is recognized as one of the world's greatest scientists.</p>
