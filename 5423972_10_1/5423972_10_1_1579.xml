   <p>Adolph J. Sabath, who is a prominent candidate for alderman in the ninth ward, is by birth a Bohemian, born in 1866. In 1879 he emigrated to this country landing at New York, where he accepted a position as watch-boy at a salary of $2.50 per week. He soon moved to Chicago, making it his future home. He soon earned enough money to study law at Forrest University; after leaving said institution and by arduous application, he soon attained the degree of bachelor of law in the Chicago College of Law. Graduating with high honor, he was soon able to open an office, in which he gave his time and attention, not only to jurisprudence, but to real estate affairs as well. It goes without saying that Mr. Sabath has been very successful in this latter branch. He has opened and disposed of many subdivisions of land contiguous to Chicago, for homes for his countrymen.</p>
