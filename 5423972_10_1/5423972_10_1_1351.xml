   <p>David Fish, Chief of a Well Known Firm Died of a Heart Attack.</p>
   <p>David Fish, chief of the L. Fish Furniture Co., died yesterday at the age of 73 years, in his residence 4834 Michigan Ave., by a sudden heart attack. Mr. Fish was born in Baden, Germany, and came to America as a boy of 13. In the year 1858 he established at Randolph street a small furniture and stove store, which later was moved to Fifth avenue, formerly Wells street. The great fire destroyed all, but he immediately established himself again and developed his business to one of the largest of its kind. The firm which has been managed for the last twelve years by five of his sons has four stores in Chicago. Besides the sons, he leaves a daughter. He was a member of several lodges and associations.</p>
   <p>The funeral takes place Sunday morning at 9:20 from the house of mourning to Mount Maariv cemetery, near Dunning.</p>
