   <p>Mr. Moses is ex-president of the Lakeside Club and for six years was a director of the Chicago Public Library. At present he is a member of the Executive Committee of the B'nai B'rith for this district, and also president of the Covenant Culture Club. He is editor since 1891 of the National Corporation Reporter, was vice-president of the Illinois State Bar Association; is a member of the Executive Committee of the Civic Federation, and a director of the Chicago Commercial Association.</p>

Notable among these lectures are those on the legal phase of the Dreyfus case and on "Haym Solomon, a Neglected Hero of the American Revolution".
