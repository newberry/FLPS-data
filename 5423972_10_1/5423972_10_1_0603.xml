   <p>P. Rothenberg (Ben Ami), the world famous Russian-Jewish revolutionary, arrived in Chicago, together with the talented author and speaker, Dr. Chaim Zhitlovsky, and at once started the movement for a Jewish Congress in America.</p>
   <p>Dr. Chaim Zhitlovsky is well known to the Jewish masses. P. Rothenberg, until a short time ago, was known only as a Russian revolutionary, who together with Father Gapon organized the historical march of the Russian masses to the Tsar's Palace, which was the beginning of a new epoch in Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0604.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lately Rothenberg has come into closer contact with his own people to give them the benefit of his organizing ability. He immediately won the confidence of the best Jewish elements, whose services he enlisted for the great movement to bring forth the Jewish demands for equal political and national rights in all the countries of the world, including a legal safe home in Palestine.</p>
   <p>To a representative of the Courier Mr. Rothenberg explained, that his main task is to encourage the Jewish people themselves to bring their demands to the peace conference, which will take place after the war; that no self-crowned intermediaries should speak in the name of the Jewish people, but its direct representatives, not to beg for favors, but to demand, what rightly belongs to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0605.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Throughout his active career Mr. Rothenberg has become convinced, that the Jewish masses favor the idea of issuing a call for a Jewish Congress in America, where Jewish questions should be discussed and ways found of solving them.</p>
   <p>Questioned as to why he is in accord with the Zionist demand for a home in Palestine, Mr. Rothenberg said, that the question of a home in Palestine does not exclusively belong to the Zionist Party, but to the entire Jewish people. The Congress movement being national in scope, must therefore also include the problem of a home.</p>
   <p>A legally assured home, Mr. Rothenberg pointed out, is necessary above all, for without a Jewish-owned home, our equality won't be worth any more than it is at present.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0606.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We will always be looked upon as a minority, as a people who are not equal to other nations. Only a Jewish home will give us absolute equality with all the other nations of the earth.</p>
   <p>"Will the masses truly be represented at the Jewish Congress? And is the fear of many labor leaders justified in that the workers will be unable to express their wishes?" the representative of the Courier asked him.</p>
   <p>"For this purpose," Mr. Rothenberg answered, "there are many who are working among the masses to see that the workers should be thoroughly acquainted with the Congress movement and take an interest in the election of true representatives of the workers."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0607.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Rothenberg also pointed out, that his main task is to awaken the working masses to work for political and national equality, as well as a Jewish home, for which purpose a National Socialist Congress Committee was organized, under whose sponsorship he came to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Asked about the present situation in Russia, Mr. Rothenberg declared that the defeat of the Russian armies, the direct result of the corruption of the Russian Government, will lead to a revolution, and the Jews in Russia can expect to gain more through that revolution, than through the victory of the German armies, for in the opinion of Mr. Rothenberg, the Germans are too strong culturally for the Russian Jews, and this would be a hindrance for the Jewish culture. Also economically the Jews will gain much in a free Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0608.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The question again arose concerning Palestine; whether there is a possibility for a large Jewish settlement, and here Mr. Rothenberg spoke mostly as a practical and successful engineer, who specializes in irrigation. Mr. Rothenberg is convinced, that Palestine has plenty of water and therefore there is a possibility for it to become a center of agriculture and industry.</p>
   <p>Palestine will be developed any way, whether Jews come there or not, but we have now an historical opportunity to secure for our people a home of their own, and we must therefore exert all our efforts in order not to miss this great historical opportunity.</p>
   <p>Rothenberg, chiefly, is a man of action and is more inclined to do than to write or speak. But at a time like this, when it is necessary to awaken the <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0609.jpg" n="7"/>masses, he is also active in oral and written work. Mr. Rothenberg, together with Dr. Zhitlovsky will appear next Sunday evening at the West Side Auditorium, where he will enlighten the Jewish masses of Chicago about the present tragic Jewish situation and indicate a remedy for the liberation of the Jewish people from their sufferings.</p>
