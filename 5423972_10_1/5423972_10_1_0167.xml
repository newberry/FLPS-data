   <p>(Zionism) Seen and Heard.</p>
   <p>Although there are many factional differences among Jews as to the ultimate solution of the Jewish problems, the ultimate salvation of the Jew: - where one party believes that salvation lies in freeing the Russian Muhzik (peasant) , another, by the redemption of Palestine, and still another by remaining in the United States, - we all agree that our immediate problems can be solved by the founding and sponsoring of such institutions as the "Bazalel" and "Palestine" Schools. Therefore we are pleased to hear that the women members of the Poale Zion Organization are arranging a Ball and Entertainment for Saturday evening, November 30, at the Metropolitan Hall, for the benefit of the Art Classes of this Bazalel School. Such benefits should be held more often and should be attended by all Jews irrespective of their own views on the ultimate solution to our Jewish problem.</p>
   <p>A school that teaches Jewish children, Jewish art, sculpture and carving, gives them an opportunity to develop their talents and through their art, attaining an appreciation of the Jewish spirit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0168.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chicago Jews will surely aid the Poale Zion women in efforts to help maintain the only Jewish Art School, "Bazalel."</p>
   <p>(Signed) Aleph.</p>
