   <p>Henry E. Greenebaum, communal leader and retired banker, died on May 18, at the age of 76.</p>
   <p>He was born in Chicago on September 1, 1854, and his early banking experience was gained with the First National Bank. In 1873 he joined his father's firm, then operating under the name of Greenebaum &amp; Foreman. In order to widen his banking experience he went to New York City, where he spent four years acquiring a thorough practical banking training. He then returned to Chicago and joined the Greenebaum Sons' Bank &amp; Trust Company, now a part of the Central Trust Company, and the Greenebaum Sons' Investment Company.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum was a member of the Sinai Congregation, and was also a member of the Standard, Lake Shore Country, and Press clubs.</p>
