   <p>When we consider the Jewish situation in Eastern Europe, which is more horrible than even a poet with a diabolical vision could imagine, we must marvel at the fact that the Jews of Eastern Europe are still alive today. Of all the dark periods in Jewish history, the present one is the darkest. Of all crises that have ever befallen us, the present one is the most difficult and the most dangerous. Of all the miseries and misfortunes that we have had to endure previously, the present ones are the bitterest and the worst, for they affect not merely hundreds of thousands of Jews, as was the case once upon a time in Spain and France, but millions. The majority of our people, the majority of our brave youth in Eastern Europe have been killed on the battlefields; tens of thousands have been crippled. More than a million Jews perished in pogroms, died from hunger and exposure. More than a million Jews in Russia were impoverished to the point of <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0402.jpg" n="2"/>having to beg [for sustenance]. Another million Jews were rendered incompetent for work, by hunger and want. Great numbers of our people were driven in desperation and hopelessness. Complete destruction has overtaken nine million Jews, and now, after the catastrophe, the Gehenna of our brethren in Eastern Europe is not yet over. They stand everywhere between two fires; they are either brutally persecuted, or entirely impoverished.</p>
   <p>The Jew in Poland has no status: no law, no justice exists for him there. In the Ukraine, Jewish blood flows like water. The black ground of the Ukraine is red with Jewish blood, and over its valleys spread enormous cemeteries filled with martyrs. In Hungary and Rumania the situation is no better. Entire Jewish groups, as those in the Caucasian countries, have been completely annihilated, and those who survived see no future for themselves in their native lands, and sooner or later they will have to emigrate.</p>
   <p>Never has history poured its fiery wrath upon us to such a horrible degree.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0403.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It has simply crushed us beneath its wheels--turned us into a heap of ashes--a heap of dry bones--and yet we live on, manifesting a strong will to live. This is a fascinating, as well as a curious phenomenon. How powerful the Jewish people must be to be able to withstand such miseries and catastrophes, and yet not perish!</p>
   <p>Strong as iron? No, strong as the Jewish people. The Jewish people are stronger than iron; the Jewish tree is mightier than the oak because no earthquake or tornado can bend or uproot it.</p>
   <p>This demonstrated will power of the Jewish people is now our only asset. The assets of other nations are their national boundaries, their highly developed industry, their big army and navy, or their large colonial empire. We possess none of these good things. Our only anchorage in life and our only basis for credit is our almost unbelievable will power which is stronger than iron. Iron rusts, but the will power of the Jewish people does not rust nor does it weaken. The greater the attempt to bend or break that <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0404.jpg" n="4"/>will power, the stronger it becomes.</p>
   <p>This recognition of our steel-like will to live, of our tremendous individuality, of our fabulous energy--even though we are drowning in a sea of tears and blood, even though a whole Jewish generation is being killed and another doomed to starvation--is our only consolation in this dark and critical moment in our history. This consolation will fill our hearts with new courage to carry on the struggle, and to work unceasingly and without malice toward our goal, toward a free national life in the land of our forefathers and of our future.</p>
