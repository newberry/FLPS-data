   <p>Isaac Danieli, the well known Jewish orator and representative of the Socialist Territorialists, arrived here yesterday afternoon to speak at a few mass meetings, which were arranged by his Chicago comrades.</p>
   <p>A reporter of the Daily Jewish Courier, had an interview with this outstanding gentleman, in which the major topic of discussion was "Jewish Youth," and a National Jewish Home." Mr. Danieli says he is a Jew of the whole world, and is acquainted with all Jewish factions who recently began to put before the world the question as to where they can secure a home for the Jews in which they can be assured of living in peace with the rest of the world.</p>
   <p>"Palestine," Mr. Danieli said, "is not the proper spot for a Jewish National Home." He is not in favor of Palestine, because of his socialistic ideas; he wants a home for the Jews in which they can govern themselves and battle for their own welfare and destiny.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0177.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He has a few other reasons for not favoring Palestine and one is that the Jewish women will be subjected to unfair competition with the Arab, Turk, and others whose ignorance precludes their ever learning how to fight for their rights against capitalism. What we socialists want is a Jewish National Home, which will insure internal and external enemies who in past centuries were at all times ready to invade and destroy us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Danieli, informs us that he will soon be in conference with Mr. Israel Zangwill and other prominent Jews who entertain similar ideas and he expects to secure their co-operation in the matter of establishing a Jewish National Home.</p>
   <p>Mr. Danieli, will speak tonight at the West Side Auditorium. This mass meeting is expected to be one of the biggest ever held for an occasion of this kind. According to the tremendous sale of tickets, it is certain to be a wonderful mass meeting. It is due to the activities of the Comrades of Mr. Danieli, that this mass meeting will be a stormy one. The dates of other mass meetings will be published in the Daily Jewish Courier in the near future.</p>
