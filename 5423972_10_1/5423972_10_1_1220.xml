  <body>
   <p>Death has taken from Chicago's Jewish community one of its oldest and first founders. Mr. Meyer Eudel Marinbaum died yesterday at his home at 1247 South Troy Street at the age of 84 years.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago in 1866. In those days Chicago had few Jews. He was among the first members of the Bes Hamedrosh Hagadol on Pacific Street, not La Salle Street. He was known in the city to all active organization workers and was himself very active in many affairs. Mr. Marinbaum was quite a Jewish scholar, an intellect, forever partaking in things relating to Jewishness. Due to his old age, we have recently not heard much of him, but he leaves with us memories of his activities and the many works he has accomplished.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1221.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The deceased leaves eight children. His oldest son, Abe Marinbaum, is private secretary to Mayor Harrison, and was also the secretary of several previous mayors. The other children are: Max, Irving, Sam, Mrs. Pearl Berkman, Mrs. Ray Bernstein, Mrs. Hattie Cohen and Miss Becky.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held today 1 o'clock, from his last place of residence to Oakwood. Many friends and acquaintances are expected to be present to pay their last respects to this active Chicagoan.</p>
