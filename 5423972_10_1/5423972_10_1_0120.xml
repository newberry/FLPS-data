   <p>The three day debate at the sixth annual convention of the Order Knights of Zion on the matter of uniting with the Federation of American Zionists was finally brought to a close yesterday in favor of unison.</p>
   <p>Every debate knew that union eventually will lead to better work for the Zionist cause, for which they have spent so much money, time, energy, and when the matter was taken to a vote, very few voted against the resolution.</p>
   <p>The Order Knights of Zion does not become extinct by this merger. It will now be called the Knights of Zion of the Federation of American Zionists. The organization will continue to carry on its Zionist activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0121.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Max Shulman, the Grand Master of the Order Knights of Zion, and Mr. Louis Lipsky, Chairman of the Executive Committee, can be given credit for the amalgamation. Their knowledge, sincerity, and devotion to their people and to the Zionist cause influenced everyone to discard personalities, and to bear in mind only that Zionism which stands above all trivial matters.</p>
   <p>There will come a time when the Zionist of America, east or west, south or north, will proudly come to this conclusion and then the labors of these two men, upon whose shoulders the practical work of Zionism in America has rested for quite a long time, will be better estimated.</p>
