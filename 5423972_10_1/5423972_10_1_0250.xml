  <body>
   <p>An elaborate dinner was given last night at the Standard Club in honor of Dr. Judah Leib Magness, rector of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Palestine.</p>
   <p>A large audience, consisting of the most prominent Jews of Chicago, was present at the banquet.</p>
   <p>Judge Henry Horner was toastmaster of the evening.</p>
   <p>He introduced the guest as one of the best and most idealistic Jews ever produced by the American Jewry.</p>
   <p>Judge Horner spoke of Dr. Magness' idealism and about his mission to the <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0251.jpg" n="2"/>United States to procure funds for the existence of the Hebrew University.</p>
   <p>Dr. Walter Dil Scott, president of the Northwestern University, greeted Dr. Magness in the name of the University.</p>
   <p>Dr. Scott spoke of the importance of a cultural institution such as the Hebrew University in Palestine. He said that he was quite familiar with the great accomplishments of this university, where the world-famous scientist, Dr. Albert Einstein, was active for some time.</p>
   <p>Dr. Magness received a colossal ovation. He delivered a very interesting talk and gave in detail the various courses taught at the Palestinian University. He also mentioned the fact that this institution of learning was popular for a time among the leading universities of the world.</p>
   <p>A group of friends organized at the banquet to help procure aid for the Palestinian University.</p>
