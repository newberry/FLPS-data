   <p>Our Chicago Jewish Congressman, A. J. Sabath, has saved two immigrants, mother and daughter, from deportation.</p>
   <p>Sarah Znacher and her daughter, Chipa, left their home in Russia to find a new home in the free land, America.</p>
   <p>The mother, suffering from weak eyes, knowing all about the health examinations at Ellis Island, decided to come to America by way of Danada. She landed in Halifax in April and found that the United States has a health inspection bureau there also. The health inspectors found Mrs. Znacher suffering with trachoma and ordered her returned to Russia. The daughter could not live in this country without her mother, hence they both were ordered deported.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0073.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These two unfortunate immigrants turned to Congressman Sabath for help. Mr. Sabath immediately interceded for them, and appealed to the Secretary of Labor in Washington, from whom he received permission to allow the two to come to the United States. The mother was placed in a hospital for treatment of her eyes, and the child was sent to school to study the English language and Americanism.</p>
   <p>The final decision from the Secretary of Labor came yesterday, allowing these two immigrants to make their new home in this country permanently.</p>
