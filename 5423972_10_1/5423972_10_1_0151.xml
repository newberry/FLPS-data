   <p>Dear Editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>Please give me some space in your paper for the benefit of Zionism. I read in the Courier that a society has been organized in Chicago by the name of "Nichlah Bezion." (A Farm in Palestine Society.) I am highly satisfied with such a movement and I hope that this society will continue to exist, and will be able to send a family to Palestine each year.</p>
   <p>But what good, if any at all, can this society do, by only transporting one family to Palestine every year? There should be founded societies such as existed twelve - fourteen years ago. Each member should pay one dollar a week, and in the course of six or eight years, whole colonies could be established.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0152.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are people who will ask now why such societies, formulating such a plan, were unable to exist in the past. The reply is simple. The time was not favorable. But now is the time for many organizations of that type to come into being, and the chances are that they will be highly successful.</p>
   <p>All Chicago Jewish institutions may thank the Courier for its plans. It united them. Now is the time to act.</p>
   <p>With greetings of Zion,</p>
   <p>Mordecae Yehuda Savitzky.</p>
