   <p>A Statement from the Manager of the Peoples Relief.</p>
   <p>As manager of the Peoples Relief Committee, I make the following statement concerning the condition of dishonesty, affirmed by our enemies, and the editor of the Jewish Courier, who carried on a campaign before and after the bazaar. The editor in his campaign, insinuated that there was dishonesty in the management of the bazaar, immediately, the morning after it closed.</p>
   <p>It is customary, that the executive of the Peoples Relief Committee should control every undertaking of the committee, not before it has taken place, but naturally after it has closed. Our auditor examined the accounts immediately after the bazaar. The report, however is not complete, due to the investigation of the accounts of the last fiscal year. As soon as he completes the accounts, in a few days, a full report will be given to the thousands of Jews who so faithfully engaged in this "sacrilegious" relief work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1045.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jewish public will also read what the committee has to say about the various reactionary elements who have so arduously worked to undermine the great undertaking of the Peoples Relief.</p>
   <p>In spite of all interferences which have caused much financial damage, the Jewish masses responded as true children to the Peoples Relief and made the bazaar a great success, which was only expected under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>Assured that our great successors will withdraw all unfair attacks upon the Peoples Relief, I remain</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours</p>
   <p>R. Eukelson, manager.</p>
