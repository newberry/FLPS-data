   <p>Rabbi A. R. Levy was born in Germany in 1858, and was educated there. In 1879 he came to America, and became the Rabbi of Kinesseth Israel Temple at Erie, Pa. In 1888 he was called to the pulpit of B'nai Abraham Congregation of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Levy has written a series of articles on "The Development of Written Language," which were published in the American Israelite. The career of Dr. Levy in Chicago is well-known. He is a true friend of the poor, diligently studying their wants and always in readiness to help. He is an enthusiast on the question of Jewish farming. During the influx of Russian-Jewish immigrants, he served for a time as superintendent of the Russian Refugee Society. He succeeded in placing a number of immigrants on farms and has continued to take an active interest in their welfare. Through his efforts the Jewish Agriculturists Aid Society was established in Chicago of which he is the corresponding secretary.</p>
