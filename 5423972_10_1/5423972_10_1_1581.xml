   <p>Abraham Gottlieb, one of Chicago's best known men, died suddenly on Feb. 9th. Mr. Gottlieb ranked high in the engineering profession. He was born near Pilsen, Bohemia 56 years ago. He began the practice of his profession as a civil engineer on the Imperial railway of Austria and came to Chicago in 1865. He established himself as a consulting and contracting engineer and built most of the bridges on the Wisconsin Central Railroad. He was the contracting and architectural engineer of the Masonic Temple, the Rand McNally Bldg. and the new Chicago Stock Exchange Bldg. During the first part of the constructive period of the Fair, he was chief engineer of the Exposition, and he was closely connected with the preliminary work of the sanitary district.</p>
   <p>He was a past president of Zion Congregation and was always prominent in Jewish social and religious life and in charitable work.</p>
