   <p>Mrs. Henry Solomon will be nominated for the presidency of the Chicago Woman's Club. Mrs. Solomon's first experience in club work was in 1877 when she was invited to become a member of the Chicago Woman's Club. A few years later, she left the organization, re-entering in 1889. She then joined the philosophy and science department, which she represented on the board of directors during the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Solomon also served on the general committee for the parliament of religions and was the organizer and chairman of the Jewish Women's Congress. She presented the idea of forming a National Jewish Women's Organization, which was adopted at the congress.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Solomon assisted in organizing the Illinois State Federation and was the first vice-president in the first district. During the last two years, she has been chairman of the institutions committee of the reform department.</p>
