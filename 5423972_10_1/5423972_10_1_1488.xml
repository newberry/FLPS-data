He was a member of the Board of Directors of the United Hebrew Charities for a number of years, and President from October, 1870 to January, 1872. In December of 1871 he was elected South Town Supervisor on the Fire ticket (non-partisan) and for two years he served creditably without compensation. From 1875 to 1882 he was on the Board of Directors of the Chicago Public Library. From September 1, 1890 to February 21, 1898 he was President of the International Bank.
