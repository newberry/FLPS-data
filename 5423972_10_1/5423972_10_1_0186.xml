<title level="a">WOULD SCAN ALL EMIGRANTS JEWISH DELEGATES URGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS ON DEPARTURE</title></bibl>

   <p>Laws requiring physical examination of emigrants at the points of embarkation were advocated as a measure of humanity, in resolution adopted yesterday at a Chicago meeting of delegates from the various Jewish societies of the United States. The meeting, which had been called by Adolph Straus, President of the "Independent Order of B'nai B'rith," was held at the Standard Club and the representatives from twelve leading national organizations were present.</p>
   <p>The resolution concerning emigration was called forth in the interests of the added numbers of Jewish emigrants now arriving in America. The argument was that physical examination to determine their fitness for emigration would prevent the hardships of separation, and lessen the chances of deportation. The massacres in Russia were deplored. Among the societies represented, with some of their delegates, were: "Union of American Hebrews," Simon Wolf of Washington, Judge Philip Stein of Chicago, "Central Conference of American Rabbis"; Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Dr. Joseph Stolz, Dr. Tobias Schoenfarber, Chicago; "Order B'nai Abraham," Samuel Dorf, Washington; "National Conference of Jewish Charities"; Judge Julian Mack of Chicago.</p>

   <p>Dr. Joseph Stolz, in his sermon given in Isaiah Temple yesterday morning, spoke a word of welcome from this country to the Jews under persecution in Russia. He declared the Jews here were ready to extend every aid to their co-religionists and prepare them for citizenship. He also declared, that the outlook in Russia for the Jews was extremely dark.</p>
