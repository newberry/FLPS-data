   <p>AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWS IN AMERICA. By Leonard G. Robinson, General Manager, the Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society, New York City.</p>
   <p>In this article, the author endeavors to relate the historical background and activities of the Jews in agriculture on the American continent. In sketching the beginning of the Jewish agricultural movement in the United States, he tells of the influx of Jewish immigration to this country which was set in motion by the reign of lawlessness, persecution, and pogroms that swept over Eastern Europe in the early eighties of the last century. Many of those newly immigrated Jews desired to become agriculturists on their own land, and their number grew to such proportions, that a few societies had to be organized to aid these agriculturists in settling on farms in the various states. One of these societies was - The Jewish Agriculturists" Aid Society of America. (pp.74-76.)</p>
   <p>This society was established in Chicago on October 28, 1888, and was incorporated in 1900. It was founded through the efforts of Rabbi A. R. Levy, who interested a number of prominent Jews in Chicago to organize such a <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0111.jpg" n="2"/>society. A committee was formed with the object of helping the poor to locate upon farms, and to encourage agriculture among Jews in the United States. The committee consisted of Adolph Loeb, president; Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, vice-president; Herman Felsenthal, treasurer; and Rabbi A. R. Levy, secretary. The committee had no permanent funds at its disposal. It depended entirely upon its friends to furnish the money in each specific case when needed. In this manner some seventy families were assisted in settling upon farms in the Middle Western states and in North Dakota, and the amount thus loaned aggregated over $35,000.</p>
   <p>The work of looking to individuals to make the loan in each instance was a rather slow and difficult process. The number of applicants for assistance also kept increasing. It was, therefore, decided to have a permanent loan fund, and in 1900, the Jewish Agriculturists' Aid Society of America was incorporated. To create the loan fund "Certificates of Credit," something like debenture bonds, were offered for subscription to the friends of the cause. These certificates are issued in denominations of $10.00 and upwards, and are redeemable after ten years. They bear interest at the rate of three percent. The "Loan Fund" can be used only for the granting of loans <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0112.jpg" n="3"/>to Jewish farmers. The expenses of carrying on the work of the society is defrayed from its General Fund, consisting of voluntary contributions, or donations, and membership dues. The annual membership payment is $10.00</p>
   <p>The membership of the society in 1901 numbered 67, and the outstanding certificates amounted to $4,700. During the same year, 23 loans were made, amounting to $9,500. Of these, 13 amounting to $3,770 were made by individuals; 7 amounting to $2,930 by the society from its loan fund; and 3 amounting to $2,800 by the Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society of New York. From the very outset this society received the hearty cooperation of the New York society, which took over, between the years 1900 and 1909, a total of 63 loans, aggregating $30,703.15, so as to provide it with ready funds for carrying on its work. The New York society also placed various amounts at its disposal for the granting of loans as the agent of that society.</p>
   <p>According to the last published report (1908) of the Jewish Agriculturists' Aid Society of America, it had a membership that year of 413, and the credit certificates in circulation amounted to $47,215. Since 1888 it has assisted <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0113.jpg" n="4"/>financially or otherwise over four hundred Jewish families to settle on farms, most of them on free Government homesteads in North Dakota. Recently, however, the society has been laboring under the disadvantages of the lack of funds, and has, as a result, not been very active.</p>
