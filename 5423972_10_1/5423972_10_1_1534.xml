   <p>The death of Gerhard Foreman on August 6th, was a severe blow, especially to the Jewish community, in which he held a high and honorable position. Born in Germany in 1823, he came to America in 1853 and settled in Illinois. He married Hannah Greenebaum, daughter of Jacob Greenebaum, one of the earliest settlers in the city.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the wedding, Gerhard and his wife's brother, Elias Greenebaum, opened a bank and brokerage business. Selecting 48 Clark St. as their place of business, the firm prospered and promised to become the big financial institution of the city when the fire of 1871 swept their place of business away. Books, valuable papers, and money were saved and Greenebaum and Foreman were the first to open after the fire and the firm helped considerably to alleviate the sufferings of the victims.</p>
   <p>Until 1884 the firm continued business and then E. Greenebaum retired and the partnership was dissolved. The institution was then continued under the name <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1535.jpg" n="2"/>of Gerhard Foreman and Sons, Edward G., Oscar G., and Henry G. Foreman being admitted as partners. Three years ago the father retired from control of the bank and the new name of Foreman Bros. was given the institution.</p>
   <p>Among bankers and brokers, Mr. Foreman in remembered as a man of sterling integrity and scrupulous honesty. Nine great charities have received aid from him in a munificent way. He was one of the founders of Sinai Congregation and an ex-president.</p>
