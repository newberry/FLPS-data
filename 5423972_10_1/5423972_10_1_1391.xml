   <p>Max Rabinoff was born in Russia in 1877 and came to Chicago in 1892. He attended the University of Illinois, where he took courses in chemistry and pharmacy. His love of music, however, changed the course of his entire career. He finally decided to establish himself with the W. W. Kimball Co., who have the reputation of being the largest piano and organ house in the world.</p>
   <p>His knowledge of the business and his familiarity with both foreign and domestic pianos were decided advantages which led to his appointment as manager of the foreign department of this large establishment. He has succeeded in building up for his firm an extensive export business which is constantly growing.</p>
   <p>Aside from his duties, Mr. Rabinoff is interested in young musical prodigies and through careful investigation, he has discovered several young musicians in the Ghetto, whose promise of a future is great. Mr. Rabinoff takes a special delight in helping these young geniuses toward the recognition which their talent deserves.</p>
