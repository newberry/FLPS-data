<title level="a">ZIONIST WORKERS ARE HERE ONE HUNDRED JEWS FROM TEN STATES BEGIN A THREE DAYS' CONVENTION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Knights of Zion began their 11th annual convention last night at the Hebrew Literary Institute, 47 Johnson Street. Nearly 100 delegates were present, representing ten of the middle western states.</p>
   <p>Grand Master Barnard Horwich presided, and Leon Zolotkoff, assistant states attorney delivered an address of welcome.</p>
   <p>The Order Knights of Zion is a western sub-federation of Zionist organizations of American Zionists. Its object is to create a legally assured and publicly recognized home for the Jewish race in Palestine.</p>
   <p>"The arms of Zionism," said Mr. Zolotkoff, "are to renationalize the people on their ancestral soil and to provide a home for those Hebrews who for some reason or other do not assimilate and are not absorbed by the nations in whose midst they live.</p>
   <p>"The Zionist movement of the world has headquarters in Germany. They have establish <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0164.jpg" n="2"/>more than thirty agricultural and vinocultural colonies in Palestine, and sell their products all over the world."</p>
   <p>The convention will continue to-day and to-morrow ending Monday night with an informal social at the Lessing Clubhouse, 447 W. Taylor Street.</p>
