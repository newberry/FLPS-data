   <p>Mr. Sigmund Zeisler, the widely known Chicago lawyer, was born in Austrian Silesia. He was educated in his native country, and after the completion of his studies, he went to Vienna where he received his degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence. Soon thereafter, in 1883, he emigrated to this country, where he graduated from the Union College of Law with highest honors. As an outstanding figure in his profession, his services were requested by the defense for the so-called anarchists. He functioned as first assistant to the City Corporation Council throughout 1893-94, during which time he engaged in the highly successful legal combat against various railroad companies which planned to use the city streets for siding purposes. Mr. Zeisler has thus aided he movement for the elevation of railroad crossings to the fullest extent.... He was a zealous member of the Democratic Party organization, taking an active part in any movement for the betterment and reforms of public affairs. As a public speaker, Mr. Zeisler enjoys a reputation equally as excellent as that of an attorney. He married Miss Fannie Bloomfield, the celebrated pianist.</p>
