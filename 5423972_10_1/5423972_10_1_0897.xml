   <p>To many dwellers on the steppes of Russia, in the Ghettos of Poland and backward rural communities of the American South as well as to excavators in the treasure-laden crypts of Egypt and social welfare workers in congested American cities, Chicago is more than a "crime center." These people think of Chicago as the home of a Jewish merchant whose generosity is giving a new start to land-hungry Russians; bread to pogrom-ridden, poverty-stricken Jews; education to hitherto neglected Negro country-folk; recreation for lonely White and Colored youths seeking their fortunes in the great cities; and fuel for the lamps of scholars exploring ancient civilization.</p>
   <p>Julius Rosenwald, who symbolizes Chicago to a wide variety of people in a diversity of places and who is helping to bring some of the learning of the world to his fellow Chicagoans, was 65 years old, Friday, August 12. Although he has been giving away millions of dollars over a period of two decades, Mr. Rosenwald remains one of the wealthiest and one of the most generous givers of his time.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0898.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What does such a man think as he looks back over his life and contemplates the future from the vantage point of sixty-five busy and eventful years? Mr. Rosenwald is too busy to reveal his innermost thoughts in this regard to a newspaper interviewer, but his friends would reply for him: "How he may best serve his fellow men in the years that remain to him."</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald has not been known to echo the famous Carnegie sentiment about the "crime of dying rich," but he appears to be ordering his life in that spirit. The man who forty-two years ago inaugurated his Chicago career with a little clothing factory in a third-story loft of the old Farwell block, wishes his wealth to be a boon to mankind, not a millstone about the necks of his five children. Wealth to Mr. Rosenwald is not a surcease from toil for the possessor and his family, but a sacred public trust, which must be performed conscientiously if one is to merit the respect of one's fellows.</p>
   <p>So today, at an age when many rich men retire to their estates for the pleasures they were unable to indulge during their active careers, Mr. Rosenwald takes an early train from his beautiful Ravinia home, to labor until late in the day in his West Side office. During the critical days of the post-war deflation, when only Mr. Rosenwald's unprecedented act in pledging his <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0899.jpg" n="3"/>personal fortune saved the business from disaster, the mail-order magnate personally supervised every phase of Sears-Roebuck activity. The business is now thriving under younger hands, and Mr. Rosenwald devotes his time and thoughts as well as his money to the manifold social and civic welfare programs and educational interests with which he is identified.</p>
   <p>If Julius Rosenwald gives money to a school, a scientific inquiry, the printing of a meritorious manuscript which might otherwise go unpublished, or a civic enterprise, such as the industrial museum, it may be assumed that he has previously made a personal study of the project and convinced himself of its merit and promise. Once interested in a cause, Mr. Rosenwald may be expected to stay by it year in and year out, regardless of the fact that the trumpets have ceased to blare and the project has taken on something of the aspect of routine.</p>
   <p>Social advance is the keynote of Julius Rosenwald's activity. He wants the movements, such as Negro education, in which he has made an investment of more than $3,000,000, to be taken over by the local communities as they attain a better economic status. He has little interest in philanthropies which fail <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0900.jpg" n="4"/>to attack the root causes of human need or tend to perpetuate those causes. The elevation of life rather than the making tolerable of life, is his goal.</p>
   <p>Finding such uses for his wealth is probably a more difficult task than was the accumulation of that wealth. Indeed, Mr. Rosenwald has no patience with those who try to infer that he must have shown great genius and skill in accumulating his wealth. "I was lucky - not a genius, and I think that is true of most rich men," Mr. Rosenwald declares. "With rare exception, the man who accumulates great wealth displays no more genius than did the capital prize winner in the Louisiana lottery. By luck he got hold of a good thing at the right time and by more luck he held on to it."</p>
   <p>After forty-two years' residence here his faith in and enthusiasm for Chicago are unabated. Just now he is interested in seeing the city provide better housing for its lower paid wage earners, so that this metropolis of the West will be spared the old-world slums.</p>
   <p>Gratified at the improved relations between the White and Colored residents of Chicago since the Chicago race riots, Mr. Rosenwald hopes that the spirit of tolerance and mutual helpfulness may be continued.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0901.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Long a supporter of the Y. M. C. A. and the Jewish People's Institute, Mr. Rosenwald hopes to see the facilities of such institutions extended so that inexpensive clubs or recreation centers will be available to young men of all races in all parts of the city. The industrial museum, which he is helping to finance to the extent of $3,000,000, is another venture which Mr. Rosenwald believes will add to the richness of life in Chicago. The University of Chicago, to which Mr. Rosenwald has given about $2,000,000 and which he serves as a trustee, is also expected to make greater contributions to human well-being.</p>
   <p>To discover the inspiration for this philanthropy one must know something of the personal ideals of Mr. Rosenwald. He is a simple, kindly man, who has not forgotten the days of adversity which he himself experienced as a young man. More than that, there burns in him those cardinal principles of justice and service to fellow-men which were enunciated 2,500 years ago by Hebrew prophets.</p>
   <p>Augusta Hammerslough Rosenwald, mother of Julius, held those ethical teachings very dear, and she inculcated them in her son in the mature years of prosperity as well as in the humbler days of his youth. The profound influence exerted by this mother in Israel upon her kin is witnessed by the devotion with which they celebrate her birthday every year, though she passed away some years ago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0902.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>On the twentieth of July, the anniversary of her birth, her children, grandchildren, great-grand children, nephews, and nieces - some fifty in number, gather at the Rosenwald home in Ravinia, to honor her memory. It is to this old type of matriarch that much of Rosenwald's humanitarian service is due.</p>
