   <p>Official announcement has been made in Washington that Samuel Alschuler of Chicago is to be the new Judge of the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Judge Alschuler's selection leaves vacant the chairmanship of the Illinois Waterways Commission to which he was named by Gevernor Deneen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alschuler was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Illinois in 1900 and has twice been the nominee for U. S. Senator. He was born in Chicago in 1859. In the Illinois legislature he was the recognized leader of the lower house during his service there, and has a personal, legal and political standing throughout the state.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alschuler has been active in Jewish circles. He is a member of the B'nai B'rith and for two terms was president of the Oriental Hillel Lodge. He also served in connection with the arbitration trial following the strike of Chicago City Railway employees.</p>
