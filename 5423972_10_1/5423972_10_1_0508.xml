  <body>
   <p>The national executive committee of the Zionist organization decided that the twenty-second annual convention be held this year in Chicago sometime in September. The exact date will be announced later. The election of delegates will take place June 29 throughout the entire country. During the months of July and August, conferences will occur in New York, Boston, Cleveland, Louisville, New Orleans, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and in a few other cities.</p>
   <p>Elected delegates will discuss Zionist problems thoroughly, for the convention must decide the exact details regarding construction work in Palestine, to be taken up at the General Zionist Congress soon to <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0509.jpg" n="2"/>be held. The large Jewish masses in America will have the opportunity to participate in this important convention.</p>
   <p>Plans are being formulated so that towns of less than fifty families also have the opportunity, in unity with their near neighbors, to elect a delegate. Voters are asked not only to elect delegates but also to participate in a referendum concerning the most important problems of Palestine.</p>
   <p>It was decided that all those who join the Zionist organization up to the 29th of June be permitted to participate in elections for the convention.</p>
