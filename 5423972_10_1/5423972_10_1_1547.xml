   <p>Col. Martin Emerich was born in Baltimore, Md., in 1847. He received a thorough English and German education at the best schools in Maryland, and shortly after completing his education, entered into active commercial life. Before attaining his majority, he was admitted to the firm of his father and brothers, who were doing a general merchandising business in Baltimore and Washington. Recognizing the boundless opportunities afforded by the ever-growing West, Col. Emerich, in 1882 started a business in St. Louis, known as the Strauss-Emerich Outfitting Co., at present, the leading concern of its kind in that city. In 1884, Col. Emerich came to Chicago and started the well known outfitting establishment on State St. bearing his name.</p>
   <p>It was not until 1892, that Col. Emerich entered politics. In that year, there was a special committee of twenty-five, appointed at a business men's mass meeting for the purpose of suggesting suitable candidates for the Democratic County Convention. Among the names proposed for the office of County Commissioner was Col. Emerich's, and he was nominated and elected by a large majority, leading the entire <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1548.jpg" n="2"/>county ticket. He served as chairman of the committee on finance, chairman of the committee on judiciary. and was a member of various other important committees. It was largely due to the efforts of Col. Emerich that the County Commission of that year made its enviable record of economy and care in respect to the public finance.</p>
   <p>Col. Emerich is an enthusiastic Chicagoan and possesses large business interests here, being interested in a well-known State St. concern.</p>
   <p>He has always been prominently identified with societies, clubs and charities, both religious and non-religious. In 1875, he was president of the District Grand Lodge No. 5, I. O. B. B. In 1878, he was president of the District Grand Lodge No. 3, Order Kesher, Shel Barsel. In 1879, he was Grand Master of the Imperial Order, Free Sons of Israel of the United States. He was also Past Master of the A. O. U. W.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1549.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He was one of the founders of the Orphans' Asylum of District Grand Lodge No. 5 at Atlanta, Ga. He is a member of the Orphan Asylum of Baltimore, also of the Cleveland Orphan Asylum, and a director of the Chicago Orphan's Home for Jewish children. He was also president of the Phoenix Club.</p>
