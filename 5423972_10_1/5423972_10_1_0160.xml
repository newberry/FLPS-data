   <p>It is already after the election. Prosperity is being ushered in gradually - step by step. Thousands and tens of thousands of workers, who have been unemployed until now, have again begun to work. The people are becoming cheerful.</p>
   <p>The Jews, who have not as yet brought their families to the United States, for fear they would not be able to provide for them, have no possible cause for fear - they may be positive of making a living. Now is the time for your families to emigrate, especially for youth, who need not fear unemployment.</p>
   <p>Do not delay, come to the only reliable steamship office, Setzer and Rosenberg, 687 W. Taylor street, and consult them as to the best procedure of bringing your relatives and friends from foreign countries.</p>
