   <p>Benjamin Vogel Becker is a member of one of Chicago's most distinguished law firms, Levinson, Becker, Glenn &amp; Schwartz.</p>
   <p>Mr. Becker was born at Warsaw, Indiana, June 20, 1871, son of Leopold and Caroline (Vogel) Becker. He attended school in Indiana, at Warsaw and at Fort Wayne. He has been a resident of Chicago since 1887. He studied law under Jacob Newman, was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1892, and was admitted to practice in the United States Supreme Court in 1900. He is a lawyer of brilliant attainments and marked abilities and has worked alone or in association with a number of leaders in the Chicago Bar. In 1898 he became a partner in the firm of Newman, Northrup, Levinson &amp; Becker, which later became Newman, Levinson, Becker &amp; Cleveland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0732.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On January 1, 1914, the partnership of Levinson, Becker, Schwartz &amp; Frank was formed. Since January 1, 1930, the title of the firm has been Levinson, Becker, Glenn &amp; Schwartz. His senior partner is S. (Solmon) O. Levinson, distinguished not only as a lawyer but as author of the Levinson plan for the outlawing of war and the settlement of international debts and other international relations. Another partner is Otis F. Glenn, United States senator from Illinois. Among other direct tributes to Mr. Becker's standing as an attorney is the following written by Stephen S. Gregory, and coming from such a distinguished source it means much to all members of the Illinois Bar: "Mr. Levinson and Mr. Becker," wrote Mr. Gregory, "are singularly well adapted for professional cooperation. Mr. Becker is a close student of human nature, <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0733.jpg" n="3"/>most sympathetic and considerate of others, and has the rare faculty of getting the best out of other people, a quality of great service to both. He has a mind of great fairness and penetration. He seems to be able to see things as they are, without errors of refraction due to professional bias or blindness, occasioned by looking at each side or aspect of a complicated matter."</p>
   <p>Mr. Becker has been active as counsel in many organizations. He is a director of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, of the Union Switch &amp; Signal Company, of the Chicago Daily News, of the Fansteel Products <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0734.jpg" n="4"/>Company, of the Panlepic Consolidated of Venezuela, Incorporated, and of other corporations. He is a member of the Chicago, Illinois State and American Bar Associations, the Chicago Historical Society,, the Chicago Art Institute, and the Field Museum. He is a Republican. Some of his clubs are the City, Standard, Chicago Riding, Lake Shore Country, the Congressional Country Club of Washington, and the Bankers Club of New York.</p>
