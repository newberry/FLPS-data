   <p>Herman Felsenthal died Sunday morning at his summer home, 1320 Lyons St., Evanston. The deceased was born at Offenbach, Germany, in 1834. His early training was gained in the schools and colleges of Germany. In 1851 he came to Chicago and established a private banking house. He was at the head of the private banking firms of Felsenthal and Kozminski and Felsenthal, Gross, and Miller. During his career as a private banker, he passed through the financial panic of '73. Six years ago, while at the head of the Bank of Commerce, he brought that institution safely through a "run" which lasted several days. He was elected president of the Bank of Commerce when it was organized in 1891, and remained with that institution until it passed into other hands last November. Since that time he had been engaged in the real estate and brokerage business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felsenthal was a Chicago pioneer of the early '50s. He joined with the late Lorenzo Brentano, while a member of the first board of education of Chicago, in introducing the study of German into the public schools.</p>

   <p>In German and Jewish circles, Mr. Felsenthas was prominent in charitable work. The United Hebrew Relief Association was fostered by him in its infancy, and for years he was a member of the governing board of the Michael Reese Hospital. He was one of the first members and for years secretary of Sinai Temple. He was a Past Grand Master of D. G. L. No. 6, Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, and was treasurer of the order at the time of his death. He was one of the organizers of the Covenant Culture Club and for twenty-three years had been chairman of the Board of Trustees of Ramah Lodge. He was also an active member of the Landmark Lodge, A. F. and A. M.</p>
