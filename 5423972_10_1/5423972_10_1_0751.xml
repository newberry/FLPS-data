   <p>Judge Henry Horner, is the Democratic nominee for Governor of Illinois. He was born on the South Side of Chicago, of pioneer Illinois stock. His grandfather, Henry Horner, settled in Chicago nearly a century ago.</p>
   <p>When Judge Horner was a boy of 4, his parents became estranged and separated legally, his mother retaining the custody of the child and resuming her maiden name of Horner, under which name the boy was brought up. He attended the public schools of Chicago and later studied at Kent College of Law. He took his degree and began the practice of law in 1899.</p>
   <p>Henry Horner, for the past 18 years, has been the presiding judge of the Probate Court of Cook County, and is 53 years of age.</p>
   <p>Judge Horner has served for a number of years as neutral arbitrator for the Ladies Garment Trades in Chicago, and was also trustee of that Union's unemployment fund.</p>

   <p>In 1929, Judge Horner as a member of the Illinois Society of Mental Hygiene, led the movement for better housing and care of the insane that resulted in a $6,000,000 appropriation by the Legislature for that purpose.</p>
   <p>He served by appointment of Governor Emmerson on the Lincoln Memorial Highway Commission and also on the state commission named to perpetuate Lincoln memorials throughout Illinois. He is also a member of the Illinois George Washington Bi-Centennial Commission. He is a director of the Geographical Society of Chicago, a member of the Chicago Boy Scout Council.
