   <p>On last Sunday afternoon a meeting of our Jewish citizens was held at Greenebaum's Hall, for the ostensible purpose of aiding a colony of Israelites established in Palestine. Mr. Michall Peabody presided. The accredited agent of the Colony, Rev. Simon Stampfer, was present and spoke of the objects and aims of the colony.</p>
   <p>Six couples had already established themselves between Jappa and Jerusalem on 80,000 acres of land secured from the Turkish Government. It is proposed to enable the persecuted Jews of Western Europe to settle there. The object of the present subscription (is) to secure the necessary tools and machinery for them to become tillers of the soil and provide for their own wants. The colony is not rich and societies have been formed in Eastern cities to render assistance......Speeches were made by Mr. Peabody, Dr. B. Filsenthal, Dr. J. Grossman, Mr. Lipmansoh, Mr. Henry Greenebaum and Rev., Dr. Stampfer. It was announced that $200 had been already subscribed.</p>
