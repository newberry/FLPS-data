   <p>The Jews of the entire world suffer more than any other people from the present war in Europe. Even in time of peace the Jews are forced to carry on a bitter struggle for their existence. Conspiracies and oppression are daily features of their lives. They have neither the freedom nor the opportunity of earning a livelihood. They are constantly being tyrannized. Under ordinary circumstances Jews are not permitted to reside near boundary lines or possess their own property, and now 300,000 Jewish soldiers are protecting the Russian border and fighting to defend Russia. The thousands of Jewish physicians, who have sacrificed their practice in order to serve in the Russian army, will be, as soon as the war ends, <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0642.jpg" n="2"/>barred from certain cities. They will be forced to return to their homes, where they lost everything, where their loved ones no longer exist, and their wealth has been destroyed. The thousands of brave, Jewish soldiers who have risked their lives for the honor of their country as heroes on the battle field will, if they remain alive, be driven from those districts that they have helped defend and protect. No nation was called to wage war against their own brethren, but the Russian Jew is driven to shoot his own brother who lives in Germany; the Jew of England and France is forced to fire at his Austrian friend or relative. Just imagine the irony of fate and the tradedy of this.</p>
   <p>All nations preach peace and practice war. If we want to preserve peace, why practice war? Benjamin Franklin said that "there never was a good war nor a bad peace." The mission of the Jews is solely to live in <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0643.jpg" n="3"/>peace, and our prophet understood the problem and nature of war when he prophesied that propitious time "when the swords will be beaten into ploughshares and sickles, and no nation will raise its sword against another nation." As long as governments select the youth to do disruptive work instead of creative, as long as youth and energy is consumed in improving war instruments instead of developing culture, we will never have peace.</p>
   <p>All important Jewish enterprises are international and the war has now practically disorganized all of our activities in Europe. It will, perhaps, be necessary for the Jews of America and particularly for the Zionists, to double their energy in various fields. We can do what other nations have done. We can establish a dwelling place for our people, not <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0644.jpg" n="4"/>by asking for any special permission or privileges, but by presenting to the world our just demand to which we are entitled. The world does not consider us, because we are not strongly organized. Let the war reorganize us. When our brothers in Europe answer the call of war, we must also respond to our sacred obligations. Whereas they stand on the battle field to defend the culture of other countries, let us work energetically to construct our own national home and revive our own culture; whereas they stand in a "blood-bath," let us adopt something righteous; whereas they are disorganized and stand brother against brother, let us organize our elements for our own benefit.</p>
   <p>Our organization (Zionist) must become stronger; our institution must be kept up; our work must go on. Every Jew of the United States must, in this crucial moment, come to the aid of his people. We now have the opportunity of showing the world that the Jews in America can awaken to this objective. Will they respond to the call?</p>
