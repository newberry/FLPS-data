   <p>Jews have been living in Chicago for a long long time. Chicago, though the second largest city, yet is not the oldest city in the country, on the contrary, Chicago is not even a hundred years old. It is not known whether Jews settled in Chicago with the very first settlers, but it is a fact that Jews have lived here nearly a hundred years ago. Chicago then was a commercial center of the west between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0863.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jewish immigrants then came mostly from Germany where reigned the dark reaction that came as a result of the failure of the revolutionary movement. Many of the most prominent Jews fled from Germany at that time. The reaction struck the Jews most and great masses immigrated to America. The majority settled in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of the immigrants was Gerhart Foreman; his grand-child now thirty-six, is president of the organized Jewish charities. The name of this grandchild is Alfred K. Foreman.</p>
   <p>When it became known that Alfred K. Foreman was made president of the Associated Jewish Charities of Chicago, I determined to have a long talk with him for the readers of the Forward.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0864.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As is known thus far Mr. Foreman is the youngest president of any Jewish charities in America. Naturally, for a president of the Jewish charities, an elderly man, one who is prominent, a well-known social worker, is usually preferred, but Chicago in this case, dealt entirely different. They turned over the administrative power of the organized charities into the hand of a real young man, one who is the grandson of an immigrant. As it was told to me, it was the plan of the famous philanthropist, Julius Rosenwald. He has for some time expressed his opinion that the youth of the rich must be attracted to this social work, so that when the older workers will become aged and drop the lines, the youth will immediately pick up the lines and proceed with the work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0865.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The father of the Jewish charities in Chicago is Mr. Julius Rosenwald. But he never accepted an office. He is the Honorary President. His name is well-known and respected in all charities, and nothing is ever done without first consulting him.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the orthodox and reform charities are one organization. Years ago the orthodox were separated from the reform, but Rosenwald succeeded in joining them together under the name of Associated Jewish Charities of Chicago.</p>
   <p>By incorporating a money saving system was installed. Before incorporating chaos existed. Many people had to contribute to both organizations, many of the people wiggled out of contributing to either one, by telling one that he just contributed to the other.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0866.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Alfred K. Foreman's grandfather, in a very short time, became very rich after he settled in Chicago. He founded the Foreman Bank, now one of the largest banks in Chicago, and whose new building is one of the largest buildings in the Loop. The Foreman family is one of the richest in Chicago. Naturally children of such rich families turn away from Jewishness. Chicago knows of many such millionaire families who were entirely assimilated. Chicago also knows of Jewish millionaire families, just aching to assimilate themselves, but who are rejected from Gentile circles.</p>
   <p>A Jewish millionaire who was determined to belong to a club where no Jews are accepted wanted to deny his religion but nothing would help.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0867.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>When I spoke to Mr. Foreman he told me he was raised in an environment of Judaism, and since childhood remembers that his people spoke of Jewish traditions, this interested me, and I acquainted myself with the charity work when a real young man. By us it is a tradition and I consider it as one of the most sacred things I received from my parents. Environment plays a great part in education. In good environments people get an altogether different education. At the beginning I could not believe that Mr. Foreman remained a real Jew, due to his environment and tradition, because it was planted in him while he was a child and it remained with him. His grandfather was a very active man in Jewish charities in 1900, and now he is, with great pride, the president.</p>
   <p>He follows in his parents footsteps. He explained to me that in the industrial department many of the people create jobs for those who come asking for help. He believes that by giving work to those who come and ask for help, you are presenting their becoming beggars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0868.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>He said that to the Jewish Charities of Chicago, which is the second largest in the country, are connected twenty-six institutions. The yearly budget ammounts to over a million and a half dollars. The work is divided into two parts; to give direct relief to the poor, and to maintain the institutions, hospitals, orphan homes, homes for the aged; The Jewish Peoples Institute, and so on. Over all these institutions, a 36 year young man stands at the head, the third generation of an immigrant.</p>
