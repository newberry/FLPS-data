   <p>Chevalier N. B. Emanuel, assistant director of the Chicago Grand Opera Company, and a musician of international note, died on June 2, at the age of 66. He gained his title of chevalier through decoration by the king of Italy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Emanuel was famous among musicians because of his remarkable musical memory. He was born in Birmingham, England, and gained his education in Leipzig, Germany. He conducted the Royal Opera in Sweden, and the Imperial Opera in Finland. He next appeared as director of the Imperial Theater in Moscow and spent 15 years in Russia.</p>
   <p>Henry W. Savage brought Emanuel to the U. S. and his first work in Chicago was the building up of the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra. After the Chevalier became assistant conductor of the Chicago Grand Opera, he established and became director of the Opera School.</p>
