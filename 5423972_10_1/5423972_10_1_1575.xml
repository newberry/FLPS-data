   <p>Dr. Alexander Kohut, Rabbi of the synagogue of the Congregation Ahawath Chesed, died on May 25th.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kohut was renowned as an Oriental scholar and writer and was an honorary member of many Oriental historical societies. He was a native of Hungary and was 52 years old. He was elected to the Hungarian Parliament, but did not take his seat, having accepted a call to N. Y. in 1885.</p>
   <p>His first work as an author was entitled "About the Jewish Angelology and Demonology in their relations to Pariseeism." For this he received a prize from the German Oriental Society. One of his most celebrated works, the one which gained for him the eulogies of the great orientalists of the world, was the "Aruch Completum," a Talmudical encyclopedia, based upon the Medrashic dictionary of Nathan ben Jechiel, of the 11th century. It comprised nine volumes, 4,000 pages, and involved 23 years of labor.</p>
   <p>Among other inportant works by Dr. Kohut are "Criticism on the Translation <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1576.jpg" n="2"/>of the Persian Bible by Joseph Tawus," "Eschatology of the Jews," and an English dictionary of ethical quotations from the Talmud, which Scribners are about to publish.</p>
