   <p>Jabotinsky has finally resigned from the Zionist Executive. He resigned two years too late, and the truth of the matter is that he should never have been a member of the Zionist Executive, because he is not a person who can accept the discipline of a political organization. Jabotinsky is a very competent writer, but a very poor statesman. As a diplomat, he is a wild person and can, in one day, disrupt something that has taken many years to build. He has all the earmarks of the Russian intelligentsia, and a member of the Russian intelligentsia is often a good orator and always a good fanatic. He is always a theoretician but never a good diplomat because he cannot distinguish between rigid theory and actual practice. As a member of the Zionist Executive, Jabotinsky did not accomplish anything. On the contrary, he made a lot of trouble. His unauthorized transactions with <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0312.jpg" n="2"/>the agents of Petlura practically ruined the [World] Zionist Organization. He will certainly be more successful as a feuilletonist than as a diplomat and party leader.</p>
