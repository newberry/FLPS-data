   <p>The voice of protest against murderous acts in Poland let itself be heard yesterday at the fourth Semi-Annual Convention of the International Furrier Union, which opened its meetings last Monday at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>The seventy delegates, representatives of thirty locals, having a membership of eleven thousand organized workers from eighteen states, denounced the slaughters in Poland, and accepted a resolution demanding that the United States Congress, President Wilson, and the Paris Peace Conference sponsor the cause of the oppressed Jews and see that the security of lives and goods of Jews in Poland and Eastern Europe be guaranteed in the Peace Agreement. Copies of the resolution were <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0475.jpg" n="2"/>immediately sent to Washington and Paris.</p>
   <p>On Record For Berger and Mooney</p>
   <p>At the same time the convention also accepted a number of other resolutions among which were: A protest against the barring from Congress of the Socialistic Congressman Victor Berger of Milwaukee, who was legitimately elected to that body; approval of the five-day Mooney general strike to start July 5; approval of the five-day work week (eight hours a day).</p>
   <p>Other resolutions approved the effort to organize the furriers in St. Louis and Detroit; favored the increase of the per capita international dues from six to ten cents weekly; approved the payments to some organizers and founders of a minimum annual fee for the year's work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0476.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As Mr. M. Kaufman, acting president, explained to a reporter of the Courier, "The outlook for Chicago Furriers is bright." The convention learned of the good work done by the local union, which secured for its members the same privileges which obtain in New York.</p>
   <p>The convention, it is believed, will close Saturday afternoon.</p>
