<title level="a">CHARLIE CHAPLIN SAILS FOR PALESTINE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Mr. Harry Goldman, formerly of St. Louis, now of Chicago, and in the future of Palestine, left Chicago last Sunday bound for Palestine, taking with him Charlie Chaplin and a group of beautiful and capable actors and actresses.</p>
   <p>More definitely, these artists are not accompanying him personally, but are packed away in several huge trunks that were sent ahead. Mr. Goldman following later.</p>
   <p>But to be truly specific, I must confess that what he really packed away were not actually Charlie Chaplin and other actors, but their art, their films of comedy and tragedy. Mr. Goldman intends <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0514.jpg" n="2"/>to be the first movie magnate in Palestine.</p>
   <p>In short, he forwarded more than a hundred thousand feet of films of all kinds of American productions, dramas, tragedies and comedies, the inimitable Charlie Chaplin, etc., all to amuse the inhabitants of Palestine, each in his own laguage.</p>
   <p>Judging by the enthusiasm and energy expended by Mr. Goldman on this task, and especially the profound thoroughness that has marked all his undertakings thus far, we are bound to believe he is on his way to success. And if, my dear reader, you should travel to Palestine and see huge Hebrew posters advertising Charlie Chaplin antics in Hebrew by management of the firm Hamnorah, please remember that this is the doings of our friend Harry Goldman.</p>
   <p>Then if again in about ten years hence you have occasion to pass by a majestic villa at the edge of the sea in TeI-Aviv, and should wonder <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0515.jpg" n="3"/>who lives therein, then be reminded that here lives the first movie magnate, our friend Mr. Harry Goldman, because only a movie magnate can permit himself to possess such villas.</p>
   <p>It is natural and fitting that Mr. Harry Goldman establish a business in Palestine. The Palestianian tradition stretches like a thread through his family. His brother, Simon Goldman, had years ago established a loan company in St. Louis and later left with his family to settle in Palestine. He had an orchard and was its manager until the war devastated his years of labor and ended his life many years too soon. Besides his Charlie Chaplin interests, Mr. Harry Goldman cares for the needs of his brother's wife and seven children, also for the orchard which the Turks had destroyed.</p>
   <p>The preparations for a movie business in Palestine were set by Mr. Goldman <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0516.jpg" n="4"/>on a strong foundation. Several years ago he visited Palestine and from his observations gained a good knowledge of the people of the land. He therefore undertook to make his movie performances understood by all the inhabitants, Jews, Christians, and Arabs.</p>
   <p>He had translated into Hebrew the scenes of all performances on these hundred thousand feet of films.</p>
   <p>The many companies from which Mr. Goldman bought his films and their rights of presentation made special Hebrew films, which were the translations of the English text. For the general Christian population, which speaks mostly English, the films with English texts will be shown as they appear in American theaters, immediately followed by the Hebrew translation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0517.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There is still another question. What to do with the Arab population who are large patrons of this entertainment.</p>
   <p>Here Mr. Goldman's personal experiences in Palestine came to his aid.</p>
   <p>He knows that Arabs retain the old custom of story-tellers, a sort of bard who travels from village to village, gathers the people around him in a semi-circle and tells his story while they smoke and listen open-mouthed to his tales of the Koran, of Momad and Amar, etc., then express their wonder with all kinds of remarks.</p>
   <p>This custom of the story-teller Mr. Goldman put to work in his movie showings. Since many Arabs are not able to read their own language, there is no sense in using the text on the screen. Instead the synopsis of the text is told briefly by the story-teller. As you see, this is a bright idea.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0518.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Mr. Goldman is in contact with Palestine and inasmuch as present conditions permit, he receives news from there and knows conditions regarding movie business. He is definitely certain that his American stock will create thrilling excitement from Tel-Aviv to Xaffa and that from Don to Bar Sheva all will say, "Such movies have never been shown here before."</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldman left Chicago last Sunday full of high ambitions. He was escorted by well-wishers and friends who hope he attains success both for Palestine and himself.</p>
