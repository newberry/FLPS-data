   <p>Every Jew of Chicago, who has left a family in the old country, must for his own and the sake of his family, bring them to the United States. The importance of bringing your family from Russia, Rumania, or Galicia, is self-explanatory. No matter who you are, it is inexcusable for you to let your family remain where they are, under such deplorable hazaradous conditions. Then too, regardless of how rich you may be, you no doubt are lonesome and stranded without your family.</p>
   <p>The only way you may insure the safety of your family, is by bringing them to the United States. The only way in which you can rid yourself of your loneliness, is by bringing your family and leading a happy family life. To follow this out, you, no doubt, will be confronted by the following questions: How much is a travel ticket? Which one is good and which is not? Which frontier should be used, which ship, etc.? In order that you may have all these questions answered correctly, and for the soundest advise, come <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0162.jpg" n="2"/>to the Travel Bureau of Seltzer and Rosenberg, 687 West Taylor St.</p>
   <p>The Bureau of Seltzer and Rosenberg is the only reliable agency in the City of Chicago, which will transport your family safely. Those who have dealt with them are greatly satisfied. Do not delay, see Seltzer and Rosenberg immediately and arrange to bring your family. Remember, Seltzer and Rosenberg, 687 W. Taylor St.</p>
