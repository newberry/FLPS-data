   <p>The recently organized Jewish Reform Congregation, Isaiah Temple, located on the South Side, has elected as its minister, Rabbi Joseph Stolz. This beloved Rabbi was born in Syracuse, N. Y., thirty-four years ago. After completing his studies at the public schools of his native city, he entered the Hebrew Union College. He graduated from the College and the University of Cincinnati in 1885 and was immediately called to Little Rock, Ark. After officiating at this place for three years, he was elected Rabbi of the Zion Congregation, Chicago, and for the past eight years, he has served his congregation well. Rabbi Stolz was actively interested in the Parliament of Religions, and the Religious Congress, as well as in the Congress of the Liberal Religious Societies, of which he is one of the directors.</p>
