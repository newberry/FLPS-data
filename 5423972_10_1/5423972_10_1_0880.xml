   <p>Adolph Kraus, one of the oldest Jewish leaders, died suddenly in his apartment yesterday, at the age of 78 years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kraus has no longer been active for the past few years. Three years ago he made his last public appearance when he celebrated his 75th birthday. Adolph Kraus was for many years the International President of the B'nai B'rith, and an active Jewish social worker. He distinguished himself especially in his activity against Czarism during the time of pogroms.</p>
   <p>He was born in 1850, in a small town of Bohemia, now Czechoslovakia. He came to America at the age of 15. He settled in Chicago after the great historical fire in 1871 and worked as a cigar maker while continuing his studies at night. He completed a law course.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0881.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He, then, stepped into politics and held various positions. His first office was president of the Board of Education; the Corporation Counsel; Civil Service Commissioner; then he entirely withdrew from politics, and started in Jewish social work, which made him famous throughout America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kraus was an old fashion social worker - a typical Jewish mediator. He is survived by his wife, Mathilda, a daughter, Mrs. Paula Veil, three sons: Albert, Milton and Dr. Harry Kraus.</p>
