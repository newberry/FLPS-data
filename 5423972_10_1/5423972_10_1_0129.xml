   <p>The National Bureau of Statistics has given out its statistical report on the figures of foreign-born in Chicago. This of course is very interesting to our Jews in Chicago. But in as much as in our United States, where religion is not a factor in the national census, it is presumed by some of our Jewish brethren that anything pertaining to Jewish is strictly of a religious sect and not a national affair. So, this being the case, some Jews are registered as Russian, Austrian, German, or from other nationalities, and that makes it hard to get the exact figures of the Jewish population in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We had to resort to a rough estimate of Chicago's Jewish population, which is as follows: There are, at the least calculation, 122,000 foreign-born Jews in Chicago, which mean about 5 1/2 per cent of the total population.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0130.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But when you add the 234,000 American-born Jews, you will find a total of 366,000 Jews in Chicago. With a Jewish community of over 300,000 which is quite liberal with donations for any thing in the line of civic doings, it is no wonder, that the Jews of Chicago can support so many beautiful and worthy institutions, such as the Hebrew Institute, and other institutions, which would be great credit to any Jewish community in the world. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, it statistical report, shows that we can safely estimate, that 75 per cent of the foreign-born Jews in Chicago have only lived here on an average of ten years. We are very proud of our foreign-born Jews in Chicago for they have accomplished a great deal in this short period for themselves, and also for the community at large.</p>
