   <p>Adolph Kraus, for more than three decades a leader and spokesman of American Jewry, is dead at the age of seventy-six.</p>
   <p>In 1893, he was manager of the Democratic campaign, which resulted in the re-election of the elder Mayor Carter Harrison. He was appointed corporation counsel and retained that post until 1897 when the task of re-organizing the civil service was given to him.</p>
   <p>In 1905, when the Russian government was persecuting the Jews, Mr. Kraus became a member of a commission of American Jews who conferred at Portsmouth, N. H., with Sergius de Witta, representative at the Russo-Japanesa peace conference. Mr. Kraus was for many years international president of B'Nai B'rith and in January, 1927, the society bestowed on him the Supreme Order of the Covenant. On his seventieth birthday, Mr. Kraus received congratulatory telegrams from every state and from England, Germany, Austria, and Palestine. Ex-President Taft, was one of the speakers at a dinner in his honor at the Hotel La Salle.</p>
