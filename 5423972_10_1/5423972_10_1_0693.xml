   <p>The meeting of the newly-founded Palestinean Farm Society, which was previously announced in the Courier, and which took place last night at the Chicago Hebrew Institute, was a great success. About forty members promised to bring nine members each to the next meeting. They also volunteered to serve as collectors for the Society.</p>
   <p>The Society will be divided into ten units. Each unit will consist of one hundred members, who will appoint or elect their own collector. The bookkeeping of the Society is so simple that the collectors will have very little work to do. The one who will actually have some work to do will be the secretary, who will have to handle the correspondence of the Society.</p>
   <p>The following directors were elected at the meeting for the next six months: Aaron Heller, Israel Reizburg, B. Antanov, A. Fleishman, Leon Zolotkoff, Mr. Lashinsky, J. Moment, Max Shulman, Marcus Weiner, H. Fleishman, I. Turner, Aaron Pressberg, D. Krantz, S. Hoffman, and T. Agranat.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0694.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A meeting of the newly elected directors will be held next Monday evening, at which the officers will be elected for the next six months.</p>
   <p>A membership meeting will be called for May 1.</p>
   <p>The plan of the Society is now well known, and is liked by the Jewish public in Chicago. It is so well liked that many unsolicited applications are being received daily from persons living in different parts of the city.</p>
