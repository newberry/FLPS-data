   <p>New York, Oct. 6--A cable dispatch from Tsofeth to Mr. Hyman Wilovsky announced that his father, the well known scholar and former chief rabbi of Chicago, Rabbi Jacob Dud, died on the first day of Rosh Hashana.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Jacob Dud Wilovsky was one of the greatest scholars of the present time. He was born in Kobrin of poor parents. Even as a child he showed such great talents that his name became known everywhere as a child of great genius. At the age of twenty-three years he was made the Rabbi of Isbellin, Grodner State. His extensive learning and acuteness established him as one of the greatest of rabbis. Jews from every part of the world began to come to him for learning and advice.</p>
   <p>Not only was he a learned scholar, but also a well known orator. He was blessed by nature with a powerful oratorical talent. Thus it was not long before the Barusker Jewish community made him its chief rabbi. But he was destined for even larger things. Soon the large city of Vilna proclaimed him as its city preacher and chief expounder of rabbinical law. From there he <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1230.jpg" n="2"/>went to Polotsk, then to Volkovitch, and later to Slutz where he stayed for ten years. Here he founded the famous Slutzker Yeshiva which he personally supervised. He placed the well known Rabbi Isadore Zalman Zeltzer as head or dean of the school.</p>
   <p>When twenty-nine years old he printed his Magdal David dealing with the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds. It created quite a sensation in the Jewish rabbinical world; they considered him a new star in the heaven of the Talmudic interpretators especially since the Palestinian Talmud was little known even to the learned men of the time. This he followed up with his book Chanah David also pertaining to the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmud. Hereafter he devoted his time to finishing his great work which well forever remain a monument to this great man as long as there are Jews who study Jewish works. This is his classical interpretations of the Palestinian Talmud under the titles of Chidushie Ridbis and Tussufis Hadir. Thus the Palestinian Talmud came into its proper place in the Jewish literature on a par with the Babylonian Talmud. This gave him the place as one of the foremost teachers of his century. But it was worth the price he paid for it, i.e., thirty years of learning the Palestinian Talmud and seventeen years of <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1231.jpg" n="3"/>writing its interpretations.</p>
   <p>The cost of publishing this work was so great that he came to America to raise the necessary funds. He received a warm welcome here and was able to accumulate the money in the short time that he stayed. He returned to Russia tol print his works.</p>
   <p>This short visit so impressed American Jews that a movement was started to bring this learned man to America for the purpose of founding schools around which Jewish life would concentrate. On September 8, orthodox Jews of Chicago elected him as their chief rabbi.</p>
   <p>At that time Chicago Jews were not yet mature in their organization of a true Jewish community and when the learned man gave forth a true order for such foundation the Jewish public was not yet ready to receive it. Instead they waged a stormy war until the great scholar resigned his position in Chicago. He traveled all over the United States and then left for Palestine where he settled in Tsofeth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1232.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In Tsofeth he founded another school, Torahs Aretz Israel, just as he had done so many times in the past. So devoted was he to his work that he worked day and night. Then too, the climate of Tsofeth was not good for him. He began to suffer with eye-trouble. It was feared he would become totally blind. All Palestine prayed for his health. It so happened he did get better and continued with his work.</p>
   <p>He left many volumes of noteworthy books that have since been published.</p>
