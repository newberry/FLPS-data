   <p>A.B.Seelenfreund was born in Vienna in 1869 and came to the United States at the age of 16. After settling in Chicago, he procured a position with Nelson Morris, and soon became his confidential secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seelenfreund joined Ramah Lodge in 1893 and shortly thereafter became its secretary. In 1904 he was also elected secretary of District Grand Lodge #6. He made the B'nai B'rith his life work and achieved a memorable record. Largely through his efforts the Anti-Defamation League was organized and the Covenant Club founded. He made several trips overseas, before and after the Great War on various missions, partly in the <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0840.jpg" n="2"/>interest of War Orphans.</p>
