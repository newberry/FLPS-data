   <p>Death has again taken its toll, ending the career of one of the most esteemed citizens of Chicago. Dankmar Adler, universally recognized as the perfect genius in the field of architecture, died yesterday. His untimely death was a shock to all who knew him. Dankmar Adler was born in Germany in 1844. At the age of 10 years, he emigrated with his parents to America. His father Rabbi Liebmann Adler chose Detroit, Mich., as their domicile, but not for long. He soon moved with his family to Chicago, where he took up his duties as rabbi of the Anshe Maariv community.</p>
   <p>Dankmar Adler, chose the field of architecture as his life's task. As architect he has indeed climbed to fame and was known throughout the United States. Several of the well known buildings in Chicago, like the Auditorium, the Stock Exchange Building, the Schiller Building, the Borden Blocks and the Central Music Hall of Chicago, were products of his great talent. He was also the architect for the Union Trust Building, the Wainwright Building and the St. Nicholas Hotel of St. Louis, Mo. He designed the Post Office Building and the Dooley Blocks in Salt Lake City. The Pueblo, Colo., Opera House is another evidence of his great genius, and so are many more. The designs of almost all <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1492.jpg" n="2"/>the important buildings, erected in the western part of the United States, were submitted to his expert opinion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adler was a member of the Union League Club, the Standard Club, the Technical Society and many other famous professional societies of Chicago. He was also a member of many societies for companionable contacts. The deceased was a former president of the Western Association of Architects, State Commissioner for the State of Illinois, an authority on architecture for the Chicago World's Fair and, for a long time, served as secretary for the American Institute of Architects. Dankmar Adler was also a member of the Illinois Regiment of Volunteers, which fought in the Civil War for the upholding of the union.</p>
