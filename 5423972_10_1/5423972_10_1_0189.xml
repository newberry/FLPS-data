  <body>
   <p>A remarkable celebration by the Hebrews throughout the United States, unparalled in the history of nations or races, is in progress to-day. A million and a quarter of Jews are holding special services of thanksgiving in expression of their gratitude to the first nation of modern time to recognize the Jews title to all the rights of man. And, inasmuch as the recognition covered the right of the Jew to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, the national thanksgiving ceremonies are largely religious in character.</p>
   <p>The general thanksgiving movement originated in New York, and the programme of exercise carried out yesterday and to be continued to-day was originated by the New York committee, and will be identical throughout the country. Especially elaborate and impressive are the Sunday school exercises, with a view to engraving on the minds of the children the causes for Jewish gratitude toward the country in which their for-bearers finally obtained recognition for their sacred rights.</p>
   <p>The celebration is directed by an executive committee composed of New York men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0190.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This committee appointed a list of vice presidents to act for each state, the Illinois list being as follows: Adolf Kraus, Judge Julian Mack, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Harry Hart, Henry M. Wolf, Dr. Joseph Stolz, Julius Rosenwald, Samuel Alschuler, Dr. Tobias Schonfarber, Dr. B. Felsenthal and Henry L. Frank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The persecution of the Jews in Germany between 1830 and 1840 drove large numbers of them to the United States, but most of them remained in the eastern cities. Gradually they drifted to the Ohio Valley and from there to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Benedict Schubert was the first Jewish settler in Chicago, so far as local history records. The date of his arrival is not definitely fixed, but probably it was 1841. The first considerable number of Jews came to Cook County in 1843. The efforts of the Jewish Colonization Society of New York, at the head of which was Wm. Renan, led to the settlement here of many Jews in the pioneer days of the city. This society sent a Mr. Meyer west to select lands upon which the colony might settle, and, after examining many sections farther west, selected and bought 160 acres at Shaumberg, Cook County. Mr. Meyer reported his action to the society and a majority of the members came to Chicago to meet their agent and see the land. Meyer's plans, <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0191.jpg" n="3"/>however, did not meet the approval of the prospective colonists, and instead of settling on the tract selected, they scattered.</p>
   <p>Many Come to Chicago</p>
   <p>Prior to the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Galena and Chicago Railroad, few Jews came to Chicago, but in 1849 the influx of Jews in considerable numbers began.</p>
   <p>Among the earliest arrivals were L. Resenfield, Jacob Rosenberg, the Kohn brothers, Samuel Cole, Mayer Klein, M. M. Gerstley, the Rubel brothers, and the Greenebaum brothers. In 1845 there were enough Jews in Chicago to form a religious society. The first action taken was the purchase from the city of ground for cemetery purposes within the present limits of Lincoln Park. In 1856 this cemetery was abandoned.</p>
   <p>In 1848 the first congregation was chartered, that of Kehilath Anshe Maarev (congregation) of the men of the west. The first meeting was held in the upper story of a frame building at the southwest corner of Lake and Wells sts. In 1849 a synogogue <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0192.jpg" n="4"/>was built on Clark Street between Adams and Quincy streets. Here they remained until 1865, when they bought property at Wabash Avenue and Peck Court. The first minister of this congregation was Rev. Ignatz Kunreuther, who became pastor in 1849.</p>
   <p>The numerical social and religious strength of the Jews of Chicago to-day is too much a matter of every day knowledge to require review.</p>
   <p>With the Jewish population about 2% of the total in the United States, it is a question whether any single element in the population has accomplished as much toward the development of the wealth and power of the states as this one during the 250 years since the Hebrews first settled in the land. Generations of financial training made them a power beyond their numerical strength in the finances of the country. As a manufacturer or producer of wealth, he has taken a strong position. In America many artists have sprung from among them, Ezekiel, the sculptor, and P. Moise has made lasting contributions to poetic literature.</p>
   <p>In almost every Hebrew family there is a doctor or a lawyer, the Hebrew's appetite for learning being prodigious.</p>
