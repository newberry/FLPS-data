   <p>The dean of Chicago rabbis, Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon, will soon celebrate his seventieth birthday. This great Jew can look back with a feeling of satisfaction upon sixty years of study and work. There are few people in this world fortunate enough to be able to devote their lives to spiritual pursuits, and there are very few Jews in this world fortunate enough to be able to devote their entire life to the study of the Torah. Rabbi Gordon is a favorite son of fate. He is lucky and he should be satisfied. He is today not only the greatest authority on the Torah in America, but also one of the greatest rabbinical authorities of our time. What he does not know about rabbinical and Talmudic literature can be hidden in the corner of one eye. Rabbi Gordon is also a great scholar in various other fields, [a circumstance] which is rare among rabbis of his type. Not merely Chicago, which, after all, can lay claim to only a small portion of the history of rabbinates, but even a city like Minsk <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0943.jpg" n="2"/>or Wilno might well be proud of a rabbi like Judah Leb Gordon. The whole Orthodox Jewish Community of Chicago should celebrate the anniversary of his seventieth birthday. I am told that Congregation Tiphereth Zion is going to give a banquet for its great rabbi upon this memorable occasion. However, many Jews of Chicago, and I am among them, think that the entire city should participate in this celebration. Every synagogue in Chicago should take part officially in the great homage that is being paid to a great rabbi and a wise man.</p>
