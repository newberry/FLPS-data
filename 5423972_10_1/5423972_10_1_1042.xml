   <p>About the American Boy Muni Weisenfreund.</p>
   <p>Muni Weisenfreund was born in Lamberg, Galicia, in the year 1895, of Jewish parentage. He migrated to America, with his parents at the age of 6. They settled in New York, where Muni started public school.</p>
   <p>His father and mother were connected with the Yiddish Theater. His mother still makes public appearances, playing now at the Arch St. Theater in Philadelphia. His parents wanted him to become a great violinist and he studied music for eight years, but the stage appealed more to Muni than the music.</p>
   <p>Then the Weisenfreunds moved to Chicago, where Muni was given a Jewish education. His father was a director of a group of actors and Muni pleaded with him to permit him to take the children parts on the stage, but his father refused. His first appearance on the stage happened to be in Cleveland <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1043.jpg" n="2"/>when an actor took sick, and as no other could be gotten, his father substituted Muni for him in "Two Corpses Eat Breakfast." He played the role of a president of a synagogue.</p>
   <p>He, later became a professional actor, playing throughout the country. He appeared with many New York stars.</p>
