   <p>"Deploring the reported assaults upon Jews in Poland and expressing the deepest sympathy for Jewish suffering, I hereby ascribe the reasons for these pogroms to foreign propaganda, especially German, and to the very unsettled outlook of the future. It is very unfortunate for Poles, as well as Jews, that these outbursts had to occur. Poles are just as much in need of the good will of the Jew as of the entire world. We American Poles know quite well how important Polish Jews can be to the new nation. We also know what damage an incited hatred can accomplish. That is why Polish leaders regret so deeply these tragic events and sincerely hope to prevent them in the future.</p>
   <p>"Leaders of both nationalities, Jews and Poles, must try to create a better understanding between the two. Any outbursts of complaints on either side cannot be of any help here. They would only sharpen the feeling and dull the understanding <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0450.jpg" n="2"/>between the two peoples. The Jewish press must soften the tone and attitude of its articles when writing of these unfortunate outbreaks. The Polish press, naturally, must do likewise. The Polish people must show their good will by the immediate cessation and future prevention of any outbursts against Jews; also, by means of open declarations and acts of tolerance and liberalism such as have already--about three weeks ago--been proclaimed through Premier Paderewski's resolute statement.</p>
   <p>"On the other hand, Jews must display their patriotism for the New Poland, their sincere desire to co-operate in the rebuilding of the nation.</p>
   <p>"I believe it is the duty of Poles and Jews in America to help establish such a friendly understanding. No one regrets pogroms against Jews more than we American Poles because we have learned, through our contact with Jews, to esteem them highly." [Translator's note: Mr. B. Horwich, Jewish representative individual, and Mr. J. F. Smulski; Polish representative individual, are returning from war-relief work in Poland. Please note former articles regarding attitude of Mr. Smulski's Polish newspaper in Chicago on the above subject.]</p>
