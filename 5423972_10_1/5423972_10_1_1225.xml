   <p>The obituary evenings for the Slutzker Scholar, Rabbi Yacov Duvid, formerly chief Rabbi of Chicago, began last night with two large services, one in Anshe Knesses Israel Shuhl, on Douglas Blvd., the other in Benay Mosheh Shuhl, Paulina Street. Both synagogues were crowded with men, women and children who came to pay their last respects to the former Chicago Rabbi who had died unexpectedly.</p>
   <p>Tears and money expressed the honor that was being paid the great scholar. The people were told how he spent his life studying the Torah and founding schools everywhere. Had he remained in Chicago he would also have established them here. In honor of this great teacher, we wish to <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1226.jpg" n="2"/>further his idea and establish here a Talmud Torah. The people responded very generously so that a large sum of money was received to build a Talmud Torah at 12th and Winchester Avenue.</p>
   <p>To the audiences, were pictured, with many touching words, the loss of so great a man. Everyone wept at the mention of this scholar in their very midst, who because of their petty quarrels, left for the east. Thus he died, away from them.</p>
