  <body>
   <p>President Woodrow Wilson has appointed Mr. Samuel Alschuler Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the Seventh District, in the place of Judge Grosscoupe, who resigned a short time ago.</p>
   <p>Governor Dunn and United States Senator James Hamilton Lewis had their respective candidates for the vacancy, but Congressman Sabath intervened and Mr. Alschuler received the appointment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1171.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Alschuler has twice been a candidate for governor of the state of Illinois. In 1900 he ran against Richard Yates, and while the Republicans captured the election then, Mr. Alschuler drew a considerable vote. The second time was in 1912, when the Primary Law was already functioning and his opponent then was the present Governor Dunn, who was victorious at the primary. A short time ago Governor Dunn appointed Mr. Alschuler President of the Deep Water-Way Commission.</p>
   <p>Now, when Mr. Alschuler becomes Judge, the post of president is vacant and naturally there will be several, who will seek this post, which pays $6,000 per year. Mr. Alschuler was always among the noted Democrats of the state. He never took part in the fights of one faction against another, for he is above that.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1172.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He is a member of the firm of Krause, Alschuler and Holden, of which Adolph Krause is the senior member. Mr. Alschuler enjoys a wonderful reputation in general, as well, as in judicial circles. In the last street car strike he represented the workers in the arbitration.</p>
