   <p>A conference of three hundred Jews, representing every kind of conservative Jew in Chicago, was held yesterday in the Hebrew Institute. Judge Harry Fisher presided.</p>
   <p>The chairman reported on the activities of the leaders regarding protests against Polish pogroms. He also reported that the leaders of the South Side Jews are against a protest meeting in Chicago, because they would rather carry on this work diplomatically, thinking that thereby they can accomplish more.</p>
   <p>Following the reports, Dr. S. M. Melomed made a motion that a committee of five be elected for the purpose of arranging a mass-meeting protesting <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0497.jpg" n="2"/>Polish persecutions of Jews. The three-hour debate on the motion showed that the opinion of the conference favored the mass-meeting. Mr. Z. B. Komaiko seconded the motion, and it was accepted, after the debating, in its modified form.</p>
   <p>According to the accepted resolution, a committee of five was elected, and its duties are to contact other similar committees for the organization of a mass-meeting.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee are Mr. Nathan D. Kaplan, Dr. S. M. Melomed, Mr. Charles Tiktin, S. J. Rosenblatt, and Ephriam Epstine.</p>
   <p>No date has been set for the protest meeting.</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was also decided to organize a publicity bureau <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0498.jpg" n="3"/>which is to gather material regarding pogroms and acquaint the American public with it. The above mentioned committee will confer with the executive committee regarding the set up of the Bureau.</p>
   <p>Judge Julian V. Mack is expected to return to Chicago shortly. He is expected to bring definite information regarding Jewish conditions in Europe, and what American Jews can do to alleviate the tragic situation.</p>
