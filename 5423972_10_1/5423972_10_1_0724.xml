   <p>Jacob G. Grossberg. A practicing Chicago lawyer for forty years, Jacob G. Grossberg has built into his reputation the qualities of a penetrating intelligence, the resources that are the result of study and scholarship, a broad-mindedness and a great ability in handling matters invested in public interest.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grossberg has lived in Chicago since he was twelve years of age. He was born in Korno, then Russia, now Lithuania, on April 10, 1870. In 1882 his parents came to the United States and after a few months in Cleveland moved to Chicago in the same year. In Chicago, Mr. Grossberg attended public schools, and in 1888 was graduated from the old South Division High School at Twenty-sixth Street and Wabash Ave.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0725.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After graduating he entered the Northwestern University Law School, then known as the Union College of Law, and was granted his LL. B.degree in 1890. He is perhaps the oldest practicing lawyer of Russian-Jewish parentage. In his early years as a lawyer he was associated with Senator James Hamilton Lewis, with whom he is again associated at the time of this publication, in 1932. When Senator Lewis became corporation counsel of Chicago, during the Administration of Mayor Dunne, Mr. Grossberg was appointed special assistant corporation counsel in traction matters. Judge Dunne's story of his long fight for municipal ownership of public utilities as presented on other pages of this publication gives credit to some of Mr. Grossberg's special contributions to the movement. His labors cleared up many of the tangled questions and smoothed the path toward municipal ownership, and he also contributed many articles in the public press on the subject. Mr. Grossberg was at one time president of the Municipal Ownership League of Chicago, <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0726.jpg" n="3"/>and he organized and became the first president of the Public Ownership League of Illinois. When Mayor Dunne became Governor Dunne, Mr. Grossberg served as a member of the Mining Investigation Commission and as attorney for the State Board of Arbitration.</p>
   <p>His personal and professional services have again and again been at the disposal of organizations representing the liberal spirit of the community. He was legal representative for Chicago in opposing the injunction sought by the traction companies to restrain the city from enforcing the safety ordinances, and he carried the case to the Supreme Court, which sustained the position of the city government. Many residents of Chicago will recall the organization known as the Washington Park Forum, popularly known as the "Bug Club" whose meetings were frequently interrupted by the police until Mr. Grossberg, as attorney of the Forum, secured a perpetual injunction restraining the South Park Commissioners from interfering with public speaking under the auspices of the club in the park. Mr. Grossberg represented the Pokagon tribe <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0727.jpg" n="4"/>of Indians in presenting their claim to lake front lands. Still another exercise of his legal influence and efforts, which attracted a great deal of public attention, was his service as attorney for the exhibitors of the famous film "Birth of a Nation" when it was first introduced in Chicago. He succeeded in enjoining the city administration under Mayor Thompson from interfering with the showing of the picture.</p>
   <p>He was also been prominent in Jewish organizations, his most notable work being the organizing of the Jewish Congress movement. He acted as president of the Jewish Congress Association for the middle western states in 1915-17.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grossberg married, January 30, 1894, Dorris Elkan. They have four children, Victor, Ralph, Herbert and Edith.</p>
