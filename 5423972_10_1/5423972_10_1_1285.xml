   <p>Hirsch Soble, representing the University of Chicago, has won the H. N. Higinbotham prize of fifty dollars in the fourth annual state oratorical contest held under the auspices of the International Peace Association, on March 31, 1911, at Northwestern University.</p>
   <p>He is a resident of the northwest side, and graduated from Tuley High School in 1909.</p>
   <p>Shortly after entering the University of Chicago on an honor scholarship, Mr. Soble made his ability as a speaker known. In his freshman year, he won first place in the declamation and extempore speaking contests. Each of these contests rewarded him with scholarships as prizes. In the sophomore speaking contest, he was again the winner, thereby winning another scholarship.</p>
   <p>In 1910, two prizes were awarded to Mr. Soble for his excellent work. One prize consisted of two hundred dollars, and the other of one hundred and twenty dollars in tuition dues. At present he is a member of the sophomore class, and an assistant in the department of Public Speaking.</p>
