  <body>
   <p>Mr. Harris Dick, president of the Western Dairy Company, died of a stomach ailment at ten-thirty last night at the Mercy Hospital.....The deceased was sixty years old.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dick is from an honorable Wilna family. He came to this city twenty-five years ago. His economy and diligent work placed him in the ranks of the great Jewish businessmen of Chicago. He is the founder of the Western Dairy Company, a thriving company in this city that does a large volume of business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dick as a philanthropist was always ready to aid every Jewish enterprise in Chicago by work or deed. He was a prominent member of the Wilna Synagogue, a member of the Captain Dreyfuss Lodge, and others. He is survived by several talented children.</p>
   <p>His wife died a month ago. This grief aggravated the illness from which he <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1066.jpg" n="2"/>had been suffering for some time. He is mourned by his children--Anna Silverstein, Morris, Ida, Samuel, and Mamie--his workers whom he treated well, and a host of friends acquired during his lifetime.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held today at three P. M. from 3611 Douglas Boulevard to the Wilna Synagogue on Sangamon Street, and from there to the congregation's plot in Waldheim Cemetery.</p>
  </body>
