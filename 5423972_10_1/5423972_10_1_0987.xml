   <p>Every Orthodox institution in Chicago is associated with the name of a person. The masses do not build institutions, they only help to build them. An institution is founded by an individual or a group of individuals. Can you imagine the Hebrew Theological College being built without the work of Ben Zion Leizerowich and Alex Eisenstein? Can you imagine the Daughters of Zion Infant Home without Mrs. Rieger? Can you imagine the Yeshiva Etz Chaim without Shloma Levin? Institutions are founded and popularized by individuals, and are, in a certain sense, maintained by individuals.</p>
   <p>Paul Rissman is one of the Jews of Chicago who has founded an important institution, and brought it to a point where it has become a great philanthropic and moral asset and a credit to the Jewish community of Chicago. The institution he founded is the Home For The Incurables in Oak Forest. He, with the help of <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0988.jpg" n="2"/>Mrs. Benjamin, built it up and then turned it over to the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities. For this achievement, Mr. Paul Rissman deserves the appreciation even of those people who do not always agree with him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rissman can look back upon twenty-five years of community work in Chicago. His friends thought that this occasion should be utilized to express to Mr. Rissman the thanks and appreciation of the community. All of Mr. Rissman's friends, with whom he has worked for a number of years in various fields of Jewish community life, will gather tomorrow evening at supper in the Pompeian Room of Gold's Restaurant, to do honor to a man whose contribution has helped to make the Jewish community of Chicago better and more beautiful.</p>
