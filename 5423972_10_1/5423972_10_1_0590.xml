   <p>At the time when the Inquisition in Spain was not officially sanctioned by the government of Ferdinand and Isabella, it functioned as a secret organization, which carried on its sordid acts in bloody, underground dens where they tortured and tormented Jewish victims who fell into their hands. At that time Jews lived on Spanish soil in riches and in luxury, and carried on all the commerce and industry of the country.</p>
   <p>Later, however, when the government officially recognized the Inquisition as a State institution which could, without any interference, persecute the "heretics", the Jews met secretly in underground caves, where they established their synagogues. There, undisturbed, they would pray to their God, and there they would also hide their gold and silver.</p>
   <p>Later on the Jews in Germany adopted a similar system in their secluded <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0591.jpg" n="2"/>Ghettos. On the outside they kept their houses filthy in order to make them appear to be the dwellings or hovels of paupers, so as not to enrage the violent mob and crusaders who would, upon the slightest provocation, attack them and confiscate their property. The small, poor hovel of Meyer Anshel Rothschild, founder of the "House of Rothschild", which still stands in the Frankfurter Judenstrasse, can truly bear witness to the manner in which our Jewish millionaires lived for the sole purpose of creating the impression that they were poor.</p>
   <p>Recently human pride has reawakened in the Jew and he has begun to feel, or at least recent times have tended to encourage or make him feel that he is a worker, a producer, and a promoter of commerce and industry; that he has the right to live as freely as all other human beings. And this caused the world to notice the outward magnificence and wealth of the Jew. And gradually the non-Jewish world began to adjust itself to the notion that the Jew was a <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0592.jpg" n="3"/>significant factor in the economic world, for which he deserves, if not love, at least respect.</p>
   <p>The Jewish colonization in Palestine, and all Zionist achievements in general, in both the cultural and economic fields, have been carried out openly and honorably. This gained respect for the Jews, who have transformed whole tracts of desert where wild Bedouins used to pitch their tents, into a Paradise. Regions which were formerly covered with wild vegetation, are now covered with beautiful, modern homes surrounded by fruit trees and blooming vineyards. On sites where wild Arabian horses and mules used to roam, Jews have erected institutions of learning, elementary folk-schools, music schools, high schools and polytechnical institutes. This has aroused jealousy among many Arabs who, seeing the example of Jewish energy and activity, are trying to develop themselves into a cultured people, instead of spending all their time in idleness, or in gazing at the stars, or in smoking their pipes--waiting until their wives return from the fields to give them supper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0593.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Do the Jewish colonists deserve thanks for this? We shall be conservative and say no. No one, generally, is entitled to gratitude for his work and energetic activity, even if that work should set a good example to others. When a person works to fit himself for a career, and then reaches a lofty pinnacle of erudition and wealth, he himself will be the first to reap the fruits of his labor.</p>
   <p>The same is true of the Jews in Palestine. With great effort, they have developed those devastated and neglected regions, and now they are beginning to reap the fruits of their toil. But do they deserve thanks and mention for that? Every thinking person will say no.</p>
   <p>However, there are people, the constant critics, the ever-present cynics, who are unable to see the growth and development of anything and therefore criticize the Zionists who are building worth-while institutions in Palestine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0594.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>One such critic is Mr. A. Litvin, who wrote in the Socialist weekly, Die Neue Welt (The New World), an article entitled, "The Jewish-Arab Question in Palestine"; in this article he endeavors to prove that "Palestine will not solve the Jewish Question", and he advises the Jewish colonists in Palestine to lie low, not to tax their energies, not to demand too much of anything, and particularly not to awaken the downtrodden Arab.</p>
   <p>This is what Mr. Litvin says about this matter in his article: "The colonization in Palestine can succeed, more or less, if the Zionists discard the policy of building such villas as Tel Aviv for the bourgeoise and parasites, which cause the eyes of the Arabs to pop with envy. This will lead them to think that Jews are all millionaires and idlers. Instead of villas, various villages should be built in which the colonist could live off the sweat of his toil. Instead of high schools and polytechnical institutes that train opportunists, folk schools should be built where children of the colonists <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0595.jpg" n="6"/>could learn their father's trade." This is the sort of sound counsel that the "good friends" of the Zionists dish out. These "friends" of the Zionists advise the latter to become people without initiative, energy and activity just like the apathetic Arabs, and in this way solve the Jewish-Arab question in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Litvin's advice to the Zionists is similar to the advice offered by the Russian liberal anti-Semites who say that the Jews would be sensible if they educated themselves less; if they limited their development in the economic and cultural fields. This would be better for them because they would not arouse envy in the lazy and ignorant muzhiks.</p>
   <p>No, Mr. Litvin! The Jewish people are not passive; rather are they alert and effectual. Such villas as Tel Aviv, high schools and polytechnical institutes indicate this. We don't want to take an example from the laziness of the <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0596.jpg" n="7"/>Arab; the Arabs should take an example from us. On their wild steppes, they too ought to build beautiful villas like Tel Aviv. High schools and polytechnical institutes would also be beneficial.</p>
   <p>The Jews can no longer conceal their activities and energetic undertakings as they have before. The Jewish socialist, who seeks to achieve freedom, wants to see this subterfuge continue. Our Jewish socialists, however, are so badly hoodwinked that in their opposition to Zionism, they become virtual enemies of culture and progress.</p>
