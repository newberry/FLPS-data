   <p>Elias Greenebaum, founder of Greenebaum Sons Bank and Trust Company, who was one of the oldest Jewish residents in Chicago, died last night at his home, 4510 Grand Boulevard, at the age of ninety-seven.</p>
   <p>Born in Applesheim, Germany July 24, 1822, he came to America in 1847, and began his career as a peddler in the state of Ohio. Later he moved to Chicago and became a salesman in a dry goods store. Several years later, he and his brother-in-law, Gerhard Forman, opened a banking establishment. The business was dissolved in 1874, and Mr. Greenebaum, with his sons, opened the bank which later bore the name mentioned above.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum was a founder of the [Chicago] Sinai Congregation and to the last days of his life, was one of its most enthusiastic supporters. He held the office of president. He aided in the establishment of the United Hebrew Charities and later in the Associated (Jewish Charities). Everything pertaining <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1062.jpg" n="2"/>to the Jewish community in this city was of great interest to him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum leaves three sons, Moses, Henry, and James, and a daughter, Emma, Mrs. Nathan Gutman. His wife, the former Rosika Strauss, died several years ago.</p>
