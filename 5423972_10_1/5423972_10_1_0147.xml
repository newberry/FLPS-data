   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Allow me some space in your paper, to say something to the Zionists here. As is well known to every one, a separate Zionist Order exists here under the name, "Knights of Zion." I don't care to enter into a discussion whether or not this Order is entitled to exist as an independent organization. That already has been thrashed out. But what I want to ask them is: why they do so little for the Zionist movement? I heard that they meet occasionally in some synagogue, or run an affair once in a while, but is that doing enough for the Zionist ideal?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0148.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now, when the world is excited over the revolution going on in Turkey, can we find a better opportunity to do something for the Zionist movement? When the Order gives a convention, they do everything in their power to advertise it, to attract new members, but why are they silent after the convention?</p>
   <p>It is high time that they exert themselves, to put more vitality into their actions. I would be highly pleased, indeed, if my words would find a response in the hearts of the Zionists here, and would thus quicken their response.</p>
   <p>With greetings of Zion,</p>
   <p>David Michlitz.</p>
