<title level="a">NEEDLESS TO FEAR THE FOES OF IMMIGRATION</title>.
</bibl>

   <p>The foes of immigration are constantly complaining thatafter the war, immigration to the United States will greatly increase and we therefore must immediately strengthen the laws against immigration.</p>
   <p>Mr. M. J. Kohler, resents this statement, and says it is nonsense to restrict immigration when it limits itself automatically.</p>
   <p>The main current of immigration has always brought with it such human material as is now useful to the European war as cannon-fodder. One example is sufficient to prove that after the war immigration will greatly decrease. The majority of immigrants over 45 years of age, in 1913, decreased to 6 1/2 per cent. The medical examination in American ports is so strict that immigrants over 45 very seldom have the opportunity of being admitted. Besides, people of that age are, as a rule, not much in favor of immigrating to strange countries.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There has been a decrease in immigration of adults under 45 years of age, also, as well as of children coming with their parents. We must take into consideration the fact that to emigrate, requires a certain amount of money, courage and energy. Very poor people cannot set out for America. The trip from Europe at their own expense would amount to too large sums, and besides they must have a certain amount of cash to show before entering America. Not everyone is able to go through all the hardships and disturbance of coming to the United States, as many are weak, sick and discouraged, left poor by the war, and unable to raise the necessary expenses for a trip to America. This will hinder many from coming to the United States.</p>
   <p>Those in favor of limiting immigration laws answer this fact with the following argument: True, the war will weaken the European population, but many of the poor and discouraged, have wealthy relatives in America; <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0067.jpg" n="3"/>tickets, and money to show before entering America, will be sent to them, and immigration will continue as in the past and probably in greater degree.</p>
   <p>This argument would be strong as iron, were it true. However, the fact is this: the number of wealthy and courageous here in America is continually decreasing; the rich and courageous are those that came here during the years of prosperity, when possibilities of becoming rich were not as rare as in these times of depression.</p>
   <p>Out in the streets, are many workers and peddlers who are glad to earn enough for themselves and their children, without taking upon themselves the risk of bringing their distant relatives and countrymen from abroad, to cause them more suffering and grief.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0068.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>All over Europe it is already a known fact that the times of prosperity here in America, are past, and when conditions here change for the worse, that decreases immigration to a great extent. To prove this fact, after the panic, in the year of 1907, immigration decreased over a half million.</p>
   <p>Besides the former laws will not permit wounded or ailing immigrants, nor widows and orphans that may have to apply to charitable institutions for help. The immigration officials are so far away from the feeling of sympathy and mercy that they are sure to be too strict with the poor unfortunate war victims. There is great hope that the conditions of the oppressed nations in Europe will change for the better. If Poland will grant its Jews more freedom and equal rights, then immigration from there will automatically decrease.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0069.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The history of immigration in the United States shows that after the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, and after the Franco-German War, immigration greatly decreased. The present commissioner at Ellis Island was aware of that when he said: "The magnetic attraction of America for immigrants will greatly weaken when its opportunities are compared with those that can be found in their own countries."</p>
   <p>When the war is over, each country will endeavor to recover its losses, and give its citizens the best opportunities to remain in their own country.</p>
   <p>It can safely be said that the great powers that are now fighting will as soon as the war is over, make all efforts to give every citizen work in his own trade and seek to keep him there.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0070.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>But in spite of our sympathy for the sufferers, no one should influence us to admit such persons as are prohibited by the existing laws. However, it would be brutal, at the present time, to make further unnecessary limitations against desirable persons, who are trying to find a haven here in America, after suffering all these years as a result of the horrors of war.</p>
