<title level="a">THE NEW VIEW OF PALESTINE REVEALED IN LETTERS FROM THE HOLY LAND BY L. Z</title>.
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Until a few years ago, letters from Palestine were not welcome arrivals. Except for the correspondence between friends and relatives, Palestinian letters were for the most part full of descriptions of need and requests for charity. Lately we find a change of tone in most Palestinian mail. Of course we still receive some written in the old vein, but the number of letters revealing a new trend is so greatly increased that it cannot but indicate an altered situation in that country.</p>
   <p>The recent letters speak less of need, and more of expectancy and of new enterprises. Even when they call for money, it is no longer as charity, but as investments in sound undertakings which will develop the land and bring returns.</p>
   <p>Before me lies a pack of Palestinian letters from which I will choose <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0454.jpg" n="2"/>some characteristic ones that indicate the general trend.</p>
   <p>From Jaffa, a friend writes to Harry Goldman, the first movie magnate of Palestine, who has but recently sailed there with a cargo of American films.</p>
   <p>"As the land [becomes more productive], the people naturally turn to amusements. There is a great demand for good cinema. We have movies from England which come to us via Egypt; they do a good business. There is no doubt but that your venture with the American cinema here will be successful."</p>
   <p>Here is an interesting letter that our friend A. S. Roe, of Grossfield and Roe, received from Seymour Piser, a Jewish legionnaire from Chicago, who was employed in the firm of Grossfield and Roe before the War.</p>
   <p>"I write from Richovoth, the finest colony in Judea. I am keeping the Passover at Mr. Sachs' (our Chicago Sachs of the wholesale grocery on West 12th <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0455.jpg" n="3"/>Street). We had a fine feast. Prof. Boris Schatz and his wife were present, as well as Mr. Miller, Sachs' son-in-law, one of the finest people I have ever met.</p>
   <p>"Regarding Palestine proper, I can say that so far as I can see, within the next five years it will surpass the state of California in beauty. It is not only a land of milk and honey, but of everything good. It lacks only cultivation. If Jews will not accept this task, others will.</p>
   <p>"Jews are coming here from all over the world. We have the possibility of a crisis [if the shortage of jobs continues]. But Jews continue to come, without thought of the future. Warnings are of no avail. 'It is our land,' they say, 'and nothing can stop us.' Our leaders must create jobs and stop land speculation. The Zionist organization is making a mistake in sending here titled aristocrats and scholars. What we need are American democratic businessmen. [There is business here which] the Palestine Committee could take possession of even before particulars of the 'Paris Peace' become known.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0456.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Regarding business prospects, I can say that anyone coming here to establish a business will certainly prosper. By the way, do you know perhaps a Jewish company which would come here to establish a first-class hotel in Tel-Aviv, near Jaffa, which may soon become a second Broadway? Would you care to buy land in Tel-Aviv or Richovoth? Let me know. [It would be] a fine investment."</p>
   <p>Mr. Robert Szold, who was formerly attorney general of Porto Rico, is now in Palestine, a member of the Palestine Committee sent by Justice Brandeis. In a letter to the undersigned dated May 1, he writes:</p>
   <p>"I have undertaken, together with Mr. Levi-Epstein, to negotiate with Mr. Saltzman and Mr. I. L. Goldberg for a merger of their proposed Crith Safer, a Bible-publishing company, to publish Bibles with your venture, the Beth Difoos Yurisholiem, (Palestine Printing House). The merger will take place shortly. We will notify you soon of the terms. The Crith Safer cannot get money from Russia now, but it is certain that it will receive financial aid from Russian Jewry. Such a merger is necessary because America is able to <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0457.jpg" n="5"/>support a modern printing establishment while Russian Jewry will supply the work and scholars necessary for a Hebrew Publishing House."</p>
   <p>In the same vein write Mr. Levi-Epstein, Dr. Harry Friedenwald, Mr. L. Saltzman and Prof. Boris Schatz, all from Palestine.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Bernstein, another legionnaire from America, writes a letter in which he describes in an interesting fashion conditions in Palestine.</p>
   <p>"The wounds of the War are still open, but we can see them beginning to heal.</p>
   <p>"Two great tasks now lie before the Jewish people; the emigration of constructive elements, and support for their labor. We have work 'galore.' It is no small task to build a country. Jews with money must come to undertake this work. [It will undoubtedly] pay them to do so.</p>
   <p>"We hear of a plan which originated in America for a Beth DiFoos Yurisholiem.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0458.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>You have no idea how interested the people are in it. The hunger for books is felt not only in Russia but also in Palestine, and Jews, hearing of the plan, pray to God that the Beth DiFoos Yurisholiem will soon be built.</p>
   <p>"I do not know when I will be discharged, but I do know one thing--I remain in Palestine."</p>
