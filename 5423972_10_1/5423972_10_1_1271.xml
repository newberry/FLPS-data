   <p>Hon. B. Hurvitz is back home from his travels abroad. Mr. Hurvitz returned Friday, from his 90 days travel all through Europe, with Mr. I. Goodman, a son of the well known Chicago Real Estate dealer, Mr. Max Goodman. Aside from Mr. Hurvitz's business affairs on his European trip, he spent much of his time in looking after the passport question between America and Russia. On several occasions, he addressed the conference in Basel Switzerland. He conferred with the Jewish delegates from Russia in order to find out what effect it would have on the Jews in Russia. Mr. Hurvitz stated that it is the opinion of the Jews in Russia that all will agree to a reprimand to Russia from the United States or other countries.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. Hurvitz informed the Jews of Chicago, that our Jewish brethren in Russia have nothing to lose by America's breaking with Russia, through abrogating their treaty. That seems to be the general feeling of the Jews in Russia.</p>
