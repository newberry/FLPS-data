   <p>Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, one of the outstanding figures in Chicago Jewish communities, died on Saturday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenblatt was born in Frank-Nemelhoff, Baltic Province, April 7, 1868. At the age of 17, he left for the United States. In 1905, he came to Chicago, where he established the printing firm of Rosenblatt &amp; Fine. After several years, he entered the insurance business, becoming manager of the Chicago territory for the State Life Insurance Company of Indiana, in which position he has become known as one of the greatest writers of insurance in the entire country.</p>
   <p>In the establishment and development of the Maimodides Hospital, he was a vital factor, serving as its first vice president and later as acting president. He served as a member of the Small Parks Commission from 1911 to 1916. He was also a director and officer of the Marks Nathan Jewish Orphan Home; and he has been a director of the Jewish Charities of Chicago.</p>
