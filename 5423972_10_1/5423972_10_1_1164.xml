   <p>Thursday evening, Dr. Adolf Decker died after a long illness. He was born December 6, 1858, in Kirchheimbolanden in the Rhine Palatinate, studied medicine at the universities of Wurzburg and Erlangen, and came to Chicago in 1889 where he has since practiced medicine. Dr. Decker made a name for himself as a chess player, especially as an author on chess problems. He also edited, for a few years, the chess column of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. Also in German social circles Dr. Decker played a prominent part. He was president of the German Medical Society and was also a beloved member of the Schlaroffia Chicagoana, in which he shone through his poetical offerings. Even while he resided in Germany, a volume of his poems was published and met with general acclaim. Dr. Decker is survived by his widow, Mrs. Melame Decker, nee Stein, with whom he had lived happily for 25 years.</p>
