   <p>Raphael Guthmann died on October 26, at the age of 73. He was prominent in the business affairs of early Chicago. Born in Germany, he came here in 1852. He was appointed to the staff of teachers of the first high school established in the city and was instructor in German,French, and Latin for five years. Meanwhile he had opened a private English night school for his German fellow-citizens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Guthmann later formed a partnership with Henry Greenebaum in the abstracting business. He sold his interest in this firm and was next associated with Leopold Mayer in the banking business.</p>
   <p>He was one of the founders of Sinai Congregation and helped to frame its advanced reform constitution.</p>
