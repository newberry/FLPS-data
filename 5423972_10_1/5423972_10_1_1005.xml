   <p>It is true that death is democratic. Everybody is equal before it. Everything democratic, it seems, is honorable, but, just the same, it is not particularly honorable to die. It seems to me that it is a shame to die. One has lived, worked, fought, created, had ambitions, dreamed, and suddenly--nothing! Death! When one dies, one is dead forever.</p>
   <p>I do not know whether you all knew him personally. Many of you knew him personally and spoke to him just a few days ago. He was young, handsome, a lover of life, ambitious, active, amiable, idealistic, a young tree, and suddenly--he is gone. Sol Pozner is dead. A sudden storm has uprooted a young tree. Is it worth while to be ambitious?</p>
   <p>Sol Pozner was a Jewish journalist and a Jewish journalist is, as you should <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1006.jpg" n="2"/>know, not a Gentile journalist. A Jewish journalist is not only a man who writes the history of yesterday but a man who helps to make the history about which he writes. The attitude of a Jewish journalist toward the subject he is writing about is intimate, personal, and emotional.</p>
   <p>Sol Pozner was not satisfied with a dry report of the Jewish labor movement. He lived and breathed the labor movement. He was passionately interested in every phase of the labor movement. He helped it, fought for it, suffered with it. This helping, fighting, and suffering affected his health. He worked until his strength gave out and then--one stormy wind and the young tree was uprooted.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish worker in Chicago should lament the death of Sol Pozner, because he was a true friend of every Jewish worker. Sol Pozner was sad, worried, and sometimes melancholy during a period of Jewish unemployment in Chicago. Once he came to me and said: "It cannot go on like this. Hundreds of Jewish workers' families in Chicago are hungry. Something must be done for them. Come with <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1007.jpg" n="3"/>me". He took me to a place on the West Side where about a hundred and twenty unemployed Jews had gathered. Their faces revealed the fact that they were hungry. When they saw Pozner, they surrounded him as if he were their savior. He listened to the hard-luck stories some of the workers told him and promised them that he would do something. He kept his word.</p>
   <p>When we were on our way back to the editorial office, he asked me: "Have you got carfare? I haven't a cent". I understood at once what had happened. It was Monday--payday. He went to the hungry workers with his salary in his pocket--and left them without a cent. Only a Jewish journalist could do this--particularly a Sol Pozner. He was a man with a beautiful soul. And now--nothing.</p>
   <p>Sol Pozner is gone. His associates in the editorial office who had loved him like a brother, weep and lament his death, together with his family. The Jewish workers of Chicago have every reason to lament his death. The Jewish workers do not have many such devoted and true friends as Pozner. Honored be his memory!</p>
