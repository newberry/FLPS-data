<title level="a">ADOLPH MOSES IS DEAD - CHICAGO LAWYER STRICKEN</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Adolph Moses, one of the oldest and foremost lawyers of the Chicago bar, while engaged in the paternal mission of ministering to his sick son, Paul A., at Ashville, North Carolina, was stricken with paralysis, and after a few days of suffering died yesterday in the presence of his wife and children. The news of his death, received in Chicago yesterday, was a shock to all who knew the lawyer.</p>
   <p>Mrs.Moses, the sons, Joseph W. and Paul A. and the daughter, Irma; were present and will accompany the body from Ashville to this city. The funeral services will be conducted in the Sinai Temple, of which Mr. Moses was a prominent member.</p>
   <p>Adolph Moses was a native of Germany, where he was born in Speyer, capital of Palatinati, Feb. 27, 1837. There he received his early education in the public and Latin schools, preparatory to the study of law, which profession was his own choice.</p>
   <p>On account of the disabilities surrounding the people of the Hebrew race in that country, he came to the United States, arriving at New Orleans, December 1852. Upon his arrival here he resumed his studies and completed his collegiate education at Louisiana University. His legal education was conducted under Randal Hunt, Christian Roselius, Judge McCaleb and other lawyers of Louisiana, who were then <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1361.jpg" n="2"/>famous members of the American bar. In 1861 he was admitted to the bar of Louisiana.</p>
   <p>The secession of Louisiana soon after found him, like many other student in like circumstances, imbued with sentiments common to all classes of people in that state. When the twenty-first Louisiana regiment was raised he was appointed one of its officers and served as captain for nearly two years.</p>
   <p>At the close of the war he moved to Quincy, Illinois. In 1869 he came to Chicago, and from that time his career was one of continued success. In comparatively a few years he gained national repute as a lawyer. His briefs and arguments, contained in the reports of the Appellate and Supreme Courts of Illinois, as well as the federal courts, are numerous and indicate the extent and variety of practice.</p>
   <p>In 1879 he received the Democratic nomination for judge of the Superior Court. Later and while in Europe he was tendered a judicial nomination, but declined, and he was prominently mentioned for the federal bench. He was independent in his convictions, as shown by his support of General Grant in 1868 and his advocacy of the leading measures of the Republican Party in 1896.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1362.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Moses was married in 1869 in Chicago to Matilda Wolf of Manheim, Germany. He is survived by his widow and six children, Joseph W., Julius Hamilton, Paul A., Mrs. J. W. Moses of New Orleans and Mrs. Moritz Rosenthal.</p>
   <p>He was a member of the American, Chicago, and State Bar Associations, and in 1897 was president of the latter. A member of the Chicago Bar Association he was much interested in maintaining the dignity of his profession and was instrumental in prosecuting irregular members of the bar before the supreme court. He appeared in some of the most important and interesting cases in the history of the state, notably in the anti-gas trust case, in which he fought the organization of the gas companies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Moses was interested in various charitable movements and did much to advance music and art. The Beethoven society found him an ardent promoter and participant in its affairs. He was a member of several political and social clubs.</p>
