   <p>Congressman Barnett, who introduced the new immigration bill intended to place further restrictions on immigration, declared in an interview with a reporter of a Jewish newspaper, that the provisions of his bill are not aimed at the Jews. By this literacy test, he expects to reduce immigration from Southern Italy, where illiteracy is high and the people are very vulgar and come here only to make money and then return with the accumulated American dollars to their homeland.</p>
   <p>He also stated that we can easily see in this bill how highly he respects the Jews and Germans, who are, according to his opinion, welcome as the best immigrants. He proclaims to know definitely that the Jews will not return to the country from which they came; that they become American citizens and useful people. He firmly believes that the Jews have nothing to lose if the President signs this bill, because, - he contends, - Jews can write Yiddish or Hebrew.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even if what Barnett has said were true; even if among Jews, as he contends, there are none who can neither read or write a language; even if he were justified in his appraisal of Southern Italians, we would still oppose the Barnett Bill. For, as immigrants, we know full well what it means to leave one's home, wife, and children, even for a short period, and to go off to another land where life must begin anew. Not because the poor Italian wants to become rich does he leave his country, but because he wants to live, to support his wife and children by the toil of his own labor. And should he return home after being here a short time, he worked hard enough for his money so that he might eke out an existence in his homeland.</p>
   <p>Truthfully speaking, however, we Jews have a greater percentage of people who are unable to read or write, even Yiddish or Hebrew, than what Mr. Barnett thinks. The bill was neither devised after a long and scrupulous observation, nor from the standpoint, as Barnett expressed himself, that it will not harm Jews. Apart from the literacy test, the bill contains many clauses which are very detrimental to the Jewish immigrant, because no other <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0076.jpg" n="3"/>immigrant suffers from political and certain other types of persecution as does the Jew. Should the Russian government deliberately want to accuse a Jew who intends to leave the country of being immoral and having no respect for private property, he will be earmarked as "undesirable" and will not be permitted to enter this country.</p>
   <p>It is possible that Mr. Barnett, personally, is very friendly toward the Jews. He, however, understands Jewish life as an outsider, as one who comes in contact only with learned and wealthy Jews, and thereby judges the whole race by them. But we, who have a profound knowledge of Jewish life internally, know that we must oppose every restriction on immigration.</p>
