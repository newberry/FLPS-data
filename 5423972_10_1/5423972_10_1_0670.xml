   <p>Yesterday's Courier gave the decision of the Quebec Supreme Court, that individual Jews may not bring before the courts a suit concerning an insult directed against the entire Jewish religion. It is understood, that the Canadian Jews will carry the case to the highest courts of that country. For us though it is important to know, that as long as Jews are not organized it will be impossible to bring suit against insultors or have them bring proof of their accusations into court, which, of course, they do not have nor can they be forced to apologize to the Jewish people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0671.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A Jewish organization will not only serve the purpose of being armed against an enemy, but will also serve to look after internal interests. We have all seen the huge success gained through organization in which matters have been settled for Jews in one city, and that, pertaining to just a small group of them. We believe the Orthodox Jewish Federation of Chicago sponsors such aims, and as proof we have its tremendous success. It has done away with the bickering and quarrelings of the various institutions. It conserved the energy of those forces that were forever trying to secure more money for itself regardless of the next institution, and thus brought about peace for everyone. So when all the promised subscriptions are paid, the Federation will then certainly be able to stride forward progressively with her program.</p>
   <p>When we stop to consider how all Jewish institutions, thanks to the organization, have assumed new life and form, then it is simple to look ahead and picture the power of strength that can be exerted for each Jewish <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0672.jpg" n="3"/>occurrence; if every single Jew were organized, prepared to defend and protect the Jewish name, not merely permit the culprit to give excuses for grave accusations, but also to demand that justice be done to all who thus accuse us.</p>
   <p>Many Jews are in fear of organization. They are accustomed to worrying individually, every one for himself. The orthodox are not too friendly with the reformed and vice versa.</p>
   <p>Both sides should understand that this is not a mere get-together for financial purposes or religious rituals, nor simply a get-together of both factions. We aim for those interests that makes every Jew a brother, a common bond that unites us all regardless of the various groups to which we belong.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0673.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>All indications point clearly to the fact, that we are moving in the direction of just such a Jewish organization. The air seems to be filled with ideas of unity and federations. We need but one step forward to express in action all our thoughts and feelings that unite us, without exception to the poor Jewish bricklayer, who represents the entire Jewish nation in Russia's blood accusation.</p>
   <p>Such a Jewish organization must certainly be founded if we do not want those anti-Semites of Quebec and the verdict of their Suppreme Court to remain as an example to other cities in which Jews live.</p>
