   <p>Mr. Leon Klein, well-known business man, founder and owner of the large department store at Halsted and 14th Street, died yesterday afternoon in his home, 4401 Grand Blvd.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klein, sixty-eight, was born in Kopetzen, Germany and migrated to America in 1846 at the age of nineteen. His first job was working for his uncle at So. Clark Street. Four years later he opened his own store at 520 So. Halsted Street, and two years later, he increased the volume of his business and opened a store at 14th and Halsted Streets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_1249.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He met with great success there and the store was turned into one of the largest department stores of the city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klein was a subscriber to the Associated Jewish Charities at $1,000 a year and more recently he subscribed to the Orthodox Jewish Charities at $500 a year.</p>
