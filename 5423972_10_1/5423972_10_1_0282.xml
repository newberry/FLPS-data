   <p>Whenever the Zionist leaders appeal to the Jewish people for help to upbuild our land, we hear Arab voices, not in Palestine, but only in the countries of Diaspora. These voices are heard in the two camps of the enemies of Zion--in the camp of the assimilators and in the camp of the yellow Socialists of the Yiddish-speaking tribe. Both are very much concerned over the well-being of the Jews in the pogrom-stricken countries. They care little what will happen to the Jews in Poland, Ukrania, and Russia. On the contrary, they are very much interested in the fate of the unfortunate Arabs and deeply "regret" that Arabs must be oppressed by Jews. The Arab instigators in Palestine are not lying when they assert that they not only have the sympathy of Christians but also the sympathy of Jews on their part. Unfortunately, there are plenty of Jews who shed crocodile tears over the Arabs, because they can present no other arguments against the idea of a Jewish Palestine. In the past, they used <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0283.jpg" n="2"/>to advance "important" arguments. A Jewish Palestine is a dream; a Jewish Palestine will never get the approval of the great powers, and so forth. Today these arguments cannot be presented, and the only thing the enemies of Zion can now say against our work in Palestine is that a Jewish Palestine is against the interests of the Arabs, as if the Arabs would ask these Yehudim and yellow socialists to take up the cudgels for them.</p>
   <p>If Zionism were against the interests of the Arabs, neither England nor the League of Nations would approve of Zionism. There are twenty million Arabs and they are all under the protection and influence of the English. Why should England sacrifice the friendship of twenty million Arabs, who might play a great role in any oriental war, in order to please a portion of the Jewish people, who, as a people, can never play an important role in time of war? Why should France and Italy be hostile to the Arabs, only in order to please the Jews, for whom they certainly have no great love? If the powers would in the least doubt the fact that the Arabs will not profit from Zionism, they would certainly not approve of Zionism because they have no reason whatever to be <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0284.jpg" n="3"/>hostile to the Arabs and do them harm. If a power like England, which receives so much political and military support from the Arabs, is not worried over the Jewish oppression of Arabs, why should our enemies of Zion want to be Popelier than the Pope and more philo-Arab than the English.</p>
   <p>The truth is that enemies of Zion are as little concerned about the Arabs as they are about the Jews, but they are enemies of Zion and every hypocritical argument is good enough for them, if only it can harm Zionism.</p>
   <p>We are not in the least worried over the relationship between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. We believe that the Arabs, regardless of how illiterate they may be, will sooner or later recognize the advantage of the Jews [living in Palestine]. The living standard of the Arabs must become higher and the Arabs will understand that to work for a Jewish colonist and receive five shillings a day is better than to work for an effendi and receive one shilling a day. The Arabs love money no less than any other group of people, and seeing that the realization of Zionism means more money to them, they will, in due time, <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0285.jpg" n="4"/>not only give up all opposition to Zionism, but they themselves will be materially interested in helping the movement. Then there will certainly arise a common economic interest, which will unite the Arabs with the Jews. Hence, we need not fear the Arabs in Palestine. On the contrary, there are many reasons to fear our own Arabs, who today are deadlier enemies of Zionism than the Arabs in Palestine. Our own Arabs are intriguing against Zionism; our Arabs are condemning the Jewish work in Palestine; our own Arabs are trying to spread hatred between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine, and our own Arabs are dissuading many Jews from fulfilling their duty to the Jewish people and to the Jewish land. The hostile propaganda of our own Arabs is much worse than the hostile propaganda of the Arabs in Palestine.</p>
   <p>The great question confronting Zionism now is how to render the hostile propaganda of our own Arabs ineffective, because this propaganda does us much harm, both materially and politically. The anti-Semites and Christian anti-Zionists in every country refer to "Jewish" leaders and thereby create a very unpleasant situation for us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_10_1_0286.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We believe that our Arabs will, sooner or later, force us to erect a partition between them and the Jewish people and the erection of this partition will consist in that our leaders will have to ask every Jew: On which side of the fence are you?</p>
