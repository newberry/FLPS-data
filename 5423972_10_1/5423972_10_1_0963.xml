   <p>Dora Robin passed away on February 24. Mrs. Robin organized the Woman's Loan Association with Miss Low in 1896. She acted as president and chairman of the Loan Committee until 1918. The organization started with $87, and now has a circulating capital of $10,000.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Robin also founded, with the assistance of Dr. Theo Sachs, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society in 1904, and served as president for ten years. She then started a campaign to build the Winfield Sanitarium with the Baron Hirsch Woman's Club and the Willing Workers. When the Associated Jewish Charities took over the work, she commenced laying plans for the Advanced Home for Consumptives. Later, she officiated at the laying of the corner-stone as the mother of the movement. This was the first organization to begin preventive work by an educational campaign in Jewish homes.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Robin was one of the originators of the Auxiliary to the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society in 1910, with ten members. The combined organizations now total over 1,000 members. She was also on the Board of the Associated and Orthodox Federated Charities.</p>
