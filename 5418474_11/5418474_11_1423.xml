<title level="a">DEATH OF WM. A. HETTICH Turner Pioneer Dead After Short Illness</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner society) laments the death of its oldest member and is joined in its mourning by a large number of Chicago German-Americans, since one of their most faithful and best representatives has passed away. Wm. A. Hettich died yesterday in his apartment at 63 West Schiller Street at the age of eighty-three. Only a week ago he was in good health, but a cold which was followed by pneumonia proved too much for the resistance of the old man who otherwise was in good condition, in spite of his age. The news will be received with great sorrow in the city, for Mr. Hettich had a large circle of friends and was well liked by everybody. Beside the Turners, the Schwaben Verein, the German Society, and the German Home for the Aged will also be hard hit by his death.</p>
   <p>Hettich....emigrated from Germany to America at the age of seventeen and first settled in New York City, where he joined the Turnverein. A year later, in <pb facs="5418474_11_1424.jpg" n="2"/>1853, he came to Chicago and became a member of the recently founded Turngemeinde. He was a member for fifty-five years, and stood by it during good and bad times. Until a few years ago one could find him on the exercise grounds (Turnplatz), where he excelled in his performances. His excellent health, which he enjoyed even in his old age, his good complexion, and straight posture furnished the best proof of the healthful influence which these exercises (turnen) have on the human body. In later years he transferred to the Pioneer Section, of which he was chairman for a long time.</p>
   <p>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and President Lincoln issued his famous proclamation, he was one of the first to volunteer. He joined the Turner Regiment, the Seventeenth Missouri, but after a few weeks suffered a fractured leg which caused him to quit the service. Enthusiastic about the justice of the Union's cause, it was with reluctance that he left the army. In later years he told with pride of his voting for President Lincoln in 1860 as well as in 1864.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1425.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>His greatest interest was in the German Society, which was founded in order to assist German immigrants who underwent much suffering because of the unsettled conditions which prevailed at that time. Hettich stood by them with all he had. That the results were gratifying will be testified by many an old settler from his own experience.</p>
   <p>When, at the beginning of the eighties, another welfare organization was established, the German Home for the Aged, Hettich was one of the first to devote his whole energy to the good cause. In appreciation of his services, he was elected to the board of directors, of which he remained a member until his death. With a few exceptions, he was present at all meetings.</p>
   <p>As a member of the Turngemeinde he advocated the introduction of festivals and picnics for the old settlers, and later took part in each one of them, usually as a member of the reception committee, to which he belonged this year, also.</p>
