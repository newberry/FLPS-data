   <p>Ernest G. Kusswurm, well-known attorney in local German circles, and former first speaker of the Chicago Turner Society, was released by death from a severe illness, in the Alexian Brothers Hospital.</p>
   <p>Ten days ago Mr. Kusswurm had to undergo a serious operation. He was the son-in-law of Adolph Georg whose daughter was his first wife. Mr. Kusswurm, who had reached an age of 58 years, was born in Hanan near Frankfurt in 1868, came to America as a young man, and opened a dry goods store in Peoria, Illinois, before moving to Chicago to study law. For 20 years he was associated with the well-known lawyer, Michael F. Girten.</p>

   <p>Kusswurm, who took an active part in German societies was, before the war, secretary of the German-American National Union. He was also a serious member of the Chicago Turngemeinde, which he served for several years as first speaker.</p>
   <p>He was for several years the president of the German Society of Chicago, and was, during and after the war, very active in the assistance of the sufferers in Germany and German-Austria.</p>
