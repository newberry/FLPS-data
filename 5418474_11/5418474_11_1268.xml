  <body>
   <p>The funeral services for the German restaurant owner, "Honest John Kuntz," who died of pneumonia at the age of 69 years, will take place Tuesday a fternoon from the Presbyterian church in Arlington Heights, under the guide of the Free Masons.</p>
   <p>"Honest John" was well known by German-Americans at the time when he was the manager of the famous Kuntz-Remmler restaurants on South Wabash Avenue. But Americans of other nationalities were also among his constant visitors, not only because they got the most for their money in tasty food, but also because Kuntz was always a true and helpful friend to those who openly and honestly approached him.</p>
   <p>He quit the restaurant business in 1920 and founded the Kuntz Realty Company in Arlington Heights, whose chief he remained until his death. A few months ago he fell ill but nevertheless attended to his business, until a few days ago a severe attack of pneumonia forced him to take to his bed, from which he did not rise again.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1269.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Surviving are his widow, a daughter, Mrs. George Chendron, a brother, and two sisters.</p>
