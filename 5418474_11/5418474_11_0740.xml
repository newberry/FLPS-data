   <p>To the many marks of honor so far received by the Atlantic fliers must be added the gift which was presented to them by Consul Michael F. Girten, president of the Germania Club. He gave to them the bronze busts of Baron Hunefeld and Captain Koehl.</p>
   <p>At the small festivity, the creator of this work of art, the artist Wilhelm F. Engelmann from Berlin was also present. The fliers accepted the gifts with thanks and decided that the busts should remain at present in the German Consul General's keeping. From there they will be sent to Germany and handed over to the Mayor of Bremen. As soon as the fliers return to Germany, the busts are to be delivered to them.</p>
   <p>Copies of the busts go to the Natural Historical Society, and will be placed in the museum. The bust of Major Fitzmaurice was not yet finished, but will be presented to him tomorrow, and then sent to his regiment in Ireland.</p>
