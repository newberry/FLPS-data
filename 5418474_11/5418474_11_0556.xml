   <p>The immigration statistics of last year show a decrease from Germany, Sweden, Norway, England, and Ireland, but a surprisingly stronger influx from Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, Russia, Italy and France. Considering the dissension which the American Press raises about these people, especially the "Huns", it will be of interest to quote from the New York Sun. At present about 1,000 people arrive daily at "Castle Garden", a large part stays in New York and it does not effect us much, in population business, and public order. Simultaneously with the immigration statistics the report of the New York Police Department is available to give elucidation. Many of the facts therein listed, prove, that the assertion: "The emigrants are an undesirable, maliciously inclined lot," is entirely fallacious. As far as "Actual breakigg of laws" is concerned, the evidence points to the contrary. 20 years ago, New York's population consisted of 940,000 with 72,984 arrests. At present we have 1,700,000 people and annual arrests of 80,000. Evidently, this augers well for New York's 20 year period of immigration. No one can accuse the police of showing greater laxness to-day, than formerly,nor that they give especial consideration <pb facs="5418474_11_0557.jpg" n="2"/>to these foreigners.</p>
   <p>Most of the legal transgressions are within the brackets of City Ordinances, which are unknown to the new arrivals. Lack of ample funds also prevents circumvention of the law, as far as this class is concerned.</p>
