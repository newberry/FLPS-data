   <p>The German element of Chicago, through the death of Fred Bergmann,was deprived of a man who was always ready to protect the interests of Germans. He died in his home at Los Gatos, Cal, at the age of 71 years. He will be buried in Chicago, the city in which he spent the greater part of his life, and where he has done so much good. His family and thousands of his friends are still living here.</p>
   <p>Born on February 22nd, 1857, in Punkewitz, Thuringia, Bergmann came to America at the beginning of the eighties, stayed a short time in St. Louis and then moved to Chicago, where he settled permanently. He spent his declining years mostly in his home in Los Gatos, Cal.</p>
   <p>A cooper by profession, he worked hard the first few years, took an active part in the great labor movements in the eighties and was, for a long time, considered the spiritual leader of the local working class. Thanks to his extraordinary abilities, he was offered a position by a large wine concern.</p>
   <p>There he worked himself up to the position of buyer for the firm, a place which he filled for many years. As a buyer he made several business trips <pb facs="5418474_11_1277.jpg" n="2"/>to Germany. Later he founded his own firm. Bergmann took an active part in the development of the United Singers to whose committee he belonged.</p>
