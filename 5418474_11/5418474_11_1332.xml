  <body>
   <p>On account of his unwearying endeavors in the interest of the German element at the beginning of the World War, and his services rendered in alleviating the terrible suffering in Germany after the Armistice and the conclusion of peace, A. C. Wehreheim, prominent German-American of Chicago and president of the Choral Society of the North West, through the Society of Germans in Foreign Countries, has had conferred upon him the great badge of honor of the German Children's Aid.</p>
   <p>The honorary document is artistically executed and has the following wording: "To the promotor of the German cause, Mr. A. C. Wehrheim, the great badge of honor is conferred in deepest appreciation."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1333.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In singers' circles, attention is called to Mr. Wehrheim's active and charitable work for people of the ceded territories, and especially to the bazaar at "White City," which was given for the benefit of German children.</p>
   <p>On the same day, Mr. Wehrheim received information that Chicago also appreciates his merits, and his skill as architect.</p>
   <p>The mayor, W. C. Dever, appointed him as a member of the Chicago Planning Commission . The Mayor of Chicago expects Mr. Wehrheim to participate actively in the deliberations of the commission in regard to the beautifying of the city, a task which Charles Wacker also made an object of his life work.</p>
