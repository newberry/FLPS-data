  <body>
   <p>In his home at 178 Seminary Avenue died today after a long illness of stomach cancer the well-known newspaperman, John Ehlert.</p>
   <p>John Ehlert came from an old Prussian officers' family. He was born 58 years ago in Luebeck as the 11th of 17 children and received a very good school education. After his graduation he went to Berlin where he took up journalism. In the year 1873 he emigrated to the United States and soon came to Chicago where he, with the exception of a few years in Milwaukee worked steadily with the press.</p>
   <p>He transferred more than 20 years ago to the English Press and had the reputation of being the cleverest reporter of Chicago. For about 15 years he made the Real Estate Market his speciality. He was "Real Estate Editor" for the Times Herald and Inter-Ocean until his illness made it impossible for him. Besides he was also contributor to other papers, chiefly the "Beet Sugar Gazette."</p>
