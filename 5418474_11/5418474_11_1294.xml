<title level="a">GEO. VON MASSOW CELEBRATES HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY TO-DAY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>George von Massow, who is well-known in wide circles of the German element of Chicago, and to all those who know him more intimately is the highly respected Nestor of the German-American journalists, celebrates his Eightieth birthday today.</p>
   <p>His mental and physical alertness are remarkable for a man of his age.</p>
   <p>George von Massow was born on the estate of his father, in Danzig, Germany in 1848. His father was a chamberlain and first lieutenant. As his father had participated in the wars for liberty in 1813, he was brought up in a military atmosphere.</p>
   <p>George, the youngest son of the chamberlain, attended the gymnasium in the old Lutheran city of Wittenberg, and in Berlin. After a successful final examination, he enlisted in the army, and fought <pb facs="5418474_11_1295.jpg" n="2"/>against Austria in 1866. After the conclusion of the war, he remained as an active officer in the Army and participated in the German-French war of 1870-71. In this War, he won the second class Iron Cross. Several years later, he left the army.</p>
   <p>In 1874, he emigrated to America and devoted himself to a journalistic career. For thirty years he was on the editorial staff of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and later, he joined the Abendpost. His devotion always belonged to the old soldiers, for whom he took an especial care in a most loyal manner.</p>
   <p>Affairs organized for the benefit of his old war comrades had his special attention. Just as much was he devoted to the welfare of the inmates of the German Old Peoples' Home.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1296.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A year after his arrival in America, he married Minna von Arx, a Swiss, who still is at his side. Mrs von Massow, and the four sons, George, Robert, Albert, and Roderich, and a sister in Germany, are his nearest relatives.</p>
   <p>Today, his numerous friends wish him a happy birthday and many more years of happiness and good health.</p>
