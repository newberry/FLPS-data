   <p>On Wednesday evening September 11, the German Young Men's Club gave its first entertainment at Library Hall, at the corner of Randolph and La Salle Streets.</p>
   <p>By 8 P. M. several hundred people, men and women, young men and young ladies, assembled in the hall, in compliance with requests made from the pulpits of various Protestant churches and personal invitations extended by members of the Club.</p>
   <p>The German Young Men's Club was organized May 9, 1866, by five students of a local American business college. The thirty-five members of the Club were born in this country,and work as clerks, bookkeepers, etc., for American firms. They are anxious to retain a knowledge of the German language.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0251.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Club meets every Saturday evening in the social room of the Sixth Methodist Church. The meetings are conducted in the German language, and the programs, which consist of debates, readings, declamations, discussions of political issues, etc., are also all German.</p>
   <p>The Protestant pastors recommend the Club to the youths of their congregations in an effort to counteract the evil influences which lure many young men away from the Christian Church.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this entertainment will be used to establish a library for the German Young Men's Club.</p>
