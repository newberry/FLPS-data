   <p>To the art-loving public of Chicago it will be of interest to learn, that the highly thought of artist of Aquarelle paintings, Mr. Peter Woltze, opened a course of watercolor painting and sketched of nature in the "Columbian Trade and Business School", 239-241 Wabash Avenue. The son of the famous painter, Berthold Woltze, professor of the School of arts in Weimar (Germany), Mr. Woltze received his first instructions there, and later visited the academies in Karlsruhe and Munich, after which he studied for three years in Italy. In Venice, Mr. Woltze was favored by becoming a special pupil of the world-famous Aquarelle painter, Louis Passini. His local works, of which "Pictures of Negro Life in the South," and those World's exposition pictures shown in the Bancroft Publications, have found the largest circulation, are greatly in demand among American art-connoisseurs.</p>
   <p>For weeks already, Mr. Woltze has been busily engaged, with a large <pb facs="5418474_11_1668.jpg" n="2"/>class of ladies, in the various parks of our city, to make sketches of nature, at which task, teacher as well as pupils are displaying great ardour. Next fall, beginning September 7th, some more special courses are planned: Decorative paintings of furniture and draperies, architectual-perspectives in water color, industrial drawings and paintings for decorators, furniture manufacturers, artistic locksmiths, gold and silver smiths, wood-stained pictures, and articles in groups, depending on the selection of the pupil for her particular occupation.</p>
   <p>Further information will be gladly furnished by the manager of the above named institution, Mr. Joseph Silvers.</p>
