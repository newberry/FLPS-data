   <p>The proprietor of a paint and decoration store, Peter Schneider, well known in German circles, died at the age of 63 years in his home, 5417 Newcastle Avenue. With his death an outstanding personality of the German element passed away.</p>
   <p>Coming to Chicago in 1885 from Bonn on the Rhine, where he was born, he accumulated considerable wealth through his industry and perserverance. He was a man who let nobody who came to him for advice or help go away without assistance. As co-founder and member for many years of the Mutual Friendly Societies, 10th Section, he played a leading role.</p>
   <p>Above all, he possessed the exquisite gift so frequent in his countrymen, of a pronounced Rhenish humor. He was, in spite of his long residence in America, a German through and through and he was constantly drawn back to his old home town, the beautiful Bonn. He again planned to go there on a visit this year in connection with the Turner festival in Cologne.</p>
   <p>But inexorable death overtook the vigorous man after a short sickness. He is survived by his widow, seven children, three brothers and five sisters, one of <pb facs="5418474_11_1267.jpg" n="2"/>whom lives in Germany.</p>
