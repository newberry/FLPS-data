   <p>Editorial:- Governor Altgeld does not seem to lay much stress on the currency question, because he disposed of it, in about ten sentences, during a three hour speech in New York. These culminated in the assertion, that the world, since the devaluation of silver, therefore during the time which witnessed the gigantic upward swing of Germany and the United States, has not made any progress at all...It seems therefore, that Mr. Altgeld never visited the Exposition in Chicago because otherwise he would have noticed the progress made in the electricity building during the last two decades, which put the achievements of several centuries in the shade. In the machinery hall, in the communication building, yes even in the agricultural palace, he could have seen a thousand things, of which the previous generation had no conception. The wonderful discoveries, which were made in the purely scientific domain, since 1873...even in recent years, for instance the Bering serum and Roentgen beams..should not be unknown to the Governor, of the great State of Illinois. It is absolutely enigmatic, how he, in a carefully thought out and composed words, could include sentences, which defy all common sense and truth. But he did not go to New York for the purpose of <pb facs="5418474_11_1648.jpg" n="2"/>of praising or burying free coinage. The purpose of his trip was, to destroy the view prevailing in the East, that he was an Anarchist. For this reason, he gave a voluminous historical description of the great Railroad Strike of 1894, and defended himself against the accusation, that he encouraged the riots or attacked the supremacy of the Government. He pointed to his quick and decisive interference against the disorders, which shortly before accompanied the miners strike, showed how quickly he summoned the militia, and proved that he immediately took extensive preventive measures, to break the Railroad-tieup, not only in Chicago, but also in the whole State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Whoever thought, that the plan of Mr. Debs, to paralyze the entire Railroad traffic and to shut off Chicago from the outside world, without the interference of regular troops, would have been successful, is given a different view by Altgeld. According to his statement, the Governor of Illinois was decisively determined, to enforce the unmolested passage of all trains and to suppress all revolts against the law, by force of arms. That this was his intention, he proved beyond a doubt, This part of his demonstration or justification was perfectly successful.</p>
