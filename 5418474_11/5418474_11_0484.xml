   <p>How large is the German population of Chicago? And what about it?</p>
   <p>No definite information could be given with reference to the first question. In some instances it might be said that the German population of Chicago has reached the 600,000 mark, while it might be just as correct to state that it is not half as numerous not even 100,000, 75,000, or even 60,000. The correct answer to this question depends, of course, upon what is understood by the name German and the people included in this category, and also what the objective of this answer might be. For instance, if a visitor from across the ocean makes the complimentary remark that one could feel quite at home in Chicago, then asks how large the German population of the city is, we proudly reply that it is 600,000 in all. But the situation takes on a different aspect if the question is asked by one interested in a new enterprise, the success of which would depend to large extent upon the support of the <pb facs="5418474_11_0485.jpg" n="2"/>German people. In this instance we would assume a more modest tone and drop the number to 100,000 or even less, because then we have in mind only those Germans identified with the German nation and who are ready to lend a helping hand to their compatriots. However, if this thesis should be excluded, and it would simply be assumed that whoever wishes to be identified with the German nation or whoever considers the German language as his or her mother tongue, it would not render things less complicated. Moreover, to determine the real strength of the Germans in Chicago would still remain a big problem, even if only immigrants from Germany would fall into that category. It is not at all unusual to speak of Austrians, Hungarians, and people from Switzerland, etc., as Germans and also of a large proportion of Poles and Russians; although they appear as such in the census, yet their culture and language, by choice, is German. According to the census taken in 1900 (the census results of 1910 for nationalities other than American have not as yet been published) there were 170,738 natives of Germany residing in Chicago. Included in this number were 3,251 persons of Swiss <pb facs="5418474_11_0486.jpg" n="3"/>origin, the majority of whom may rightly be considered Germans; 11,815 Austrians; 42,494 German and Austrian Poles; 24,178 Russians; and 4,946 Hungarians whose culture and language preference was also German and among whom there are undoubtedly many who deserve to be called Germans. But the nearest correct statement on this subject would be approximately 200,000 foreign-born population, who chose Chicago for their domicile at that time. What is it today?</p>
   <p>This implies the question what about the future of Germanism in Chicago? Especially, did they make progressive strides or did they fall into an apathy? Despite the various answers to the first question, the general opinion would accuse the Germans as having fallen into a lethargy. The older generation is especially prone to bemoan the backward trend of Germanism in this city and if one protests their assertion, or challenges the correctness of their opinion, they promptly refer to the retrogression of German instruction in public schools and to the fact that the German population of Chicago cannot even support its own German Theatre. Then those of us who are still unwilling to be <pb facs="5418474_11_0487.jpg" n="4"/>convinced against our own wishes cannot escape the litany of retrogression, moreover, of the shallowness and desolateness of the German societies of this city. They do bemoan the passing of the real German spirit and the German customs which were so prominent among the Chicago citizens of German descent.</p>
   <p>This would indicate that we accept conditions as they are and say no more about them. But this is not the answer to the question. It has not been proven yet, that there has been a decided retrogression of Germanism in Chicago. Those of us who believe to the contrary and who still have great hopes for the future, are on the right road.</p>
   <p>The census of 1910 will probably disclose that German immigration has fallen off, as compared with the census of ten years ago, but not materially so. Furthermore, if the Austro-Germans, the Hungarians, etc., should be included in this category, the number of German immigrants who make their homes in Chicago will probably pass the number disclosed by the census of 1900....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0488.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The prevailing economic progress of the German population cannot be denied; the economic situation of the Germans of Chicago has improved greatly since 1900 and still greater improvement is shown when compared with the years preceding that period. The statement that numerous Germans chose to deny their descent, with the increase of prosperity, may be based upon reliable information. However, it must not be disregarded that others, no less numerous, became German-conscious and proud of their descent.</p>
   <p>It is also a fact that there are just as many, or more, Germans living in Chicago today than there ever were. Their offspring are regarded as being numerous, but how large the percentage may be of those who still consider themselves Germans is a question, the answer to which is yet to come. And this can be accomplished only by demonstrating their strength which they have failed to do during the past ten years. The lack of support of the German Theatre and the negligible interest in the study of German in public schools was also sufficient proof.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0489.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The new German Theatre is to open this autumn. Care has been taken to see that a diversified repertoire keeps the interest of the public alive. In order to satisfy individual preferences, the repertoire for the coming season is composed of operettas, dramas, and comedies to be given at moderate admission prices. It will be a real test of Germanism in this city. And only then when the anticipated support of that institution should fail, only then, the accusation of disinterestedness will be justified. This would, of course, indicate a clear case of Germanistic retrogression in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Another deplorable lack of interest was shown toward the study of the German language in public schools. This would, however, require a lengthy explanation. Therefore, it may be well to confine ourselves today just to this: "A little is better than nothing at all, and never dispose of muddy water, before clear water is available."</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the principal of every school to communicate with the parents of each student as to their desirability of the child's instruction <pb facs="5418474_11_0490.jpg" n="7"/>of German. This would become compulsory if, for instance, fifty students of the fifth grade of any school would announce their wish for that study. The minimum attendance of the German class by pupils of the seventh and the eighth grades would be twenty-five. And if the number of the future aspirants of one school would not warrant the organizing of a single class then two neighborhood schools could combine their separate units into a single class. Only a strong public demand could bring about the much-needed improvement in the study of the German language.....</p>
