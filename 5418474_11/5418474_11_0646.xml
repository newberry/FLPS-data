   <p>We publish below a letter from the Social Democratic Association here and one from the Chicago correspondent of Bebel's Volksstaat, Mr. H. R. Zimpel. The latter quotes in toto the lines that we took exception to; it appears that he has not really maintained that "at present already several thousand workers annually starve in the United States," but only that several thousands would starve if a very strong influx from Europe did take place. But even in this hypothetical form we could not admit the validity of the statement. Immigration is still necessary for the United States, and the immigrants are doing well for themselves. Or isn't it true that even in a city like Chicago the immigrant laborer acquires, after a few years, a house and lot, and with that the essentials of independence? The fact that up to now the various attempts to found a special workers' party have come to nought through lack of interest on the side of the workers, that the various labor papers usually died after a short existence proves that the need for it is not yet being felt among the laborers.</p>
   <p>The invitation of the Association we will follow with pleasure, and will report the discussions to our readers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0647.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chicago, August 16, 1871</p>
   <p>Editor of the Staats Zeitung:</p>
   <p>The Socio-Political Workers' Association decided in its last meeting to invite the gentlemen of the Staats Zeitung to its next meeting at the place of Mr. Reiser at Halsted and 12th Street. Also to give for our friend Zimpel the declaration that he acted completely in our sense and worthy of a Social Democrat, and that no real Social Democrat is afraid of a single paper of their (?) present day worm-eaten society, but gladly picks up the glove that is thrown to him in this curious way. In that, indeed, consists the difference between the Social Democracy and present day society, that the Social Democracy is pledged to mutual solidarity, to stand one for all and all for one, and that the latter did not need in the least to hide behind the chimney screen of the Socio-Political Labor Association.</p>
   <p>The Socio-Political Labor Association</p>
   <p>H. Herminghaus, Secretary.</p>
   <p>Post Scriptum:</p>
   <p>I would rather have concluded this matter with you personally but had to abide by the decision of the Association.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0648.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>However, one thing I would beg of you; they were then no lies, but facts, that I reported; for you, small matters, but not for us, when workers die of hunger; where now is the liar? Is it the Cincinnatti Volksblatt, the Staats Zeitung, or the Internationals?</p>
   <p>Besides the paragraph in question in the Volksstaat reads verbally as follows: People in Germany still believe fairy tales about America, and many come over in the sure expectation to here find an Eldorado, only to find themselves bitterly disappointed. That only is due to the fact that the present corrupt press never cares about truth, but only writes what is of the greatest advantage of its own interest, and that is here in America the strongest possible influx of labor. Therefore, lies are gladly heaped on lies, because what harm does it do, even if here every year a few thousand workers starve todeath, who might have managed to survive quite nicely over in Europe. Not by any means, do we want to stop our party comrades who want to come over. On the contrary, he who has made up his mind should come and some way or other he will, no doubt, muddle through; and he who has only some luck in finding employment here, is still a bit better off than in Germany.</p>
   <p>Now, gentlemen, my party comrades and I, find in this not a warning, but on <pb facs="5418474_11_0649.jpg" n="4"/>the contrary, a direct invitation to immigrate into America. Where now is the liar?</p>
   <p>H. R. Zimpel.</p>
   <p>(Footnote of the translator: "It seems that the Staats Zeitung, after cruelly joking about"Mr. Mikrokosm," now shows extraordinary patience with the honest, but awkward Socialist. Actually, Mr. Zimpel had said exactly what the Staats Zeitung quoted him as saying - however, from his next lines it appears clearly that he did not mean what he was saying. The struggle of the new mass parties emerging in the late nineteenth century was one for articulateness as much as for social standing.)</p>
