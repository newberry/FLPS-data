   <p>In her home 622 Briar Place, Mrs. Hedwig von Weber-Sperco, a pianist, well known in America and Germany, was found dead yesterday. She committed suicide by gas. Mrs. Weber-Sperco, a grandniece of the immortal Carl Marin von Weber, has, according to her intimate friends - sought relief in death, because of her dwindling income and the fear that at her age - 75 years - she would be unable to find new sources of income.</p>
   <p>Although the artist had a large number of friends in this city, who would have been only too willing to help her, she seemingly was too proud to accept an such aid. Mrs. Weber-Sperco was born in Danzig and came to America in 1874, as a pianist and piano teacher. At the age of 50 years, she again went back to Germany and studied some more under Carl Hawelka.</p>
   <p>In October, 1926 she was able to celebrate her 50 year jubilee as a pianist. On this occasion she arranged a large concert in Kimball Hall which was <pb facs="5418474_11_1271.jpg" n="2"/>attended by most of the city's great musicians, and by a large audience She leaves two sisters in Germany, one of whom is the famous pianist Jennie von Weber.</p>
