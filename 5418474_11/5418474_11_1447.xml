   <p>Pastor Rudolph A. John, of the Evangelical St. Paul Church, celebrated with the members of the "Men's Club" his thirtieth anniversary as Pastor of one of the biggest and most prominent German churches in Chicago. He is greatly honored by the members and friends of his church. Pastor John is not only known for his extraordinary ability as a clergyman, but also for his great interest in regard to the children of the synod, who require care in the "Uhlich Orphan's Home", to which the church has contributed more than half a million dollars in the last few years, and also for his efforts towards having a building erected which shall serve as an old people's home for the feeble old people of his synod.</p>
