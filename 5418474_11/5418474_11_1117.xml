   <p>The funeral services for Pastor Edward Hoelter, who died in his home, 1134 So. Ashland Boulevard, at the age of 58 years, will take place tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon at the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Church, whose pastor he was since 1922. Beginning at 4 o'clock this afternoon, his body will lay in state at the church.</p>
   <p>Pastor Hoelter died in the Lutheran Memorial Hospital as the result of an operation. After the death of his father, who was the pastor of the Congregation since 1878, Pastor R. Hoelter was elected as his successor. At the time he had served as assistant to his father for 25 years. In addition to being mourned by two daughters and four sons, he is mourned by the members of the congregation, who feel the loss very deeply.</p>
