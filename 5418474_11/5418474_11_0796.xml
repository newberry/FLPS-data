   <p>The German Consulate General of Chicago has received numerous inquiries about the value, amortization or exchange of German securities. Inquiries of this sort often also arrive at the Abendpost, and it is apparent that great uncertainty exists among the public as to this matter. There are frequently, totally false and fantastic ideas set forth about it. That is why the Abendpost is publishing the following short and clear abstract from the regulations which have been put together for that purpose by the Consulate General.</p>
   <p>German Bonds: Old owners are those who acquired their German bonds prior to June 1, 1920 and have kept them ever since. They can apply up to May 15, to the Continental and Commercial National Bank or to the First Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago if they want to exchange them. At either of these <pb facs="5418474_11_0797.jpg" n="2"/>banks printed applications can be obtained, which have to be filled out and returned to the bank. The bank then sends the form to the German commissioner for the liquidation of German bonds in New York. New owners, those persons who acquired their German bonds after July 1, 1920, may apply after May 15 for exchange to the banks mentioned.</p>
   <p>City Bonds: Regulations dealing with the exchange of German city bonds are established by the city administrations involved. As to details of the procedures and the periods of exchange the owners of such bonds are advised to go to such banks as have direct communication with a German bank. We are not familiar with the individual regulations of the various city administrations.</p>
   <p>Industrial Bonds: Owners of such bonds who want to exchange them are to apply to the firm, company, or corporation which issued them.</p>
   <p>Securities: Concerning claims for securities, the owner has to turn to the insurance company in question.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0798.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mortgages: For the purpose of evaluating mortgage bonds, the owner should get in touch with a mortgage bank familiar with the question.</p>
   <p>Savings Accounts: Owners of accounts in a public bank, or one with a state permit, should turn over their claims to the pertinent savings bank.</p>
   <p>Bank deposits are not listed as valuables in accordance with the law issued July 15, 1925.</p>
   <p>German bank notes issued before October 11, 1924 are valueless. Following a public announcement of the Reichsbank (German National Bank) such bank notes had been called in for exchange by July 5, 1925. This time limit having elapsed, it is no longer possible to exchange such bank notes.</p>
