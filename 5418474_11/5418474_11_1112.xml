  <body>
   <p>A group of notable German-Americans has asked Mayor Kelly to fill the vacant post of fire commissioner by appointing Mr. Arthur R. Seyferlich.</p>
   <p>Among those present were the postmaster, Ernst J. Kruetgen; Fred Rixmann, president of the German-American Citizens' Bund; Wilhelm Adelhelm, president of the Swabian Society; H. E. Hintzpeter, president of the German Club of Chicago; William F. Jacobs, one of the directors of the German Club; Oscar A. Stoffels, former president of the German Club; Dr. George L. Scherger, pastor of St. Paul's Church; Paul H. Mueller and Paul H. Hartmann, of the Abendpost; Al. Horan, bailiff of the municipal court, and George Seiff, clerk of the criminal court. Several other gentlemen, representing German-American organizations, had declared their readiness to be present, but were prevented from doing so for various reasons.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen declared that Mr. Seyferlich has been known to them for years, and that they were moved by the conviction that he is the right man, in every respect, for this important and significant position. It was <pb facs="5418474_11_1113.jpg" n="2"/>further indicated that this would be an opportunity to rectify an injustice which had been perpetrated upon the deserving fire marshal some time ago, that Seyferlich is well known in the fire department, and that he enjoys everybody's esteem.</p>
   <p>The mayor thanked the gentlemen for their interest, and gave them the assurance that he would take their wishes into consideration.</p>
   <p>Arthur R. Seyferlich was born February 23, 1869, in Chicago's Forty-fourth Ward. His father comes from Bremen and his mother from Mecklenburg; they emigrated to the United States in the year 1849 and settled in Chicago. The great fire caused them to lose everything they had built up by hard work. But, with fresh courage, they started working anew.</p>
   <p>After attending the public schools, young Seyferlich turned his attention to a craft, and entered an upholstery shop as apprentice; there he devoted himself to upholstering furniture.</p>

   <p>In the year 1890, at the age of 21, Seyferlich joined the fire department. There he began serving in the lowest ranks and, climbing step by step, he was nominated fire marshal in 1921. He occupied that post until 1927, when he was relieved of his duties by the Thompson administration.</p>
   <p>There were six brothers and three sisters in the Seyferlich family. He is the second of the sons. He married in the year 1891. One son was born to this marriage.</p>
   <p>Seyferlich's brother was made fire marshal on December 22, 1910, following the great fire in the stockyards; he occupied the office until his death in the year 1914.</p>
