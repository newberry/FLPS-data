He attended public school and business college at Halbroun, and afterwards went abroad. He worked for four years as a volunteer, and was then appointed secretary to the director-general of the London-Brighton South Coast Motorcycle Company Ltd.</p>
   <p>Having held this position for two years, he then came to the United States and settled in Chicago. His father and his relatives live alternatively in Chicago, and in California.</p>
