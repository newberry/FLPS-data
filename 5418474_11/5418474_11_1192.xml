   <p>Amid a large gathering of Churchmen and laymen, the body of John P. Daleiden, who for a generation played a leading role in German-Catholic circles, and who was well known as benefactor of the poor, was laid to rest today.</p>

   <p>Among the local businessmen were Fred Hansen, John A. Schmidt, Louis Biage, Adam Meyer, Frank and Valentin Seng, John Beatty, Peter Feipel, A. Kemper, Nick Ranen, John Gebhardt, Edw. Berkel, secretary of the Daleiden Company, Mat Butzer, James Daly, M. H. Wiltzius, Bernh. Malburg, Dr. J. Barber, A. Baltozore, the Austrian Consul General, M. Girten, W. C. Sullivan, and John Alt.</p>
   <p>As pallbearers, officiated Ferdinand, Henry, and James Daleiden; Theodore and John Grop, and John Brost, grandsons of the deceased. Honorary pallbearers were members of the Alexian Brothers, the St. Martin's Court, C. O. F., the St. Mathias Benevolent Society, the Holy Name and Holy Family Society, <pb facs="5418474_11_1194.jpg" n="3"/>and the Third Order of St. Francis and Sacred Heart League.</p>
