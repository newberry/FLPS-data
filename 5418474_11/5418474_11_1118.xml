   <p>Mr. Peter Bartzen, the well-known German-American, succumbed to a heart attack yesterday at his son's home in Waukegan. He was eighty-two years old.</p>
   <p>Funeral services for the former president of the County board and former Building Commissioner of Chicago, have not been fully arranged.</p>
   <p>"Battling Pete"came to Chicago, with his parents, from Germany, at the age of ten. After finishing school, he started his career by becoming a building contractor. But soon he turned to politics and was an ardent follower of the Democratic party. Having filled several smaller <pb facs="5418474_11_1119.jpg" n="2"/>offices, he was appointed by Mayor Dunne, in 1906, as Building Commissioner.</p>
   <p>In 1912 he was defeated as president, however, he served as County Commissioner for the next two years. His political career included a lively dispute with the Civil Service Administration.</p>
   <p>About 15 years ago he retired. He is mourned by his widow, Mary Bartzen, four sons and three daughters.</p>
