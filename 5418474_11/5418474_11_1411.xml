   <p>The many friends and acquaintances of John H. Weiss, president of the Gottfried Brewing Company and the Calumet Malting Company, will regret to hear that he died yesterday at his residence, 4419 Drexel Boulevard. As is known, he had been ill for some time.</p>
   <p>He was born in 1856, in Frankenthal, Palatinate, Germany. He graduated from the commercial school of that city, and was treasurer of a malting company for some years. In 1880 he decided to immigrate to the United States, and came directly to Chicago, where his older brother lived. After two years he entered the malting company of Binz and Weiss, and two years later he was made treasurer of the Gottfried Brewery, having married the daughter of the president of the Brewery, Matheus Gottfried.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Gottfried retired from the leadership of the large business [1892], Weiss succeeded him. For a long time the Gottfried Brewery was the largest <pb facs="5418474_11_1412.jpg" n="2"/>organization of its kind in Illinois. Later Weiss, Carl Gottfried, his brother-in-law, and Ferdinand Gundrun founded the Calumet Malting Company. Its business increased very rapidly and flourished for many years.</p>
   <p>The deceased, who was an able and prudent businessman and was a member of various German societies, is mourned by his wife, Margarete, and two sons, Norman M. and John Herbert Weiss.</p>
