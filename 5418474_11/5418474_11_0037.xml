   <p>Today marks the passing of twenty-five years since Father Ferdinand Kalvelage was ordained to the priesthood. The parish members are celebrating the occasion....</p>
   <p>Ferdinand Kalvelage was born in Lohne, near Vechta, Germany, and came to America in 1847, arriving in New Orleans on November 10; he was nineteen years old at the time. In December of the same year he came to Chicago, where he studied at St. Mary's University, which was situated on the present site of the Cathedral. He completed his studies in Carondelet, Missouri.....</p>
   <p>On St. Vincent De Paul Day he came to Chicago as priest of the St. Franciscus Church, and has remained here since that time.... He....also built the imposing <pb facs="5418474_11_0038.jpg" n="2"/>church and school, near Twelfth Street and Newberry Avenue.</p>
   <p>Last evening the school children honored the celebrant by reciting verses and lyrical selections. They also presented a short stage performance.</p>
   <p>At about eleven o'clock a serenade was given by the Catholic Casino Club. Anton Schager, Jr., gave the celebrant presents from the Club.</p>
   <p>Father Kalvelage expressed his appreciation....amid the congratulations of the assembly. Among the presents we mention the following:</p>
   <p>A golden chalice (given by three priests); a beautiful stole (worth $240), from the Catholic Casino, St. Franciscus, St. John's, and St. Stanislaus Young Men's club;....An embroidered picture, "Die Rettung Moses'" (The Saving of Moses), in a luxurious gilded frame; a chair of walnut wood upholstered with purple velvet (from the school children); a couch (also from the school children); an embroidered stole, worth $50 (from the Franciscan <pb facs="5418474_11_0039.jpg" n="3"/>nuns in Joliet); several works of eminent Catholic authors; two silver flower holders; a silver smoking set; and a number of bouquets.</p>
   <p>High Mass will be read in honor of the celebrant this morning at ten, at St. Franciscus Church.</p>
   <p>Hayden's "Zweite Messe" (Second Mass) and Beethoven's "Hallelujah" will be sung as accompaniments. At one o'clock dinner will be served at the school-house, and in the evening a banquet will be given by the Casino.</p>
   <p>St. Franciscus Church has been beautifully decorated.</p>
