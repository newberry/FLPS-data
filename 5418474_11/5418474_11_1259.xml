   <p>The banquet which the "Fidelia" arranged yesterday evening in the Lincoln Turnhall, on the occasion of the 80th birthday of its former conductor, Henry Von Oppen, turned out to be a demonstration of veneration and love. "Our Henry" was repeatedly heard and was the keynote of the speeches which were held in honor of Mr. Von Oppen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Fallbacker, who as president of the Fidelia arranged this Festival, welcomed those present. He expressed his pleasure that so many passive members had appeared as well as such a great number of fellow-singers of the "Harmony." After that all the singers present sang "The Day of the Lord," under the direction of Ottomar Gerasch, an old choir director, who had come to honor his friend, Oppen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rohde, as toastmaster of the evening, praised Mr. Von Oppen as a good friend, and leader. Mr. Von Oppen then thanked all those who had come to honor him.</p>

   <p>The new baton which they had given him on his birthday, he bequeathed to his "Fidelia" so that at its sight they might always remember him. Then once more he seized the baton and directed several songs with his old fervor.</p>
