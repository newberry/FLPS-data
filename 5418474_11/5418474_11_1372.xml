   <p>Surrounded by bright flowers and flooded by rays of a shining winter sun, the black coffin stood in the large hall of the Lincoln Club in which Julius Goldzier was laid for his last slumber. A number of friends and acquaintances were present, to pay the last honors to the dear dead. Pastor John of the Evangelical St. Paul's church praised the deceased as a man of the old school, ever ready to help his fellow citizens with advice and action, and to assist them to his best ability. Blessed with a great gift of oratory, he said, the departed had used this not only in social circles, but also in public life for the benefit of his fellow citizens. His name is engraved in the hearts of all those who knew him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oscar Ruh, president of the Lincoln Club, also spoke a few farewell words. In the name of Schlaraffia, Mr. Walter Haenichen mentioned in particular the true friendliness of the deceased. Mrs. R. Pick sang a touching farewell song after which the body was taken to Graceland cemetery for burial.</p>
