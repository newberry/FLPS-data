   <p>Henry Legler died in the North Chicago Hospital, yesterday. The deceased began his work in the Public Library in 1909. Before he came to Chicago he had acted as secretary of the Milwaukee Schools and before that, he was editor of German papers in Milwaukee and La Crosse, Wisconsin. Dr. Max Henin, President of the library, after receiving the death notice of Henry Legler, at once called a meeting of the trustees to form a resolution regarding arrangements for the funeral.</p>
   <p>According to the assertion of Dr. Henin, the deceased was a man of high intellectual attainments, and his work as librarian deserve the highest praise. He not only possessed the highest regard of the trustees, but also of all the employees.</p>
   <p>Besides the duties of a librarian he was devoted to the welfare of Chicago, and he did much for the development of the city. His death is not only a deep loss for the library but also for Chicago.</p>
