   <p>"From Washington comes the report, that the German government protested against the Burnett Bill." If certain circles in congress think it necessary to prove that American culture has advanced so far that it can institute, without fear of exposure, the educational test of Cretans and Kutzowallachs, then neither Germany nor any other state can have any official objection against it. We German Americans are aggravated because we see in the same a treason against the spirit, which prevailed when the Republic was founded, and because it speaks of a pitiable ignorance of necessities, which the country needs to further develop and open up economic conditions. This phase is that symbol which distinguishes immigrant masses from Americans. This latter element believes that in the hundred years of its independent national existence it has accumulated sufficient spiritual values aside from the rolling dollar, that it is able to cut out an educational straight-jacket for the rest of the world. The hyphenated people, meaning German-Americans, is of the opinion that the country's structure of civilization, is by no means finished, and to further this building callous muscles should be welcomed as co-workers. The view that the only spiritual values existing are those in this country brought over by themselves, but containing nothing of native American coinage is pure malice.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0480.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the home countries of the hyphenated Americans, it is regarded as an unquestionable fact, while the nationalist Americans will think it a malicious lie. If Germany has no right to interfere, when Uncle Sam sports the toga of the educational censor, neither has it any cause to act in the interest of its emigrants. The German government's protest is not directed against the educational test but only against the passage in the Burnett Bill which states that American immigrants have to be examined by American physicians, inspectors, etc., at the port of embarkation. This, naturally, is a challenge which no foreign country is willing to pass, least of all Germany. Its navigation companies are the most scrupulous in the world as was acknowledged even America after the "Titanic" catastrophe. Its physicians are the best educated on earth and do not need any supervision by American scholars or officials, and Count Bernstorff pointed out with great clearness, which can not be misunderstood, the position of his government, that it never would stand for American control over German ships.</p>
