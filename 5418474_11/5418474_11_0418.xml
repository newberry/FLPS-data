   <p>Out of the yearly tabulation of the General Commissioner of Immigration, interesting figures can be quoted, which are referring to the latest immigration and emigration of Germans in the United States. The report, of course, embodies only the fiscal year of July 1st, 1920 to June 30th, 1921. During that time 7,321 immigrants and visitors from Germany came to the United States; 6,014 went back to Germany, there-fore, only 1,307 more Germans from Germany immigrated to this country than those who emigrated. Entirely different is the relation to the Austrians and Swiss. 5,045 Austrians immigrated to this country and only 1,511 emigrated. 7,631 Swiss immigrated and only 1,518 emigrated. These figures are different, when race or people, and not the nationality is considered; there we find that 17, 764 more Germans immigrated than emigrated. This classification will be observed in most tabulations. 183 Germans from all countries could neither write nor read. About half paid their own fares, the other half had their journey paid by their relatives. The majority of the immigrants were on the way to to their relatives. Of the Germans who emigrated, three fourths were between the age of sixteen and forty-four years. Most of them had been in the United States about five to ten years. 1,295 had been in the United States one to fifteen years; 423, fifteen to twenty <pb facs="5418474_11_0419.jpg" n="2"/>years, and 374, over 20 years. Most of those Germans who were admitted went to following states: California 1,366; Illinois, 2,672; Michigan, 1,335; New Jersey, 1,703; New York, 5,804; Ohio, 2,672; Pennsylvania, 2,022; Wisconsin, 1,495. According to their professions most of them were servants, laborers, and farmers; others were: 17 actors, 61 teachers, 19 ministers, 49 musicians, 6 government officials, 9 artists and 1 editor.</p>
