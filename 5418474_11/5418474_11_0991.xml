   <p>A largely attended mass-meeting of German citizens was held at the West Twelfth street Turner Hall yesterday afternoon, for the purpose of discussing the recent labor riots in Berlin. The meeting was called by some of the members of the Arbeiter-Zeitung Pub. Co., and was intended to begin at 2 o'clock. It was fully an hour later, however, before the first speaker appeared upon the platform. The audience had assembled promptly at the specified time, and the interval preceding the opening of the meeting afforded an opportunity for a general discussion of the crisis. Everybody seemed to have formed a well out-lined opinion of the situation in Berlin, and the young Emperor was denounced in emphatic terms, on every side.</p>
   <p>Albert Schmiedinger presided over the meeting, which was conducted entirely in German. He referred briefly to the labor riots in Berlin, and said the meeting was held for the purpose of giving the German residents of Chicago, an opportunity to express their opinions of the trouble in the Fatherland. Then he introduced Dr. H. C. Bechtold, who delivered a long address.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0992.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Bechtold first reviewed the circumstances leading up to the uprising of the working men in the German capitol. The primary cause of the trouble, he believed was, the want of working men all over Germany. The ordinary condition of the German working classes were bad enough, but the Emperor sought to aggravate the trouble by turning a deaf ear to the complaints of his subjects. Not satisfied with ignoring his subjects, he had even gone farther. Then the speaker referred to the Emperor's speech in which he advised those who were not satisfied with his rule, to emigrate.</p>
   <p>"Any one of you here," Dr. Bechtold continued," has more courage than the young Hohenzollern. More bravery is shown by you every day in the streets of Chicago, than he ever dared show." Then the Emperor's return to the palace through a back entrance in a closed carriage, was alluded to, and the audience burst out in enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bechtold denounced the attitude of the German press on the subject. Three days ago, he said, "the newspapers, not only of Germany, but of other nations as well, were referring to the uprising as a heroic deed on the part of the <pb facs="5418474_11_0993.jpg" n="3"/>lower classes. Now they were characterizing the uprising as a miserable riot. The speakers found a reason for this sudden change in the vigilance of the censors of the press, who were careful that true reports of the trouble did not appear in print. He advanced the tampering with the London Times' correspondence, as an example of the German authorities overvigilance.</p>
   <p>Just such demonstrations, the speaker said, were the hopes of the laboring classes. They were the forerunners of the coming revolution in the present condition of the masses. He did not know whether the final stand would be made in eight, eighteen or eighty years hence, but it was inevitable. Dr. Bechtold made no attempt to predict the outcome of the present trouble, but he characterized it as only one more manifestation of the revolution which was now in progress.</p>
   <p>Morris Schultze followed Dr. Bechtold. He also denounced the policy of the German Emperor. He was fully in sympathy with the causes at the bottom of the uprising. He also saw in the riots, another evidence of coming revolution. After reviewing last weeks' events in Berlin and commenting upon them, he read a statement expressing the sympathy of the meeting in the unpleasant affairs of the German people.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0994.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The statement was drawn up in German and was unanimously adopted. Translated it was as follows:</p>
   <p>The working men and citizens of Chicago assembled in mass-meeting in west Side Turner Hall, heard the news of the uprising against German capital and German military with great satisfaction. They have interpreted the uprising as a never failing sign of the coming overthrow of the imperial "divine right" and the commencement of a new era of labor evolution. Well knowing that the new movement in Germany is an uprising against unbearable oppression under which the German working classes now suffer, we pledge our full support to the popular movement of our brethern across the ocean.</p>
   <p>We request our brothers and sisters in the fatherland not to tire fighting the oppressors. We urge them not to emigrate even though the Emperor has expressed a desire for them to leave if not satisfied with his rule. Should he attempt to lead them to war, we request them not to go, but to remain and combat until the ideal of free humanity be realized. The meeting declares itself displeased with <pb facs="5418474_11_0995.jpg" n="5"/>the Hollenzollern William, who declares the welfare of millions of Germans shall depend upon his own weak will - one, whom men of science say, is subject to hereditary disease. Get rid of your "Reise Kaiser and Arbeile Kaiser," German working men! Remember he will never help you, for he is at the head of an order of society under which you suffer. He should be the first to be dethroned. Your brothers are with you.</p>
   <p>After the adoption of the statement, Francois Martin made a short speech on the same subject, after which the meeting was adjourned.</p>
