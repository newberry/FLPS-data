   <p>Ex-Governor John P. Altgeld, is confronted with a $12,000 suit in the circuit court, at the behest of Mrs. Caroline Lathrop Bilbert of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The debt amounts to $12,000 and accrued interest to the tune of $522.66. This alleged debt, was contracted on the 14th of November, 1893, by Mr. Altgeld's business partner, Robert E. McCabe, and, it is claimed the former state executive of Illinois gave personal security for the loan. As security for its payment, Mr. Altgeld gave a mortgage to the plaintiff; it covers two residences on LaSalle Street, but since that time he transferred them to Alderman Wm. E. Schlake. The debt agreement provided, that the debt be liquidated on November 14th, 1898, and if not paid then, the interest rate should continue at 7 per cent, instead of 6 per cent. The rate increase has been obtained now, but the interest never was paid. Mrs. Gilbert could claim the mortgaged buildings by attachment proceedings, but she prefers to collect her dues in the form of a suit for collection.</p>
