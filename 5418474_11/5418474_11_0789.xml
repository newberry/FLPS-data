   <p>The people of the United States are celebrating, this year, with special solemnity, the festival of the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, at historic Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the cradle of the Magna Charta of the great North American republic.</p>
   <p>Names like de Kalb and Von Steuben, appear in the memory of the Germans during a review of those distant times of the founding of the United States, pointing out that already at the beginning of American history, close relations between the United States and Germany, existed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0790.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These relations, which reach back to the times of Frederick the Great, were increasing steadily in the 19th century. The immigration from Germany formed strong ties of blood relations between both countries, and supplied American citizenship with many of its best and most valued elements.</p>
   <p>The name of Karl Schurz is symbolic of this closely mutual participation of citizens, between social and spiritual life.</p>
   <p>The universities and schools exchanged professors, teachers and students; the merchants of both countries joined in beneficial competition; the sympathic understanding of the countries for one another, increased steadily. Into this promising development suddenly came the entrance of America into the World War, which caused those so regrettable gaps of mutual enmity and alienation; misunderstandings and disappointments were increased, and the two <pb facs="5418474_11_0791.jpg" n="3"/>countries suffered tremendously, even a long time after the termination of the war. But gradually equilibrium was again established and the agreements of 1921, made between Germany and America, were put in force as proofs, that the relations were normal again.</p>
   <p>Since between Germany and America, in the history of their long relations, there had not actually existed any differences which could not be bridged, and which should have any political reason to exist, the process of arbitration, which was also strengthened by a mutual good will, was comparatively quickly accomplished.</p>
   <p>The self-confidence of the German reconstruction, and the honest will of the German people to put their house in order by their own strength, caused the influx of American capital into Germany; thereby the commercial relations became normal again, and the mutual work for the recovery of the world, and the peaceful formation of nation's destines, brought both nations to a <pb facs="5418474_11_0792.jpg" n="4"/>closer understanding, than ever before.</p>
   <p>The number of visitors, who came from America to visit Germany and became acquainted with its people, delightfully increase every year. All American visitors, who came to see the German people at their reconstruction work, to enjoy the beauty of German landscapes and the healing power of Germany's watering places, are heartily welcome.</p>
   <p>Also, the number of travelers of all professions and classes who come to America from Germany increases steadily; they on their part, are anxious, to get acquainted with this great and powerful American government, whose destiny it was to play a such prominent part in the development of humanity. Such an approach reciprocated by both countries, based on good will and mutual sympathy, is warmly welcomed, not only for the benefit of Germany and America, but also for the benefit of the peace of the world, for whose furtherance American statesmen have pledged themselves, in the postwar times, in a promising way.</p>
