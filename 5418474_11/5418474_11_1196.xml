   <p>The funeral rites of Dr. Ludwig Hermann Abele, well known eye specialist who died in Flordia last Saturday, have not been decided up to this hour.</p>
   <p>Dr. Abele was born in 1865 in Kaustang where his father was general custom inspector. After attending high school in his home town, Abele went to the University of Freiberg, where he devoted himself to the study of medicine. Passing his medical examination in 1891, he became an assistant at the eye clinic of the University of Munich. One year later he worked in the same capacity at the University of Koenigsberg, Prussia, where he finally was promoted to the position of chief-physician. Finally he went as an eye specialist, to Berlin, where in 1901 he married Miss Antonie G. x. The same year, together with his wife, he emigrated to America with the intention of establishing himself in Chicago, where he soon became known for his activity. He worked at St. Joseph's Hospital, at the German Hospital, and at the Alexian <pb facs="5418474_11_1197.jpg" n="2"/>Brother's Hospital.</p>
   <p>Dr. Abele was a member of the Society of Eye Specialists and of the German Medical Society.</p>
