<title level="a">DR. O. L. SCHMIDT'S 70TH BIRTHDAY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In the circle of his family, and accompanied by the best wishes of hundreds of his friends from all ranks of the population, Dr. Otto L. Schmidt celebrated his 70th birthday.</p>
   <p>Among the many telegrams, letters of congratulation and floral presents, sent to him, there was a congratulatory message from the Dean of the University of Vienna, which is evidence of the respect and esteem that Dr. Schmidt enjoys both in the United States and Europe.</p>
   <p>Otto L. Schmidt, son of Dr. Ernst Schmidt, was born March 21, 1863, in Chicago, where he finished school. He studied medicine in Chicago, Wurtzburgand, and Vienna. Soon after completing his career he began his medical practice in Chicago, where through his professional ability and jovial manner, he acquired many friends among his patients. He was active for a number of years at the Alexian Brothers' and the Grant's, formerly German hospitals.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1121.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Schmidt is well known far and near as a historian and both the Chicago. Historical Society and the State Historical Society acknowledged this fact by electing him their president. During the last three or four years he devoted the larger part of his time to the German group at the World's Fair as president of a committee named to display in a fitting manner the achievements of the German-Americans. In this connection it is regrettable to state that it is not quite sure whether these beautiful plans will ever be realized.</p>
   <p>Member of the Board of Education</p>
   <p>During Dever's Administration, Dr. Schmidt was a member of the Board of Education, in which capacity he defended what he thought to be right. He was member of a number of clubs, among them the Germania and the German Club.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1122.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Wherever a good German cause was concerned, no one did ever appeal to Dr. Schmidt in vain. The Germans of Chicago unite in the wish that the celebrant may be permitted to live many more years, and to labor in the future, as he has done in the past, for the benefit of his fellow citizens.</p>
