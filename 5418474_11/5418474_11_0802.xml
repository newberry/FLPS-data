   <p>Long before 7 o'clock, the church of Pastor Menzel began to fill up with visitors last Sunday evening. The last showing of the film, "Germany of today", brought the south side of Chicago to its feet, and the German element proved once more that it does not fail where the question of help for their afflicted fellow countrymen is concerned.</p>
   <p>When, about 8 o'clock, Mrs. Helen Lorriman opened the program with a beautiful organ solo, there was not a single seat to be had in the church. Pastor Menzel greeted the assembled audience with a few hearty words, and expressed his satisfaction that in spite of the short notice the attendance was so excellent. After a few remarks by Dr. Robert Trent, about the purpose of the evening, the film program began.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of former film evenings, everything has been told about the film itself. On the south side, too, it won the hearts of the audience. Mrs. Lorriman rendered the musical accompaniment on the organ. Between the acts of the film, Professor Broeniman offered violin solos and the "Arion of the South Side" sang beautiful German songs.</p>

   <p>Dr. Trent was fully justified in saying that the "Society for the Germans in Foreign Lands", in its American branch, is trying to offer only the very best through its film and lecture evenings to assist the German children in the stolen provinces. The speaker sketched a living picture of the lives and sufferings of the millions of Germans who have been bartered through the peace treaties in foreign countries. The contents of his speech were afterwards fully confirmed through the pictures of 30,000 Germsns, evicted by Poland. Afterwards a collection was taken up by Pastor Meuzel, which netted $128.</p>
