   <p>The 40th anniversary of Siegmund Selig's association with the German stage, will be celebrated next Sunday night at the Pabst Theater. Mr. Selig has been for a number of years the business manager of the company and has made only a few stage appearances since accepting this responsibility.</p>
   <p>This artist commenced his German-American stage career exactly 40 years ago next Sunday, with a record high in honor and accomplishments. He commenced his work in Chicago at the time when this colossal American city, first appeared on the map.</p>

   <p>Messrs. Deutsch and Steidle, gave the young ambitious novice his first chance in the year 1859. But what character was he suited best to interpret? He would have liked to act the hero parts, or again those of the lover. But O! What about that nose!.....Finally his fine talent as a comedian was discovered. Since then, he has been a member of the theater companies of Philadelphia, New York and St. Louis. Director Ostermann engaged him in the spring of 1872 for a guest performance at the Globe Theater in Chicago. He became thereafter a prominent member of the German theater in Philadelphia, remaining there three seasons. The German theater in Milwaukee claimed him then for four seasons. During the years 1881-82, he took over the business management of the three combined German theater companies. Those of Chicago, St. Louis and Milwaukee. The season 1883-84 found him as director of the Thalia Theater in Milwaukee (North Side Turner Hall) and 1885-86 as director of the Germania Theater of Detroit. He became associated with the directors of the Milwaukee theaters.</p>

   <p>Messrs. Richard, Welb and Wachsner, taking over the business management of that company in the year 1888, and in that capacity he now discharges his duties in the city of Chicago. The elder generation will still remember his large repertoire and, his great success as a comedian. Among his favored portrayals was that of Spangenbach, in the farce "Mauer Bluemchen" (Wall Flower) by Blumenthal and Kadelburg. This role he has chosen for his jubilee performance. Judging by the supporting cast, the evening promises to be one of much fun and enjoyment.</p>
