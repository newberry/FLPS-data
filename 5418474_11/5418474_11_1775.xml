   <p>As already reported, the well-known German publisher died last Wednesday morning at 177 Illinois St. from heart disease.</p>
   <p>Louis Schick was born in 1842 in Hamburg v. d. Hohe, Germany. His father was likewise a publisher, and he came from an old established publishing house. Schick came to America at the age of 17, and to Chicago in the early sixties. Here he entered a business house as a clerk and worked himself up to the position of bookkeeper. Later he established, with a Mr. Meininger, a German bookshop on Madison St. The Chicago fire destroyed his business. After the fire he started another <pb facs="5418474_11_1776.jpg" n="2"/>German bookstore on the corner of Clark and Lake Sts. This business he retained until he retired in 1889, in order to devote his time entirely to publications.</p>
   <p>His collection of novels, known as the Schick Collection, and his Humoristic Library are well known everywhere. He also published a splendid translation of Nordau's Works: Conventional Lies and Paradoxes. He is also the author and publisher of, Chicago and Its Environs.</p>
   <p>Schick lived a rather secluded life during his last years. Nature was his best friend. He was never married. A sister, living in Chicago, survives him.</p>
