   <p>The funeral of the well-known and highly respected Redemptorist Priest, Adam Herz, took place yesterday at the St. Boniface Cemetery, proceeding from the German Catholic Church of St. Michael, corner Eugenie Street and Cleveland Avenue. The deceased was born seventy-nine years ago in Mindt, Germany. He studied in various universities, and came to America as a young priest and member of the order of the Redemptorists. He served a few years as master novice in De Soto, Missouri, and was later transferred to Chicago, where for some years he was active as rector of the St. Michael Congregation.</p>
   <p>He succumbed to a protracted illness on October 13, in Alexian Brothers' Hospital. Father Herz leaves behind him a large circle of acquaintances and friends who will preserve his memory for a long time.</p>
