   <p>Gustav Struve has sent us an interesting pamphlet which gives his reason for leaving the Army. Although fifty-six years old, he entered the 8th Regiment, New York Volunteers nineteen months ago, took part in all its campaigns, and by and by advanced to the rank of Captain. Now he has resigned from his position for the following reason which is supported by documentary evidence:</p>
   <p>When Colonel Wutschel left the Regiment after the battle of Cross Keys, Lieutenant Colonel Hedterich assumed command and distinguished himself by his able leadership under Commander in Chief Sigel, especially in the memorable battles of Bull Run and the Rappahannock. Then suddenly, on October 26 of this year, information was received that Governor Morgan of New York had definitely filled the vacant colonelcy, however not by appointing Lieutenant Colonel Hedterich as Colonel Wutschel's successor, but by conferring the honor upon Prince Salm-Salm, a man <pb facs="5418474_11_0211.jpg" n="2"/>who is notorious for no good accomplishments, and who is a stranger to the Regiment. Immediately all officers of the Regiment sent a petition to Governor Morgan, asking that he reconsider the appointment, recall Prince Salm-Salm and name Hedterich to the post, stating that the latter deserved the advancement on account of his long and meritorious service. This petition and recommendation was strongly supported by Colonel Gilsa, Commander of the Brigade of which the Regiment is a contingent, by General Sigel himself, and also by General Stahel, Division-Commander. As soon as it became known that Colonel Wutschel had been dismissed, Hedterich sent a mild and dignified protest to the Governor, calling attention to the fact that he (Hedterich) had been unanimously appointed Colonel of the Regiment by its staff of officers and had been recommended for the position by his Superior Officer, Gilsa. He also pointed out that according to paragraph ten of the new Army Regulations, as well as according to Section nineteen of the Congressional Act concerning the enlistment of volunteers, the Governor cannot appoint anyone colonel unless the party to be appointed has been proposed by the respective regiment, and seniority rights must be considered <pb facs="5418474_11_0212.jpg" n="3"/>except in case of incompetence of the person entitled to advancement. This protest also was supported by Gilsa, Stahel, and Sigel.</p>
   <p>Letters of similar content were sent to the Governor by Mr. Andreas Willmann, Mr. Wesendonk, and Dr. Karl Kessmann, the latter acting in behalf of the New York German Volunteer Committee.</p>
   <p>When a delegation of officers of the Regiment visited the Governor in regard to the matter, he declared that he regretted he had no previous knowledge of circumstances pertaining to the Regiment's wishes, but that he had no further control over the appointment and would award the colonelcy to Hedterich in case Prince Salm-Salm would resign. The Governor also said that Mr. Witthaus, a German businessman of New York, had recommended the Prince. However, Mr. Witthaus denied this very emphatically in a letter addressed to Lieutenant Colonel Gilsa, and stated also that he would consider it a mean and low trick if Prince Salm-Salm accepted the position which was offered to him under the above described circumstances.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0213.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>However, the Prince accepted the colonelcy, and in Washington his wife declared in the presence of reliable witnesses that she had acquired the position for her husband, that she would see to it that he kept it, that she had powerful "connections" in Washington--she named several men, whose identity Struve does not reveal, unfortunately--and with such help she would be able to "counteract the machinations of any possible intriguers against the Prince".</p>
   <p>Disgusted with this shameful business, Struve submitted the following letter of resignation:</p>
   <p>"Gainsville, Virginia,"November 6, 1862.</p>
   <p>"To the Commander of the 8th Regiment, New York Volunteers: When I entered the Army nineteen months ago, I did not do so with the intention of making a career of soldiering. In Baden, Germany, I was President of the Military Commission, and Acting President of the Diet Committee, and thus I had the necessary <pb facs="5418474_11_0214.jpg" n="5"/>military education and training to organize a regiment or a brigade in this country.</p>
   <p>"However, I never expected that favoritiam would be practiced to such an extent that birth should receive preference to merit, or monarchial antecedence to republican antecedence, when military promotions are in question. Never did I even dream that a Prince who was a lieutenant in the Prussian Army would be made colonel of a regiment though he never had the slightest connection with that regiment, while several of its members who served long and honorably in the Army of the United States were available; yet that has just happened in this Republic, and at a time when that Republic is involved in a war for its very existence, against the advocates and defenders of slavery.</p>
   <p>"It was my sincere desire to serve my term of two years, in case a bullet of the enemy did not terminate my earthly existence, but under the present conditions decency and honor demand that I retire from military service, knowing that such action is in accordance to Article 28 of our Army Regulations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0215.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Gustav Struve, Captain, Company D."</p>
   <p>Generals Heinzelmann and Burnside refused to accept this resignation; even a second and third attempt by Struve to obtain an honorable discharge were in vain. It seems he even received a severe reprimand from the brigadier general, was threatened with military arrest, and was ordered to substitute "sickness" or "old age" as the reason for his resignation; but since Struve was strong and healthy, although he was fifty-seven years old, he could not obey the order. Finally November 23, he received the coveted honorable discharge through General Sigel who, in the meantime, had acquired an independent position.</p>
   <p>Struve concludes his pamphlet with these words: "Today (November 26) Prince Felix Salm-Salm is Commander of the 8th Regiment, New York Volunteers; and with his wife, who boasted that she had obtained the position for him and would maintain him therein, he occupies the tent reserved for the Colonel of the Regiment, while Lieutenant-Colonel Hedterich has been indicted and placed under arrest by order of Prince Felix Salm-Salm!!!</p>
