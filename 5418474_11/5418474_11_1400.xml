   <p>At the age of 87 years the well known printer, poet, Turner and Singer, Johann Wilhelm Dietz died, Saturday evening, in Columbus Hospital. The end of the greatly respected and well known old gentleman, came after a week's illness. The funeral services will take place tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock in the chapel of Graceland cemetery.</p>
   <p>Johann Wilhelm Dietz was born in Colgne in 1835. His father was the proprietor and publisher of the Kolinsche Volklblatt, a man known for his liberal ideas, among whose co-workers during revolutionary times also was the poet, Ferdinand Freiligrath. The intercourse with Freiligrath had a deciding influence upon young Dietz and, in addition to his profession, he devoted himself to poetry. Many of his poems gave proof not only of his poetic ability, but, at the same time they showed that he possessed a true German heart, which he displayed until his death.</p>
   <p>The deceased, who for decades managed a printing plant with his son, Fred a Dietz, at the corner of Clark &amp; Kinzie Streets, was one of the oldest singers in the city.</p>
