   <p>After a long year's suffering, Mr. Georg Carl Koch, one of the oldest German citizens of Chicago passed away last Saturday, and he will be buried tomorrow at Wunder's Cemetery.</p>
   <p>The deceased was one of the founding members of the Lutheran St. Paul's Parish whose beautiful church is located on Superior and Franklin Streets. He took to his end a most lively interest in the development of this Parish. Forty-six years ago Mr. Koch and his wife were the first couple that was married by Pastor Wunder who will now also hold the funeral sermon for the deceased.</p>
   <p>Born on March 14, 1827 in the State of Nassau, Mr. Koch was 20 years old when he came to Chicago and after a few years established a tannery. By his untiring seal he brought his business to prosperity and everywhere he enjoyed the highest esteem of his fellow citizens. Ten children, four daughters and six sons survive.</p>
