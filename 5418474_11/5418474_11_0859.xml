   <p>Germany has really started to become democratic if we can believe reports and rumors from abroad. The chancellor and ministers of the Reich will be responsible to the people from now on, and the chancellor will remain in office only as long as he enjoys a majority in the Reichstag. The army high command and the army administration will, in the future, be subordinated to the chancellor and the civil authorities; and these in turn are accountable to parliament, i. e., the people. It is also said that the power to decide about war and peace has been transferred from the Kaiser to the Reichstag. These reforms, if true, would certainly put the relationship of the German people to its government on an entirely different basis. However, if the government is to become a real government of the people, all these constitutional changes are insufficient unless they are accompanied by a decisive <pb facs="5418474_11_0860.jpg" n="2"/>reform of the Bundesrat (federal council). [Translators note: In the federal council, all German kingdoms, grand duchies, principalities and so on were represented.] As long as the Bundesrat remains in its present form, with its present privileges, the German people will not be the absolute master of its fate. The Bundesrat is in as great need of reform as was the Prussian Diet.</p>
   <p>The Bundesrat is not, as so many people over here still believe, a real representative of all the German states, but represents only the governments of these states, in other words, their rulers, who can give instructions to their representatives in the Bundesrat, without consulting the desires or interests of their people. The King of Prussia, for instance, has never inquired of the (Prussian) Diet how the Prussian representatives to the Bundesrat were instructed (by the people) to vote on important questions, but on the contrary has not hesitated to give them his own instructions and thereby put himself in open conflict with the will of the people. Now that the people are <pb facs="5418474_11_0861.jpg" n="3"/>introducing reforms, they may as well put a stop to this arbitrary procedure also. The members of the Bundesrat must become true representatives of the people of the different states; must receive their instructions from them, and their mandates from their own parliaments. Of course it would be still better, if they were elected directly by the population of the various states and received no instructions other than those of the people. Only in this way can the Bundesrat become a part of a true parliament. As it is now, all the representatives of a state are obliged to cast their votes alike in any particular matter, regardless of their personal opinion.</p>
   <p>The authority must also be abolished which the Kaiser exercised in the Bundesrat as King of Prussia, by virtue of the articles of the constitution still in effect. It is true that Prussia has only seventeen out of fifty-eight votes in the Bundesrat, which is not much if we consider the size of its territory and the density of its population; but according to Article Seventy-Eight of the Constitution of the Reich, any constitutional changes are automatically rejected <pb facs="5418474_11_0862.jpg" n="4"/>if fourteen votes are cast against the proposal. Prussia alone can therefore prevent any change in the Constitution at any time. "Prussia" was so far only and solely the King of Prussia, or rather the Prussian Junker, whose interests alone counted. Besides, the Prussian votes, alone, in the Bundesrat, were sufficient to reject all proposed changes in regard to military and naval matters, or in the customs regulations and the tobacco, salt, liquor, beer, and sugar tax (Article Thirty-Five of the Constitution of the Reich); and all changes in regard to the administration and execution of the customs and tax laws, as well as the dissolution of the Reichstag while it is in session: For all decisions on these subjects the consent of Prussia was absolutely essential, not on account of its greater population or territory, but only because it had reserved this privilege at the time the Reichstag was established. If the authorized members of the Bundesrat were the representatives of the people instead of the representatives of the regents, and if they were not sent to Berlin with sealed instructions, but were allowed to make their decisions on any matter as real members of parliament <pb facs="5418474_11_0863.jpg" n="5"/>according to their best knowledge and conscience, the general interests of the country would undoubtedly be better served than they have been up to the present time. As it is one person, and an irresponsible one at that, namely the King of Prussia, has the final decision on many important problems and each time the votes are cast he controls at least seventeen of them.</p>
   <p>The best solution would probably be a conversion of the Bundesrat into a kind of upper chamber of the Reichstag, patterned after our own federal senate. In view of the great variance in size and population of the various (German) states, it would hardly do to grant them equal representation in the upper chamber as is the case in the United States. The equality should rather be relative and in proportion to the size of the state. With a population of sixty-six million inhabitants, counting one Bundesrat member for each million or fraction thereof, Prussia would have forty-one, Bavaria seven, Saxony five, Wuerttemberg and Baden three each, Hesse and Hamburg two each, and all the rest of the states one representative each. That would make <pb facs="5418474_11_0864.jpg" n="6"/>altogether, without Alsace-Lorraine, which at present is not represented at all in the Bundesrat, eighty-one Bundesrat members, of whom forty-one would be elected in Prussia which, even under this arrangement, would still have the majority. But that would do no harm, for Prussia is a large territory and its population has extensive and diversified interests. The forty-one Prussian votes would hardly ever be in solid opposition to the others and, if they ever were, they would also have the overwhelming majority of the German people behind them.</p>
