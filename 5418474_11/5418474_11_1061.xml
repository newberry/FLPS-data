   <p>"The victory of the German arms, a consequence of which will be the predominance of German cultural development, means much to the reform-movement of modern Judaism. The propelling idea of today's reform Jewry is essentially German.</p>
   <p>Twize the Jews tried to amalgamate themselves with a general cultural movement. The second instance, that of Moorish Science in Spain, in the middle ages, was more fertile than the first with Hellenism in Alexandria. Still, Jewry remained stuck in a morass of ritual and ceremony. It was due exclusively to German philosophy, and German discipline and character (Deutsche Zucht und Art), that in the days of Moses Mendelsohn, a movement of liberation for Jewry started. Nowhere else, neither in England not France, neither in Russia nor poland, did the reform idea emerge so thoroughly. To everywhere was brought only, from its German source. When the Jews were overcome, by the soul of the German people, they learned to grasp the religions idea in the Germans way. The superiority that German civilization has won in the world will make it certain, that the times are not far, when without ceremonies and mysteries, those life farces will be raised to the level of religion, which makes for progressive perfection of the individual as well as of human society.</p>
