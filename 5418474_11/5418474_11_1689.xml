   <p>The German Press Club of Chicago made the following resolution of condolence on the occasion of the death of Anton C. Hesing; "With deep regret and hearty sympathy, the German Press Club of Chicago has taken notice of the sudden death of Mr.A.C. Hesing, and takes the opportunity in its first meeting to express his sorrow about the death of one of the most prominent and deserving representatives of the German Press. The Germans in Chicago lose, with the death of Hesing a strong fighter and representative of their interests, a man, who always took the initiative for their ideals, wherever there was a danger to the prestige of German affairs and who knew like no one else, in hours of need how to interest enthusastic and sacrificing cooperation. His memory will be kept in high esteem as long as there will be a German Press in Chicago, in the State of Illinois and in the United States of America. His death is a great loss, which will be felt painfully for a long time to come. Resolved to incorporate the preceding resolution offering condolence in the minutes of the Press Club and to send a copy of same to the descendants and family and to publish the same in the daily press of Chicago.</p>
