   <p>Dr. Walther Wever, the German Consul of Chicago for a number of years received today the official report, that he had been promoted to Consul-General by the German Government. Consul Wever will remain as the head of the German Consulate of Chicago, which however has not been advanced as a Consulate General. Not only the Consuls personal friends but the whole German colony of Chicago welcomes this report, as the Consul Wever has done its utmost to advance German-American relations in every sphere.</p>
   <p>One of his greatest successes was the accomplishments of the pupils performances of German plays. He also promoted the invitation of German professors to American institutions to hold lectures for the American public. His activity found the greatest acknowledgement in the German and American circles.</p>
