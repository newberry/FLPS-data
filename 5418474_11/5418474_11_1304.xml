   <p>One of the most prominent representatives of the German-Americans of Chicago has died. Former Alderman Joseph M. Weber, 1324 N. Parkside Avenue, succumbed after a lingering illness. His death which is lamented not only by his immediate family, but also by a great circle of friends and acquaintances, makes a big gap in the ranks of German-Americans.</p>
   <p>Joseph Weber was born in 1853 in Brooklyn, New York, to which place his parents had immigrated from Baden, Germany. He was brought to Chicago by his parents at the age of two years, thus he spent fully 72 years of his life in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Joseph Weber achieved great prominence as a business man as well as a politician and did much for the German cause. He was elected alderman of the 7th and 8th Wards at the age of 31 years, and enjoyed great popularity and the esteem of all those with whom he came in contact.</p>
   <p>He belonged to the E. O. N. W., the Catholic Knights, the Catholic Casino, and the Society of the Holy Name.</p>

   <p>The deceased is survived by his daughters, Mrs. Philippine Densderder, and Mrs. Mary Schmidt, as well as by two sons, Adam and Franz Weber, and also by 15 grandchildren.</p>
