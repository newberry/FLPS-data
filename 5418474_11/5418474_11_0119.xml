   <p>The birth of Carl Schurz in Germany one hundred years ago was a significant historical incident. A great deal has taken place during the century following his birth. In fact, under normal conditions, a millennium would have been required to add to the book of world history the same number of pages of historical significance as have been contributed by the last hundred years.</p>
   <p>Carl Schurz played a prominent part in the movement for German unification. However, because he was implicated in the revolutionary movement of 1848, he was forced to flee Germany, but he did not leave until he had completed the rescue of his teacher Kinkel, who was detained at the Spendau prison.</p>
   <p>After a sojourn in England and France, he chose America for his future home, arriving here in the year 1852.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0120.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Young Schurz's dreams were in part realized, but the lofty goal he envisioned for Germany was beyond reach. The newly constituted German State was not the creation of the people, but was the result of Bismarck's cleverly designed political strategy, which he reinforced by his policy of Blood and Iron. Neither did that newly created State provide for the inclusion of all German peoples. In order to attain his objectives, Bismarck sacrificed the generally accepted idea of a greater Germany--a sacrifice which meant the exclusion of Austria's Germanic races from the Reich.</p>
   <p>Great and powerful was the nation of which Carl Schurz was justly proud. However, that period of the Reich has passed into oblivion; it has been replaced by an era in which the republican system of government obtains. Germany is now a republic, but not as envisioned by Carl Schurz, since certain districts of Austria are not included within the confines of Germany. The star of the once brilliant and mighty nation has been dimmed. Enemy hordes dominate the land. The hard and earnest labors of a vanquished nation will, for many decades, benefit those who have triumphed over a defeated Germany.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0121.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us take inventory of the changes which this our country has recorded since the arrival of Carl Schurz. A young nation in its making fought a bloody Civil War to a victorious conclusion. It has subsequently developed from an unimportant State which was hardly more than a colony, into the largest, wealthiest, and most powerful republic in the world.</p>
   <p>One of the outstanding architects of this colossal structure was our great patriot Carl Schurz, who served the country as a military leader. He also demonstrated his great talents as politician, public speaker, journalist, and, finally, as diplomat and statesman.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the enormous changes which have occurred throughout the world since his death in 1906. First and foremost are the technical achievements which astound the world by their rapid succession. And were Schurz now to return, he would be amazed at the progress which has even eclipsed his fondest dreams.</p>
   <p>Yes, leaders and statesmen of the 1848 type would indeed be a great asset to the <pb facs="5418474_11_0122.jpg" n="4"/>Germany and the America of today. Schurz was endowed with extraordinary talents. He could offer humanity much of what the world is in need of today. He possessed idealism, which he preserved all through his life despite the heavy responsibilities placed upon him in his service to humanity. His ideas and plans for the creation of a greater German republic may have been considered somewhat fantastic; nevertheless, his intentions were noble and patriotic and not at all beyond realization.</p>
   <p>He defended justice without regard to consequences. President Lincoln, after recognizing Schurz's excellent qualities, proffered him his friendship, accepting in return his collaboration.</p>
   <p>Intimately acquainted with the political affairs of our country almost from the moment he put foot on our soil, he realized that big things could be accomplished only by affiliating himself with a political party. Anxious to intercede in behalf of righteousness and justice, he immediately sought membership in a party.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0123.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>For this he was generously rewarded. However, he never yielded to bribery, and once he had arrived at a conclusion, nothing could deter him from his course. He placed public interest above the welfare of the party whose honored leader he was for many years. However, the dictates of his conscience led him to abandon the party because of his inability to reconcile two conflicting interests. He took this step with much regret.</p>
   <p>Schurz's political activities differed from those of the present-day politicians inasmuch as he remained true to his principles regardless of possible political consequences. Things are different today. The only political principle upheld at present is disregard for principles. It is possible that this complete change could not have been averted, because it has been shown that an era of heroic activities is succeeded by a period of materialistic trend. Idealism is not tolerated where materialism dominates.</p>
   <p>The Schurz centennial seems, therefore, a most fitting time to recall the life and work of that illustrious patriot. He was indeed a great and important <pb facs="5418474_11_0124.jpg" n="6"/>person, the hero of two continents. Let that great idealist serve us as an example. Let his spirit govern our practical politics for the benefit and salvation of the nation.</p>
