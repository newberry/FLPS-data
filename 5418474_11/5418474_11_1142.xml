   <p>The earthly remains of Charles Gabriel who lived in Chicago since 1854 and who died at his home, 7736 Yates Ave, Tuesday, at the age of eighty-one years, will be laid to rest at Graceland Cemetery this afternoon.</p>
   <p>The deceased was born in Germany and came to Chicago with his parents at the age of three years. He started his career in the steel construction line and superintended the erection of the steel structure of the old Masonic temple, which was for years Chicago's tallest building.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gabriel is survived besides his widow, Mrs. Crescentia Gabriel, by his two sons, Harry J. Gabriel, of Ponchatoula, La.,and Charles B. Gabriel, of Chicago; also by two daughters: Mrs. Estella Harms and Mrs. Barbara G. Brinck, who like-wise live in Chicago. Besides those, his passing is mourned by a great number of friends and acquaintances who will always honor his memory.</p>
