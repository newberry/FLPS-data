   <p>Emmanuel Gall, president of the Suabian society and honorary president of the men's chorus society "Harmony", was born in Affalderbach, Wuttemberg, Germany, in 1854.</p>
   <p>After finishing school, he entered the business of his parents as an apprentice and learned the trade of a stonecutter. In the year of 1873, at the age of 19 years, he emigrated to the United States, and joined his brother, a proprietor of a stone cutting concern, who, at that time lived in the township of Lakeview, not far from Graceland cemetery.</p>
   <p>Until 1875 the two brothers managed the business in partnership. Then he took over the business independently and for 53 years managed it with great success. He retired from business only a year and a half ago, and is now enjoying the twilight of his life in his home, 1416 Warner Ave., in which he has lived continuously for 40 years. Gall's name is well known in the German societies. He was president of the "Harmony" for 18 years, and the Suabian society, which he joined in 1893, saw him its president four times.</p>

   <p>In 1877 he married. This marriage was blessed with four children, one son and three daughters, who are still at home.</p>
