   <p>From midday of April 1<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>th, to noon, April 20th, 68<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>9 immigrants have landed at Castle Garden, 75 per cent of whom were Germans.</p>
   <p>The annals of the history of immigration reveal that, prior to this, there was never such a large number of immigrants recorded within the period of twenty-four hours, during the first four months of the year. To be more explicit, the immigration prior to these record breaking twenty-four hours, was already 71,194 in New York alone, for the current year. However, New York is not the only port of disembarkment, and therefore it may be said with reasonable certainty that immigration to this country will exceed the half million mark this year.</p>
   <p>This newspaper devoted in the past much space to the German mania for emigration; although it should be mentioned that the people of Switzerland are sharing that propensity in spite of the short period of compulsory military service in <pb facs="5418474_11_0606.jpg" n="2"/>Switzerland, as compared with the German military service.</p>
   <p>Not young people alone grew weary of their homeland but the aged likewise. We quote the comment of a Swiss newspaper: "So many are eager to emigrate. The majority is, however, well provided with the necessary funds, although only a few are certain about the immediate future. The departure of so much young blood and creative national vigor is regarded as a heavy loss for the Fatherland. The emigration of those in advanced years is, on the other hand, indicative of the decline of economic welfare in their native land."</p>
   <p>Since the Swiss immigration to this country is from the German part of Switzerland, it would seen a reasonable prediction, that these newcomers will help to strengthen the German element in America.</p>
