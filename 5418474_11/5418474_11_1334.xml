   <p>Mrs. Caroline Gross Busse, mother of the former mayor of Chicago, Fred A. Busse, died yesterday at the ripe old age of 79 years, at her home, 7558 Yates Avenue. She was the widow of Captain Gustav A. Busse. Mrs. Busse belonged to an old family of settlers in Chicago. Her parents emigrated from Germany in 1837. The Gross family home stood at the crossing of Monroe and Clinton Streets; where Mrs. Busse was born, on August 28, 1846. She was married to Captain Busse in 1865, after his return from the Civil War.</p>
   <p>In 1871 she lost all her property in the "Great Chicago Fire." Mrs. Busse was a co-founder of the National Society of the Loyal Legion, and also belonged to many other prominent women's societies. She was very active in church and benevolent societies. Her husband died 18 years ago, and her son, Fred, the former mayor, died twelve years ago. She is survived by two other children, Mrs. Albert G. Mang and George A. Busse. The funeral will take place from her home, Friday afternoon.</p>
