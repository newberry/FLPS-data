   <p>The old German actors and directors, who, in the course of decades gave so much enjoyment to German Chicagoans and their descendants, by arranging or performing theatrical plays, are getting fewer and fewer. Scarcely had death called director Max Hainsch when he went again to the bed of an old veteran of the German American stage, Robert Pepner.</p>
   <p>Hepner was born in Berlin. Full of humor and of an enterprising spirit, he was fit for America. About 45 years ago he came to Chicago as a greenhorn. The stage drew him, because it had done so before. He was an actor and manager for a number of years, and acquired great popularity, especially as director of the performances in the Vorwarts Turner Hall. Later, he became the proprietor of the tavern and dance hall of the Workingmen's Hall, Roosevelt Rd. and Waller Ave.</p>
   <p>For several years nothing was heard of Robert Hepner. He retired into private life. For over a year, a serious heart disease had confined him to his home. A few days ago pneumonia set in, and the weakened body of the man who was over 74 years old, could not offer any resistance. A very firm man was Hepner, and many of his friends will preserve his memory.</p>

   <p>The funeral will take place from his home, 1848 Belle Plaine Pl., Saturday afternoon to Waldheim cemetery. The Turner society Vorwarts and the Herder Lodge A. F. &amp; A. M. and others will accompany the body to the grave.</p>
