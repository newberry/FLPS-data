   <p>The latest actions and speeches of Governor Altgeld have brought the people of Illinois to the conclusion, that one governor has changed his mental attitude in politics and all related public affairs.</p>
   <p>Altgeld had been known all his life as a humanitarian, a friend of the poorer classes and a sincere politician.</p>
   <p>The latest labor troubles and increase of radicalism in labor ranks must have changed Altgeld to a subsequent indifference towards the well meant progressive aspirations of our working classes. In his latest speech, Altgeld is pointing out his firm intention to intervene at one with militia in case of sudden riots and organized labor upheavals. Apparently he don't believe any more in sensible investigations with a subsequent arbitration towards a peaceful understanding without the presence of bayonets. Altgeld is going even so far as to boast about having at least ten regiments on hand, which he will dispatch in the shortest time to any part of Illinois,if organized labor offers the necessary provacation.</p>
