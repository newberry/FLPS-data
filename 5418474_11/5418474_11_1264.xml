   <p>Jacob Lindheimer and Michael Rosenberg, two well known Chicago citizens of German descent, died almost at the same hour, yesterday, in St. Luke's Hospital. Both were for many years occupants of public offices and prominent Democrats.</p>
   <p>Their sudden demise will be a hard blow to the Democratic party of Cook County, because as Lindheimer in his capacity as county treasurer, served the public for many years, so did Rosenberg, up to his death fill the office of sanitary trustee.</p>
   <p>Rosenberg, who underwent a werious abdominal operation a week ago, from the effects of which he died, was buried yesterday. Funeral services were held at 1 o'clock in Piser's Chapel, 3111 West Roosevelt Road.</p>
   <p>Michael Rosenberg was born in 1885 in Chicago; he took over the old iron business from his father, and found time to devote himself to philanthropic, religious and political affairs. He was manager and director of a number of <pb facs="5418474_11_1265.jpg" n="2"/>religious and charitable organizations.</p>
   <p>Jacob Lindheimer was born in Germany, and came to Chicago in the year 1876. In 1891 he entered politics. He became tax collector and from then on till his death, he filled many responsible positions. In the years 1911 and 1912 while city treasurer, he particularly took an interest in the plight of his employees who were hard pressed by partial payment dealers. He gave them advances out of the city treasury.</p>
   <p>Up to his death Lindheimer was vice-president of the Democratic committee of Cook County; for many years he also was county treasurer. He was in the real estate business, and was a member of the Chicago Real Estate Board.</p>
