   <p>Dr. Philipp Wieland, member of the German parliament and proprietor of a large brass factory, is visiting the United States to inspect and study American manufacturing plants. After his arrival yesterday, he registered at the Bismarck Hotel, and then in the course of the day he inspected the steel works in Gary, Indiana.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wieland arrived from Butte, Mont., where he had inspected the big copper and zinc mines of Anaconda.</p>
   <p>The German manufacturer, on his visit to Washington was welcomed by President Coolidge and General Lord; he expressed his warm gratitude and <pb facs="5418474_11_0759.jpg" n="2"/>satisfaction for the hearty reception in this country. He believes that the New York-Berlin flight accomplished by Chamberlain and Levine will be an important factor in the formation of new connections between America and Germany. Dr. Wieland spoke about the immense proportions of American industry and about the demensions of the plants, and the organization of American industrial methods.</p>
   <p>He intends to remain in Chicago for quite a while and will start his return journey to Germany July 6th.</p>
