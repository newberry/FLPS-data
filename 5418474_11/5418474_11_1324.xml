   <p>Christian Carr, 75 years old, died this morning at the Grant hospital. This old loyal German for decades had fought bravely for the German cause, and had helped actively towards the development of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Christian Carr was born in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and settled before the great fire in Chicago. For many years he was the proprietor of a hardware store on Sedgwick Street.</p>
   <p>To singing societies, his death means a great loss, because of the popularity which he enjoyed wherever he went. The choral society "Fidelia" which was organized in 1852, lost with Christian Carr its last founder. Mr. Carr enjoyed until shortly before his death, the best of health and was surprisingly active. Kind providence permitted <pb facs="5418474_11_1325.jpg" n="2"/>the fulfillment of his last wish, to participate at the great singing festival in Peoria last June.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carr is survived by his widow, Mrs. Mathilde Carr, 71 years old, who for many years had been her husband's loyal companion; a daughter also survives.</p>
   <p>The Carr family are in excellent financial circumstances.</p>
