   <p>Philipp Groll, a former bakery owner, died at his home yesterday at the age of over 74 years. Our German citizens lost in him one of those pioneers, who knew Chicago since its beginning, and who helped to lay the foundation for the Western metropolis and its glory and fame. Mr. Groll lived in Chicago for forty-four years, and contributed his share in promoting the development and success of the city. When Groll came to Chicago it had less than 8,000 inhabitants.</p>
   <p>The famous Groll's bakery was located on La Salle Street, between Randolph and Lake Streets. Mr. Groll was also a member of the volunteer fire department, <pb facs="5418474_11_1787.jpg" n="2"/>and served with the present chief of the fire department, Sweeney, in the same company. When he opened his bakery in 1848, he was, as a German baker, the first of his trade in Chicago.</p>
