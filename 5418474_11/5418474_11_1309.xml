   <p>At the age of 48 years, the musician Wilhelm Speckin died today at his home, 6613 Greenview Avenue. Speckin, who was born in Lubeck, Germany, came to America 24 years ago. He lived first in Philadelphia and came to Chicago in 1910.</p>
   <p>In Philadelphia as well as in Chicago he was a member of the Symphony Orchestra and played for many years in the orchestra of the summer opera at Ravinia Park. His instrument was the bass-viol, which he mastered so well that he was not only considered a master, but also an authority in musical circles.</p>
   <p>He is survived and mourned by his widow and his 13-year old son. The funeral services will be held Tuesday. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the "Schlaraffia" will be represented.</p>
