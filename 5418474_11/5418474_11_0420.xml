  <body>
   <p>Three quarters of a century is a long time! Indefinite happenings envelope it, especially in the last 75 years. We only have to consider our own Chicago and Cook County, of its many changes which took place in this seemingly long time, but in the history of the world only a short time.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago, pictures of the old Chicago, the organization of the Lincoln Park etc., were published in the Abendpost. Today, a German family, who exactly 75 years ago, settled in Cook county and who developed into a widely branched family, shall be honored in print. From the family of Johann Friedrich Busse, of sturdy low German extraction, 148 families descended. All, except six, are living in Cook county; The development of Johannes Friedrich Busse and his descendents is a glorification of the German name; if all deeds were made known, then the people first would realize how immense the accomplishments of the cultural work of the German immigrants have been, and still are. The great grand father of the now living generation, originated from Hanover, Germany. He was born in 1800. He served in the German army. After quitting his military services and returning to civilian life, Busse, as a real and true farmer's son, took over the farm of his old parents and married. Six children were born. A son Heinrich immigrated in 1840 <pb facs="5418474_11_0421.jpg" n="2"/>to America. He settled in Wisconsin. A year later his five other brothers and sisters followed, also his parents. They went to Elk Grove, on the outskirts of Chicago. The neighborhood at this time consisted of heavy growths of timber, but a few German settlers were there already, also progressive villages like Des Plaines, Wheeling, Halfway, and Niles Center; but in comparison to the present time, the territory was thinly settled. For miles there was nothing but thick woods, where today are blooming fields. Immense pioneer work was accomplished. Hard work and little pay, but a free life and almost without worries, these were the characteristics of the settlers of those days, and of later years. A visit through these settlements at the present time, will give proof of the prosperity of its owners. The numerous little villages which are located near by Chicago bears witness of real and solid wealth and comfort.</p>
   <p>The settlement:</p>
   <p>The new immigrants obtained from Samuel Page a farm for $2,500.00. With hard work and endurance the family progressed and developed, so that now, it is branched out far and wide.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0422.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At the age of 77 years, after a life of hard labor, but also rich of blessings, the senior of the family Busse passed away. A year later his wife followed him. Of their children none is alive any more, only the 77 year old widow of the son Ludwig, Mrs. Christine Busse, who is a member of the County administration of many years standing. An uncle of the last named, Christian Busse, was also a member of the county administration and of the states equalization council.</p>
   <p>The family Busse not only cultivated a family life of true German fashion, but also participated in all mutual undertakings and in public life. Many confidential offices of the numerous towns and townships were occupied by different members of the family.</p>
   <p>Of the 45 grand children of Johann Friedrich and Johanne Busse, 36 are living, and they again with their children's children will come together to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the immigration and settlement of the grandparents, with a basket picnic. To the founders of the St. Johannes church the grand parents Busse also belonged. The speeches will be held both in German and in English.</p>
