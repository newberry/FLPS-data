   <p>There were eight thousand people in attendance at the Military Tract reunion today.</p>
   <p>Judge Altgeld was the principal speaker. At the close of his address, Miss Nellie Miller recited "The whistling Regiment" to a whistling accompaniment by Mrs. L. F. Gumbert, in a manner that aroused the utmost enthusiasm. Capt.J. B. Johnson of Kansas City, Kas., ex-Speaker of the House of Representatives of that state, was then introduced. He said he had addressed large crowds of people, but had never been called upon to talk to them in the open air before. His address was well received.</p>
   <p>An association of the army of the Potomac of the West was effected this afternoon, with Capt. Fordyce of Berwick, Ill. as president, and Samuel Terry of Galesburg as secretary.</p>
   <p>Regimental reunions were held this afternoon, as follows: Fifty-seventh, sixty-fourth, Sixteenth, Fiftieth, Eighty-third, Twenty-eighth and Forty-fourth Illinois, and Seventieth Missouri.</p>
