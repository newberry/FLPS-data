   <p>With the literacy tests for immigrants Senator Lodge of Massachusetts is in such a hurry that he wanted to force the acceptance of this bill immediately after abolition of the business rules. This means, he expected of the Senate to vote about such an important affair without any debate, while otherwise it is the custom of this body to talk for weeks over the most unimportant affair. With this motion he did of course not succeed, but the Senate resolved, to consider the bill as "unfinished" business until January 17th and to put it to a vote on that day. This means that no other bill can supersede this one and it must be put before the Senate on this day under all circumstances. Its acceptance is therefore almost certain.</p>
   <p>The bill differs only in a few points from the one President Cleveland stopped with his veto for undisclosed reasons. It is milder only to a slight extent; as it does not exclude the Canadian and Mexican migratory laborers any more <pb facs="5418474_11_0537.jpg" n="2"/>in consideration of our own migratory laborers in the Canadian gold districts. The alien-haters still claim, that the few thousand laborers who live in Canada or Mexico and find occassionally occupation in the United States, menace the Grand Republic with ruin, but they subordinate their patriotic anxieties to the insatiable "Anglo-Saxon" money hunger. For fear that the Ganadian Government could take reprisals and share the American gold diggers away from the Klondike, they will not close for the present time the frontier to the Canadian "birds of passage." This alone is remarkable for the sentiment of those Gentlemen who claim to worry only about the preservation of American customs and institutions. For gold their "holy" convictions become saleable!</p>
   <p>Since the first Lodge bill was killed by Cleveland's veto, immigration did not swell up in a dangerous way but it slowed up very considerably. The proof has therefore been shown that immigration does regulate itself, and that it is unnecessary to fear a "flooding" of the country by "uneducated foreigners" and that we need not further restrictions by law. Notwithstanding that Congress neglects its most important tasks, as e. g. the bankruptcy law and the improvement of the railroad laws, in order to hit the "foreigners" again.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0538.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But unfortunately it must be admitted that the Congress is incited by the Labor Organizations that overwhelmingly consists of immigrants. The "leaders" of the trade unions attack the foreigners consistently and the members, with few honorable exceptions, raise no opposition against these doings. Either they are too lazy to go to the meetings, or they are too prejudiced by the illusion that their own condition will improve when no more laboring forces are admitted. How erroneous this perception is, the future will show and besides the laborers will feel sorry for it some day that they lent their arm to the darkest reaction. The spirit of intolerance which they have invoked, they will not be able to dispose of so easy, and when finally the entire labor movement will be declared "un-American", they only can accuse themselves. That it will come to this, can be concluded not only from the many decisions of the American courts, but also from the turn which the fight against the Unions has taken in Great Britain. One need wait only for the destruction of their "tyranny" in the motherland, than it will be proceeded against also in the daughterland.</p>
