   <p>Governor Altgeld's friends, in order to weaken the accusations of Colonel Morrison against their leader, are telling the details of an attempt, which was made by the head of the commission to regulate Interstate Commerce, in May and June to approach the Governor of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Altgeld himself confirms the statement that Mr. Morrison in a very touching manner sought to obtain his friendship, and adds, the public, no doubt, will be able to draw its own conclusions, of the motives, which prompted Mr. Morrison to the declaration of war, and also of the old gentlemen's character.</p>
   <p>The governor spoke yesterday evening before three great and enthusiastic meetings, first at the People's Institute, then at the Vorwarts and lastly at the "Freiheit's Turnhalle." He did not lay much stress at all the three places on the currency-question, but on the fact, that among the Republican party leaders, there are many of a very doubtful character are to be found.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1646.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He called these Gentlemen the Modern Pharisee's and expressed the fear, that Christ, in case he returned to earth, would find the vocabulary of the English language insufficient, to characterize them, and would, for such purposes, have to use the Hebraic Idiom, which offers a larger variety of words.</p>
   <p>He says, that he is not so anxious to be reelected, as governor, as he is, to see the people at the National election show its independence from foreign millionaires...</p>
   <p>The silver people have started in earnest, to hold election meetings. Besides the three Altgeld meetings, they arranged yesterday seven other meetings, but the Republicans surpassed them, by holding not less than sixteen large meetings.</p>
