  <body>
   <p>Dr. Oswald L. Appelt, one of the younger German physicians of the North Side, was suddenly claimed by death. Last Sunday Dr. Appelt was still in good health; on Monday morning he was found dead in his home, 3749 Ward Street. A heart attack ended his life. Dr. Appelt was forty-nine years of age. He had his office at 3000 Lincoln Avenue. He came from the vicinity of Berlin, travelled for many years as a physician on the steamships of the North-German Lloyd, and finally established himself in Chicago some five years ago. Owing to his jovial nature he enjoyed great popularity in many circles on the North Side. The body is at the undertaking establishment of A. V. Furman, 3100 Irving Park Boulevard. The doctor had no relatives in this country, the consul general cabled, therefore to the brother of the deceased. His brother lives at Biedegast near Halle on the Saale. Instructions for the disposal of the body were requested by the Consulate.</p>
