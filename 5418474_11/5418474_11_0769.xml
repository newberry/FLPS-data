   <p>Mr. Gustave Moshak, a member of the German Foreign Institute, has requested the Abendpost to publish the following report so that every German-American may become better acquainted with the institute and give it whole-hearted support.</p>
   <p>Ten years ago, on the 10th of January, the German Foreign Institute at Stuttgart, Germany, started its praiseworthy activity. Its aim at that time was to foster the closest relationship possible between Germans and German-Americans, in regard to culture and economics, regardless of all such distinctions as citizenship, party politics and faith.</p>
   <p>If the institute today, after 10 years of activity, can be satisfied with the results obtained, this is largely due to the active support of innumerable Germans living abroad in all parts of the world. It also is a special pleasure to note that considerable support of the institute came from German fellow countrymen in the United States, a country,which next to Germany, contains the greatest number of Germans in the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0770.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But it is regrettable, that in spite of the great number of Germans in the United States, comparatively few are actively connected with the institute and support its work. It is a well known fact, based on many observations, that the reason for this is not a lack of understanding of the activities of the Foreign Institute, but ignorance of its problems. Therefore it would be well if all the Germans living abroad would join the organization and thereby become better acquainted with the same.</p>
   <p>All the Germans abroad are requested to send pictures, newspapers, and periodicals giving information regarding the activities of Germans in the United States. In return, the German element can be assured that all the material which is submitted to the institute, will be used.</p>
   <p>As proof we give the following information: In 1926 the department of pictures of the German Foreign Institute lent 30,000 pictures, free of charge; and in the same year it furnished information to 35,000 inquirers,also free of charge.</p>
   <p>It is also worth mentioning that the "Press Correspondence," published weekly by the institute,which contains reports about the life of Germans living abroad is distributed, also free of charge, to 24,000 newspapers at home and abroad....</p>
