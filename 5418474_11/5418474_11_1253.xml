   <p>Mr. Otto Berndt, who enjoyed great popularity in German circles, especially among singers, died yesterday morning at the age of 69 years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berndt came to America from Sommerda in Thuringia in 1882. He settled in Chicago in 1886, where he lived ever since. Under the name of Otto Berndt and Son he established a cigar store a few years later, which he developed, and handed over to his son Frank, in order to retire. Otto Berndt was for many years an active member of the Chicago Singing Club; of the Harngari Singing society; he also belonged to the Waldeck society, was an honorary member of the Suabian society, and a member of the Schleswig-Holstein <pb facs="5418474_11_1254.jpg" n="2"/>Singing Society. He was a true German, and enjoyed great popularity because of his uprightness and lovable character.</p>
   <p>The funeral ceremonies will take place Friday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in Constellation Temple, 3900 North Robey Street. The burial is to be at Montrose cemetery. He leaves besides his widow, two sons, three daughters and 13 grandchildren.</p>
