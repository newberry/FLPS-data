   <p>In the fields of science and technics a lively exchange between America and Germany has been an old custom, whose significance cannot be estimated too highly. Only in the field of art were the relations one sided. Germany gave, America took. Except experts, hardly anybody knew something of the real native American music. The reason is probably that the quantity of well known American composers is very small. These limitations in America had without doubt an oppressive effect upon the American composer and frustrated his creative power. The American music loving public which is extraordinarily large, ignores only too often their national pride and prefers European music in proportion of nine to one. Therefore the field of his creative power is limited, and the same thing happens to him as happens to the singers, who have to be, in a certain respect, first approved in Europe, before they can count upon a larger audience in America. In consideration of these conditions, the Chicago composer, Simon Bucharoff, is to be complimented for his endeavors to span a bridge between American composers and those of Germany, thereby make the German musical spheres attainable to the American. His plan is to raise a small fund which will enable the American composer to introduce his works into Germany.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0842.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bucharoff himself prepared a way to have the premier performance of his opera "Sakahra" in Germany next winter. He will now with the help of his local music loving friends and practicing musicians, as Frederick Stock Wessels, and others, do the same for his Chicago fellow artists. His plan includes further the organization of an American association, which will be accessible to the very eminent German composers and musical associations in the same way, as Americans are permitted to enter the German associations, and thereby at the same time, help to check the misery of the German artists. If this accomplishment is successful, the exchange of musical endeavors would be complete. It really would not matter, how much Germany and how much America would contribute to this exchange, but much more upon the creation of intimate mutual exchange in this field of art. That the American music would profit by these exchanges is natural; certainly such an encouragement would give the composer a wider field of efficiency, and thereby develop a specific American music which at the present time is only in the state of beginning, and which are mainly rooted in the negro melodies of the south. Germany certainly would welcome such undertakings because of their willingness, which has no equal, to place itself, its knowledge, its experience and its sound judgment at the service of a movement which concerns one or the other sphere of culture or will serve as a further development of same.</p>
