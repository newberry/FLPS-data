   <p>Mr. Ernest J. Kruetgen, Trustee of the Worlds Fair and president of its German group, was administered the oath by City Clerk Peter Brady on the occasion of his appointment to the Board of Local Improvements. Mr. Kruetgen went to the offices of the administration, which was just meeting, and was welcomed there by its president, Benjamin Lindheimer. The administration then went into executive session and elected Mr. Kruetgen as vice president, a position which was previously held by George K. Schmidt, before he became city treasurer in the Thompson administration.</p>
   <p>In his inaugural address Mr. Kruetgen mentioned, that he is no stranger to civic affairs, because, as a member of the School Board and later as a member of the Chicago Planning Commission, he learned a good deal.</p>
   <p>After the meeting, Mr. Kruetgen called on the Mayor, to officially present himself.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak welcomed Mr. Kruetgen heartily and expressed the hope that Mr. Kruetgen will feel at home in his new office.</p>
