   <p>It is rumored, that Governor Altgeld requested that the papers of the Anarchists Process be sent to him. For 2 years the "Amnesty-Association" made efforts to obtain a pardon for Oscar Neebe.</p>
   <p>General M.M. Trumbull, a member of the Association was greatly pleased yesterday, when he heard of the Governor's order. He declared, that the above association for years, was working, to obtain the freedom of Neebe, Schwab and Fielden. As long as Fifer was the Governor, their efforts were unsuccessful. As soon as Governor Altgeld was inaugurated, steps were taken again and a lively correspondence with the Governor in this matter carried on. The General added: "I think the Governor is ready now, to receive a delegation and I am convinced that we will be successful in spite of not having been given any definite promises."</p>
   <p>The petitions are ready and signed by thousands of prominent citizens.</p>
