   <p>A more improper time than the present could not have been selected by the Atlantic Navigation companies for their immigration rate war. As formerly cautious and farsighted business people, the heads of these companies seem in this case to be stricken with blindness. The reduction of the transportation costs to the ridiculous price of ten dollars (board included) points, of course, to an artificial stimulation and increase of immigration, and it was unavoidable that it enraged the enemies of immigration. It is twice as dangerous at a time when business in general is slack and when the import of alien laborers can be represented as threatening the labor of this country. Doubly dangerous, also, for the reason that only a few months separate us from the beginning of a new Congressional term in which, because the elections are now past, they will not be afraid to issue anti-immigration laws by a hostile majority, which they did not dare to do before the election. Also there is no Cleveland in the President's chair to veto such legislation. Roosevelt himself belongs to the proponents for further restriction of immigration.</p>
   <p>Generally there should be no reason to believe that a man who pays only $10. for his fare is less desirable than the one who has paid $20. or $30. On the contrary, <pb facs="5418474_11_0507.jpg" n="2"/>the less he has to pay for transportation the more money he has left when he lands. The rate war has not lasted very long as yet and already complaint after complaint is heard about the deterioration of the immigrant that it has caused. The highest official of the Department of Immigration, General Commissioner Sargent, has declared already that he has convinced himself with his own eyes, that the low rates have produced a terrifying increase of undesirable immigrants. Of course he will not fail to report accordingly to the President and thereby assist the enemies of immigration.</p>
   <p>A special impression will be made by reports from England according to which they try to get rid of the "scum" of the Russian and other undesirable immigration, that had settled in London and other large cities, and where they have been, for a long time, an object of great displeasure. The London Newspapers report, with frank pleasure, which smells like malicious joy, that Uncle Sam gets the unclean, disagreeable bunch of which they thought they never could rid themselves.</p>
   <p>Shuddering tales are related of the conditions in certain London districts, especially Whitechapel where the majority of the people often have from twenty to thirty in <pb facs="5418474_11_0508.jpg" n="3"/>a single room. In fact, what is related, may not be much worse than what was written by English historians about a large part of the pure English, Anglo-Saxon emigration that came over here in former centuries and whose descendants deem themselves today the aristocracy of this country. But those are old stories and known to few, while what is said for the disadvantage of the new arrivals is published in all papers of the country and is noticed by everybody.,...</p>
