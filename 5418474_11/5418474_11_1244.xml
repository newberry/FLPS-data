   <p>Among the best known personalities in the German element, not only of Chicago but of the United States, belongs undoubtedly, Judge Theodore Brentano, who was appointed in 1922 as American Ambassador to Hungary and who served at this post for several years.</p>
   <p>Brentano was born in Michigan in 1854. His parents who were of German descent, were Lorenz and Caroline Brentano. After finishing high school in his home town, he studied law in Germany and Switzerland to get his degree at the National University.</p>
   <p>In 1882 he was admitted to the bar in Washington. He came to Chicago and in 1887 became assistant corporation lawyer, in 1888, Assistant City Attorney, and served from 1890 to 1921 on the Superior Court bench as Judge; he later became Chief Justice of Illinois, and when he reached the age limit, he retired.</p>
   <p>In 1887 he was married to Minnie Claussenius of Chicago. Three daughters were born of this union.</p>
