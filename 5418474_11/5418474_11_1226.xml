   <p>Among eminent musicians of Chicago, Otto Wulf figures prominently. He was born in Gettdorf, near Kiel, Germany, on June 24, 1880. His brilliant work has earned him the distinction of having been named honorary citizen of his native city. He is also a member of the Beethoven House in Bonn.</p>
   <p>During his activity as a teacher, which covered a period of twenty-five years, Wulf acquired great fame. He is well known in the United States as well as in Europe. Many of his former students are world-famous virtuosos today.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1227.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His brilliancy shows itself in his concerts and in his Wagner interpretations at piano recitals, which did much in shaping his future and greatness.</p>
   <p>Otto Wulf is a member of the Steuben Club, the Germania Club, Schleswig-Holsteiner Saenger-Bund (Song Club), and a Good Fellow of the Fellowship Steubensia. He is the director of the National Institute of Music.</p>
