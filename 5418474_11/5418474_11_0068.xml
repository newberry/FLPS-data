   <p>Monday morning, October 9, after the fire had crossed the river, many anxious eyes were fixed upon the tower of the Hartmann Church, at the corner of Ohio and La Salle Streets. In vain people hoped that the fire would not go beyond the Church.</p>
   <p>Once more the Northside people are looking at the Church but with different emotions. The Church is being rebuilt. The St. Paul Lutheran Evangelical Church, as it is called officially, but is simply known as Hartmann's Church, by the people, has a past which explains perfectly the devotion of its members. It was built in 1843 at the time when "Germanism" was still weak in Chicago and when the actual site was still outside the city limits. Of the sixty original members some have died, while others are today among those who wish to rebuild Chicago. The financial means formerly did not allow an imposing structure. Through the intermediary of Wm. B. Ogden, the Church received the land at Ohio Street from Walter A. Newberry. A frame Church was built at first, the total cost being $1,600.00. After eleven years the development was such that in the year 1854, there was erected an $18000.00 Church that was destroyed by <pb facs="5418474_11_0069.jpg" n="2"/>the fire of October 9th.</p>
   <p>Since its inception, the parish has had only three pastors. At first Pastor Selle for three years, then Pastor Fischer for four years and for the last twenty-two years, Pastor Hartmann.</p>
   <p>The obtaining of means for the new Church was not easy. The new building will cost $50,000.00. Pastor Hartmann collected $11,000 on his trip East.</p>
