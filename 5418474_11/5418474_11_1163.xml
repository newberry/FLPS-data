   <p>The funeral of Adolph Steiner, who died in his home on West Center Street, at the age of ninety-two years, will take place tomorrow afternoon, at 2:00 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Steiner was a veteran of the Civil War, and dived with his brother Gustav Steiner in Park Ridge. He was an Alsatian born in Strassburg. In the year 1843 he undertook the trip to America; it took a long time in the sailing ship, and the trip took him across the ocean, into the great lakes to Chicago. A heart attack was the cause of his death. He served his adopted country as volunteer during the Civil War, in Company D of the 58th Illinois Infantry.</p>
