   <p>A large meeting of the Chicago Colorado colony was held last evening in Arcade Hall.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Robert Collyer, president of the colony, in calling the meeting to order, expressed his satisfaction with the idea of the colony, saying if it was carried out as it ought to be, and as he believed it would be, it would be one of the best movements ever started. There could be no doubt that there were large cities to be founded in the west, and a company going out to settle could found a village with schools, etc., necessary to an advanced civilization. He alluded to the trials of individuals when they settled alone on the public lands.</p>
   <p>W. M. Byers, the first man to take a press to Colorado, was then introduced. He pointed to a map on the blackboard, showing Denver, Cheyenne, the Black Hills, and the course of the railroad between them, and the site of the Greely colony on the Cache La Poudre River. He alluded to the Chicago German colony, which now has 50,000 acres ready for irrigation, and 150,000 acres more in course of preparation.</p>
   <p>At the close of his lecture, a vote of thanks was extended to him, after which the meeting adjourned , when a number of persons subscribed to the articles of the colony.</p>
