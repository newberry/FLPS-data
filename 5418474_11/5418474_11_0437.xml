   <p>The World War has afforded more opportunity for the manifestation of exaggeration, hysteria, and "hypersentimentality" (sic) than any previous war, and it is a deplorable fact, especially with respect to the future internal peace of our country, that our American people in particular showed such a strong tendency indiscriminately to follow after the charlatans of public opinion. [Translator's note: The word "hypersentimentality" appears in English in the original.]</p>
   <p>The snooping of such societies as the National Security League, the Protective League, the Knights of Liberty, etc., which incited the various nationalities to mutual hatred and violence (with the aid of the greater part of the public press); the hanging and flogging, the tarring and feathering of citizens upon mere gossip or unfounded accusations or for failure to follow exactly <pb facs="5418474_11_0438.jpg" n="2"/>the instructions of secret committees--these and similar happenings have left a permanent stain on America's honor. The greater number of so-called patriotic organizations have now discontinued their "free services"; some of these societies, for instance, the National Security League, are now forced to submit to a rigid investigation of their motives, methods, and financial affairs; the newspapers and magazines which indulged in defaming not only our enemies but also American citizens have discontinued their derogatory activities; and the public at large is gradually assuming an attitude which is comparable to the awakening from a bad dream.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it must be doubly disagreeable, when a subordinate official--if he can be so classified--disturbs the reconstruction of the Republic's peaceable relations by making public statements which are hardly excusable, since official investigation has revealed that they are untrue. Last Saturday Lajos Steiner, a representative of the Division of Information of the Bureau of War Commerce, appeared before the Senate committee which is investigating enemy propaganda. This committee is holding its meetings in Washington. According to a report which was published in the New York Times, Mr. Steiner <pb facs="5418474_11_0439.jpg" n="3"/>declared that hostile governments, through their consulates and in other ways, are persuading their former citizens who are now living in the United States to send their savings abroad, ostensibly to support needy relatives but actually in order to be able to strip the citizens of these savings when they return to their native land. [Translator's note: This illogical sentence is a faithful rendition of the original sentence. Presumably the "citizens" referred to are nationals of foreign countries who have not become citizens of the United States.] It is said that $400,000,000 is thus sent out of our country every year. Furthermore, Steiner knows that the great transatlantic steamship companies are strongly opposed to the naturalization of the 17,500,000 immigrants who are living in America, because these immigrants would have no reason to visit their former homelands after becoming American citizens. And, according to the third main point of Mr. Steiner's testimony, there are 25,000 foreign language newspapers in the United States. With but a very few exceptions, these publications are "un-American," and, in dozens of cases, they are "hostile to our country". Incidentally, there are numerous other accusations; for instance: many foreign language newspapers, <pb facs="5418474_11_0440.jpg" n="4"/>a large percentage of the clergy, teachers, etc. are in the pay of European governments. Attached to Mr. Steiner's report is the remark: "Senator Overman thanked the witness heartily for the valuable information".</p>
   <p>In reply to the sensational statements of Mr. Steiner one could point out--if it were at all worthwhile to pay any attention to Steiner's ravings--that the Federal Government, from President Wilson down to the most subordinate official of the treasury, has often called attention to the inspiring patriotism and the invaluable services with which the foreign language press supported the cause of America; that the achievements of the foreign born and the sons of the foreign born were equal to those of the bravest defenders of our country; and that in many places the foreign born element ranked first in the purchase of Liberty bonds, war-saving stamps, thrift stamps and in contributions to war charities. However, we cannot forego the opportunity to compare some of his alleged "information" with a report of the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior. Incidentally, this report is found in the same issue of the Times in which Mr. Steiner's statements were published. <pb facs="5418474_11_0441.jpg" n="5"/>According to the report of the Bureau of Education, there were 33,000,000 foreign-born or foreign-bred persons in the United States in the year 1910; the report records 1,575 foreign language newspapers, not 25,000.....</p>
   <p>If the other assertions which Mr. Steiner made are no more reliable than his statistics, then Mr. Overman's expression of gratitude appears to be groundless and, therefore, superfluous.</p>
