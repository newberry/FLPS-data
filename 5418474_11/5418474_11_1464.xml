   <p>Fred A. Busse, former Mayor and Postmaster of Chicago, one of the greatest Republican politicians of the city and of the state, and a very active business man, died yesterday, in his home, 4852 Sheridan Road, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon. Although Mr. Busse has been ailing for some time, his relations and friends did not suspect that his death was so near and would come so suddenly. The original malady of the deceased was a rheumatic fever. This was joined by an inflammation of the stomach. The invalid spent on account of these complications, several months in the Mercy Hospital, which he left, upon his own request, in order to return to his home. His physician, Dr. L. C. Mix, declared at that time that his patient was not in danger of his life, and that his recovery could be expected soon. But the suffering, which lasted so long, sapped his vitality, and he was unable to withstand a relapse. This occurred day before yesterday, and his death followed, yesterday forenoon. The news of Mr. Busse's demise spread like wildfire in the business section of the city, and friends and acquaintances of the former mayor were deeply shocked. Mayor Harrison issued a proclamation to the city council to appear today at a special meeting to make the necessary preparations for the mourning ceremony. In all probability the city council with the mayor at its head, will participate at <pb facs="5418474_11_1465.jpg" n="2"/>the funeral. Corporation counsel Brundage who served under Busse, expressed himself about the demise of former Mayor Busse as follows: "I can only utter my deep felt regret, over this sudden death. I stood so close to Mr. Busse that his demise means a personal loss to me. Those among us, who knew him intimately know how to appreciate his generosity of which he gave many proofs.</p>
   <p>The deceased was born in Chicago, March 3rd, 1866, His father, the late Gustav Busse, served in the army during the Civil War, and was discharged with the rank of Captain. Fritz grew up on the North Side, and was known amongst all his contemporaries. In his younger years, he worked in his father's hardware store. He scarcely became of age, when he entered politics, and soon played a prominent role. First he was elected as clerk of Northtown, in 1891. Then he became usher of the court, and soon afterwards assistant Sheriff. Later he was elected to the State's Legislature and State Senate. In the year 1902 he was elected State Treasurer, after expiration of this term, President Roosevelt appointed him Postmaster of Chicago.</p>
