   <p>From Delavan Lake, Wis., comes the news, that an old well known German, who formerly lived in Chicago for many years and acquired a number of friends and acquaintances has died at the ripe old age of 86 years.</p>
   <p>Born in Bielefeld, he came to America as a young man, settled in Chicago, and took over after a short time, the Apollo Hall on Blue Island Ave. and 12th St., which was a rallying place of the good Germans of the southwest.</p>
   <p>On account of his jovial nature, he was very popular and thanks to his circumspection and obligingness, his business enjoyed great prosperity. He sold same later and built himself the Woodlawn Bay Hotel, in Delavan, Wis., which he also managed with great success, until he turned it over to his son, William, and retired altogether. He leaves only this son; his wife preceded him in death a number of years ago.</p>
