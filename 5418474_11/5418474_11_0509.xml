   <p>Twenty-five German immigrants reported at Police headquarters today and demanded the arrest of the Employment Agent, Louis Krampe, 135 North Clark Street for obtaining money under false pretences. According to their statements they were sold into slavery in the Mississippi Oyster territory by the accused. Hermann Mueller, 6614 May Street, the leader of the complainants, was the only one of the crew who could understand and speak English. The rest were all new immigrants.</p>
   <p>According to the statements of Mueller he and his fellow complainants came in connection with Krampe by answering an ad and declared themselves willing to go to Pensacola, Florida, to work there in an oyster packing plant. Krampe promised the wages of $2.00 a day for men, and $1.50 a day for women.</p>
   <p>On December 26th they started the voyage in a special car of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railway. Two days later they were unloaded in a town which they <pb facs="5418474_11_0510.jpg" n="2"/>believed to be Pensacola. After the train left they found out that they were at Bay St. Louis, Miss.</p>
   <p>"About an hour later", - Mueller related to Detective Gallagher, who was ordered to arrest Krampe - "A foreman of an oyster packing plant appeared at the Bay and commanded us to board some trucks that brought us to the factory. The latter is the property of the firm of James Dunbar and Sons.</p>
   <p>The next morning we started to work. We had to open oysters, and received one cent for each pound of oyster meat. We worked for three days, realized that the strongest and fastest man among us could hardly earn fifty cents a day. We talked the matter over and insisted that we would not do any more work until we could speak to the manager of the concern.</p>
   <p>What is the idea?" said Dunbar. "I have not sent for you and you should be glad that I gave you work. I paid $5.00 for each one of you. It might be better for you to take up the work again at once!"</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0511.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I stated that we would open no more oysters, but that we were willing to work with the oyster fishermen who are earning more.</p>
   <p>No, said Dunbar, nothing doing. You go back to the factory or you quit. And if you don't go back at once I will have you all arrested.</p>
   <p>I declared to the gentlemen that we have friends in Chicago who would look after our interests. The next morning the railway car that brought us there was pulled up again. We were ordered to board it and not to show our faces again. We were brought back to Chicago. When we complained to Krampe he refunded to each of us $5.00 of the $10.00 we had paid him. He declared that the Labor Agent, Gregg of the Frisco Railway System had requested him to ship us. We had believed that we would find remunerative occupation in the south.</p>
   <p>We have to get hold of Krampe. The court investigation will decide whether he is guilty or someone else.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0512.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mueller signed the order for arrest against Krampe, who was accused nine times before in similar cases.</p>
