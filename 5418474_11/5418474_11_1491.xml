   <p>Various attempts of our present Democratic leaders, to dig out the good old political Altgeld plank, is showing, how human progress did not make any headway since Altgeld's time.</p>
   <p>Let us repeat, what Altgeld then wrote and afterwards became a part of the democratic platform, adopted by the Democratic National Convention:</p>
   <p>"We are particularly opponents of a government ruling with injunctions, as a new and dangerous form of oppression, whereby federal judges, disregarding the laws of the states and the rights of the citizens are becoming lawmakers, judges and law executors alike. We therefore approve the bill adopted by the U. S. Senate and soon to be submitted to the House of Representatives which concerns the contempt of court proceedings in Federal Courts and prescribes a jury trial in certain cases of contempt of court."</p>
   <p>These sentences were spoken at a time, when radical elements ruled the Democratic Party as never before and as never since.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the bill mentioned never passed the U. S. House of Representatives.</p>
