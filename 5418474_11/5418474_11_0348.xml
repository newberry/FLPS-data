   <p>For many years our authorities have shown that along with immigration we are also confronted with considerable emigration. The strangers coming to our hospitable shores do not always find matters conforming to their expectations. Many return to their fatherlands, rich in experience but deficient in funds. Others have the knack of utilizing the possibilities offered by the nation. They work and save, eventually acquiring a little money. But they will not be assimilated. They learn to speak the language about as well as necessity requires, but at heart they remain foreigners. These people return to the native hearth with their acquired. treasure <pb facs="5418474_11_0349.jpg" n="2"/>(whatever that may amount to), buy a farm or an established business and thus support themselves during their declining years.</p>
   <p>Americans have often frowned upon this practice and have considered it unfair. Such people stand accused, as Theodore Roosevelt once said, of regarding the United States as an international lodginghouse. They are reproached with having come to the United States for the sole purpose of extracting money from it. They remain foreigners because they have no intention of becoming Americans. They will not be absorbed, either in the social or in the economical sense, although the land offers them a comfortable existence. Nevertheless, these people must work hard for their money; they acquire nothing <pb facs="5418474_11_0350.jpg" n="3"/>gratuitously. Even if their conduct is an injustice, legally not much can be done about it.</p>
   <p>But what can one say about native Americans who deliberately leave this land and live elsewhere indefinitely? They constitute a much larger group then is generally conceded. A report from Washington shows that 435,000 Americans emigrated during the last twelve years. This contingent intends to remain in foreign countries permanently. A man with statistical propensities, using the government report as a basis, figured that 697.1 Americans departed each week during the last twelve years; this amounts to approximately one hundred departures per day.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0351.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It may be assumed that in this exodus there are also found a number of commercial travellers representing large corporations. But these constitute only a small fraction of the whole, and most of them have no intention of always remaining beyond the boundaries.</p>
   <p>There are also many American farmers who have settled in Canada, but they, too, are not numerous. Who, then, are the Americans who deliberately leave the "Land of the Free," the "Home of the Brave"? They are well known. London, Berlin, Paris, and other European cities boast of large American colonies. These people live in foreign countries because they feel at home there, more so than in America. Most of them are sufficiently prosperous to enjoy a liberal income; others are not so fortunate and must earn their living.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0352.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After all, it is not surprising that they prefer to live elsewhere. It has often been claimed that prohibition is the fundamental cause. But that is only partly true. It is the spirit of prohibition, its revolt-inspiring attitude; the incessant control, police cudgels, bureaucratic supervision and interference, which nearly encompass every human pursuit--all of this instills disgust for the American homeland and promotes a desire to leave it.</p>
   <p>Can you blame them for their unwillingness to live in a country where the drinking of beer or a highball, or the smoking of a cigarette is considered a serious transgression, while habitual, genuine criminals, allied with politicians, control large cities?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0353.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Political and religious pressure, one and a half centuries ago, induced Europeans to forsake that continent. In later years hordes migrated to America, because the economic situation was more auspicious. Today, we witness a reversal of this mass-movement.</p>
   <p>Americans, by the hundreds of thousands,are intent upon escaping from the present, unbearable whip-rule, so dextrously applied by fanatics, strong-arm moralists, snoopers, and reformers.</p>
   <p>Europe offers a haven for Americans; hence the exodus.</p>
