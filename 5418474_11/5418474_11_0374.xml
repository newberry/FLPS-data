   <p>When emigration was permitted again, critics approached the German immigrant and subjected him to severe criticism. He undoubtedly is in a difficult position, because regard for the Germans has greatly diminished, on account of the war propaganda. The German therefore, encounters many unjustified prejudices even today.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0375.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is regrettable that the German immigrants, according to the critics, have not always complied with their duties, and often reports have been sent through the press complaining of the conduct of German immigrants in the country where they settled.</p>
   <p>The following principles may guide the German in how to conduct himself in his adopted country:</p>
   <p>First: Always remember that you are a German.</p>
   <p>Second: Remember that you are enjoying the hospitality of a foreign country.</p>
   <p>Do not forget your old homeland in the new country. Strive to win esteem for Germans in foreign countries, and resent with dignity and pride any humiliation caused you as a member of a defeated country; you are entitled to respect on account of the German people's deeds.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0376.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Seek association with other German immigrants and cultivate German ways and customs. Keep your mother tongue and also strive to awaken love of the German language in your children and assist them in preserving it. Respect the laws and regulations of your adopted country and always act in such a way as not to offend your fellow-citizens.</p>
   <p>Avoid interference with politics of the country of which you are a guest. In trouble, give your assistance - if at all - only to the rightful government, and abstain from an attitude in regard to foreign politics entirely.</p>
   <p>Do not criticise the conditions of foreign countries, as long as you are not acquainted with the habits and customs. Remember, that this country is the fatherland of those people who are granting hospitality to you.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0377.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Respect habits and customs of your new fellow-citizens. Meet them with politeness, but also with dignity and pride, when they try to insult you as a German.</p>
