   <p>It is indeed of little importance whether or not the European Press approves our recent election.</p>
   <p>In Europe they know little about the conditions in our country, with the exception of only a few; furthermore, they are governed by a intense prejudice against this republic of ours.</p>
   <p>McKinley was never a favorite either of the German or of the Austrian press. If his name appears, it seems to be necessary to make the sign of the cross, just as if Satan himself had been mentioned. They reproach McKinley for his interference with European industry. Furthermore, most of the German and the Austrian press sided against us during the conflict with Spain. They went even further in their antagonistic attitude, by ridiculing our army and navy. Only recently a disgraceful poem was published in the "Kladderadatsch,"a Berlin newspaper, which we have put on display in our offices. Only a small percentage of the German press is in sympathy with the policy of our country. For instance, the well edited Frankfurter Zeitung acknowledges our accomplishments, and our position among the most powerful nations of the world. Concerning our recent <pb facs="5418474_11_0967.jpg" n="2"/>election, the Frankfurter Zeitung said: "It is impossible to disregard the political achievement attained by that colossal country known to us as America; neither can the world remain passive to America's commercial competition." There are still newspapers in Germany which consider the German-American citizens as members of the German Reich. As such, they are expected to exercise their political influence, in favor of German commerce and industry. How stupid:</p>
   <p>In matters of politics and economics we, German-Americans, are true Americans. We agree with the Anglo-Americans; our first concern is the welfare of our country. To those newspapers which misrepresent our attitude and question our sincerety as Americans, we reply that not only do they insult us, but they also belittle us in the eyes of the Anglo-Americans. When we took the oath as American citizens, we ceased to be subjects of the German Empire. The loyalty of German-Americans cannot be questioned.</p>
   <p>This we have demonstrated during the Civil War and on various other critical occasions. If the German journalists were only partly as intelligent as their government, they would cause the latter less concern. They should remember the words of the Emperior who stated not long ago: Politically, I know no German-<pb facs="5418474_11_0968.jpg" n="3"/>Americans, but only Americans."</p>
   <p>This viewpoint we also share. This country is our country; we belong to this nation and we shall defend it, because it is our country, right or wrong.</p>
