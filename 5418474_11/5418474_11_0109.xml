   <p>In his flower-decked office, which, like all the adjoining rooms, was crowded with friends, Ernest S. Kruetgen took the oath of office this morning as Chicago's new postmaster. Federal Judge Page conducted the solemn ceremony and was also the first to give the new postmaster his best wishes.</p>
   <p>Among those present one could see many prominent German-Americans who had come to be witnesses of how one of their own number assumed a position which had already been held for twelve years by a good German-American. In the many speeches that were made there was perceptible, along with the pleasure at Mr. Kruetgen's appointment, a certain regret at the resignation of the former postmaster, Arthur C. Lueder.</p>
   <p>The vice-president of the Iroquois Club, James F. Bishop, acted as master of <pb facs="5418474_11_0110.jpg" n="2"/>ceremonies and introduced the various speakers. The first speaker was the retiring postmaster, Mr. Lueder, who took the opportunity to thank his fellow citizens for the confidence that they had shown him during the time that he had held office, and to wish his successor luck. Other speakers were Chief Postal Inspector Walter Johnson, William O'Connell, Congressman [A. J.] Sabath, County Clerk Sweitzer, Charles J. Vopicka, and James Kearns.</p>
   <p>At the end of the short but impressive ceremony the new postmaster expressed his thanks to them all. Never in his life, he said, had he found it so difficult to find suitable words to express his feelings. It made him proud, he declared, to see again how many friends he had, and he promised these friends and all the citizens of Chicago that he would make every effort to be a credit to them and to justify the confidence which had been placed in him.</p>
   <p>After the conclusion of the official part of the installation ceremony, hundreds crowded up to clasp the hand of the new postmaster and of his wife, who <pb facs="5418474_11_0111.jpg" n="3"/>was looking on with tears of joy in her eyes, and to wish them good luck in the rest of life's journey. It would be impossible to mention the names of all the different people who were there. It should be noted, however, that the members of the Germania Club, the singers and turners, societies of which Mr. Kruetgen had been a member for years, as well as the organizations which are more political in character, were present in full force.</p>
