   <p>Rev. Sommerlatte, manager of the "Harbor Mission" of the Reformed Church in New York, reports the following: "Being employed as a missionary in the Harbor of New York for the last eight years, I have paid particular attention to the landing of German steerage passenger and have assisted them as much as possible.</p>
   <p>During the past year we witnessed to our sorrow how the healthiest and strongest German were compelled by force to return to Germany, after they had been held in New York for weeks. All steerage passengers are under very strict regulations. Whoever has no definite promise of getting work here, whoever had been in jail or penitentiary, whoever is weakly or sickly or well advanced in years, all these must return to Germany. Women with illegitimate children, married women, if the husband is not already in the United Statesm must return to Germany. Clerks, students, lawyers, teachers, army-officers, public-officers, all these are being sent back because they are not skilled workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0526.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Persons, who have relatives or friends here, are permitted to land, provided the latter agree to take care of the immigrants. In case the friends or relative refuse to do so, the immigrants can be sent back. If any of the immigrants cannot answer the 25 questions about his personal affairs to the perfect satisfaction of the officials, or he betrays in the least that he has prospect of work, his case is referred to a special office. Upon the decision of these special officers depends the fate of the immigrants.</p>
   <p>"Formerly the immigration commissioners were of German descent and therefore liberal. But in recent times all the officers have been Irish and besides, the most important positions are held by outstanding leaders of the trade unions, therefore unreasonable severity prevails.</p>
   <p>"The latest regulation is that the immigrants must state to what religion he or she belongs. A Catholic has a better chance to get through because most of the officials are Catholics.........</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0527.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"All immigrants, coming in as steerage passengers are treated like prisoners, whether they deserve it or not."</p>
   <p>These conditions although somewhat exaggerated in certain respects are actually prevailing. The official attitudes and actions towards these immigrants has changed and is now rather insulting and abusive. The immigration laws are applied with unreasonable severity, particularly since Powderly has been appointed as Immigration Superintendent. Since the fire on Ellis Island this problem has become more difficult. There are now not sufficient buildings to give to the immigrants the necessary comforts during their stay for a closer examination, or waiting for a written security from their relatives or friends. Their stay indeed is similar to a jail sentence.</p>
   <p>The total number of immigrants who have been sent back is not as large as one would assume according to the above portrayal, and may not exceed a total of 1,500.</p>
