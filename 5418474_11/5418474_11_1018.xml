   <p>The Westliche Post received this telegram from Washington:</p>
   <p>"The Associated Press printed the news that Ambassador Pendleton sent a report to the State Department In Washington, indicating that Bismarck is displaying his animosity toward the German-Americans in Germany more than ever before, and ordered that no consideration be shown them. But the State Department denounces this report as without any basic truth."</p>
   <p>As long as Mr. Pendleton does not receive such reports directly from the Reichs-Chancellor's office, he does not concern himself about thousands of his fellow-citizens. Bismarck and his co-workers regarded the mistreatment of German-American citizens as a domestic problem, and did not consider it their duty to inform the American Ambassador of it.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1019.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The German Government Boards received their instruction on how to deal with those American citizens of German birth, who left Germany prior to serving their term of compulsory service.</p>
   <p>If the existence of such conditions is not known to Mr. Pendleton, then he, like Cleveland and Bayard, does not read any news! Our reports are based on the truth! Contrary to the interpretation of the Bancroft Treaty, which Bismarck himself presented to the Reichstag ( at a time when he had not been possessed by a raving madness against America and German-Americans), the new order provides for all the American citizens of German birth, who left Germany before serving their period in the military service, either to be barred from entering Germany, or, at the best, permit them only a sojourn of weeks or a few months.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1020.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And these are the young worshippers of Bismarok who came to this country during the last ten years, and who, in their idol-worshipping of the Kaiser and Bismarok, disgusted the older generation of our German-Americans. These people who praise Bismarok as the infallible but worldly pope of Germany and loudly applaud his every despotic whim, who came here with the idea of accumulating sums of money, with which to live comfortably in Germany ever after, those Oleo-Margerine Germans who are now being trampled upon by their idols, can surely not expect our sympathy. These are the men, who knew nothing of the German-Americans of the fifties (50's) and sixties (60's), who boasted that only since Bismarok's great deeds have become generally known, the position of the Germans in America has been recognized.</p>
