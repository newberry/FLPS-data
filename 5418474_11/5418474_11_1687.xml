   <p>Only 48 years old, Robert Kiesling died yesterday at his home. Besides his widow, 4 grown-up sons are mourning his death.</p>
   <p>Born in 1847 in Germany, Robert Kiesling came to America in 1880 and settled down in Chicago, where he struggled hard to get on his feet. He finally succeeded in having a little store at the corner of Blue Island Avenue and Mc Cormick's Road. On the side he studied hard and at the same time became a well known figure in the German Society life.</p>
   <p>In 1886, Robert Kiesling became editor at the "Arbeiter Zeitung". In 1888 he followed a call of the "St Louis Tageblatt." He stayed on its staff for three years. He then returned to Chicago, where he became one of the editors of the "Abendpost." This position he still occupied at the time of his death. Robert Kiesling was a member and secretary of the National Association of German American Journalists, and an outstanding figure in the German-American newspaper world.</p>
