<title level="a">ALTGELD AND THE DEMOCRATIC JUDICIAL TICKET. HOW THE CANDIDATES BESIEGE THE MAYOR</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>It was rumored, that Ex-Governor Altgeld, if not openly, then secretly approves the revolt of the Silver party and the Populists, against the Judicial Ticket, which the regular Democratic Machine was putting in the field, but this has been proved to be a mistake. Altgeld, on the contrary, strives to reconcile the hostile brothers, and Captain Black, the acknowledged leader of the party rebels, had to give him the promise, that they would refrain for the present, from calling a convention to nominate candidates as judges. In accordance with this decision, President Shakelford, sent to all Silver clubs yesterday evening, the official notification, that the convention has been postponed.</p>
   <p>The geniune Populists, and the Bimetallic Union, who are not satisfied with this arrangement, and perceive a betrayal, are determined, to act, from now on, on their own hook. In the Tremont House, their leaders will devise a plan of action, tomorrow, and it looks as if the Democrats would not be spared an attack in the flank. But the Republicans are also threatened, in their own ranks.</p>
