   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The new German Consul in Chicago, Dr. Walther Wever, arrived with his wife and their three children yesterday. Dr. Wever functioned as German Consul in Rio de Janeiro before his transfer to Chicago. He is the son of His Excellency the Privy Councillor and Attorney General, Dr. Wever, and the descendant of an old and prominent family of jurists. He received his early education in Berlin and later studied law at the University of Heidelberg.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wever was born June 24, 1859, in the city of Berlin. After he received his degree in 1887, he functioned for a short time as judge in one of the courts of Berlin, but in December of the same year he entered the foreign office. In July, 1888, he was transferred to the German Consulate in Paris. In 1890 he was called upon to manage the affairs of the German Consulate in Bucharest. This position was only temporary, for he was soon appointed vice-consul at Sofia, Bulgaria. Then followed his appointment in 1893 as chief consul at <pb facs="5418474_11_0970.jpg" n="2"/>Rustschuk and another appointment in 1895 as Consul in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
