   <p>Once again the German-Americans of this great city gathered at the Morrison Hotel, last night, to pay tribute to two German fliers, who a year ago made the difficult but successful attempt at crossing the ocean from east to west. The celebration was held in honor of the courageous Captain Herman Koehl and Baron Guenther von Huenefeld. The premature death of the latter has been keenly felt and deeply mourned by every person of German ancestry. Today, we commemorate the first anniversary of their successful flight and landing on Greenley Island. It affords us the opportunity to inscribe with gilded letters the accomplishments of these aviators, who have added glory to the enterprising spirit of Germany.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0731.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Two bronze busts, representing the aviators, were presented on this occasion to Dr. Hugo Simon, Consul General for the German Reich, by the German people of Chicago. According to previous arrangements made with Paul Loebe, President of the German Parliament, and Mr. Guerard, Minister of Transportation, the busts will be permanently installed in the Berlin Exhibition Hall for Transport and Aviation.</p>
   <p>Reproductions of the busts, as well as, the dedication slab were placed in front of the speakers' platform. The busts, dedicated to the German Republic, were the gifts of Chicago's citizens of German extraction, honoring the men who conquered the air in an east to west flight over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
   <p>Michael Girten, Consul General for Austria, and toastmaster on this occasion, presented Mr. M. E. Meigs, editor of the Herald and Examiner, as first speaker of the evening. Mr. Meigs, himself an aviator, recalled the history-making <pb facs="5418474_11_0732.jpg" n="3"/>flight of these distinguished men before entering upon the subject of aviation in general. "Chicago," he said, "must become as great an airway center as it is a railroad center. An adequate airport is our urgent need. Therefore, I call upon you, my fellow-citizens, to use your influence for the realization of this necessary project."</p>
   <p>Mr. Ernest J. Kruetgen, the principal speaker of the evening, then delivered the dedication address. In his praise of the Reich Republic, he said: "The vital strength of Germany is indestructible; her losses bring forth renewed and inexhaustible vigor!" Then speaking of the honored heroes, he said: "We pay tribute today to two outstanding Germans, Koehl and Huenefeld, who personify the true German spirit." With these words, he entrusted the bronze busts--just then unveiled-- to the care of Dr. Hugo Simon, who was to carry out further instructions. "We are eager," he said, "to make it known to the German nation that we too appreciate outstanding accomplishments, and that we too are proud of the German Fatherland."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0733.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The German Consul, in his reply to Mr. Kruetgen's address, pointed to the praiseworthy spirit of co-operation evinced by German-Americans toward their old homeland. Thus, no animosity or hatred developed toward America during the years following the World War. The German people could never forget that the foundation of the new German-American friendship was directly attributable to the efforts of the German-Americans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ludwig Plate, general agent for the North-German Lloyd Line and a close friend of the deceased Baron von Huenefeld, lifted his voice in praise of the ardent patriot who devoted his life to the service of his country. Fearless, faithful, and religious was our hero; his memory will be perpetuated among German people everywhere.</p>
