   <p>Death has taken Emil Mannhardt, one of the outstanding, citizens in our German population. He was one of the best known and highly esteemed newspapermen of this city. Seemingly in best of health, Mr. Mannhardt celebrated his 70th birthday only a few weeks ago. But a hidden malady, the presence of which was unknown to him, made its slow progress, until an acute attack made an immediate operation necessary. It was too late however, and death put an end to his intense suffering.</p>
   <p>Heinrich Emil Mannhardt was the son of a Mennonite pastor, living in Danzig. It was there that he received his education, choosing the field of techincal science as his vocation. Later, after coming to our shores, he discovered his real calling. He immigrated to America in 1866, becoming associated with the newspaper, The Philadelphia Democrat, four years later. He terminated his connection <pb facs="5418474_11_1483.jpg" n="2"/>with that newspaper in order to become editor of the department of local news of the Baltimore Wecker. Duly recognized for his work he was offered the position of editor of the department of local news of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in 1872, thus becoming a member of the staff of that newspaper. Hardly had any time elapsed before he became manager of the editorial department of the Sunday issue of the same newspaper. Upon the death of Hermann Raster, he was called upon to manage the main editorial department, in which capacity he remained until 1899.</p>
   <p>After he retired from active business life, Mr. Mannhardt became interested in the founding of the German-American Historical Society, functioning as its secretary until his death. His excellent services as editor of the Geschichtsblaetter, (Historical Magazine) published by the society, will be remembered for a long time.</p>
