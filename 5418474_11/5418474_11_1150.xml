   <p>The former actor, Henry Loewenfeld, sixty three years of age, who for years belonged to the German Theatre in Chicago, and was well known in society circles, died at his home in Mayville. He had not felt well for some time, but his illness had given no cause for alarm.</p>
   <p>A heart attack resulted in his death. Loewenfeld was born in Hamburg, Germany, the son of a famous Rabbi. After finishing his studies, the deceased followed a theatrical career, and was active on most of Germany's large stages. About twenty years ago, he came to America. During his appearance at the local German Theatre, he became acquainted with Miss Bender of the Ensemble Theatre, whom he married, and lived happily with. For several years the couple resided in Mayville.</p>

   <p>The deceased was a very amiable person, and acquired everywhere a great circle of friends. "Our Henry," as all his friends called him, had a heart of gold. Always ready to help, and always in the first line, where it concerned German culture, and German characteristics.</p>
   <p>Loewenfeld belonged, among others, to the Scharaffia, and to the German Press Club. Henry Loewenfeld was a member of the German Theatre in Chicago, under direction of Max Hainsch; played a few years later in Philadelphia and returned again to the Bush Temple Theatre, under the direction of Ulrich Haupt.</p>
   <p>Loewenfeld was at one time a co-worker of the Abendpost, for several years.</p>
