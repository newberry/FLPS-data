  <body>
   <p>The German Society is endeavoring as much as possible to protect the arriving immigrant against too heavy expenses and extortions. For that purpose, the president of the of the society, Mr. Geo. Schneider, with Mr. A. C. Hesing went yesterday to the bureau of police and had a long conversation with Messrs. Talcott and Klokke. They asked to have policemen stationed at railway stations to be on the look-out for immigrants. They also asked that their agents be granted the privileges of special policemen.</p>
   <p>They asked Mr. Parmelee to forbid his agents to solicit the patronage of immigrants. Mr. Parmelee is the owner of the omnibus wagons stationed at the railway stations. Too often a family of immigrants had to pay from five dollars to six dollars to be brought to their hotel just a few blocks away, since the price in the Parmelee bus is fifty cents per person. In justice it must be said that Mr. Parmelee knew nothing about that, and he gave his agents strictest orders, forbidding them to solicit the patronage of immigrants.</p>
