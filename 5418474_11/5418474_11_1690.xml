   <p>Without deathstruggle or pain Mr.A.C.Hesing a pioneer of Germania in Chicago and president of the Ill.Staatszeitung Co. died last night. A heart attack, the second one after a light attack in the previous year, ended his life quickly. Notwithstanding his 73 years Mr.Hesing, till the last days of his life, was in good health and in full bodily and mental strength, so that his sudden death was a great surprise to the persons, next to him. After he had dictated last night in his residence 3239 Vernon Avenue an article for the "Staatszeitung", in which he sharply citisized the actions of the boodlers in the city council, he went to bed at about 11 o'clock. A few hours later he complained of not feeling well, and a doctor was sent for, who however declared that there was nothing seriously wrong. At about 7 in the morning his condition became worse, and he died very quickly. When Postmaster Washington Hesing, who had been informed of his condition, arrived at 8 o'clock in the home, he found his father dead.</p>
   <p>Mr.Hesing,Sr. celebrated his 70th birthday January 6,1893. He came to Chicago in 1857, but immigrated to this country in 1840. He took a very active part in political life and was elected in 1860 as Sheriff of Cook County on the Republican ticket. In the year 1863 he took over the management of the I11. Staatszeitung, in which position <pb facs="5418474_11_1691.jpg" n="2"/>he represented, with zeal and energy, the rights of the Germans of Chicago. In his last years he promoted the care and maintenance of general and useful enterprises, and was especially interested in the "German Altenheim" (Home of the Aged). The funeral will take place Wednesday.</p>
