   <p>Among the many remarkable merchants of State Street, Chicago's famous business center, there are few who can point to a greater and more successful accomplishment than Isaac Woolf, founder of the large clothing house of the same name, and who rose from newsboy to merchant prince.</p>
   <p>Proud as he is of his achievement, Mr. Woolf is a bit too modest to talk about himself, and it was only after considerable entreaty that a reporter of the Staats-Zeitung was able to gather a few facts about his life.</p>
   <p>Some twenty years ago Woolf started his career as a newsboy. Insignificant as this beginning may seem, Woolf's strong will enabled him to start the Woolf Clothing Company on the corner of Halsted and Madison streets. True, it was a modest beginning, - no indication whatsoever of future development. Yet, a keen observer, had there been one around, would have noticed in that <pb facs="5418474_11_1559.jpg" n="2"/>modest beginning the seed of a large enterprise of the future.</p>
   <p>Woolf was a firm believer in the policy that a customer is always right, and he spared no effort to prove it. He was always present and enjoyed a bit of conversation with his customers, a habit which made him many a friend. It is doubtful whether a man can be found in Chicago today, who has more friends than Woolf among all classes of the city's population.</p>
   <p>For seventeen years, since he established his business, Woolf has never failed to give an annual Thanksgiving dinner to the newsboys, and this one act alone may have a great deal to do with his popularity among those who know him. This dinner, one might say, is an integral part of his business and grows with it, becoming increasingly important to the ever spreading army of homeless, hungry newsboys. Every Thanksgiving day. Mr. Woolf takes great delight in seeing to it that none leave his store without having partaken from a large brown turkey and other delicacies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1560.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For the newsboy, Woolf's day, as this day is called, is the most important event of the year. And rightly so, if we consider the fact that Woolf's latest Thanksgiving dinner was a huge affair in which 12,000 people ate. Just imagine a man who shares what he has with 12,000 youngsters, and it will dawn upon you why "Ikey" Woolf, the newsboy, became the towering merchant prince.</p>
   <p>Two years ago Woolf moved his store to State Street, and this change gave rise to considerable confusion among his old customers and friends, who mistook Sol Woolf's place at Jackson and State for his store due to the similarity in the names. The Woolf-Clothing Company overcame this difficulty by buying Sol Woolf's stock at a 50% reduction and offering it to the public at purchase price. This, of course, was a business transaction that made the Woolf Clothing Company very popular among State Street shoppers, a popularity which it enjoys to this day.</p>
