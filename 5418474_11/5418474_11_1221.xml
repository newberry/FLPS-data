  <body>
   <p>The founder of the well-known clothing firm of Hart, Schaffner and Marx died at the Belmont Hotel after contracting pneumonia.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hart was born on February 17, 1850, in Eppelsheim, Germany, and came to this country eight years later when his parents emigrated from Germany.</p>
   <p>Within a year after Chicago's great fire, Mr. Hart opened a small clothing store at 436 S. State Street, one of the first in the field. In the course of time, his store became the present "Men's ready to wear clothing establishment" of Hart, Schaffner and Marx, <pb facs="5418474_11_1222.jpg" n="2"/>said to be the largest of its kind in the world.</p>
   <p>In 1873 Hart married Addie Cline, with whom he had three children, Mrs. Louis H. Kohn, William L. Loewenbach, and Jacob H. Hart, all living. After the death of his first wife, he married again in 1906. Mrs. Sarah L. Hart, his widow,survives him.</p>
   <p>Harry Hart was president of the Sinai congregation. He has always been benevolently inclined, particularly towards Jewish circles; however his philanthropy extended also to other institutions of the city.</p>
   <p>The funeral service will be given at the Sinai Temple tomorrow afternoon, with Rabbi L. Mann officiating. Interment at Rosehill cemetery.</p>
