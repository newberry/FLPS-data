  <body>
   <p>General Julius White has accepted the command of the First Regiment of the National Guard. He did so under two conditions. First, that the regiment should wear on any march the uniform of the United States, so that the companies may wear their special uniforms only at unofficial occasions. Secondly, that the regiment should march on Sundays, only if it is necessary to preserve public order, or at funerals.</p>
   <p>These two conditions are unimpeachable. The officers have learned from not a few bad experiences that a militia, the main function of which consists in exhibiting colorful, outlandish uniforms or in arranging picnics, cannot count on much sympathy from a large part of the public. To be sure of that, one only needs to remember the infamous role the Chicago Times played on the occasion of the 4th of July picnic.</p>
   <p>This is a wise instinct that has determined the officers of this almost purely German and Scandinavian regiment to choose an American as colonel. In that way it is made unmistakably clear that the regiment does not want to be a <pb facs="5418474_11_0190.jpg" n="2"/>foreign, but an American organization.</p>
   <p>General J. White began his military career under General Siegel. He has not the intention to make the regiment a political machine. Neither is he now a candidate for any office, nor does he plan ever to become one.</p>
