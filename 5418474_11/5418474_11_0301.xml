   <p>On October 6, 1683, the "Concord" landed in Philadelphia with eighty Pietists from Frankfort and Crefeld, led by Franz Daniel Pastorius--an event which, although of little less importance than the landing of the "Mayflower" on November 20, 1620, has been given only scant recognition in America's history. And yet these two dates marked the sources of two streams, from which a nation in the New World was evolved.</p>
   <p>Like William Penn and the Pilgrim Fathers, Pastorius and his society were driven across the sea by religious oppression. Penn assigned them a piece of land between the Schuylkill and the Delaware, and, on October 24, Pastorius founded the first German town in America, called "Germantown", which the German linen weavers and winegrowers nicknamed "Armentown", because of the hardships and privations they had to suffer during the first years. [Translator's note: "Arm" in German means "poor;" therefore, "Armentown," town of the poor.] But later on, thousands followed. "You can live here if you <pb facs="5418474_11_0302.jpg" n="2"/>work hard and you can live according to your belief, too, and nobody will bother you!"--that is what brought them over here.</p>
   <p>The introduction of these first German settlers and their descendants, the "Pennsylvania Dutch," into the American economic life, forming a part of the American population and at the same time preserving their customs, is perhaps the most striking example of the process of Americanization for which a later period invented the term "melting pot". Pastorius played no small role in this process.</p>
   <p>A hundred years before the birth of the great American democracy, this trustee, legislator, schoolteacher, and general adviser, during the period of helplessness and chaos among the colonists, on everything from agricultural problems to lawsuits, was a true American for whom the principles of the Declaration of Independence, as yet unwritten, were a living truth. "Sober, honest, wise, and pious," as Penn described him, he was the embodiment of German character, which enjoyed the friendly respect of the whole world until Prussianism cast <pb facs="5418474_11_0303.jpg" n="3"/>a shadow over it.</p>
   <p>"No idler he, whoever else might shirk,</p>
   <p>He set his hand to ev'ry honest work,</p>
   <p>Farmer and teacher, court and meeting clerk;"</p>
   <p>so America's great poet, Whittier, lauds him. What the whole nation, almost a century and a half after him, recognized as a sacred obligation to the spirit and letter of the Declaration of Independence, was first held before the eyes of early America by German patriotism: Human rights and freedom for the slaves, also!</p>
   <p>He died at the age of sixty-nine, in 1719. The exact date of his death and his last resting place can no longer be ascertained. In Germantown a monument was erected in his honor, but a more beautiful one was established for this German hero of American democracy by John Whittier in his poem," The Pennsylvania Pilgrim," which glorifies his life and his courageous protest against slavery.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0304.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The history writers of the country which he embraced with all his soul, and to the greatness of which he had given his share, hardly mention him, but Whittier's immortal eulogy makes up for this neglect:</p>
   <p>"And lo! the fulness of the time has come,</p>
   <p>And over all the exile's western home</p>
   <p>From sea to sea the flowers of freedom bloom!</p>
   <p>And joy bells ring and silver trumpets blow;</p>
   <p>But not for thee, Pastorius! Even so</p>
   <p>The world forgets, but the wise angels know."</p>
