   <p>The committee of the Schwabenverein the Suabian Society, the largest German club in Chicago celebrated last night, at the council room of the North Side Turner Hall, the ninetieth anniversary of the birthday of its co-founder and first president, Ernst Hummel, of whom honorable mention was made already last week on the occasion of the fifty-fourth foundation festival of the Society.</p>
   <p>The "new born child" who, in spite of his advanced years, still goes through life with indomitable spirit and who takes active part in the affairs of the Society, and never fails when it means to further its aims and purposes, was welcomed on behalf of the Society with a hearty address by President Wilhelm Adelhelm. He was also given a hearty welcome by the society's Committee members and former presidents who had come to participate in his honoring and who surprised him with a well devised birthday gift, consisting of a huge basket of beautiful roses. In the course of the evening, he was remembered in many congratulatory speeches, which were made in his honor, and hope was expressed that Mr. Hummel will be granted many more years to remain as the honorary president in the circle of the Suabian Society, and to be able to witness the prosperous development of the <pb facs="5418474_11_1141.jpg" n="2"/>seed which he and his co-founders of the Chicago Suabian Society had planted fifty-four years ago.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers present were the honorary president Emanuel Gall; Wm. Jauss and Frank Kramer; the former president Julius Klein; secretary H. Hieher; treasurer Karl Ruck, and the Committee members Jas. Baron,Karl Schmid, Wm. Schelling and F. Rudel.</p>
   <p>The four surviving old gentlemen who were among those who founded the Society in 1878 are: Ernst Hummel who was born in 1842, in Germany; John Bauholzer, born in 1849, at Rottweil, Germany; Adolph Hartmann, born in 1851, at Heilbroun, Germany; and Peter Vogt, born in 1854, at Moegglingen, Germany.</p>
