<title level="a">THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Immigration for the fiscal year 1918-19 amounted to about 235,000 persons, while the emigration total came close to 216,000, which leaves the country a net gain of about 19,000.</p>
   <p>In spite of that, our lawmakers in Washington are deeply concerned over the immigration question, which is really a problem of the greatest importance.</p>
   <p>For the country is "threatened" by a large immigration, which, if it were of a different nature, the country would welcome.</p>
   <p>An immigration of undesirable elements, "threatens" and it will be a difficult job to encourage and obtain the immigration of useful and therefore desirable elements. There may be an emigration of elements which the ruling society would gladly be rid of but which the country can hardly do without.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0429.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All this will become clear if one examines more closely the immigration and emigration figures of the last fiscal year, and also considers the various reports on anticipated trends.</p>
   <p>Of the 235,000 immigrants, 82,000 came from the British Isles (45,564 English-men, 14,262 Scots, 10,146 Irish, and 965 Welshmen) and 21,243 from France, whereas about 39,000 Englishmen, Scots, and Frenchmen emigrated, leaving an immigration surplus of about 44,000 for these nationalities. On the other hand the migratory movements of Italians, Greeks, and Slavs show an emigration surplus of 50,000.</p>
   <p>That means we have an homogeneous immigration surplus which is acceptable to the American people, and an emigration surplus of elements which are not especially esteemed by the [American] ruling classes, but whose labor the country can use. Through the migratory movements of the last year the country lost physical man power which it needs for its industries, and gained potential workers, or elements which are not needed for our economy and which we can easily do without.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0430.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The respective loss or "gain" is not yet great. Neither would make much difference, but migration of the year 1918-19 is indicative of the near future. Immigration and emigration of the last year are merely straws in the wind, harbingers which indicate the trend. It is well known--at least it was claimed often enough officially and by steamship travel agencies--that many hundreds of thousands of Poles, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, and other Southern Slavs, Italians, etc., have decided to go back home and are only straightening out their affairs here and waiting for passage. It is certain that the steel strike and present business and labor conditions--particularly prohibition-- will only serve to augment and hasten the emigration of such elements. We are afraid that the scarcity of labor, which already is making itself felt will become acute, and will aggravate to the danger point the evils from which the country is suffering at present--insufficient production, high and still rising prices, dissatisfaction, and unrest--if the emigration of Southeastern European and Slav workers continues on an anticipated scale, and if no immigration of similar elements takes its place to make up for the loss.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it is reported that in Great Britain and France many thousands <pb facs="5418474_11_0431.jpg" n="4"/>are making preparations to emigrate to America, and that a heavy immigration of economically and politically undesirable elements can be expected. Representative Johnson of Washington, chairman of the House Committee for Immigration, declared that it probably was not known that Japan, and especially Yokohama, was full of absolutely undesirable elements, particularly Russian military deserters, who are just waiting for the opportunity to come to America. They were the scum of the earth. Dutch cities, too, were full of citizens of all countries, who had good reasons to stay away from their homelands and who waited for passage to America. Other sources reveal that millions of Europeans plan to come to America to avoid the huge war debts and taxes in Europe.</p>
   <p>These assertions may be exaggerated, but they certainly describe the general situation correctly. In the victorious countries particularly, certain strata of society will evince strong inclinations toward immigration. A lot of money was made there during the war and hope for huge war indemnity payments [by the vanquished] ran high. The necessary heavy taxation will be resented there all the more, and there will be many malcontents who would like to get away with their profits and worried consciences!</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0432.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Congress has not only the power but also the duty to prevent that kind of immigration as much as possible; and it seems that maintenance of the war restrictions for another year (after ratification of the peace treaty) is the best that can be done for the time being.</p>
   <p>It would be a mistake to work out a new immigration law in a hurry and to whip it through [Congress]. The situation is very confused, and passions are still running too high for anything good to result from such confusion.</p>
