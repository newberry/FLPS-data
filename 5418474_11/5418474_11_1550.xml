   <p>p. 7 - 2 The Rev. John J. Esher, for thirty-three years Bishop of the Evangelical Church, died yesterday at his residence, 745 Jackson Boulevard, aged 77 years. Bishop Esher had for sixty-nine years been a resident of Chicago. He was born in the Province of Alsace, Germany, in 1823, and when nine years old, immigrated with his parents to the United States, locating in Pennsylvania. Shortly afterward the family moved West and settled in Cook County.</p>
   <p>At the age of seventeen he began the studies which in later years made him prominent in Evangelical work. In 1845 he entered the ministry, becoming one of the charter members of the Evangelical Church at the conference held in that year. In 1863 he was elected Bishop of the Evangelical Church and served in that capacity continuously until his death. He was the senior Bishop of the Church, and the oldest Minister in active service in his denomination.</p>
   <p>Bishop Esher made several trips abroad in the interests of foreign missions. He founded a mission in Switzerland, and later made two trips to Japan, where he established several missions. He was the author of several books on theology, one of which was completed only a few weeks before his death. "Over Land <pb facs="5418474_11_1551.jpg" n="2"/>And Sea; A Missionary Trip Around The World," was one of his earlier productions.</p>
   <p>In 1891 differences in the Church resulted in the organization of a new body called the United Evangelical Church. Bishop Bowman and Bishop Esher sided against Bishop Dubs, and the break was the result. As a result of the harmonizing efforts of Bishop Esher, the matter is now said to be in fair way toward a settlement.</p>
   <p>The survivors of the Bishop are one son, E. B. Esher, and two daughters, Mrs. G. C. Knobel of Chicago and Mrs. L. W. Yaggy of Lake Forest. The funeral will be held on Saturday at 1 P. M. from the Sheffield Avenue Evangelical Church. Interment will be at Graceland.</p>
