  <body>
   <p>From the house of mourning, 417 Dearborn Avenue, the body of Wilhelm Froost accompanied by a great number of followers has been laid to rest this afternoon. Mr. Froost died last Friday in the home of his sister, Mrs. Adelina Dietze, in Winona, Minnesota. He was there on a visit and died, at the age of 68 years. He came from Elberfeld and as he was the seventh son, King Frederic Wilhelm III chose to be his godfather. When he was ten years old his parents immigrated to the United States of America and later he took up his residence in Chicago and founded a liquor business under the firm name of Wm. Froost and Company, which developed to some importance.</p>
   <p>Several years ago Mr. Froost retired to private life. He was very well respected in large circles and his death is a great loss not only for the local Germans but also for great masses of the poor, who lose their benefactor. He leaves his wife and a daughter, Miss Louise Froost, three sisters, and a brother.</p>
