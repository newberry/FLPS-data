   <p>John Haderlein a well-known personality among the old settlers of German-Americans, passed away. He was born in Northern Bavaria and lived more than forty years in Chicago. He represented the interests of the local German-Americans at all times. John Haderlein was a member of the Schwaben Verein and a true and sincere supporter of the affairs of his fellow countrymen in the city council of which he was a Democratic member for thirteen years. John Haderlein started his activities in Chicago as an employee of the Wacker and Birk Brewing Company; later, between 1890 and 1912, he managed a restaurant on the Northside. In 1920 he ran as candidate for Congress in the tenth district against Carl R. Chindblom and was defeated.</p>
