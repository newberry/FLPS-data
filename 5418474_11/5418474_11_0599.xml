   <p>Certain European nations facing the serious problem of immigration of their youth to America go so far as to falsify official documents in order to attain the desired end. Thus, the Stadtblatt, a newspaper of Bunzlau, Silesia, published a letter by Dr. Schumacher, the German Consul General in New York, in which he warns against emigration to the United States. It is pointed out therein, that the United States is at the brink of another economic crisis. Furthermore, it continues, the growing tendency for swindling is undermining sound business strategy, which fact is responsible for 281 more business failures in the past four years than any ever recorded previously.</p>
   <p>To any well informed person this idle talk cannot be convincing since a man of the type of Dr. Schumacher knows exactly that during the past two years insolvencies in the United States have been on the decrease. Thus it becomes obvious that Dr. Schumacher could not have been the author of that letter. Consequently, we have disregarded the supposed report of the Consul General, <pb facs="5418474_11_0600.jpg" n="2"/>although a number of the leading English-American newspapers are giving much space to this gossip, attaching seriousness to that document. Doubting neither the author nor the contents of the letter, the Chicago Tribune, in yesterday's issue, compared the German Consul General in New York with the miserable Mr. Crump, the English vice consul in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, a statement made by Dr. Schumacher and published in the New York papers, denounces the Stadtblatt for the publication of the letter supposedly written by him. He denied emphatically any knowledge of that letter, branding the whole affair as fictitious.</p>
   <p>The German press is guilty of still another misdemeanor. It publishes letters from Germans living in America, describing the pitiful state of conditions in this country, while thousands of others whose communications are inspiring do not find favor with the German press. This mischievous partiality against America is of no consequence, however. The innumerable letters praising this country are by far more important than the press. This is amply proved by <pb facs="5418474_11_0601.jpg" n="3"/>the German immigration into this country, which rose, despite the propaganda, to 5,000 German immigrants disembarking in one single day, a thing repeated again on May 9 of this year.</p>
   <p>The necessity of German immigration into this country is duly recognized even by those Germans for whom the Fatherland is the only salvation.</p>
   <p>Private communications from prominent men of Germany clearly indicate this fact. The writer of this article is happy to submit a letter for publication written to him by a man who is widely known and respected in the province of Wuerttemberg, which newspaper does print stories of woe of the Suabian immigrants in America. In part, the letter states:</p>
   <p>"It is evident that Garfield is concerned with the education of the masses. Thus, the government finds it necessary to take the initiative as patterned by Europe, especially Germany. Germany, on the other hand, will be open to <pb facs="5418474_11_0602.jpg" n="4"/>any suggestions for improvement coming from North America.</p>
   <p>Germany is, of course, over-populated, a fact which cannot be disregarded as one of the principal causes for mass emigration. It is our hope, however, that those who emigrate will find happiness in the new world and help promote German ideals and customs there."</p>
   <p>An attitude like this will in time gain strength and help annihilate the unjustly formed opinion against the United States of America.</p>
