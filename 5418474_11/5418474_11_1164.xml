   <p>An old German American, of the old stamp, who in the years of prosperity played a prominent part in the business life of the city and enjoyed a good reputation, Herman Otto Lange, for many years president of the Ferguson &amp; Lange Foundry Co., died yesterday after a long illness at the home of his son-in-law, Walter F. Klein, 5401 Wayne Ave., at the age of seventy-six years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lange, who lived in Chicago since 1909, was born in Bromberg in 1855. His parents were Louis Lange and Pauline Lange, nee Braun. He visited the Junior college in his home town, emigrated to America in 1870 and settled first in Muskegon, Mich. There he filled the position of cashier of the Merchants National Bank for six years, and joined later the lumber firm, Torrent, but was also interested in several other mercantile undertakings. On October 15, 1882, he was married to Ida M. Torrent. Four children were born to them: Marguerite, now Mrs. Walter F. Klein; Nellie, now Mrs. E. Atwood; Florence, now Mrs. T. I. Robinson, and Liston.</p>

   <p>After the family moved to Chicago in 1899, Mr. Lange joined the William Ferguson Foundry as secretary and treasurer. The firm changed its name in 1903 to Ferguson &amp; Lange Foundry Co. and Mr. Lange was for years its president and treasurer.</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, Mr. Lange played a prominent part in German circles in former years; he was particularly interested in the German theatre. He was also active as a singer and belonged to the Germania Men's Chorus, which has been dissolved since. Besides he was a member of the "Schlaraffia Chicagoana," and the German Press Club.</p>
