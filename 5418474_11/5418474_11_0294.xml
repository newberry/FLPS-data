   <p>Through Science Service, Inc., whose director is the well-known research worker and author, Mr. Edwin E. Slosson, an essay by Frank L. Babbott was recently circulated which deals with eugenics research and with national welfare. Mr. Babbott is the president of the Eugenics Research Association, which was founded in 1913 and consists of 350 members. The discussions about eugenics research and national welfare agree with the "Nordic theory", which asserts that the modeling and development of the United States is the work of the English, Scotch, and Irish, exclusively. The Science Service report about the Babbott discussions reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The convention of statesmen who drew up the Constitution of the United States in Philadelphia consisted ninety per cent of Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen. In the last session of the Senate, which consists of almost twice as many members, eighty-one per cent of the members, according to Mr. Babbott's information were of the same racial extraction. The last Senate had two members of <pb facs="5418474_11_0295.jpg" n="2"/>French descent, Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware and Edwin S. Broussard of Louisiana, as well as several other members who are partially of French origin. There was also a Norwegian, Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota, and two senators of Swedish descent, Irvine L. Lenroot of Wisconsin and Peter Norbeck of South Dakota.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Babbott, in establishing the proof of the racial extractions, requested every one of the ninety-six Senators to give him information about the racial extraction of his parents, grandparents, etc. If America of today has no great statesmen like Washington, Franklin, and Madison, then the fault lies not in the changed racial extractions of the legislators, as the statistical material fully proves."</p>
   <p>Upon the inquiry of the correspondent of the Abendpost at the office of the Science Service in Washington, as to whether people of German extraction were not also members of the first Constitutional Convention of the United States, as well as of the last Senate, the following information was given: "In the complete discussions about eugenics research and national welfare by Frank L. Babbott, no report is to be found that German blood was represented among the <pb facs="5418474_11_0296.jpg" n="3"/>delegates at the Constitutional Convention."</p>
   <p>Mr. Babbott, however, in his eugenics analysis of the last Senate, gives the names of those senators who are of German origin. They are: Frank L. Smith, Illinois, English-German origin; O. E. Weller, Maryland, English-German origin; William E. Borah, Idaho, German-Irish origin; Thomas D. Schall, Minnesota, German-Irish origin; Robert N. Stanfield, Oregon, Scotch-Irish-English-German; F. M. Simmons, North Carolina, Scotch-Irish-English-German; W. B. Pine, Oklahoma, Scotch-Irish-English-German origin; Simeon D. Fess, Ohio, German origin; Richard P. Ernst, Kentucky, German origin; C. C. Dill, Washington, Scotch-Irish-German-Dutch-Swiss; Wesley L. Jones, Washington, Welsh-Scotch-Irish-German origin.</p>
   <p>Mr. Babbott's analysis does not extend to the members of the House of Representatives of the last Congress. Among its 435 members, forty-one had German names, while undoubtedly many others were partly of German extraction, or had Americanized German names of which the origin cannot be easily traced. Besides the twelve senators of mixed German extraction, there are in the House numerous other statesmen who have German blood in their veins. They form at least twenty-five per cent of the entire membership of the House of Representatives.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0297.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Babbott is mistaken when he declares that among the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of the United States, in 1787, there was not one who was of German extraction. German blood flowed through the veins of a few of them. One of these was Gouverneur Morris of New York, a member of the Executive Committee, who deserves gratitude for the draft of the Constitution. He was a direct descendant of Jacob Leisler, who was elected Governor of New York by the citizens, and who, in 1691, together with his son-in-law, Milborne, was hanged because he valued the welfare of the colony more than the wishes of England. Milborne's widow, nee Leisler, later married a Huguenot, Abraham Gouverneur. Her son, Nicholas Gouverneur, married his cousin, Gertrude Rynders, a daughter of Hester Leisler. The son of this marriage was the grandfather of Gouverneur Morris, whose first name was his surname, and not a title.</p>
   <p>General Frederick Frelinghuysen was another member of the Convention who was of German descent. The general, a grand child of Pastor Theodor J. Frelinghuysen, was born in Westphalia, Germany. Many descendants of German ancestors assisted in securing the acceptance of the Constitution. Among those was, especially, Friedrich August Muhlenberg, the Speaker of the first House of Representatives <pb facs="5418474_11_0298.jpg" n="5"/>of the Congress of the United States.</p>
   <p>Professor A. B. Faust, of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, in his historical work, The German Element in the United States, made the following statement: "The Germans have always risked life and property in support of the Constitution, and have during the entire nineteenth century put a larger contingent of soldiers in the field than any other immigrated national group ever has supplied."</p>
   <p>H. W. M. Richards says in his book, The German Leaven in the Pennsylvania Loaf, "If it had not been for the Pennsylvania Germans, the Declaration of Independence of July 4th, 1776, would have been unheard of, and today, instead of the great United States, every state would have been a country by itself, and probably a weak colony of Great Britain."</p>
   <p>The influence of the German members of the Assembly of Pennsylvania forced the acceptance of the Declaration of Independence. The Quakers and the followers of the Episcopal Church, who were strictly under the influence of England, were against the independence of the Colonies. Of the eight Pennsylvania delegates <pb facs="5418474_11_0299.jpg" n="6"/>to the Continental Congress, only one, Benjamin Franklin, signed the Declaration of Independence voluntarily, two disappeared, one was present and was persuaded to sign, while two refused to sign. [Translator's note: two delegates are apparently unaccounted for.] It required all the pressure of the German members of the assembly of the province to overcome the opposition, and to force the acceptance of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Constitution of the United States was not wholly the work of Germans, but was mainly the result of long parliamentarian schooling, as it was inherited from England, together with the example of the new French state philosophy, which was the result of the French Revolution. But, nevertheless, it was German influence which brought about its acceptance, and it was the Germans who pledged themselves with all their might to the preservation of the Constitution.</p>
