<title level="a">THE ILLINOIS DISTRICT OF THE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN SYNOD</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Illinois District of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, covering Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, and other states, has been in session since last Wednesday at the Emanuel Church, at West Taylor and Brown Streets. This Synod as a whole is divided into eight districts, of which Reverend Schwan of Cleveland has been president for some time.</p>
   <p>Within the Illinois District are one hundred and thirty-one pastors and professors, more than a hundred school teachers, and a large number of deputies, eighty of whom are present at this session. Pastor Wuner of Chicago is president of the Illinois District; Pastor Achenbach of Venedey, Washington County, is vice president; and B. Burfeind of Madison, Cook County, is secretary.</p>
   <p>Pastor Schwan of Cleveland opened the session on Wednesday morning with customary formalities at the Emanuel Church. During the afternoon, Pastor Wunder <pb facs="5418474_11_0043.jpg" n="2"/>presided; the regular organizational matters were attended to, and new members were inducted.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that the appended articles of faith should be discussed during the morning session. Professor Grosse of Addison, Dupage County, was the principal speaker on this subject.</p>
   <p>The teachings of the Papists that no man can be sure of the state of grace with out a revelation, is anti-Christian and an error.</p>
   <p>Ebr. 11, I; Matth. 11, 28-38 [sic]</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Altogether seven theological assertions believed in by the Lutherans are listed.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0044.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On Thursday afternoon a report was given concerning the condition and requirements of the Fort Wayne school, which follows the German system of instruction. The school has six classes. There is only one other school of its kind in America, in Watertown, Wisconsin. Also matters concerning the Synodal Teachers' Seminary at Addison were discussed.</p>
   <p>Election of officers for the next three years was held on Friday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Pastors Wunder and Achenbach were re-elected. Pastor Brauer of Grete, Will County, was elected "visitor" for Northern Illinois, and Pastor Meinicke of Rock Island was elected "visitor" for Central Illinois.</p>
   <p>No session was held yesterday afternoon....[Translator's note: Omitted items do not involve Chicago Germans]. The last synod was held here, two years ago. The next yearly session will probably be held at Quincy or Peoria. The Rock <pb facs="5418474_11_0045.jpg" n="4"/>Island community offered the use of its church for the occasion.</p>
   <p>On Tuesday evening a memorial service will be held at Emanuel Church in memory of Pastor Ruland, who was killed in a railroad accident while touring the United States. Professor Craemer of Springfield will officiate.</p>
