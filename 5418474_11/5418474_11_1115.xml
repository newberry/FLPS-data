   <p>The funeral of Fritz Weis, honorary president of the Chicago Sporting Club, took place yesterday afternoon at the Irving Park Cemetery. The funeral services were held in the chapel of Westfall and Son's undertakers, 3807 Lincoln Avenue. As an introduction, the Schiller Liedertafel, of which Fritz Weis was a member, sang "Hymn to the Night," a favorite song of the deceased.</p>
   <p>Pastor Bruckner of the Epiphainas Church held the memorial sermon, in which he emphasized the popularity Mr. Weis enjoyed among his relatives, friends, and acquaintances. "Fritz Weis," the minister said, "was a German and a true man." To the afflicted parents he devoted a few consoling words. The singers honored their comrade by intoning "Peacefully Rests Your Heart." Alfred Behnke spoke in the name of the German Sporting Society of the Chicago Sporting Club. In short but impressive words, <pb facs="5418474_11_1116.jpg" n="2"/>he again dwelt upon the merits of the deceased and the work he had done for the club and the movement. Unforgettable to his friends will be the excellence of this fair and sincere sportsman, who to our regret has been called away only too soon. At his bier those present vowed to honor him by cultivating his ideals and by continuing the work he had begun. Besides the Schiller Singing Club, almost all sporting societies of Chicago were represented through delegations.</p>
