   <p>The noted City engineer Bernhard Feind died last night at his home, 157 Orchard Street, at the age of 45 years. He was born in 1849 in Hannover,(Germany), studied engineering at Berlin and came in 1880 to America. After holding various responsible positions, he finally entered the employ of the City of Chicago and has been known since as an expert engineer, particularly on the drainage system and hydraulic water pump.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feind was a member of the Chicago Academy and died comparatively young, having had for years a liver ailment, which kept him on the sickbed during the last three weeks.</p>
   <p>He will be buried Friday afternoon on the Rosehill Cemetery.</p>
