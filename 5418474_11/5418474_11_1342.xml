   <p>The funeral of Father Nicholas L. Franzen took place yesterday, and was attended by many German Catholics. He was respected by laity and clergy alike.</p>
   <p>The mass for the dead was read at St. Nicholas Church, corner Cleveland Avenue and Eugenie Street, by Father Math Meyer, assisted by Fathers Louis Brand and George H. Thomas. Reverend I. Ott was in charge of the service. Two memorial sermons were given for the deceased. Father Henry Weber spoke in German, Father E. Cantwell in English. The pallbearers were the Alexian Brothers, members of the church board and of several organizations constituted an escort of honor. The burial took place on St. Boniface Cemetery.</p>
   <p>The deceased, who was born in Chicago and was, for a long time, rector of St. Michael's and St. Alphonsus churches, earned for himself the love and admiration of his numerous coreligionists and the respect of many others.</p>
