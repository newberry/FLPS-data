   <p>The good hearted German in America very often is requested by his German cousin on the other side for some favors and on account of his readiness to assist he has now been asked by the National Liberal Party for some funds for election purposes.</p>
   <p>A circular has been sent to Germans in Chicago whose names indicate their Germas descent and which reads as follows: Berlin - January, 1907. Dear Sir and Fellow Countryman: The dissolution of the German parliament forces the National Liberal Party, which stood at the cradle of the "Reich" and created in cooperation with Prince Bismarck the foundation of the state, to fight the Centrum and Socialism as the enemies of the Empire and its Emperor. The fight has to be fought with all energy, to secure the further beneficial development of the Empire internally and externally. It must not happen again, that the esteem of the Empire and the Imperial crown will be disrespected, as it happened by the Centrum, the Socialists, Guelphs, and Poles on December 13, 1906.</p>

   <p>We need for this purpose great financial help. Some of our countrymen living abroad have sent us already unprovoked larger amounts for this purpose and we therefore appeal to the Germans in other countries, who still sympathize with their old country and who share our opinion, that only an energetic policy of the National Liberal Party can reserve the respect of the German flag abroad, for their financial support. Each contribution is welcome and should be sent to the Central Bureau of the National Liberal Party, Schillingstr 9, Berlin.</p>
   <p>With fellow-national esteem,</p>
   <p>Central Committee of the National Liberal Party</p>
   <p>Bassermann, Chairman</p>
   <p>Fr. Friedberg, Vice Chairman</p>
   <p>It has not been known what success this appeal has had in Chicago.</p>
