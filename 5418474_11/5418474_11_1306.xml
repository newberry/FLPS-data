  <body>
   <p>The funeral of Lebrecht Uhlendorf, well known in German circles, will be held tomorrow at his residence and the interment will be in Rosehill cemetery. The deceased had reached the age of 72 years. He was a native of Brunswick, Germany, and descended from an old aristocratic family. However, he renounced his title of nobility and came to America at the age of 18 years.</p>
   <p>Formerly active as cigar manufacturer, later as stock broker, he retired several years ago. Lebrecht Uhlendorf was a patron for years of Gills restaurant, always occupying a table reserved for him and his friends. He was a member of the Germania Club for over 50 years. He also belonged to the Chicago Turner Society and was a faithful visitor at the Turner Hall concerts, of which he had been an ardent promoter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Uhlendorf had been ill for some time. He died Thursday in his home, 559 Surf Street, and is survived by his widow, three daughters and a grandchild.</p>
