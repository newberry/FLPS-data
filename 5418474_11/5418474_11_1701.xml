   <p>There are bad news for some crooked politicians in Chicago. Governor Altgeld announced that he has plenty of material on hand to prove, how certain state senators and representatives accepted thousands of dollars of bribes. Governor Altgeld is righteously angry, and determined to bring these grafters into court.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Governor for his fearless action and hope, he will go through with it, regardless of consequences to his own political and personal friends. We know that neither Republican nor Democratic administrations have been free from corruption. Furthermore, it always has been difficult to unmask grafters, as most cases were smoothed over in the nick of time by some political friends of the same party.</p>
   <p>Dishonesty of public officials has been on the increase during the last 15 years. The office of Governor, in its purposes and duties, should be high above this deplorable situation. We are glad to say, that Governor Altgeld <pb facs="5418474_11_1702.jpg" n="2"/>is the right man in the right place. The record of his past will be a guarantee for pitiless persecution of political crooks and public offenders.</p>
