   <p>The German government intends to launch a propaganda campaign of colossal proportions. According to reports from Berlin, the propaganda is intended to serve a double purpose, to strengthen the spirit of nationalism among the German people and to counteract criticism in foreign countries. That the German government has a right, or, if you will, the duty to spread propaganda and through it to influence opinions inside and outside the country, is quite natural. Propaganda is always good and effective--provided it is conducted right.</p>
   <p>It is reasonable, in this connection, to point to Italy. Italy was the first among the great powers to introduce a purely dictatorial government after the <pb facs="5418474_11_0684.jpg" n="2"/>war, but in point of fact Turkey was ruled by a dictator long before, and there were also other European countries such as Spain, Poland, and Jugoslavia, in which democratic constitutions still existed on paper only. Italy was the first of the great European powers in which democracy was abolished in all its forms, without leaving a trace.</p>
   <p>This was very much resented in this country. The press heaped bitter and malicious criticism on Mussolini. It emphasized, time and again, that Mussolini's procedure was tantamount to retrogression, to a change from the better to the worse, to a return to barbarism. Mussolini was not a whit daunted by all that, nor did he get emotional or upset. When the foreign correspondents began to annoy him, he simply made them leave the country; since he had a right to do that, no one lost his temper about it.</p>
   <p>Of late, the attitude of the press and public opinion have changed radically with respect to Mussolini and Italy. Mussolini is no longer criticized, and <pb facs="5418474_11_0685.jpg" n="3"/>it is generally admitted that he brought about order in Italy, and that he pulled the people out of the quagmire. Every Italian and American who visits Italy returns an enthusiastic eulogist of the new order. Mussolini's propaganda was the best and most effective ever used. He told the world that by his fruits they shall know him. That these fruits are good is generally acknowledged today.</p>
   <p>It cannot be denied that the attitude toward Germany that is prevalent in foreign countries is by no means favorable. Two recent events may serve as examples of the way this opinion is expressed by the press. A few days ago it was reported that the Pope had refused to sign the concordat with the German goverment, as he did not agree with their church policies. This was a piece of clever propaganda, for it was obviously intended to incite the Catholics of the world against the German government. It was also stupid propaganda in the extreme, because the very next day the concordat was solemnly signed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0686.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>For years, Dr. Edgar J. Fisher was dean of the American Robert College in Constantinople, now Istambul. When, recently, he wanted to return to Turkey from a vacation trip to the United States, he was refused readmission. The Turkish government took offence at an article in an American pedagogic paper which was not even written by Dr. Fisher, but for which--as assumed by the Turkish government--he must have supplied the material.</p>
   <p>The press paid no attention to this occurrence. It is apparently aware that every government has a right to determine whom it wants to accept as a guest, and to whom it should refuse entry. Had the German government acted similarly, it would undoubtedly have provoked a storm of indignation in the American press. One might be tempted to know, from this, the conclusion that Turkey is more popular in America than present-day Germany.</p>
   <p>It appears useless for the German government to attempt to counter foreign attitudes and propaganda inimical to Germany with a great campaign of words.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0687.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The American press will certainly take notice of these words, especially in Hitler's speeches, for Hitler is front page material. The effect will be neither deep nor far-reaching, for such propaganda, organized and ordered by the government, can never have a convincing effect. It might perhaps be effective if the government would instruct its diplomatic and consular representatives immediately to issue denials of all false reports, and to demand publication of the denials.</p>
   <p>There is still another point which is of utmost importance. The systematic procedure of the German government against the Jews has created a great deal of bad blood in foreign countries. It is quite natural that the Jews of America and of other countries should espouse the cause of their racial brothers in Germany and that they should seek to damage the German government by means of word and deed. Who would blame them for that? The treatment of the Jews is considered a grave injustice in foreign countries, and no amount of propaganda will offset that.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0688.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>So far as the German government is concerned, this attitude of enmity to the Jews is a point in its program; it constitutes a practical fulfillment of its racial theory, known to play a very important part in its philosophy. If the government wants to continue in its adherence to this theory and to the practical effects resulting from it, it is its own business. Then it must also accept the consequences of inimical attitudes in foreign countries.</p>
