   <p>p. 8.. The Society of the Veterans of the 24th Regiment of Volunteers of Illinois, known as the famous Hecker Regiment, arranged a re-union of the German veterans last night in the spacious North Side Turner Hall. The large attendance at the affair proved once again that the German comrades are much more appreciative of the bond between them than shown by veterans of other nationalities....</p>
   <p>The national colors were used in the decoration of the hall. Displayed upon banners were the names of prominent German leaders of the Civil War. Also the names of the battles in which the German troops won for themselves an everlasting name in history... On the stage when the curtain rose, were assembled the veterans of the Hecker Regiment, the hosts of the evening.</p>
   <p>There they stood in the accustomed military posture with Mr. Mattern, the president of the society as their leader. A few words of welcome were then extended to the assembled 1,000 veterans by Mr. Mattern. Adolph George was introduced as chairman of the evening celebration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wilhelm Vocke delivered the very enthusiastically received address which <pb facs="5418474_11_0151.jpg" n="2"/>he closed with these words: "There is magic in the name of George H. Thomas!... No commander in chief was ever as highly esteemed by his troops as was that great hero. He inspired his men as no one had ever done in the past.</p>
   <p>"He was a native of Virginia and yet, unlike the rebel, Robert E. Lee, remained true to his military oath. He was a loyal patriot, joining the military forces of the North immediately at the outbreak of the war. His qualifications and military leadership were revealed from the moment he first drew his sword against the enemy at Mill Springs. Thomas represents a soldier with the virtues of a gallant warrior."</p>
   <p>Judge Theodore Brentano was represented by Mr. H. S. Boutell, a member of congress, who said in English: "... I consider it a special honor and privilege to address this great gathering of German veterans. Cheerfully have they given their lives, although they did it not in defense of a monarch or for any conquest. They gave their blood for the preservation of two great ideals. The first, the preservation of the Union which is at all times the first thought of every true American....</p>
   <p>"Abolition of slavery was the second. The accomplishments of the Grand Army <pb facs="5418474_11_0152.jpg" n="3"/>of the Republic will live forever in the annals of our history. The swords of the American soldiers were never used unless it was in defense of justice and humanity. Neither did they ever give up until they had won the victory."</p>
   <p>A salvo of applause followed the speech.... The beautiful basso voice of Hermann Dietz was then heard singing: Black Clouds from Milloecker's, The Army Chaplain. He was followed by the Senefelder and the Turner Male Choirs, rendering the Old Kentucky Home....</p>
   <p>Major Rassieur was then introduced as the next speaker. He is one of those highly cultured German-Americans. His subject was: German poetry, and the German intellectual life in America. He paid tribute to the Germans for their excellent influence upon the development of the American nation. He said that the German-Americans displayed an understanding for the welfare of this country far greater than did the natives of the land. He expressed the wish that the distinguished services rendered by German-Americans to their adopted fatherland would always be remembered.</p>
   <p>Letters of regret received from persons unable to be present were read by Mr. Vocke.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0153.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>General Sigel of New York said: " I deeply regret my inability to be present at the festivities in honor of the Veterans of the 24th Regiment of Illinois. It would have been a joy to greet personally the comrades of the regiment. Greetings from a comrade. I remain, Yours, F. Sigel."</p>
   <p>The contents of the letter received from Mr. Wilhelm Rapp, publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung are as follows: "To the German heroes of the Union. I felt quite honored by the invitation to attend your festivities. But a written word in my opinion is more significant than my presence. The fact that the patriotic press worked hand in hand with you who performed heroic deeds on the battle fields can not be disregarded. I am proud that as a representative of the press from Baltimore and Chicago, I was privileged to be one of your loyal comrades. May you all be blessed with a long life. Your friend, Wilhelm Rapp."</p>
