   <p>One of the best known Germans of Chicago died yesterday in his residence, 2814 Archer Avenue in the person of John L. Thurn. He was born in Bavaria in the year 1841 and came to Chicago as a boy at the age of 15 years. In the year 1865 he established himself in the Dry Goods business, which he managed up to 1884. Since then he busied himself in the Real Estate business and as a representative of Insurance and Building corporations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thurn was a zealous Lutheran and participated in the founding of several churches and cemeteries. Nine children, five sons and four daughters survive him. The funeral takes place this forenoon at 10 o'clock from the place of mourning to the Church of the Holy Cross, 31st and Center Avenue. The interment takes place in the Concordia cemetery.</p>
