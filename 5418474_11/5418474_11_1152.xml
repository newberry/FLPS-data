<title level="a">CAPTAIN PAUL KONIG HEARTILY WELCOMED AT MIDLAND CLUB</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In a long and extremely entertaining program, the world famous commander of the first commercial submarine to cross the Atlantic in peaceful business pursuit, Captain Paul Konig, was received at the Midland Club before a capacity audience.</p>
   <p>The pleasant elderly gentleman, as the hero of the "U" Deutchland turned out to be, occupied the place of guest of honor at the speakers' table, surrounded by Messrs. Charles W. Peters, John F. Voigt, Postmaster Arthur C. Leuder, Hermann De Vry, Leo Roeder, Exchange Student Werner Zepernick, and L. Plate.</p>
   <p>In the course of the breakfast Captain Konig was honored by the singing of German folksongs, among them the "Wacht am Rhein"; Werner Zepernick played as piano numbers "Liszt's 12th Rhapsody," and "Scotch Dances" by Beethoven; Kurt Schlegel, of the German Theater, gave a few humorous recitals.</p>
   <p>The president of the German Club, Charles, W. Peters, acted as toastmaster and presented as first speaker Mr. De Vry. After Mr. De Vry the former president <pb facs="5418474_11_1153.jpg" n="2"/>of the club, John F. Voigt, spoke of the disgraceful Peace Treaty of Versailles. He was able to report that even the French general, Foch, during his stay in America, declared that the terror act of Versailles would never have happened if the generals and not the politicians Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and the misled Wilson, had arranged the conditions. The speaker cited another commanding general of the American Army who like others places the responsibility for the present depression upon Versailles.</p>
   <p>Captain Konig Speaks</p>
   <p>Captain Konig announced at the beginning that he came to America solely to meet again his many American friends, who congratulated him by the thousands for his safe crossing of the ocean with the "U" Deutschland. He has no terror stories to report of the war times because as soon as it became real interesting on the surface of the ocean he had to dive with his boat.</p>
   <p>He then gave a detailed description of his two trips from Bremen to Baltimore and New London,Connecticut. Quietly, and almost good naturedly, he spoke of the thousands of dangers which threatened his undertaking from the English and French before arriving in American territorial waters, without however, <pb facs="5418474_11_1154.jpg" n="3"/>being able to prevent him from discharging his cargo of German chemicals and medicine and in return taking on American goods for Germany. Many details sounded quite interesting but were hazardous to Captain Konig and his crew, who were constantly exposed to death.</p>
   <p>The enemy ships in Baltimore, supported by a number of spies, left nothing undone to catch Konig in their nets, even in American territorial waters. But, just as Germans succeeded as the first and only ones to build a commercial submarine, so Germans succeeded in escaping the many intrigues of the English and French. Only the "U" Bremen, of which Captain Konig made the first authentic report, became, through an accidental hit by an English "U" boat, a victim.</p>
   <p>Stormy applause rewarded Captain Konig for his interesting recital.</p>
