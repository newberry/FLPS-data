   <p>The Koelnische Zeitung, one of the most significant [newspapers] in Germany, has recently complimented our German-American fellow-citizens, for which the latter will extend gratitude, together with a thunderbolt, to the newspaper. The paper published the following announcement:</p>
   <p>"Our best assistants are the Germans in the United States. Their direct influence on matters of war, as they exist now, is invaluable to the Vaterland. They introduce a basis of restraints and considerations to public opinion which has often embarrassed Mr. Wilson."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0866.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The large mass of German-Americans in America will derive very little pleasure from such a compliment. The statement, coming from a Vaterland newspaper, claiming that the German-Americans help Germany through the influence set motion by them in the United States, would probably befit an English, French, or Russian newspaper. When a paper, which is published in Keln, and which is considered as an official newspaper, makes such a statement, it is apt to do a lot of harm to the Germans in America and to abate the influence which is considered, by the Koelnische Zeitung, so invaluable to the Vaterland.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to delve into any inquiries as to whether or not the "compliment" is well earned. We are very far from accusing <pb facs="5418474_11_0867.jpg" n="3"/>a race of conspiracy. The large masses of German-American, we are sure, are loyal to America. There is no doubt, however, that the Koelnische Zeitung, which is well informed, speaks with certainty; that a certain portion of the German-American population exercise their influence to benefit the Vaterland not because they want to play the role of conspirators to America, but for the reason that "blood is thicker than water."</p>
   <p>We are most interested in this point, because it unveils the vanity and falseness of all assimilated philosophies and imaginations.</p>
   <p>In times of peace we prate about international brotherhood, about doing away with nations and races, and some Utopians go as far as to advocate the annihilation of languages. As soon as a controversy <pb facs="5418474_11_0868.jpg" n="4"/>arises in which people take different stands, all philosophies explode, and like the material in a chemical flask, the different element dissolve. Like flock together according to their natural relationship.</p>
   <p>This is a point which our own assimilated critics should take to heart.</p>
