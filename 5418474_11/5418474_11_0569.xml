   <p>To the Germans of Chicago: In consequence of the rising immigration and the increasing congestion of relief seekers at the offices of the German Society. The work of the latter has increased to such a degree, that the employees cant any longer fulfil their duties however much the individual members of the council of administration are trying to do their best in giving assistance and in simplifying the business methods. Unfortunately it must be admitted that the enemies of the Society are not keeping up with its increased duties and that, due to its lack of funds, the society is unable to employ more help. But with the aid of the German population, we could increase our activities especially in paying more attention to the immigrants.</p>
   <p>Until now almost the whole time of one of our employees has been consumed by personally collecting the three monthly dues from our members who live scattered all over the city. To avoid this, it has been proposed to ask the members of the <pb facs="5418474_11_0570.jpg" n="2"/>society to pay their dues annually instead of quarterly.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously we take the opportunity to urge all German speaking citizens who are not yet members of the German Society to consider the necessity of help for needy Germans and to join the Society.</p>
