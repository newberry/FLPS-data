   <p>The German reservists who are stranded here in Chicago, but who have the burning desire to prove their patriotism by bearing arms for their country, have hit upon a new idea which may help them to realize their ambition. As soon as the news of Japan's threatening attitude towards Germany had spread, they decided on a plan which found public expression during an informal meeting held last night in the Bismarck Hotel. Like most other Americans, they think it impossible for the United States to stand idly by in case Japan declares war on Germany and the Yellows attempt to become the sole masters in the China sea and the adjoining waters of the Pacific Ocean. They rather expect America to be drawn into the brawl.</p>
   <p>If that should happen, the reservists--three thousand men have already declared their willingness--want to form several volunteer regiments under the command <pb facs="5418474_11_0141.jpg" n="2"/>of German officers and go to war for their old and their adopted countries. At the German consulate the idea is regarded favorably. Consul Reiswitz, when asked whether the men would be credited by the German authorities with the time they served under the American flag, observed that this could probably be arranged. Since so far it has been impossible to send the reservists to Germany, the next best thing would really be to let them fight together with an eventual ally. The Reich would probably sanction this procedure afterwards by a proclamation. Although international law had no provisions for a case like that because it has no precedent, the German Government would certainly not object to this sort of military service.</p>
