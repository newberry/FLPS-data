   <p>Otto Dietz, who especially in German war veteran's and military societies, was a highly esteemed man, died of a heart disease, not having been in the best of health for quite a while previously. Born in 1871 in Saxony, he came to visit the World's Fair of St. Louis in 1905. There he was engaged by the Lemp Brewery, owing to his mercantile abilities and worked for this firm until shortly before his death. As a friend of German good fellowship he devoted himself from the time of his arrival to German social life.</p>
   <p>For two terms he was president of the German Association of North America, for almost twenty years president of the German militia association, secretary of the Central Association of German Military clubs, one of the founders of the singing sections of the German Military Associations, member of the citizens union and the Herder Lodge. He was very proud of having worn the King's coat and was everywhere known as a good and true comrade.</p>
   <p>He is survived by his wife, Franziska and two sons, Otto and George. The funeral will be held tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 from the chapel, 3946 Milwaukee Ave. to Montrose Cemetery.</p>
