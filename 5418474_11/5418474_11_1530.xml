<title level="a">GENERAL PETER OSTERHANS THANKS THE NATIONAL UNION.</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In appreciation of the support given General Peter Osterhans, which the German-American National Union had given last winter to the General in their petition to Congress and which resulted in his being put on the pensioners' list of the regular army with the rank of a Major General, the old warrior sent the following telegram to the president of the National Union, Dr. C. E. Hexamer. The telegram was sent from Bonn and is dated October 14. The contents read:</p>
   <p>"From the bottom of my heart I thank you and the friends for the fine support on my account, which I shall appreciate for all time. Success has been achieved by close cooperation of the German people of the states. Your courageous and capable activity to unite the German-Americans also in matters of general interest will effect its justified influence on the trend of the times. The ideal goal of your problem is grand and beautiful, but many difficulties will present themselves, among them, indifference for idealistic causes without monetary advantages. The temptations in the country of plenty, for the adventurer, are very great and the danger for the German-American to assimilate himself with those adventurers and easy money makers is imminent. In time they forget <pb facs="5418474_11_1531.jpg" n="2"/>their descent and even their mother tongue and the children may be lost to German views altogether. The language is the soul of the people. Whoever wants to know a country must first learn its language. The German national character embodies truth, courage, and faithfulness. History has shown this 2,000 years ago and still shows it today. Family ties are still sacred and the parents work for the ethical education of the children. If they make their own way in the world, accompanied by the blessings of their parents, they will develop into active and capable members of society. They are the supporters of German nationality, the fighters for the honor of the entire population in peace and war."</p>
   <p>The General concluded to return to the United States in the Spring.</p>
