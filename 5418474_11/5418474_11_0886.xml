   <p>Our Germans are maliciously attacking Secretary of State Bryan for his valiant efforts to maintain peace, to uphold the neutrality of our country, and thus save us all the terrible happenings whose scene is present-day Europe. They abuse him, call him "the most devoted servant of England," although not even the German government has yet found the slightest reason to protest any violation, of neutrality by our country. It is evident that some of our Germans are more Germanic than the German government itself, which is a most peculiar quality to find in American citizens and is bound to start suspicious thoughts of this peculiarity in other American citizens. In the Day Book, we read the other day a letter from Wisconsin in which its writer, a lady, describes the fanatical ways of Germans in her vicinity, who proclaim openly that they would take a stand against our Republic if war between Germany and the United States should break out. They would go with <pb facs="5418474_11_0887.jpg" n="2"/>their own "Vaterland". Such fanaticism may do a great deal of harm not only to American Germans, but to all European immigrants.</p>
