  <body>
   <p>Karl J. Stierlen is dead. The report of his death will awaken sincere regrets in wide circles of our German population, and also among Americans. Mr. Stierlen was respected and beloved on account of his thorough honesty and his true Americanism; at the same time he was a good German.</p>
   <p>He succumbed to a severe attack of acute indigestion, after suffering for only a few hours, at his home, 2033 Lane P1.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stierlen was born in 1862 in Markreinigen, Wurttemberg, Germany. He had a good education and came to the United States in 1880. At first he stayed in Jersey City, N. J. Later in 1882 he came to Chicago where he entered the service of the cigar manufacturer, G. Meog and Sons. He was in the employ of this firm for over forty years, for a long time as secretary and director of the sales department. He also was interested in several mining and transportation companies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1336.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first society he joined in his life was the Chicago Turner Society. The Swabian and German Clubs also found him a faithful member. He was a Free Mason and a member of the Elks. He is survived by his widow, nee Emma Schaefer; there are no children. Funeral services will be held at 1253 N. Clark Street tomorrow afternoon. Burial will be at Graceland Cemetery.</p>
