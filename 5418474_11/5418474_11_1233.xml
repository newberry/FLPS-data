  <body>
   <p>As postmaster of the great metropolitan city, Chicago, Arthur Lueder deserves the thanks of the entire public, not only because of his ability and endeavors to create a closer co-operation between the different postal branches, but also of his efforts to secure a higher standard of work in the postal service.</p>
   <p>Arthur Lueder was born in 1876 in Elmhurst, Ill., son of Professor John Lueder. He graduated from Elmhurst College, studied law and turned later in 1902 to real estate. In 1921 he was appointed postmaster of Chicago. He took over his office in October of the same year and has served ever since, except for interruption in 1923, when Mr. Lueder ran as candidate for Mayor of Chicago against Judge Dever.</p>
   <p>Arthur Lueder is a member of the Germania Club, the German Club, and many other German-American Societies. He also is a veteran of the Spanish-American war and a prominent Free Mason. His activity as postmaster is highly valued, and among his employees he enjoys great popularity, because of his joviality towards them.</p>
