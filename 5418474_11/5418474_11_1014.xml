   <p>The several speeches delivered by Bismarck, November the 28th,were in reply to the complaints coming from the Centrist Party that the German government forbade the Jesuits to make use of the German colonies. The Chancellor explained, that this precaution was taken, not because they (the Jesuits) are an order of the Catholic Church, but, because their activities are directed against nationalism, and they (the Jesuits) therefore have to be regarded as enemies of Germany. On this occasion Bismarck also hit at the German-Americans, saying: "Germany can not boast of a great deal of national devotion. I may even add, that we suffer in this respect from anemia, considering with what ease a great many Germans throw of their nationality. All this reflects upon our national activities, our personality and our party. Once in America, the Germans lose interest in their language, and what is more they speak insultingly of the Germans." Bismarck has known many German-Americans who conversed with him in excellent German. What a coincidence, that at the same time the much travelled Professor Hoffmann replied to the Kaiser's questions, that the German-Americans cling with all their love to the old Fatherland and honor the Kaiser highly. There we have two extremes. But the fact remains, that as long as there are German settlers in any of the colonies or in our Republic, the majority of the German-Americans are true <pb facs="5418474_11_1015.jpg" n="2"/>to the language and customs of the old Fatherland. But they became American citizens, and the love for the German nation does not include the despotic princes and governments. To escape those they emigrated, therefore they cannot be expected to approve now (that despotism) when they come for a visit from their adopted country. The Germans here were united into one nation at a time when the question in Europe was still, "Where is the German's Fatherland?" At that time the "Man of Blood and Iron," who later was to solve all these problems by force, was still unknown. The 50th anniversary of the Philadelphia "Male Chorus" could enlighten him, regarding the German-American love for the old Fatherland.</p>
