   <p>Yesterday a quarter of a century was passed since Pastor Ludwig Lochner followed the call of the Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church. Of course the day should not go by without recognition by the Parish members and they arranged for their highly esteemed pastor a festival service at which Pastor Engelbrecht delivered the sermon.</p>
   <p>After the service the treasurer of the Parish handed a considerable money gift to the minister and also the Church organizations presented him with honorary gifts. Pastor Ludwig Lochner was born on April 7, 1842, in Nuremberg and came in 1849 with his parents to America. In 1864 he became a pastor, remaining until 1867 in Richton, Illinois, then for ten years in Richmond, Virginia. In August, 1877 he was called to his present parsonage. During his 38 year-career not a single time was he prevented from preaching by illness. On November 18, 1864 he was married to Miss Louise Knab of Milwaukee. He is the father of eight children, of whom six are living, five daughters and one son.</p>
