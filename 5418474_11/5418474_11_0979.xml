   <p>p. 5.. Judge Stein returned from his European journey and says that he feels mentally and physically strengthened. He will resume his official activities tomorrow. Every Saturday will be set aside for divorce cases.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to hear his dissertations about the German judicial system which he studied thoroughly. "I have noticed," he said yesterday, "that the German judges have a different position than here. They feel a greater sense of dignity and are also more conscientious in their judicial duties. Abroad the judge questions the witnesses, although the lawyers are also able to ask questions which the judge may have overlooked. The petitions and acts in civil as well as criminal cases contain much more detail, are more thorough than in the United States. It is quite unusual that an appeal is taken to a higher court and all legal business is therefore settled more promptly than here."</p>
