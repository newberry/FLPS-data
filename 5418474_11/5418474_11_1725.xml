   <p>St. Louis, November 13 - A special wire of the "Chronicle" from Springfield, Ill., contains an interview with Governor Altgeld concerning yesterday's anarchist celebration in Chicago, at the Waldheim cemetery where the pardoned anarchists Schwab, Field and Neebe delivered speeches. The governor was asked whether the pardon was not given under the condition that the above mentioned will not hold "any more speeches about anarchism". He replied: "I have granted the pardons, because I did not hold these people guilty of the crimes of which they were accused, and I have not imposed no conditions what-so-ever." He declared further: "You can report to the "Chronicle" and its readers, that there are no real anarchists in the entire state of Illinois, not even a single one. The only cause of the talk about anarchy are the daily papers; if these would cease to talk about it, nothing would be heard of it any more; only they keep the subject alive.</p>
   <p>The laborers in Chicago and other places of Illinois are as good citizens as can be found in any other state. Many of them are well-to-do; many own property, and all are good citizens and no anarchists.</p>
   <p>Of course the people have a right to have their own opinion about everything and <pb facs="5418474_11_1726.jpg" n="2"/>also to express this just as it is allowed to all citizens. If they make use of this right, one should not call their speeches "anarchistic" whithout reason.</p>
   <p>No Sir! There is no anarchist in the state of Illinois, not a single one."- With this he closed the conversation about this matter.</p>
