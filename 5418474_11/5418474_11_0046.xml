   <p>St. Antonius Church, at the corner of McGregor and Hanover Street, was dedicated yesterday forenoon amid impressive festivities. Not only a large German Catholic contingent from the South Side appeared but also Irish and American adherents of the faith were present, and so not a vacant seat was available at the large church. Unfortunately Bishop Farley was not well yesterday morning, and....Bishop Dwenger of Fort Wayne officiated. Delegates of various Catholic societies met the bishop and his ecclesiastical entourage at 18th and State Streets, and accompanied the clergymen to the church. At ten o'clock the dedicatory festivities commenced amid impressive ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Father Riordan....of the Chicago diocese, assisted by his brother, Deacon Patrick Riordan, and Subdeacon Masterson, read the Holy Mass. Music was provided by the Chicago Orchestra, and choirs of various German parishes. Matthias Schlaudecker, well-known organ builder, conducted. The choirs sang very well, although it became apparent at times that they were not accustomed to singing <pb facs="5418474_11_0047.jpg" n="2"/>in a large, combined group......</p>
   <p>Bishop Dwenger based his sermon on Zachariah's story of the mulberry tree, following which the entire congregation sang "Grosser Gott Wir Loben Dich" (Te Deum); this marked the end of the imposing festival.</p>
   <p>Besides the clergymen already named, the following members of the Catholic hierarchy also participated: [Altogether fifteen names were listed: Irish and German.]</p>
   <p>The St. Antonius parish is of recent origin; the church community was founded by the highly active Father Fischer who....finished St. Peters Church at Polk and Clark Streets, and founded the church at Naperville. Within a short time, little more than five years, he succeeded in founding a large congregation and, due to his indefatigable efforts, the community now possesses a splendid church....and the small mortgage still encumbering it will probably be paid in the near future. The church is built of yellow brick from Watertown, Wisconsin, and sandstone from the Auxsable quarries. The church is to be 150 feet long, <pb facs="5418474_11_0048.jpg" n="3"/>and is to have a frontage of 72 feet; and the transept is to be 100 feet wide.</p>
   <p>The church's exterior is imposing; the only defect is that the building appears to be somewhat short in proportion to its height. However, this can be remedied by filling in the building plot up to four or five feet, to the established street level. This would tend to give the church an appearance of being lower. A lengthening of the church was probably out of the question as the architect had to design his plans in conformity with the size of the building site. The temporary, wooden stairway leading to the main portals also detracts from the general appearance. Nevertheless, the facade with its three large portals and the rich, but not ostentatious, ornaments, is the most imposing part of the exterior.</p>
   <p>The church is built in the form of a Latin cross. The breadth of the transept is the same as the width of the main part of the church, and, where the two arms of the transept join there appears the partly finished tower, surrounded by four smaller ones. The gable roof, at the front, is surmounted by a fair-sized tower which will contain the vesper bells. The area for the choir is <pb facs="5418474_11_0049.jpg" n="4"/>semicircular and the space above it forms a dome. The church was built according to the plans of Paul Huber, a Chicago architect, and the style is very reminiscent of the better Romanesque architecture of the latter part of the eleventh century; the entire conception bears a striking resemblance to the beautiful convent church at Laach. The exterior shows harmonious proportions and in the interior this effect is still more evident, as cross-shaped, vaulted ceilings of rounded arches greet the beholder. At the base of the vaulted ceiling, [at the confluence of the arch and wall which forms a tangent] project the capitals on which the six-foot statues of the twelve apostles are to be mounted.</p>
   <p>The so-called square from which the transepts, nave and niches of the church extend, is surmounted by a dome 34 feet in diameter; its highest point is 72 feet above the floor. The main portions of the church are 50 feet high, and the transepts are 26 feet high. Wall ribs, pillars, capitals, etc., all are symmetrical and conform in their style to the entire conception, thereby, creating a uniform, appropriate effect which will be greatly augmented when <pb facs="5418474_11_0050.jpg" n="5"/>the serene tones of the powerful organ reverberate through the magnificent building.</p>
   <p>The rather austere coloring of the interior is, fortunately, somewhat enlivened by the artistic stained glass windows. We feel that when the church is completed in all its details, it will be regarded as an architectural accomplishment worthy of emulation not only in our city but throughout the West.</p>
