   <p>Although America has only dignified sarcasm for German ability, thoroughness and honesty, yet when public affairs are thoroughly mismanaged, the American public readily seeks these qualities in its saviours. Especially in its police system, Chicago is the Eldorado of criminal vagabonds and the citizen does not feel safe even in his bed. The conditions of safety were dangerously weak, and finally the States Attorney held the chief of police responsible for these outrageous conditions, and at last the Grand jury indicted the Chief of Police. The Mayor of Chicago still protected the chief, until he himself came to the conclusion, that such conditions could not be tolerated any longer, and the man who would be the head of Chicago's safety, must not only have the necessary ability and energy, but must also have an immaculate past in his professional career in his public life in America. Therefore, of course, the selection must fall upon a German.</p>
   <p>Herman Schuttler, who will be the next chief of police of Chicago, has always been the most eligible man, whenever the position as chief of police was to be <pb facs="5418474_11_1435.jpg" n="2"/>filled; his zeal for duty, his ability for a responsible position, his unimpeachable honesty, were always acknowledged, and yet he was always passed over, because he was a German.</p>
   <p>But now our high authorities are forced to understand, that only the German Schuttler is able to clean up the Augean stable, and that he is the only one, who enjoys morally and physically, the reputation, which is requisite for successful activity.</p>
   <p>Herman Schuttler will certainly be an honor to his German descent, and with an iron fist he will crush corruption inside the police system, at the same time, the criminals, who have led an easy life, and who were seldom disturbed will also feel his iron fists.</p>
   <p>Herman Schuttler started with the police force from the very bottom, and the fact that be now stands at the top, in spite of his German descent, proves that he belongs there.</p>
