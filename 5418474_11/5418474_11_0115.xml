   <p>Otto Tischer, member of the Benjamin S. Butler Post, was taken by death at the age of eighty-nine.</p>
   <p>The funeral arrangements for Mr. Tishcer have been completed. He died at the Edward Hines Hospital last Tuesday. The services will be conducted in the chapel of Graceland Cemetery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tischer was born in Germany in 1842 and came to this country in his early youth. He enlisted in the Union Army in 1863, becoming a member of Company C. of the 35th New Jersey volunteers. At the completion of his military service, he became interested in the real estate business, but the great conflagration of 1871 left him penniless. Mr. Tischer was in robust health until the recent heat wave broke down his strong constitution. He was one of the four surviving Veterans of the Benjamin S. Butler Post No. 754 of the G. A. R.</p>
