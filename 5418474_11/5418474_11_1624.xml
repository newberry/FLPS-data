   <p>The desire of the State Central Committee, to postpone the celebration of peace until after election, because of party-politics has been simply ignored by the County Democrats. Mayor Harrison, and his followers, have thereby plainly manifested that they will not dance to Ex-Governor Altgeld's music. It is to be expected that Altgeld will strike back.</p>
   <p>It was frankly admitted yesterday in political circles, that the unity in the Democratic camp was a thing of the past, and that Altgeld will have nothing to do with the election campaign in Cook County; he may possibly throw a monkey-wrench into the whole works. Mayor Harrison stated also, that the Celebration Committee is non-partisan and that he cannot agree with the Central Committee, accusing the Republicans of intending to exploit the affair for political purposes, and that Ex-Governor Altgeld must have been wrongly informed, otherwise his well-known speech and his statements are unthinkable.</p>
