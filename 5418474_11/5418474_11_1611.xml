   <p>If one claims an important position on the basis of being a good fellow, he should at least avoid making political statements. The nomination of E. Hoechster, as candidate for Congress, can be considered only as a bad joke, or as a deed of a sacrificial character. Perhaps, there might have been a few Germans, who would have voted for him, since he is a subject of charity and must be supported at public expense anyhow, and to let him go to the poorhouse is lamentable. But Hoechster, gets so intoxicated by his own eloquence, that he forgets the part he was to play originally. A few days ago he made some statements, which he afterwards tried to modify but could not deny. We quote:</p>
   <p>"As your candidate I stand upon the Chicago platform....Everything in this platform is good enough for me; I support the whole program. I am for bi-metalism. I stand for the principles of W. J. Bryan; and also for the principles of the best Governor we ever had, Mr. Altgeld. I stand against <pb facs="5418474_11_1612.jpg" n="2"/>the rotten law, which is now on our statue book, the Civil Service law. This law has done more damage to the citizens of Illinois than any other one known."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoechster was interviewed by a reporter of the Abendpost. When his attention was called to this particular part of his speech, he tried to escape his predicament by the personally written statement:</p>
   <p>"I am against the Civil Service law, as it is now on our statue books and as it is now executed. I stand for the repeal of this law. It is a humbug now and must be amended." With the same breath he demands the definite repeal of the law, and the amendment of the same. He accuses the present Democratic Mayor, Mr. Harrison; that he and his advisers make a humbug of this law. The last statement, indeed, is true, but this is only evidence, that the best laws are ineffective, if the executive officials neglect their duty and trample upon the law, as it were, with their feet.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_1613.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Of course it is not difficult to understand, that Mr. Hoechster is against a law, which demands proof of the ability of applicants for official positions, for this puts the bread-basket where it can hardly be reached by the average professional politician. However, he should know at least, what the voters of his district think of the infamous "spoil-system", which seemed to be invented solely for the Irish bread and butter brigade.</p>
   <p>He was not compelled to state his opinion in regard to the Civil Service law of the state, because he is a candidate for Congress and not for the State legislature. Obviously, he desired to recommend himself as a real follower of the party to those, who nominated him. There is no danger, that he is going to be elected. His statements have reduced his chances still more. Emil Hoechster will not be the representative of that congressional district in Chicago, which is most thickly populated by Germans.</p>
