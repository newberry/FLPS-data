   <p>Through the death of Josef H. Ernst, the Germans of Chicago have lost one of their most capable representatives.</p>
   <p>He was born on February 25, 1838, in Bingen on the Rhine. He emigrated to this country when he was 16 years old. He crossed the Atlantic ocean on the French ship "St. Nicholes." The trip lasted forty-eight days. After coming to Chicago he enrolled as a student in the old Franklin school..... As assistant to his uncle, then superintendent of the Chicago City Cemetery, he had ample time to attend Sloan's Commercial and Law College, completing his studies in 1858. Then followed his appointment in 1864, by the Mayor of Chicago, as superintendent of the City Cemetery, and two <pb facs="5418474_11_1568.jpg" n="2"/>years later he was elected Clerk of the Comptroller's office. He occupied this position for fifteen years. Mr. Ernst was elected secretary of the Mutual German Fire Insurance Company of North Chicago in 1874.</p>
   <p>His election in 1886 as Alderman (Democratic) of the fifteenth ward shows the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow citizens. He was re-elected in 1888, but according to the new district division he represented what is now the twenty-first ward. Ernst emphatically declined his re-election in 1890, but in 1892 he could not resist the urgent plea of his friends any longer and, therefore, announced his candidacy for alderman on the Independent ticket. He received almost as many votes in this <pb facs="5418474_11_1569.jpg" n="3"/>election as were cast for both of his opponents combined. He always justified the confidence placed in him by the public. Mr. Ernst, was a member of various German benevolent societies to which he donated much of his time and efforts.....</p>
