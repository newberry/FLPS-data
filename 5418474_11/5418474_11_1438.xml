   <p>Chicago lost, through the death of Gerhard Huessen, an outstanding and well known personality. By profession he was a singer. He also was one of the oldest readers of the Illinois Staats Zeitung. He was a man with extraordinary qualities and a friendly and charming disposition, which is natural of the people born in the Rhineland, the most beautiful part of Germany.</p>
   <p>Gerhard Huessen was born in 1835, in the small town of Orsay, Rhine province, Germany. He was the son of a state official, who in his younger years served as an officer in the German Army, and also fought in the battle of Waterloo, and with the confederates entered Paris after the victorious war of liberation, in which Napoleon was defeated. In 1855, Gerhard Huessen immigrated to the United States. He first went to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, four years later he came to Chicago, where he obtained his citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>Among his many pleasant memories are several outstanding incidents of which he spoke, for instance, how he in conjuction with his fellow singers serenaded President Lincoln, who, on his way to the capital for the inaugural ceremony, <pb facs="5418474_11_1439.jpg" n="2"/>stayed for one night in Chicago. Later on, he performed the sad task of singing a farewell song at the slain and beloved President's bier, whose body lay in state in Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>After paying Germany a long visit, he returned, and again made Chicago his home town. His active participation in all German social undertakings, especially where German songs were cultivated, and because of his excellent tenor voice, which was of fine quality, gained him great fame. He took part in many big concerts, and sang in Roman Catholic Churches to his old age. He was an honorary member of many prominent singing circles of Chicago, also abroad. He was an active member of the exclusive music clubs of Cologne, Dusseldorf, and Aachen.</p>
   <p>His family life was ideal. His deep reverance for his native country was symbolic. He died at the patriarchal age of eighty one years, deeply mourned by his loving family.</p>
