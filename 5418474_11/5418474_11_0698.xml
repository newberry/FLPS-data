  <body>
   <p>The idea of organizing an International Radio Forum for the purpose of international understanding and exchange of ideas was put into practice only a few weeks ago. This ingenious application of modern technique was first made in Paris, where a Trans-Atlantic transmitting service was organized. The idea has now gained a strong foothold in Germany.</p>
   <p>Owing to this, German-Americans in the United States will have a chance in the future to listen more often to German authorities of different branches of Science.</p>
   <p>As founder and chairman of the International Radio Forum, the former Ambassador to Sweden, Ira Nelson Morris, made recently known that a German Committee was formed which consists of the following prominent public men in Germany: Dr. K.O. Bertling, director of the American Institute in Berlin; the wholsale manufacturer, Dr. Robert Basch; Dr. Hans von Bredow, National Broadcasting Commissioner; Dr. Hugo Eckener, Director of the Zeppelin Works; Prof. Albert Einstein; <pb facs="5418474_11_0699.jpg" n="2"/>Dr. Gerhart Hauptmann; Prof. Ernst Jaekl, president of the German College of Politics; Dr. Richard von Kuehlman, former Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs Franz von Mendelsohn, former president of the International Chamber of Commerce; the wholesale manufacturer, Dr. Carl Friedrich von Siemens; Dr. Wilhelm Solf, former Ambassador of the German Reich; Banker Max Warburg, and Max Jordan, representatives of the National Broadcasting Company in Middle Europe.</p>
   <p>Organized on an International Basis</p>
   <p>The International Radio Forum, of which Committees already have been formed in France and America, and which now also will be extended into other countries, is not built either on a political or a business basis, but is intended only to serve as a means of fostering mutual understanding among nations.</p>
   <p>All of the American broadcasting will be transmitted over the network of <pb facs="5418474_11_0700.jpg" n="3"/>the National Broadcasting Company. All addresses transmitted by individual persons will be made in the English language.</p>
