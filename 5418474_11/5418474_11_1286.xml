  <body>
   <p>In the midst of his work, one of the most prominent technologists of Chicago, Prof. Frederick Stuhlemann, dean of the Siebel Institute of Technology and member of the executive board of the institute, died suddenly at the age of 75 years. Dr. Stuhlemann succumbed to a heart attack in his, office.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stuhlemann was born in Menningen, Bavaria, Germany, in 1857, and was educated in German schools. He studied in Munich, where he received his Ph. D. For several years he was assistant professor of chemistry. Dr. Stuhlemann came to Chicago, in 1882, where he became one of the most prominent chemists of the institute, and has been a teacher of many who today are very prominent in the chemical industry.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stuhlemann is survived by his widow. (Note: Probably Memmingen or Meinningen; no town named Menningen is listed.)</p>
