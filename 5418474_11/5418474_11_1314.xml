  <body>
   <p>Shortly after having completed his biography for the Abendpost, Rudolph Steindle, well known in German circles, died in his home, 1027 Oakland Avenue, at the age of 71 years.</p>
   <p>Steindle belonged to the "old faithful ones," who, although born in America, never forgot their German origin, and who were always willing to give their time to promote and foster the interests of the German element. He was, according to his own story, born in 1856, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and learned to be a lithographer.</p>
   <p>In 1871 he moved with his parents to Chicago and specialized in stage decoration. Later he founded a decorating and sign painting business which he managed until his death. On the occasion of the World's Fair in Chicago he furnished big display carriages to the various German societies.</p>
   <p>Steindle was a member of the Chicago Turner Society for over 53 years, and belonged for years to the Lessing lodge No. 557, A. F. &amp; A. M. He was a member of the "Circle" and the German Club, the Old Masters Club, and the Orpheus Men's Chorus.</p>

   <p>He is survived by his widow, who had shared his joys and sorrows for over 46 years.</p>
