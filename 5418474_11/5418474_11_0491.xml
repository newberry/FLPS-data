<title level="a">DRASTIC IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Out of obscurity comes the Democratic Congressman S. A. Roddenbery of Georgia, announcing his contemplated immigration restriction bill, which can not fail to win the approval of every person who is opposed to the foreign element in this country. The well-known bill on that subject, which was introduced by Senator Dillingham and applauded by the nativists of this country, could hardly be regarded as anti-immigration, if compared with the bill which Congressman Roddenbery proposes to introduce.</p>
   <p>Senator Dillingham proposes that in addition to the exclusion of the yellow race, which is already exempt by law from the privilege of being admitted as citizens of the United States (including Chinese, Japanese, and various members of the yellow race), that every immigrant irrespective of color should be submitted to an intelligence test upon his arrival in this country. Furthermore, every male immigrant who has <pb facs="5418474_11_0492.jpg" n="2"/>passed the age of 16 years, should prove his ability to read and write; while in the case of absolute illiteracy-although having no physical handicaps which would be a preventing factor in the acquisition of that knowledge-the immigrant should not be permitted to enter this country. However, the bill is provided with one redeeming clause, namely that no separation of families must take place.... The Dillingham Bill proposes further a more drastic immigration law concerning the so-called contract workers,-limitations which have already reached the point of irrationality. The penalty to be imposed upon corporations and industrial concerns which would import foreign labor regardless of that law, should be an extremely severe one.</p>
   <p>This Republican Senator, who is also Chairman of the Immigration Commission by appointment of Congress, announced his thorough study and wide knowledge of that subject, and therefore, deems further changes of the present immigration law unnecessary. Very gracious, indeed.</p>
   <p>But the Democratic Representative is not satisfied with quite as little. There is, of course, a comparatively small percentage of the foreign <pb facs="5418474_11_0493.jpg" n="3"/>element living in his state, and the importance of their votes is rather vague. Obviously he believes: If not, why not, and then acts accordingly. He proposes the intelligence test for persons passed the age of 14 years. Furthermore, that admission to this nation shall be permissable only if the immigrant can show that he actually possesses $100, besides the present head tax of $4 (pending an increase to $50). The immigrant must also be in the possession of a certificate of good character, which must bear the official stamp of his homeland. But even then, the decision of admission would depend largely upon the immigration officials. In addition, a physical examination must also be performed, to which every male immigrant between the ages of 14-50 would have to submit and which would compare with the strictest physical examination undergone only by recruits who enlist in the Army of the Federal Government. The immigrant must pass all these tests before being admitted to this country, thus he may be prepared to join the army if necessity calls; else be returned to his native land, regardless of his immaculate character and in many instances excellent possibilities.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_11_0494.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, it would be safe to assume that, if the proposed immigration law should be adopted, the Europeans, who would still feel inclined to seek the hospitality of this nation, could be transported to these shores in one single, moderately sized boat. The radical changes of immigration restrictions as proposed by Mr. Roddenbery can be regarded as a fantastic brain-storm, from which no real danger is looming. It is, of course, needless to emphasize that this bill will not gain the necessary support. On the other hand, different other attempts are also being made to restrict immigration, the success of which is not quite so remote. For instance, the bill in favor of the increase of the head tax to $10, and various other limitations as proposed by the Republican Representative Hayes, of California, and indorsed by Mr. Overman, the Democratic Senator from North Carolina.</p>
   <p>The Hayes Bill proposes to refuse permission to this country to any person 16 years of age, who cannot prove his or her ability to speak and write English, or at least have the knowledge of another language spoken in Europe. (Hebrew and Yiddish would constitute the required knowledge). Exempt from this ruling would be a person coming from Canada, Newfoundland, Cuba, and Mexico <pb facs="5418474_11_0495.jpg" n="5"/>provided that he or she resided in the respective country not less than three years. He also proposes that each person who would be admitted to this country must have $25 in his possession.</p>
   <p>Although each of these Immigration Restriction Bills differ in the particulars, each one proposes, however, the consideration of the intelligence test. It may be well to cite the fact that once during the administration of Grover Cleveland a similarly drastic immigration restriction bill was submitted to Congress. The bill received the general approval of both Houses although it was not put into effect because it had been vetoed by the President. It is also true that the supporters of that bill will double and redouble their efforts, which they expect will culminate in their victory; the possibility of which can not be questioned.</p>
   <p>It is highly important that friends of immigration realize the seriousness and get busy in order to avert a calamity which would arise if the bill should be passed.</p>
