   <p>A meeting has been scheduled for this evening, at the North-side Turnhall. Matters appertaining to the new regiment will be discussed. All Turn Clubs are requested to send a representative as a unified plan for the organization of the German regiment is to be considered. All those, who have announced their intention to be members of this regiment and also those who intend to join, should present themselves at the Turnhall, Thursday evening at 7:30. Drilling will be commenced next Monday. President Schlenker of the German Warriors Association of North America, considered it his duty, to report to President Mc Kinley, that, if necessity requires it, the Republic can rely on the service of the association's members. Mc Kinley's private secretary replied, that the letter has been sent to the War Department, with a request for proper consideration. The German Warriors Club of Chicago, of which Mr. Schlenker is a member, endorsed his stand unanimously, yesterday and adopted the following resolution: As our adopted Fatherland is endangered by war, this association has unanimously decided, that if our help is necessary, then we, old, experienced soldiers will be prepared to serve our country whenever called upon, in conjunction with all other Warriors. Associations.</p>
   <p>John Arndt, Pres. Franz Kwiatkowski, Sec.</p>
