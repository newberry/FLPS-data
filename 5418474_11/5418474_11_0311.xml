   <p>Numerous friends paid their last respect yesterday to Julius Roemheld, at the funeral services in Graceland Cemetery. Mr. Roemheld was born in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1828. As an immigrant, he came to Chicago in 1850, and soon thereafter established himself as chemist on the corner of Clark and Kinzie Streets. His was the first geniune drug store in Chicago, greatly appreciated by hunters and others, who came very frequently from distances of several hundred miles in order to provide themselves with medicines from his renowned drug store. However, he sold the business in 1865 to Anton Caspar Hesing, and Mr. Emil Dietzsch, the latter a very popular national poet. After the completion of this business transaction, Mr. Roemheld engaged in the manufacture of chemicals, with a factory at 212 Kinzie Street, which was consumed by the great conflagration. He retired from business several years ago.............................</p>
