   <p>The celebrant is the Sinai Community. Most prominent for its leadership among the reformed Jewish communities in the West, is the Sinai congregation which is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary today.</p>
   <p>The congregation was organized in 1876 with an initial membership of about 350 families, which has now grown to 2,000. The staff of the Sunday school consists of the superintendent and seven assisting teachers, all of whom are well-equipped to give religious instruction to 280 children. The first rabbi to serve the congregation was B. Felsenthal, for many years identified as an organizer of Jewish communities in our city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felsenthal became the spiritual leader of the first Jewish community, founded in Chicago in 1863. On June 7 of the same year the first reformed synagogue was dedicated by that congregation. It was a one-story <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1013.jpg" n="2"/>frame building situated at Monroe Street. Due to the rapid growth of the city, the community was constantly forced to change its place of worship.....When Mr. Felsenthal retired from active work, his appreciative congregation bestowed upon him a pension for life. The surviving founders of the Sinai congregation are : Henry and Elias Greenebaum, Leopold Mayer, H. Frankenthal, Joseph L. Gatzert, Abram Hart, and Nelson Morris. The present officials of the community are: Adolph Loeb president and Selig Greenebaum secretary. Listed in consecutive order are the rabbis who served the community since it was founded: Messrs. Felsenthal, Chroneck, Kohler, and Hirsch. Doctor Hirsch, the present pastor of the congregation, was called to this pulpit in 1880, and became engaged immediately in extraordinary and far-reaching activity. The present temple is situated at the corner of Indiana Avenue and 21st Street.</p>
