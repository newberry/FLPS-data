   <p>At a meeting that was to be held at the Ohavah Sholom Congregation, which was called off on account of various reasons, the Chicago Rabbis, or better said the Chicago Rabbinate, were about to protest to the Chicago Jewry for not being given the respect and honor due them as teachers and leaders in various societies to which they adhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0923.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is evidence that the material condition of the rabbis in this country has improved immensely. The time has passed when the Jewish public was called to a mass meeting in order to raise money so that the rabbis could be provided with a livelihood. When seeking honor it is obvious that one is not confronted with financial worries. Hungry men do not look for honor.</p>
   <p>It also shows that our rabbis do not utilize practical teachings. They should have known that this mass meeting would be as futile as the others called for the purpose of raising money. In general, the idea of creating honor, through mass meetings, is dishonorable.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0924.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Our rabbis are now better off materially, due to the fact that our societies are wealthier. We are, thank God, very successful in this country, and we can support our rabbis in a fine manner. No mass meeting can accomplish what good business can do, and the rabbis will receive their portion of honor if they will stand higher morally and spiritually in the congregations, and by this they will command the respect, not only of the members of their respective congregations, but also of the general public.</p>
   <p>The rabbi is unlike the Protestant or Catholic prelate. The rabbinical position is, among Jews, not recognized as the position of the Christian clergy. The rabbinical clothes do not reflect his sacredness as do the uniforms of the Gentile clergy.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0925.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The rabbis will get the respect to which they are entitled, if they will be recognized by the public. May the rabbis not forget that the Jewry of America are still in a degree of the Generation of the Wilderness, (referring to Numbers in the Bible). They still remember Russia and can not break the habit of paying tribute to such a rabbi as they have seen in Europe, and they look upon the American rabbi with great suspicion. May the rabbis rear a new Jewish generation of American children who shall be brought up to respect the American rabbi, and then they will receive their due respect. They should let the older generation alone. No mass meeting will alter the situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0926.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We are not aware of the true reason why the mass meeting was called off. But if they have come to the conclusion, which we have herein expressed, then it is obvious that our rabbis are beginning to acquaint themselves with the prevailing conditions of America.</p>
