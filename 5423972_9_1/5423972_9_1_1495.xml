   <p>Hadassah! What a glorious and inspiring chapter you have written in the annals of Zionism. Your workers and leaders in Chicago were the pace makers and path-finders for this noble endeavor. Your efforts in creating the world famous $50,00 give-or-get dinner has inspired many communities in the country to follow your example. You have steered your ship in peaceful waters, for years, mindful of your goal; the healing and succor of the sick and the needy in Eretz Yisrael. You have been the pet of Chicago Jewry because of your devotion, your sincerity, and the intelligence with which you have conducted its affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1496.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>You have created an organization which has become the finest of its kind in the country. You have never lost your head but kept clear of all entanglements.</p>
   <p>And now for some unknown reason, all this has unfortunately changed. We were not backward in calling attention to this undesirable change. Mr. Max Korshak is peeved at our straightforward constructive criticism. He evidently does not know that Chicago Hadassah was born in our home and that we were its god-father, so to speak. For twenty years we have nourished and helped Hadassah with all that was within our means until it has become all-powerful and with this power lost its balance. Arrogance has taken the place of fortitude, and dictatorship has supplanted conciliation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1497.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Political "deals" and Jesuit tactics are an everyday occurrence. We have no personal grievances or axe to grind with Hadassah. We wish it well. It deserves it. But if the present conduct of its leaders is permitted to continue without being challenged, we fear for the future of that most worthy organization. The mere fact that one man, whom some of the Hadassah leaders do not like, would be present at the Herzl Memorial meeting caused them to refuse to honor the memory of Dr. Herzl. What stupidity. The leaders of Hadassah were ready to make a "deal" with the Zionist organization to carry out their pet peeve, and that is not fair to Hadassah, nor to its good name, and the sooner they realize it the better it will be for all concerned. Hadassah has a powerful influence on the Jewish women of Chicago and we hope that it will continue to exercise that influence for the good of Hadassah and for the good of Chicago Jewish women.</p>
