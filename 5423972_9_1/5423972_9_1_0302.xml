   <p>p. 3 - At yesterday's closing session of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, the district lodge No. 6 decided, to indorse the Chautauqua - system. For this purpose $400 has been appropriated. The district lodge announced its intentions, to arrange a course in Jewish history and philosophy. It has also made preparations for a series of lectures, by the most prominent scholars.</p>
   <p>The Order of B'nai B'rith was founded October 18th, 52 years ago, - therefore that day is to be known henceforth, as the "B'nai B'rith Day."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0303.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was suggested, that the lodge express its appreciation to Mr. Julius Bien of New York, who as president of the national grand lodge, served the order so faithfully for the past 20 years. Due to his efforts, the order has branched out beyond our shores.</p>
   <p>The question of the insurance policy has been settled, agreeing on a 30 per cent reduction on all outstanding policies. For new members, the system will remain unaltered. The new rules will go into effect, July 1st, 1900. The proposal that the convention of the district lodge, should be held every other year in the future, has been rejected, because the suggestion did not receive the required majority of the votes.</p>
