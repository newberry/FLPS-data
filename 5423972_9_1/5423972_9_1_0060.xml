   <p>The twenty-first convention of the Progressive Order of the West opened with great ceremony in the Crystal Room of the Sherman Hotel. The hall was decorated with American and Jewish flags; the Marx Nathan Orphan Home Band played "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Hatikvah". Rabbi Mushkin offered a prayer, and lawyer S. Meikon introduced Mayor Thompson's representative, Mr. Frank Ayres, who welcomed the convention in the name of the city. Then an appropriate address of acknowledgement was given by lawyer Max Shulman. The chairman of the convention committee, Mr. S. Handelman, gave the "gavel" to Grand Master Abraham Levy who read his message, and then the actual work began--the business of arranging the convention machinery. Various committees were appointed.</p>
   <p>The roll call taken by Grand Secretary Morris Shapiro showed that the convention had an attendance of one hundred and ninety-two delegates, one hundred and one <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0061.jpg" n="2"/>of whom were from Chicago.</p>
   <p>In his message the Grand Master spoke of the great work done for the membership with regard to insurance, the interest the Order has shown in the field of charity, both at home and for the unfortunate Jews across the sea, and the great patriotism displayed by the membership in the critical period of America at war.</p>
   <p>His recommendations were in regard to changes in certain points of the Order's constitution, such as: "The Grand Master, or his representative, has the right to suspend or oust, with the approval of the Executive Board, all members of the Order who, at lodge meetings, make statements detrimental to the Order."</p>
   <p>Councilor of the Order, Samuel Meikon, in his report, indicated the necessity for the Order to "accept 'fraternal rights', else the future is dark."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0062.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The delegates listened attentively to Mr. Meikon, but we can say, with certainty, that they will defeat any resolution favoring "fraternal rights". A lively debate is expected at tomorrow's meeting when the question will be put to a vote.</p>
   <p>A vigorous campaign is being carried on concerning the office of Grand Master. There are three [candidates] vying for that office: Samuel Epstein, Morris Klein and Samuel Krantzberg. The present Grand Master, Mr. Abraham Levy, has declined to run for this office. The two strongest candidates are Epstein and Krantzberg. The former, a Chicagoan, has the support of the majority of delegates; besides, he was the only one to refuse any kind of a salary for the office. This led to a resolution doing away with the $1,500 a year remuneration. Mr. Krantzberg is from St. Louis. He has the support of the ex-Grand Master, Mr. B. Frank.</p>
   <p>No one knows whom R. Levin supports. All candidates and their friends are impatiently awaiting the results, and are counting the minutes until noon today <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0063.jpg" n="4"/>when the elections will take place.</p>
   <p>The salary of the Grand Secretary, at yesterday's meeting, was increased from $2,400 to $3,000 a year.</p>
   <p>Last night, a banquet was given at the Ashland Clubhouse in honor of the convention delegates. It was a wonderful banquet, and everyone enjoyed it immensely. The toastmaster was Harry Wolf. Speakers were: A. Levy, M. Shapiro, Dr. M. I. Dworkin, and others.</p>
   <p>During the banquet an appeal was made by Madam Fannie Reinhart for war-sufferers. The sum of sixty dollars was collected. Mr. Harry Wolf donated ten dollars for the privilege of taking the money to the relief office, making the total sum seventy dollars.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: No explanation given of "fraternal rights".]</p>
