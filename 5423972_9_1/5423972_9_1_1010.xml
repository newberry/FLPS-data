   <p>The twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the Sinai congregation was commemorated yesterday in a most festive manner. The faithful who attended the services in the synagogue outnumbered by far the sitting capacity of the temple which was actually transformed into a gorgeous bower. The services were plain, however, according to the ritual of the reformed Jews. Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, pastor of the congregation and Rabbi Tobias Schaufarber shared the pulpit delivering sermons. The instrumental and the vocal numbers which heightened the beautiful ceremony were a rendition of the synagogue's own choir, augmented yesterday by the Studebaker Opera Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Hirsch chose for his subject an explanation of the meaning of the word "temple." "Since the earliest time," he said, "peoples of the world regarded a temple as something vastly different from any other institution designated for its service. This was an erroneous idea, however, rooted deeply in the minds of the people, the rectification <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1011.jpg" n="2"/>of which was an intensely difficult problem." Dr. Schaufarber concluded the services by reflecting upon the accomplishments of the reformed Jewish religion, and Dr. Hirsch's principle task which revolves around the teaching of its doctrine.</p>
