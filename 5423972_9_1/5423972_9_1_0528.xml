   <p>Before the war, Reform Judaism in America was on its last legs. It had no message to the Jewish people, except the message of doom. It had no message to humanity, except the message of an early disappearance of the Jewish people as an ethnic unit. It had no religious message to its adherents; for what sort of religion is it, if one cannot embrace it unless one is very rich and very comfortably placed? It is a religion of the rich and the satisfied, and, therefore, no religion at all. Reform Judaism has no myth, no traditions, no metaphysical outlook, no philosophical background, and no theological basis. It is a ready-made religion, carefully cut, carefully tailored, carefully trimmed, so that it suits the men and women who are accustomed to comfort. In short, it is not a religion. The only stock in trade of Reform Judaism is religion, but because it is antagonistic to nationalism, to Hebrew, and to everything Jewish, it is in reality nothing, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0529.jpg" n="2"/>because religion of that sort cannot be said to be religion in truth.</p>
   <p>Shortly before the war, the leaders of Reform in this country began their untenable position and in consequence thereof, they began to court Jewish nationalism. They received the Zionist leaders from abroad with open arms, they told nice things to Dr. Shmarya Levin, the powerful Zionist orator; they told nice things to Nahum Sokolow, the great Hebrew writer and scholar, and they sympathized with Dr. Magnes, who had openly deserted Reform Judaism and embraced Zionism.</p>
   <p>Then the War broke out and the relief work began. The Reform Jews in America threw themselves into the relief work, concentrated all their energies on the work of relief, and found in it a new content for their empty life and a new position from which they could continue their work. It is not an exaggeration to say that the relief saved Reform Judaism in America from actual disintegration. If not for relief work, Reform Judaism would have been today bankrupt morally, socially, and in every other respect. Relief work was its Messiah <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0530.jpg" n="3"/>for a time, but not for all the time because the long war came to an end too. Besides, the Reform Jews who were in control of the carrying out of the constructive relief policies have made a mess of it. The many millions given to them to rebuild the devastated ghettos in Eastern Europe have been either badly invested or have been melted away in foreign exchange fluctuations or have been wasted, and after this terrible failure they had to give up their relief work and they have given it up already. But without relief work, without charity to be busy with, their life is empty, for charity was for the last eight years the only contents of Reform Judaism, and what is it going to do now if the charity work in the form of relief work is to come to an end?</p>
   <p>Reform Judaism in America is now at the parting of the ways. It must either admit its failure, declare itself bankrupt, or it must discover a new shnorring (begging) business, and thus find new contents for its life.</p>
   <p>Those Reform leaders who can read the signs of the time and who can clearly <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0531.jpg" n="4"/>understand the issue before Reform Judaism now, are joining the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] movement, and are thus attaching themselves to the forces that work for productive Judaism, but the narrow-minded Reformers or the die-harders try to cling to the untenable position created by the winding up of the relief work, and since they do not want to admit their failure and to declare themselves bankrupt, they look for a new shnorring business to keep up the fable that charity and Judaism are identical. This explains the anxiety to go out again on big drives, to organize again shnorring campaigns for institutions, the necessity of which is very doubtful because they serve no useful purpose. In all the major Jewish communities throughout the States such drives are to be undertaken shortly. In Chicago a two and a half million dollar drive is to be organized soon, the proceeds of which are to go to institutions the usefulness of which is very doubtful. The motive power of these pending drives is the continuation and the perpetuation of the falsehood that charity and Judaism are identical, and, therefore, these drives are only an excuse for Reform Judaism in America after the war to perpetuate a situation which cannot be perpetuated. We wonder <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0532.jpg" n="5"/>whether the intelligent element in the Jewish communities in America understand the connection between semibankrupt Reform Judaism and these pending drives. If they do, they will know what attitude to take to these drives.</p>
