   <p>The Thirtieth Annual Convention of the Zionist organization of America has come and gone. After three days of hectic deliberation, replete with excitement and ablaze with oratorical fireworks, the 850 delegates have returned to their homes to enjoy a well-earned rest. The Convention was not without its achievements, though it is a little difficult to say just how the Jews in Palestine will profit from them.</p>
   <p>The outstanding achievement was the spectacle provided the loyal delegates who had traveled along way to attend the Convention. For let it not be forgotten that a Convention has failed of its real purpose unless it has provided its delegates with a good show. Only innocents are under the impression that a Convention, numbering almost a thousand delegates can be a deliberative body.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1575.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At best it is a cheering, singing, flag-waving crowd. At its worst it degenerates into a jeering, hooting mob. The Zionist Convention began at its best and ended at its worst. If a Convention is to succeed as a spectacle, it must have an opposing element, and the more noisy and menacing the opposition the better. It gives the delegates a chance to take sides. It flatters their vanity, and it makes them anxious to come back as a delegate next year, which is as it should be.</p>
   <p>An astute administration leaves nothing to chance. To make sure that the Convention will not be without an opposition, it sets about preparing one of its own. Sometimes it instructs its publicity department to handle the job, even calling upon the publicity director to lead the opposition himself.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1576.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The more inexpertly the opposition behaves on the floor of the Convention, the more credit the publicity department deserves. And presently it may come to pass, that the publicity director in charge of the opposing ranks will receive a bonus at the end of the year for his exceptional services to the cause.</p>
   <p>Far be it from me to suggest, that the opposition at the last Zionist Convention at Atlantic City, led by the publicity director of the United Palestine Appeal, was a creature of administration. I am certain that neither Louis Lipsky, head of the American Zionists, nor Israel Goldberg, publicity director, would have stooped to such tactics, nevertheless, the delegates behaved as if the official opposition was a huge joke, and so the administration forces emerged completely successful.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1577.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There were two opposition groups at the Convention, I. Goldberg and Mr. Zeldin of the United Palestine Appeal, led an incoherent, though vociferous, opposition: while the publicity director was haranguing the crowds in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, the president of the Zionist organization was negotiating with the Hadassah representatives. Mr. Goldberg's chagrin and dismay upon learning of the defeat of the Szold forces can be imagined. Nor was the victory secured without sacrifice. Mr. Lipsky was "compelled" to sacrifice his loyal vassal. A. Goldberg leader of the so-called "Hebrew crowd", and a Zionist of thirty years standing. Mr. Lipsky obtained the support of the Hadassah sisterhood on condition that Goldberg would not be a member of the all-powerful Administrative Committee, next year.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1578.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>When the "Hebrew crowd" and the "Yiddish crowd", for whom A. Goldberg is a symbol of Old World Zionism, pure and undefiled, realized that their favorite orator was being ousted from the administration, pandemonium broke loose. Great was their shock when Mr. Lipsky personally took the floor, and declared that A. Goldberg's name was delated with his (Lipsky's) consent "in the interest of harmony." There was little harmony after that statement, nor is there likely to be harmony in the Zionist organization during the next year. A. Goldberg, who had lost his voice the day before defending Mr. Lipsky's administration against the animadversions cast upon it by the publicity director, was purple with rage. He tried to make a speech but his voice did not carry. Goldberg's friends cried that Lipsky had double-crossed him.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1579.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Why were Hadassah's guns levelled against Goldberg? Some claim it was on account of the frank manner with which A. Goldberg was in the habit of criticising certain policies of the Hadassah. But there are those who say that in his administration of an important department, Goldberg displayed gross incompetence and carelessness. Be that as it may, Hadassah refused to pledge its support to Lipsky unless A. Goldberg was eliminated from the Administrative Committee, and Lipsky was by no means loath to let his erstwhile friend go. Time will tell whether A. Goldberg will regain his former position in the Zionist organization, and whether he will ever again consent to serve under Lipsky. To judge from his present fighting mood, Abe Goldberg wouldn't be averse to launching an opposition party of his own, and the first victim of his axe would be his former chief. It remains to be seen how the European Zionist will react to the ousting of Goldberg.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1580.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The generalship of Hadassah's forces was no mean job. Credit is due Anna Kross, who learned political strategy in the Democratic Party. Let Mr. Lipsky look to his laurels. He might awake one morning to find Mrs. Kross had stolen his toga. Although a member of Hadassah less than two years and practically unknown to Zionist circles, Mrs. Kross beat A. Goldberg for membership in the Administrative Committee by twenty votes. This was the first time, as far as I know, that the Hadassah women had stooped to "play politics." But the fight, be it remembered, was not entirely of their making. The administration had made up its mind to deprive Hadassah completely of its influence and the women would not stand for it. They came to the Convention 250 strong, ready to join any opposition movement that would promise to defeat the pet measure of the administration.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1581.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>For a long time Hadassah acted as if it would join Israel Goldberg's movement, but Mr. Lipsky stepped in at the right moment and "fixed things." The new Administrative Committee contains several Hadassah members. Most of the old members are out. Also, we can be sure that the proposed reorganization scheme will leave Hadassah mistress in its own house, for Hadassah is a hard working, compact organization, with a membership of more than thirty thousand. Nearly all of the work of Hadassah is done without renumeration. While the Zionist organization is faced with a deficit of $156,000, the Hadassah chapters have promised to wipe it out. Posted appeals to Zionist districts to rid the organization of the deficit proved unavailing, but Hadassah will keep its pledge. At the Convention the delegates had the opportunity to find out, that the funds of the Hadassah are administered in the most efficient way possible, and no stigma attaches to any of the Hadassah's officers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1582.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>This is no small achievement when one happens to be familiar with the reckless nammer in which the American Zionist commonwealth has been administered. Such is the enviable record of Hadassah and its leaders, that they could not be charged with "politics." When making a strong demand for efficiency and honesty in the administration of Zionist funds.</p>
   <p>If the administration of the Zionist organization of America was compelled publicly to confess its sins of commission and omission, it went to show that its personnel is unimpressive. Democracy, so called, won a victory at the Cleveland Convention six years ago, but the American Zionist movement has never recovered from it. Judge Brandeis, of the Supreme Court went, and in him the ablest American Zionist, also.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1583.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>Officially, a few of them have returned. The men at the helm of the Zionist organization, ever since, have lacked the standing in the community to attract Jews of the highest type to the Zionist cause. The most prominent Jews of America are not found in the Zionist ranks, and until a way is discovered to enlist their active participation, the organization will not command the respect and support of the Jewish community at large. In other words, no Jewish cause in the United States can hope to be successful and efficient as long as the so-called Yahudim, (cultivated class), keep aloof from it. Sooner or later the delegates at Zionist conventions will learn this fact. They will learn too, that the cry of democracy raised by little fellows is demagogic, because in practise the small fry are just as undemocratic and wilful as the big men, and in addition are incompetent, if not downright dishonest. It is probably too late for the Zionist organization to win back Judge Brandeis.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1584.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>Unfortunately Judge Brandeis is over seventy and his health is not all it should be. Unfortunately, also, Brandeis cannot assume the leadership of the Zionist organization without first resigning from the United States Supreme Court. This is something Brandeis will not and should not do. But the American Zionists will have to find a really big man to head their movement. Mr. Lipsky is an estimable gentleman and a clever, at times too clever, a politician, but it is absurd to suggest that he is an outstanding American Jew, or that he is, or that the personnel of the Administrative Committee represents, the finest that American Jewry boasts. If inefficiency and incompetence are rampant in the American Zionist movement, it is because third rate policitians and notoriety seekers constitute the bulk of its leadership.</p>
