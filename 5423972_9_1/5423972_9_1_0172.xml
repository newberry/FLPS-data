   <p>If the National Labor Committee in New York thought that its withdrawal from the Jewish Congress would persuade the Jewish workers from participating in that Congress, it planned without the consent of the Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>Not only will all nationally inclined workers be represented at the Jewish Congress, but also such organizations stand directly under the auspices of the National Labor Committee. The Jewish Workmen's Circle of Boston and a few other organizations revolted against the position of the Labor Committee and elected delegates to the Congress.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0173.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The truth of the matter is that the National Labor Committee felt that without the support of the American Jewish Committee, with whom it had originally united, it would go to naught at the Congress. Down deep in his heart every Jewish workingman is a Jew that sympathizes with the Jewish people. As long as the class struggle is preached to him with everything pertaining to Judaism excluded, he does not consider it as a concern of his people. However, should he encounter the Jewish question, his instinct of Jewish unity will awake and become active.</p>
   <p>Such an occurence the National Labor Committee would obviously want to avoid. The Congress itself will prove to what extent this is true.</p>
