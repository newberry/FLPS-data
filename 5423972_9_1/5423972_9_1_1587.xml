   <p>Teachers and fellow students respect his earnestness and industry. The native born Jewish pupil is less of a grind and more interested in sports and similar activities.</p>
   <p>Add one more war causalty; the Jewish immigrant student. Before the war he was respected and welcomed by teacher and student alike. Now none so poor as to do him reverence. The very virtues which formerly gained him general esteem are now cited against him. Is he industrious? Then he is a "grind". Is he good at his studies? Then he is an intellectual "Shylock", who goes in for marks as for money. Is he working his way through school and denying himself all but the barest necessities? Then he is a "day student", a "commuter," a mere visitor at the class room.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1588.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>How different things were in my own school days! I was in my seventeenth year when I came to this country, in March 11, 1904. After spending seven months in a cigar factory I entered public school in the Fall, and having neither parents nor wealthy relatives to support me, I worked my way through grammar school, (with honors), and university (with high honors.)</p>
   <p>During all this time I was forced to earn my living in the evening, and so took no part in social and athletic activities. Yet my whole student career, extending over a period of eleven years, was one continuous triumphal procession. Far from being looked upon as a "grind" and a mere visitor at the classroom, I enjoyed the respect and even friendship of my schoolmates, whether Jewish or Gentile; while teachers and principals frequently gave me privileges denied to other students.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1589.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>My experience was not unique or even exceptional, but quite the rule among immigrant students at that time. We were all respected and befriended. No one dreamed of holding our poverty against us, of scorning us because we were not models of sartorial perfection, or of reproaching us for thinking that the primary aim and object of a school is the cultivation of the mind and the propagation of knowledge, rather than "The prolongation of the sweet period of adolescence."</p>
   <p>But all this is a thing of the past. Nowadays, I and my kind are regarded as undesirables for the very reasons that once made us welcome. More painful still, many Jewish students who were born in this country are privately blaming us for the ills which have lately befallen them in certain American universities. Far from taking pride, as I have, in my American school career, it would seem that I ought to feel ashamed of it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1590.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The chief charges against the Jewish immigrant student are:</p>
   <p>1. That he is not a native American.</p>
   <p>2. That he is poor.</p>
   <p>3. That he is a grind.</p>
   <p>The immigrant students does not deny and of these charges, yet pleads not guilty. It is quite true that he was not born in this country. But then the same thing is true of the Pilgrim fathers, and the present Secretary of Labor, Secretary Davis, would be rightly indignant if anyone questioned his Americanism on account of his foreign birth. Pity he does not concede as much in the case of Americans of East or South European origin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1591.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Again, it is true that the immigrant student is poor, but so were the aforementioned Pilgrim fathers and Secretary Davis at the time they landed here, not to mention the tens of millions of others who came here from the Old World and helped to build the country. None of these brought to America much in the way of material goods, nevertheless, Americans feel justly proud of their pioneer ancestors, who braved the perils of the seas, settled an unexplored land and turned a wilderness into the richest country on earth.</p>
   <p>Are not these the very qualities which the immigrant student brings with him to America? Is not the immigrant a self-made man?</p>
   <p>Finally, it must likewise be admitted that the Jewish immigrant student is apt to be a "grind". But what of it? Since when has application to a useful task come to be regarded as a vice? If "grinding" is wrong what becomes of all those maxims about, "burning the midnight oil"</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1592.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>which are dinned into our ears from a thousand pulpits and platforms? "Genius," said Carlyle, "is an infinite capacity to take pains." In other words, to "grind". And the great Edison has said that, "Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration."</p>
   <p>Gustave A. Feingold in an article on the "Intelligence of the First Generation of Immigrants," that appeared sometime ago in The Journal of Educational Psychology, wrote: "But if 'grinding' at the useful task in which the individual is engaged is not manifestation of intelligence, what is? As a matter of fact, that which measures the intelligence of a nation is its ability to pursue and to consummate remote and far plans which affect the national life."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1593.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The master passion of the typical Jewish immigrant student is the desire for education. "All we want is just to study," as the Jewish folk song has it. Torah is die beste s'chorah, ( learning is the best commodity), and where the only aristocracy recognized was that of the mind. Until quite recently leadership in the Jewish communities of the Old World was determined by the possession of scholarship rather than wealth. No hardship was deemed too great for the sake of education. From time immemorial the Jewish scholar took the following vow of poverty laid down in the Talmud: "And wouldst thou know the law? Then must thou eat a morsel of bread dipped in salt, and drink water sparingly, and sleep on the ground, and live a life of hardship, while thou toilest in the study of the Torah."</p>
   <p>To be sure, of late the object of this passion for learning has changed from the Talmud and rabbinical lore to secular subjects; but the passion remains as intense as ever.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1594.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>It is this which accounts for the large number of Jewish students in American schools.</p>
   <p>I realize that love of learning is not the only ideal in life. But the truly educated man is he who finds nothing human foreign to his spirit, who has learned to respect ideals, standards and values, other than his own.</p>
   <p>What the late Arthur Gleason said about the Jews in general applies even more to the Jewish immigrant student in America, "I am aware of their faults but am untroubled by them." The sum of their virtues yields a richness needed in the Western world. Many Jews are untrue to themselves. I am speaking of the best of them and in them. To see that, to speak of that, to be friendly to difference, this is the high calling of a university. What I have learned the college can teach; to pierce through difference to the great agreement.</p>
