   <p>Dr. Stephen S. Wise, the most radical among the American Reform rabbis, has now come out with a new and sensational statement, which is keeping the large telegraph agencies throughout the country very busy. Dr. Stephen S. Wise declared last Sunday, from the pulpit of his Free Synagogue, that he did not believe that the Torah was received from heaven, nor did he believe in the divine origin of the Ten Commandments--and that if the representatives of the Jewish religion thought that he was a heretic, they should excommunicate him.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wise is very anxious to play the role of a Baruch Spinoza--he wants to be excommunicated, and he wants the ceremony of excommunication to be as ostentatious as possible. He would like an elaborate black processional, black candles, black raiment--everything in deep black--and the <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0603.jpg" n="2"/>unfortunate martyr led to the rostrum by two wardens....and behind the rostrum, a crowd of reporters and photographers, from every American newspaper.....This is the vision of Dr. Stephen Wise when he cries out: "Good Heavens, fellow Jews, have mercy upon me! Excommunicate me! I do not believe in the divine origin of the Torah, and this I profess because I want you to excommunicate me."</p>
   <p>We wish to assure Dr. Wise that the Jewish people will not excommunicate him because he does not deserve that honor. Dr. Wise may do whatever he pleases; he may even deny the existence of God; he may claim that the real religion is Christianity; he may claim that the redeemer of mankind is Jesus--still, we will not excommunicate him; comedians are not excommunicated. The writings of Maimondes were banned; Baruch Spinoza was excommunicated; a few other great leaders have been excommunicated, but they were sincere people with honest aspirations. They were great thinkers and great scientists, and, above all, they were great idealists and seekers after truth, but comedians have never been excommunicated--and as a "rabbi <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0604.jpg" n="3"/>and preacher in Israel," Rabbi Wise is a comedian, and an expensive one at that.</p>
   <p>A rabbi who proclaims publicly that he does not believe in the divine origin of the Ten Commandments or that the Torah was received from heaven--and does not believe in anything that the Jewish religion declares to be principles of faith--should, if he is an honest person, resign from his position and go into the suspender business or into any other business. If a state official became convinced that the entire philosophy of the state was a myth, a fable, a superstition, that the real truth lay in the philosophy of anarchism, then he would soon resign from office. A religious official, if he is a man of character and integrity, should do likewise. If he does not do this, he is, first of all, a comedian, and comedians are not excommunicated because whatever they say amounts to nothing.</p>
   <p>If the representatives of the Jewish religion were to excommunicate all comedians and jesters, our synagogues would always be taking up the problem <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0605.jpg" n="4"/>of excommunication. All the Reform rabbis, all the pseudosocialist comrades and their leaders and all other comedians who jeopardize Jewish life, would have to be excommunicated and it stands to reason that that would be impossible.</p>
   <p>Rabbi [T.] Schanfarber is quite right when he characterizes this act of Dr. Wise as an attempt to get publicity--more publicity--and even the Reform rabbis do not take him seriously.</p>
   <p>We consider this performance of Dr. Wise very vulgar. We consider his action as the greatest display of tactlessness ever committed by a man in his position. Nobody would have suspected him of believing that the Torah was received from heaven or that he had any serious connection with the Jewish religion anyway, but to come out with such a statement only provokes the Jews, and as this provocation has only one motive--publicity--it is doubly vile. It can only arouse the hatred of millions of Christians who believe in the divine origin of the Bible, and must also result in further demoralization in our own camp.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0606.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A person with a sense of responsibility and with some degree of good taste does not openly discuss such delicate matters as the principles of religion--especially when there is no reason to discuss such questions publicly. If we have to rebuke the irresponsible and most unsavory action of Dr. Wise, we must do so in a statement in which we protest against the vulgarity and publicity-seeking action of a man who considers himself a rabbi and preacher in Israel.</p>
   <p>But we will not excommunicate Dr. Stephen Wise because we do not ban comedians.</p>
