   <p>Samuel Meisenberg, a young Russian Jew of 22, was one of the first four victims on the battlefield at Vera Cruz, Mexico, in defense of the American flag. War is a horrible event. Nevertheless whenever war is declared, it is to us Jews a special spiritual delight, to see how we "foreign patriots" voluntarily surrender our lives to internecine strife. Naturally, fun is made of Jews in the army. However, we know that this ridiculous fun-making is inherited from the old-timers, when the Jew did not have the opportunity of showing how he could defend his fatherland or his adopted land.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1297.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hundreds of years of slavery could not destroy the real heroic spirit of the grand children of the Maccabees. Just as soon as they come to a free country they usually do what they ought to do. They show themselves first in peace, first in war, and first in love for their new fatherland.</p>
   <p>Samuel Meisenberg's sacrifice will win us recognition. Our neighbors, who looked upon us "foreign patriots," especially upon the Jewish district on the West Side, with contempt, will in the near future think differently of these foreigners.....</p>
   <p>It is rather difficult to reassure a father and mother in the bereavement of their son who was fatally shot down in the prime of life. We believe, however, that we express the opinion of the Chicago Jewish community by extending our sympathy and our condolence to Mr. and Mrs. Meisenberg.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1298.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is not merely their bereavement, but also the bereavement of the entire Chicago Jewish community. And when the body of this young victim shall be brought to Chicago, all the Jews of the city will be mourners and will follow the casket of the young Jewish man, whose life was sacrificed for America's honor.</p>
