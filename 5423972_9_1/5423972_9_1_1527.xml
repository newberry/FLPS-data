   <p>A Reorganization Conference of the Chicago Zionists took place at the Hotel Sherman on Sunday, September 7. This conference was made possible by the events at the last Zionist convention and was held for the purpose of reorganizing the Zionist forces of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Arrangement Committee for the conference was headed by Miss Pearl Franklin and consisted of Dr. A. E. Abramovitz, Mrs. Harry Berkman, H. D. Bubman, A. Z. Halperin, M. C. Handelman, H. L. Meites, and Mr. H. Zteinberg.</p>
   <p>The Reorganization Conference was called to order at 11 a.m. by Mrs. Pearl Franklin. The various committees were appointed and the session closed with an address by Mr. Nash Brown, a representative of the Cattle Raising and Milk Products Co. Ltd. of Afula, Palestine, who spoke on behalf of this project.</p>
   <p>The second session of the conference began at 2:30 in the afternoon with Mr. Max Shulman as the presiding officer. Mr. Shulman rendered the Presidential Report, and cited the events which led up to the present reorganization conference. Mr. Jacob De Haas, the Chairman of the Committee on Organization of the Zionist Organization of America, then made a fine presentation of the problems confronting the present national administration and indicated the scope <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1528.jpg" n="2"/>of work to be undertaken by the Zionists of Chicago during the coming year. Mr. De Haas was followed by Mrs. Benjamin Davis, Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. Mr. B. Horwich, on behalf of the Nominating Committee, presented first the name of Judge Harry M. Fisher as the president of the Zionist Organization of Chicago for the ensuing year. Judge Fisher was unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher took the chair and in a short address presented his program and earnestly asked for the cooperation of all Zionists and sympathizers throughout the city to help the Zionist Organization of Chicago become the strongest group in the communal life of the city. Judge Fisher particularly eulogized the splendid services rendered to the cause by Mr. Max Shulman during the last thirty years. Mr. Shulman was presented with a watch in recognition of his signal services. The presentation was made by Dr. A. E. Abramovitz. Mr. I. T. Feingold, on behalf of Mr. Shulman's friends, presented him with a golden book inscription. Mr. B. Horwich also spoke feelingly about Mr. Shulman's past services. The afternoon ended with an address by Mr. Max Shulman who offered his whole-hearted support to the new president, in order that Chicago may become the outstanding Zionist center in the United States.</p>
   <p>The evening session which was attended by an enthusiastic audience that taxed the capacity of the assembly hall, was opened at 3:30 p.m. by Judge Harry M. <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1529.jpg" n="3"/>Fisher. Miss Frances Glickman initiated the evening's program by singing several arias. The speakers included Mr. Max Shulman, Mrs. Harry Berkman, Mr. Jacob De Haas, Mr. N. Steinberg, and Rabbi Solomon Goldman. The first Reorganization Conference of Chicago Zionists closed amidst enthusiasm at 11:30 p.m., with the singing of Hatikvah. All those present were unanimous in stating that this conference will mark the turning point in the history of Chicago Zionism.</p>
