<title level="a">[MEETING CALLED OF SYNAGOGUE PRESIDENTS]</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Dr. S. M. Melamed</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>I would like to know what kind of people our presidents of synagogues are. I am never able to make up my mind as to just what kind of Jews they are. Are they serious men? Are they wise men? Do they take their duties as leaders of the city seriously? All the presidents of synagogues know that if they were united in one body, they would be able to accomplish wonders and would be able to make Chicago the real Jerusalem of America. The question naturally arises: Why don't they unite? Why don't they do that which they could and should do? The reorganization committee of the Association of [Synagogue] Presidents has now worked out a new and good organization plan, which will enable all the synagogues and their presidents to do useful and necessary work for the city. A meeting of all the synagogue presidents of the city is scheduled to take place on Monday. The meeting will have to consider many important problems.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0471.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Up until now, I haven't heard any synagogue presidents discuss the meeting and make any preparations for this great and important gathering. If the Chicago synagogue presidents were wise, serious, and practical Jews, then every one of them, without exception, would be present at the meeting next Monday evening at the Hebrew Theological College. If they cannot attend personally, they should send a representative. I will be present Monday evening at the meeting of the synagogue presidents at the Hebrew Theological College. I want to know how many of our synagogue presidents are serious and practical men. The wisdom and seriousness of our synagogue presidents will face a severe test on Monday evening. Let us hope that our leaders will pass the test.</p>
