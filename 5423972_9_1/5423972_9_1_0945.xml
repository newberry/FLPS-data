   <p>Resolved, that the sale of the seats in the new Temple be made upon the basis of the scale of prices adopted by the Executive Board at their meeting held in January 29, 1912, and that an auction be conducted at the new Temple on Sunday, March 3, 1912, at three o'clock p.m. for choice of location of seats, and that at such auction, the following rules should be enforced to govern the auction.</p>
   <p>The highest bidder secures the first choice of location anywhere in the Temple. He shall then immedicately select his seats. The next choice of location shall then be auctioned and the highest bidder for such next choice shall then make his selection. The auction shall thus continue so long as there are persons willing to pay a premium for choice of location.</p>
   <p>Any bidder may select as many seats as he desires, but not less than two, and all seats selected must be consecutive and in a single row. If a bidder selects a whole row in the center section he must pay double the premium bid, for the reason that he secures two aisle seats; but this rule this rule does not apply to any other section.</p>
