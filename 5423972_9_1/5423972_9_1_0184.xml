   <p>There remains but one week to the convention which is to nominate delegates to the first American Jewish Congress, and a large number of Jewish organizations in Chicago have not as yet responded or submitted the credentials of their delegates. Such Jewish organizations are passing up a great opportunity to contribute their portion of work to a great matter which concerns all Jews.</p>
   <p>The entire civilized world is now compared to a gigantic cauldron, in which all sorts of metals are cast for deflagration and purification. The flames of the war, under the cauldron, cause them to fuse and when the war ends various nations will become stronger in their nationalism, although materially they will probably be weakened by the effects of the war.</p>
   <p>The largest fraction of the Jewish people is now being disintegrated in the "cauldron" of prostration amongst other nations. The Jews will find out, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0185.jpg" n="2"/>after the war, that they are not combined with other nations, as many of them have believed. It can be said with assurance that after the war the Jews in Europe will feel isolated, even in such countries as England, France, Germany, and Free Russia. The bloody operations of war attract equal classes and repel that which is more or less foreign.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish people will not come out united from the present war-cauldron, their condition among the nations will be of smaller significance than that it was before the war.</p>
   <p>The whole Congress idea <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> being by an instinctive sentiment, that the Jews must now be united. Not only the Jewish masses, but also the inactive, half-estranged Jews feel this way.</p>
   <p>The American Jewry are in a more propitious condition than the Jews of other countries. They are in position to take the first step in uniting the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0186.jpg" n="3"/>people. No doubt their work will be copied by the European Jews.</p>
   <p>Delegates can be elected in one week. The Jewish organizations of Chicago, which until now have not elected delegates, should do so.</p>
