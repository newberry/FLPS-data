   <p>YOUNG JUDEA of the CHICAGO HEBREW INSTITUTE.</p>
   <p>By Minnie D. Isaacs.</p>
   <p>While walking through the Hebrew Institute any afternoon and seeing the many classes in singing, dancing, elocution, gymnastics, story-telling and cooking, the meetings of the Festival Club and Sabbath School; all conducted for the purpose of giving happiness to the boys and girls, one feels that there is no room for another activity here - that all that can be done to develop the moral and aesthetic sense of the boy and girl coming in contact with the Institute, is already being done. Yet the Institute fosters a phase of club life for Jewish boys and girls of twelve years of age and over that stimulates their interest in all educational opportunities afforded them and trains them for Jewish service, namely, the Young Judea Clubs. This organization aims to inculcate a love for the studies of Jewish history, tradition and the Hebrew language; to instill a loyalty to the Jewish race, and to encourage its members to work for the realization of Zionists hopes. The club program includes the discussion of current Jewish topics, inter-club debates <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1446.jpg" n="2"/>games and the celebration of all Jewish festivals. Through entertainments and various affairs, members of Young Judea Clubs are afforded the opportunity of meeting girls and boys of various sections of the city and are thus unconsciously sowing the seeds of a better understanding between the young of their own age from various districts of the city, that will bear fruit when they will be mature men and women. In addition to all this, membership in Young Judea gives its members an interest in common with the older members of their families; it also binds together the Jewish youth of the entire land by common ideals and, owing to the recent declaration of statesmen in favor of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, now causes its young members to rejoice with the Jewish youth of the entire world that they can behold the dawn of a new era for the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute Center of Young Judea is one of the many centers now conducted in various sections of the city. It was organized in August, 1917, by the Young Judea organization of Chicago, which is the local branch of the National Young Judea movement with headquarters in New York. During the past season, the club programs, as well as all <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1447.jpg" n="3"/>entertainments, were under the direction of Miss Ruth Eisenberg. She was assisted by a faithful band of Young Judea club leaders who devoted much time to the work during a trying Winter. Mr. Louis Gould is president of the Leaders' Association of the Hebrew Institute Center. The outstanding fact of the season's activities at this Center is the deep interest displayed in a distinctly Jewish program, by its members. This has encouraged the club leaders and others interested in the movement to arrange an ambitions program for the Center. Miss Rose Bloom is now supervisor of Young Judea activities. She recently secured the cooperation of former pupils of the Hebrew Institute Sabbath School and former members of Junior Zionists Clubs. An interesting progran has been outlined. All meetings will be held on the Institute playground and purposeful play will be given Young Judeans.</p>
