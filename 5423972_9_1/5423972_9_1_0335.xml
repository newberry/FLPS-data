   <p>The Union of Jewish Communities of America held its session again yesterday forenoon at ten o'clock in Standard Hall. After attending to preliminary business the local rabbis extended an invitation to the delegates to take a coach trip and see the city. A lengthy debate ensued about the executive board's recommendation to raise half a million dollars for a Jewish college. Various delegates were of the opinion that the institution should be located in New York, and others believed it made no difference whether such a college was in New York, New Orleans, Cincinnati, or any other city, as long as it served as a university for rabbis throughout the United States. Finally the resolution was adopted to procure the money, but the problems of how to raise it, and where the institution should be located, were referred to the executive board for decision.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon session the chairman of the special committee read a detailed account of the persecution of Jews in Russia, whereupon a committee <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0336.jpg" n="2"/>was appointed to raise money and to offer asylum in America to the banished people of Russia as well as to those who had fled. In order to facilitate emigration from Russia Mr. Abraham sought support from the many secret Jewish organizations.</p>
   <p>A. W. Rich considered the immigration and settlement question an important issue, which from the historical standpoint may become as significant as the exodus from Egypt. He was of the opinion that the secret organizations should help procure for every Jewish immigrant a completely equipped farm of a hundred acres, including livestock, in Nebraska or Kansas, exempt from payments of any kind for seven years, since thereby it would be possible for the settler to become a self-supporting landowner within a short time.</p>
