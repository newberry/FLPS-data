   <p>p. 3 - Yesterday was the second day of the sessions, held by the National Conference of Jewish Charities at Sinai Temple. The subject of the discussion was: "Poverty and its Cause in Large Cities." The first speaker was Dr. M. Reitzenstein of New York. His subject was: "What conditions do poor lodgings and poverty, produce?"</p>
   <p>Dr. Reitzenstein pointed out that unsanitary living quarters are directly responsible for the devitalization of the individual, and poverty is the natural outcome of these conditions. Most indifferent toward better homes for workingmen is the city of New York. The speaker suggested that in order to remedy this undesirable state of affairs, it was the duty of municipalities to erect sanitary dwellings after the pattern of the European countries, and then to enforce the strictest sanitary laws.</p>

   <p>The next lecturer was Mr. Morris Goldstein of Cincinnati. He chose for his subject: "Cause of poverty and the help extended by organized charities." The most important factor of poverty, the speaker said, are premature marriages. He urged that charitable societies use their influence to discourage this practice among the poor. But the principal causes of poverty, especially among the Jews, are poor health and unemployment.</p>
   <p>In the opinion of Dr. Lee K. Frankel of New York, the big majority of the Jewish population in large cities, is suffering from tuberculosis. Dr. Frankel pointed out that it was no longer necessary for sufferers from that disease to seek high altitudes as being the only cure. With <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0297.jpg" n="3"/>proper care and good food, they can effect a cure almost anywhere, provided, the air they breathe is pure and clean. It is the responsibility of the state to build sanitariums for patients suffering from tuberculosis on the outskirts of each large city. And if the state disregards this obligation, the charitable societies should consider it a part of their work to do this in the interest of suffering humanity.</p>
