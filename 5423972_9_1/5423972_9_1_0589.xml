   <p>Last year a former rabbi of Chicago, who is no longer in America, approached me and asked me whether I knew of a synagogue that would like to engage a rabbi. I replied that I was not an employment agency for rabbis. When I asked him what sort of a synagogue he was interested in, his reply was, "As far as I am concerned, it can be a synagogue that exists only on paper, just as long as I am the rabbi; I have to make a living."</p>
   <p>I know a middle-aged man in Chicago who is extorting money from everybody for a philanthropic institution of dubious character. He refuses to accept less than twenty-five dollars [as a donation].</p>
   <p>This man calls himself "rabbi," although I doubt whether he can read Hebrew <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0590.jpg" n="2"/>correctly. He doesn't know English very well, either, but he knows the "game". He distributes calling cards, which give him the title of rabbi. He is received by householders as well as businessmen--and he dictates the sum of money that the victim is to give him for his institution.</p>
   <p>I have seen the letterhead of one of the dubious and obscure rabbis of Chicago. The letterhead bears the inscription: "Chief Rabbi of Chicago". When a Jew in Oshkosh or Kalamazoo receives a letter from the chief rabbi of Chicago, he is delighted. And when a person is happy, he does as he is told.</p>
   <p>Every fake M'shuloch [collector for foreign institutions of charity and theological seminaries] who collects money in the downtown offices calls himself "rabbi" or "chief rabbi". When will the Chicago rabbinate begin to clean house?</p>
   <p>Our rabbis in America speak a great deal about respect for the Torah and respect for the rabbinate. How can the masses have any respect for the rabbis in <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0591.jpg" n="3"/>America, when they hear of scandals like the Tillinger incident in New York?</p>
   <p>How can the masses respect the rabbis if the rabbis themselves do not insist that their house be kept clean? The title "rabbi" has become very cheap because any Jew who has ever received a rabbinical degree--even though he hasn't looked into the Talmud for twenty years--calls himself a rabbi. Has anyone ever heard a European Jew calling himself "rabbi" because in his youth he had been a student and had received a rabbinical degree, which really was only a sign of encouragement to him to continue his studies? The title "rabbi" is widely misused in America--by the Orthodox no less than by the Reform Jews. It [the title of rabbi] has become meaningless, and the bearer of the title does not command any respect, unless he is distinguished as a scholar--independent of his title.</p>
