   <p>Under the above title, Dr. Gerson Levy wrote a brilliant editorial in the last edition of the Reform Advocate, which should be read by our rabbis and cantors.</p>
   <p>The cantor used to act as sexton - a servant to the rabbi. Now the congregation has slowly driven the rabbi from the pulpit and transacted the pulpit into stage where the cantor impersonates the actors and sings theatrical songs. This is a matter in which everyone, to whom the future and Judaism is beloved, should become interested.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0941.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Recently, the cantors went a step farther. In addition to introducing strange melodies into the synagogues, and ruining the sacred prayers with melodies which are heard in the saloons and theaters by the vulgar type, they formed a habit of conveying from the synagogues, true Jewish melodies, which are sacred, and beloved to the Jews not on account of the harmony of the music but for their antiquity, tradition, and legends in which they are enwrapped, and introducing these sacred tunes on the stage.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless it is our wish to see the cantors on the stage - and the rabbis on the pulpit. The cantors will inevitably be driven from the stage.</p>
