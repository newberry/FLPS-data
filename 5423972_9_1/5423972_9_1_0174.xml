   <p>The Jewish Courier submitted the following circular to all candidates nominated as delegates to the Jewish Congress:</p>
   <p>In the Auditorium Hotel, Sunday May 20, a group of the Chicago Jewish organizations nominated you as one of the thirty-eight candidates, of which nineteen are to be elected from the Chicago Jewry, to serve as delegates to the first American Jewish Congress, which will convene in Washington, D. C., Sept., 2, 1917.</p>
   <p>The election, as you know, will be held on June 10.</p>
   <p>In the endeavor to serve the Jewish public in matters concerning the Jewish Congress, the Daily Jewish Courier wants to acquaint its readers with all candidates and their respective views on the chief issues with which the American Jewish Congress shall devote itself.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0175.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For this purpose, the Courier requests that you kindly submit a statement of approximately 300 words, stating your opinion about the following questions:</p>
   <p>1. What, in your opinion, is or should be the chief task of the Jewish Congress?</p>
   <p>2. Through what means should such a task be attained?</p>
   <p>3. Are you in favor of having the Jewish Congress remain a permanent organization?</p>
   <p>The Jewish Courier will publish your statement. Please send your latest photo, accompanied with your statement, to our office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0176.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Being that the time is short and there remains but two weeks until election, it would be desirable that you send in your statement no later than May 31.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>The Jewish Courier.</p>
