   <p>In connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the introduction of Sunday services in Sinai Congregation, Mr. Julius Rosenthal was interviewed by a reporter of a local paper. Mr. Rosenthal took an active part in the effort to establish Sunday services and the following excerpts from the interview give a comprehensive picture of the origin, development and consummation of the movement.</p>
   <p>"In the early forties of the present century, an agitation arose among the German reform Jews and Rabbis in favor of the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and religious service. Dr. Samuel Hirsch of Luxemburg, father of our Dr. Hirsch and an eminent German Rabbi, was the main defender and agitator for a Sunday Sabbath. He was the first one, who at the Rabbinical conference at Braunschweig in 1845 and later in his catechism, published in 1854, made strong pleas for it.</p>
   <p>The movement in Germany did not flourish because of the hostility of the principalities and the opposition of the orthodox Jews. In this country <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1028.jpg" n="2"/>ing the Saturday Sabbath was leading to infidelity and materialism. It was he who introduced to us the teachings and catechism of Dr. Samuel Hirsch.</p>
   <p>When Dr. Kohler came to the Congregation as successor to Dr. Chronik, he found the field prepared for the innovation, and under his leadership, on the 15th day of January, 1874, Sunday services were officially introduced in Sinai Congregation. At the outset, Saturday and Sunday services existed contemporaneously, but in time the Saturday services became unpopular and even those who had been in favor of it failed to attend.</p>
   <p>The attacks on all sides and from all parts of the country, on Sinai Congregation, and the ridicule heaped upon it by orthodox Rabbis and religious zealots did not affect the action of Sinai at any time. The movement instead of dying out as had been predicted, has been followed by quite a number of congregations in this country. Sinai has encouraged them to follow <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1029.jpg" n="3"/>under the leadership of earnest and conscientious young Rabbis. The future of Judaism depends upon the institution of the Sunday Sabbath.</p>
   <p>Sinai may glory in an array of celebrated leaders of Israel, whose teachings, directly or indirectly, it enjoys. Under Felsenthal it was brought under the influence of the teachings and efforts of Samuel Adler and Einhorn. The latter's prayer book was introduced and remains up to date. Dr. Chronik was imbued with the spirit of Samuel Hirsch, of Geiger and Holdheim. The progress made by Sinai under Dr. Kohler, and the eloquent and soul-stirring sermons of Dr. E. G. Hirsch are well known and recognized everywhere."</p>
