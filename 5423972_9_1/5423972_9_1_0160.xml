   <p>The Twenty-first Annual Convention of the Federated Zionist Societies of the Middle West, which was held in Chicago during the New Year's week, beginning December 28, 1917, and closing January 1, 1918, was notable for the earnest work and the enthusiasm manifested by those who attended.</p>
   <p>Several of its principal functions took place at the Chicago Hebrew Institute, the first of which was the mass meeting held at the gymnasium hall, Sunday evening December 30, 1917. It was an exceptionally successful affair.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the inclement weather a mass of people surrounded the entrances of the gymnasium hall long before the hour at which the meeting was to open. Having filled the gymnasium hall to its utmost capacity, and also an overflow meeting at the Assembly Hall there still remained a large crowd clamoring for admission.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0161.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The speakers at this meeting were Dr. Shmaryah Levin, Mr. Jacob De Haas, Dr. S. Deinard of Minneapolis and Judge Hugo Pam, Mr. Max Shulman, President of the F. Z. S. of the Middle West, presided, Governor Frank O. Lowden, on behalf of the State of Illinois, extended greetings to the Convention and spoke at length on America and Zionism. The appeal on behalf of the Palestine Restoration fund made by Dr. S. H. Deinard and Mr. Jacob De Haas met with an enthusiastic response from the audience, who showered their money on the platform and made pledges to be redeemed within sixty days.</p>
   <p>The scene repeated itself in a somewhat diminished form at the overflow meeting in the Assembly Hall. The speakers were Dr. M. Sheinkin of Palestine, Judge Harry M. Fisher, Mr. B. Harwich, presided. The total amount of cash and pledges raised during the Convention is stated to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The Convention, coming as it did at the time when public attention had been focused by world events upon Palestine and the Zionist aim to restore it to civilization as a Jewish State, was of great moment. The gathering of 350 <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0162.jpg" n="3"/>delegates from ten states of the Middle West attracted wide attention.</p>
