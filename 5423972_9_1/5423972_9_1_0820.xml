<title level="a">RABBI SADOWSKY ARRIVED IN CHICAGO THIS MORNING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The newly elected rabbi of Congregation Tiphereth Zion, Rabbi Sadowsky, arrived here this morning. Prominent members and representatives of the Congregation Tiphereth Zion came to the depot to greet their rabbi and to extend him a hearty welcome.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Sadowsky occupied the pulpit for eight years in Rochester, and for three years in Albany, New York. He has been a resident of the United States for the past eleven years. Rabbi Sadowsky is a descendent of the great rabbis of Russia and is considered an outstanding American rabbi. He received his rabbinical degree in Russia at the age of twenty-two.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Sadowsky is considered not only as an authority on the Torah, but also as a modern intellectual; he is well posted in the old and new Hebraic literature. He is the author of several books in Hebrew and is well versed in the English language. Rabbi Sadowsky has a modern conception of [the function of the] rabbi, and is interested in all the great Jewish problems. Of the younger <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0821.jpg" n="2"/>generation of rabbis in America, Rabbi Sadowsky is unquestionably one of the best known.</p>
   <p>We say to him: "A hearty welcome".</p>
