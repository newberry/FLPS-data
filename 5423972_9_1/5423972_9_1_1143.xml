   <p>The Sinai Congregation held a call meeting on last Tuesday evening, for the purpose of taking action upon the resignation of the Rev. Dr. Kohler. Rev. Dr. Kohler's resignation was accepted to take effect from the last day of the current month. A resolution to pay the Doctor his salary for the months of July and August was voted down, on the ground that the Doctor had published in the papers an account of the heavy indebtedness of the Congregation, and consequently it would appear like acting against the veracity of his statement, if the Congregation were to show more liberality than it could afford. It was very plainly stated at the meeting, that the slim attendance at the Sunday lectures was not due to the indifference of the members, but to the nature of the lectures. The young men do not understand well the German language; Dr. Kohler does not moderate himself in the expression of sentiment, and does not confine himself to the subject of his lecture - all this is the reason why the Sunday lectures have become unpopular.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1144.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The use of the parsonage, free of rent, was granted to the Doctor, without a dissenting voice, up to the end of August. A resolution was adopted that the Board of the Congregation be authorized to look about for a new minister, one of whose necessary qualifications should be the ability of lecturing in English. A set of resolutions to the effect of abolishing the Sunday lectures, were declared out of order.</p>
