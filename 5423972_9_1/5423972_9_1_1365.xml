   <p>One of the pioneer self-governing boys' clubs - the American Boys' Commonwealth - will dedicate its new clubhouse at 3036 W. Roosevelt Rd. on June 27.</p>
   <p>The boys' organization, with a membership of over 500, is sponsored by the Young Men's Jewish Charities. It came into existence about five years ago and during its short history has become one of the most-widely known boys' clubs in America.</p>
   <p>The A. B. C. has the distinction of holding the National Debating Championship of the Boys' Club Federation, which they won two years ago at the national convention in Washington. For many years, boy orators of the A. B. C. have assisted the Mayor's Safety First Commission by speaking at large gatherings and on the radio.</p>
   <p>The chief aim of the club is to build boys into fine citizens by instilling in them at an early age the duties and obligations of good citizenship. At the weekly meetings, which are conducted with all of the decorum and orderliness of the best parliamentary bodies, the boys are frequently addressed by men and women of note. Among those active in the work of the A. B. C. are Judges Henry Horner and Hugo M. Friend and Gen. Abel Davis.</p>
