   <p>In a letter to Paul Rothenberg of Chicago, President Obregon of Mexico makes an offer to the Jewish people, of the highest importance. The Mexican government invites "the immigration of Russian Jews" and is ready to set aside a large fertile tract of land for colonization by them under attractive conditions.</p>
   <p>Some of these conditions are the immediate granting of Mexican citizenship by a special act of the Mexican Congress, exemption from taxation for five years, financial assistance during the early part of the immigrant's stay, free transportation from the port of entry, and free shipment of materials from Mexican industrial centers.</p>
   <p>In return the Mexican government asks that all the immigrants accept Mexican <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1663.jpg" n="2"/>citizenship, so that under the country's law they may acquire title to the land. That the free distribution of this land be undertaken by a responsible Jewish agency, and that this agency guarantee the character of the immigrants.</p>
   <p>The tract offered is larger than the State of Illinois, and has a healthful climate and is rich enough in natural resources to accomodate ten to fifteen million people in addition to the comparitive few now settled there. Its location is such that it is free from revolutionary disturbances and political upheavals.</p>
   <p>Such an offer, coming at this time when almost every door is closed to Jewish refugees, is worthy of the deepest consideration. In a short time many thousands of Jews could be settled in a region of plenty.</p>
   <p>We do not know what steps Mr. Rothenberg is taking to place this matter before the Jewish people of this country, from whom any support given this plan may come. We believe if the project is properly presented, financial <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1664.jpg" n="3"/>supported would be forthcoming in abundance. Here, at last, is something which promises to break through the blind alley of relief and charity, and furnish a solution to the great problem of our people's tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The colonists will not be restricted to agriculture, for the tract borders on the sea, has good harbors, and is rich in fisheries, game, minerals, timber, and all of the natural wealth that promotes industry and commerce.</p>
