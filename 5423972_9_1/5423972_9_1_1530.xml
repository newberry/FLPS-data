   <p>Declaring that only a tremendously increased number of Zionists can bring about an increase in the political strength of the Zionist program in Palestine, Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America issues an appeal for new members for the Zionist Organization of America in the leading editorial of the current issue of the Hadassah periodical, out recently.</p>
   <p>"Everyone is aware that this is a critical moment in Zionist affairs," the editorial states. Investigations that grew out of last year's riots in Palestine are still in progress and no definite political changes affecting Palestine have been made. At this very time, when political action is necessary, a large membership in the Zionist organization is essential to impress the Mandatory Power and the rest of the world with the intensity and profundity of the Jewish desire for Palestine."</p>
   <p>The article asks the Hadassah women to bring men to the Zionist cause. In its senior and junior divisions Hadassah has 50,000 members, who are also members of the Zionist Organization of America, comprising the majority of American Zionists. Hadassah requests each of its members to make herself responsible for one new member in the Zionist organization.</p>

   <p>"To strengthen the coalition regime of the Zionist organization, to make Zionism here a telling force and an influence in Zionist affairs the world over, the Zionist Organization of America must have a vastly increased membership," the statement says. No amount of ability, prestige, and strategy in leadership can go far without a huge army of enrolled backers. There are 4,500,000 Jews in America, among whom for years has been carried on extensive and continuous propaganda for Zionism. It is inconceivable that there exists today Jews ignorant of the aims and ideals of Zionism and the general aspect of life and Zionist accomplishments in Palestine. Without loss of time, the most thorough attempt must be made to plum the sources of Jewish life in America in the interests of Zionism, to crystalize the latent enthusiasm of men who bear a measure of sympathy for Zionism, and to arouse interest among those still indifferent.</p>
   <p>This is the real need of the hour - thousands of new members in the Zionist Organization of America, thousands of new well-wishers and workers to add their strength to the upbuilding of Palestine.</p>
