  <body>
   <p>Camp Logan, Texas, May 4, Lieutenant Colonel Abel Davis of Chicago, was promoted today to the rank of colonel and appointed immediately as Commander of the 132nd Infantry Regiment.</p>
   <p>Colonel Davis was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel on the 26th of April and it was then predicted that he would become a full-fledged Colonel in the near future.</p>
   <p>Colonel Davis went to Camp Logan as a Major of the First Illinois Regiment of the National Guard. Exactly on the day of his twentieth anniversary of service in the Militia, he became a Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
   <p>Abel Davis enlisted in the First Infantry Regiment as a buck private at the time of the Spanish-American War, April 26, 1898, and continuously distinguished himself in the service; particularly so, since his regiment became a unit of the National Army after arriving in this camp.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1258.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Colonel Davis is well known in Chicago as the vice-president of the Title and Trust Company; as a former County Recorder and as a famous Jewish civic leader.</p>
