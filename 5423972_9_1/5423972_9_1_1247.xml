  <body>
   <p>A dispatch from France announces that Captain William J. Mack, a brother of Federal Judge Julian W. Mack, was promoted to the rank of major for distinction in the service.</p>
   <p>He left for France several months ago as a captain of infantry, after having graduated as an officer from the First Officers Training Camp at Fort Sheridan. Besides being captain, he was also the legal adviser of the Insurance Board. Now he has become a major and judge advocate. Both offices rank high, and are conferred only for great distinction.</p>
   <p>The insurance act for soldiers was drawn up by Judge Mack, and it is only natural that Major Mack should be well acquainted with all the details of this act which is of great benefit to American soldiers and sailors. Before entering the service, Major Mack was well known as a lawyer and civic leader. He was especially <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1248.jpg" n="2"/>active in the relief work of the local branch of the American Relief Committee.</p>
