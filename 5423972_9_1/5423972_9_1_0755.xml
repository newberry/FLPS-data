   <p>In various countries of Europe, especially in the newly established countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Jugoslavia, Jewish leaders are at present engaged in an interesting discussion on the subject of the intellectual qualifications of a rabbi. The Jews of these countries are compelled by circumstances to train their own rabbis and to establish their own rabbinical seminaries. It is admitted that old-fashioned Yeshiboth are out of place because the Yeshiboth graduates cannot cope with the difficulties arising out of modern Jewish life. Therefore, the rabbi, if his work is to be effective and his mission successful, must not only be a Talmudic scholar to a certain extent of course, but must also possess a general secular education. Even in Poland, the home of the old-fashioned Yeshiboth, the Jewish leaders, representing all sections of the Jewish population, are seriously planning to establish a modern rabbinical seminary. With the exception of the Lithuanian Yeshiboth, the Talmudic high schools and academies in Eastern Europe are now undergoing a process of modernization. The famous Lida Yeshibah, established <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0756.jpg" n="2"/>by the late Rabbi Reines some fifteen years ago, is now more of a rabbinical seminary than an old-fashioned Yeshibah because its students receive a general Jewish and secular education in addition to their Talmudic training. The Orthodox leaders in Eastern Europe are aware of the fact that the old-fashioned rabbi cannot perform his duties any longer. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that the old-fashioned rabbi is not in a position to deal with the problems which he now faces daily because he does not have a general secular education. In nearly all the Eastern European countries, the Jewish religion is recognized as one of the state religions, and the representative of an officially recognized religion in Eastern Europe must not only devote his time to his purely congregational duties, but must also perform certain official duties. He must participate in public functions, he must mingle with the authorities, etc. The old-fashioned rabbi cannot possibly perform such duties, and if the community wishes to be well represented, it must necessarily have a modern rabbi who is an up-to-date man.</p>
   <p>If the Eastern European Jew has come to recognize the need of modernizing <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0757.jpg" n="3"/>the rabbinate, the Orthodox Jews in America must certainly modernize the American rabbinate. If a rabbi in a God-forsaken hamlet in Poland or Czechoslovakia must be an up-to-date man, an Orthodox rabbi in America must certainly be a modern man. The old-fashioned rabbi, unless he is a really great rabbi, great in learning, and great in virtue, is a useless person. The old generation does not need him because it is Orthodox anyway, and he is of no use to the young generation because he cannot speak to it--he has nothing to say. If the Orthodox Jewish youth in America is drifting slowly but surely away from the synagogues, it is partly because of their disgust with the old-fashioned uncultured rabbinate; if we intend to save our youth for the cause of Conservative Judaism, our first duty must be to educate modern rabbis who can talk to the Jewish youth in English, and can teach Judaism in a modern way. Such a rabbi must know many things other than the Talmud. He must not only speak English correctly, he must master the language thoroughly. He must be familiar with English and world literature; he must know philosophy and theology; he must know a thing or two about sociology and the problems of modern life, and he must, first of all, be a thorough Hebrew scholar. Most of the old-fashioned American rabbis representing <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0758.jpg" n="4"/>Orthodoxy, are anything but Hebrew scholars; they know next to nothing about Hebrew literature, Jewish history, and Hebrew grammar. They are not familiar with other branches of Hebrew and cognate learning. In a great many cases, they do not even know the Bible, and in many cases, they do not know the Talmud. Since they know very little, they cannot say much; they have nothing to say. For this reason, they do not satisfy even the old generation. The young generation however, ignores them entirely.</p>
   <p>The problem of modernizing the Orthodox rabbinate is virtually solved in Eastern Europe. It is also virtually solved in the East in this country because the Orthodox rabbinical seminary in New York is a modern institution in the best sense of the word. In Chicago, however, Orthodox Jews believe that it is possible to perpetuate the old-fashioned rabbinate and at the same time to retain the support of the young generation behind Orthodox Judaism. We can only repeat what we have stated many times that unless we modernize our Orthodox rabbinate in Chicago, Orthodox Judaism in Chicago is doomed. The old Orthodox generation is dying out and the young generation is drifting away from Judaism because the <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0759.jpg" n="5"/>present type of Orthodox rabbi is, with few exceptions, unqualified to teach the youth; he has neither the intellectual nor the moral qualifications.</p>
