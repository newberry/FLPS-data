   <p>This Sunday, August 28, at 2 p.m., the dedication exercises of the enlarged and remodeled synagogue of the Congregation Beth Itzchak of Albany Park will be held at 4641-47 North Drake Avenue. An interesting and elaborate program has been arranged. Rabbi David Erlander, spiritual leader of the congregation, Rabbi Saul Silber and other prominent rabbis and Dr. Weisman and Dr. Azranat will speak. The musical part of the program is in charge of Canter Kritz who will be assisted by an augmented choir. Refreshments will be served by members of the Sisterhood, to all present.</p>
   <p>The dedication ceremonies of the Beth Itzchak Congregation mark an epochal occasion in Albany Park Jewry. The congregation was organized only nine years ago with a handful of men. A house of worship was erected on the present site six years ago. A year ago Rabbi David Erlander, noted educator and orator, was elected the spiritual leader of the congregation. The progress and development has been phenomenal. Today the congregation has a membership of 250. Its Hebrew school which ranks among the best has an enrollment of 140 pupils. The synagogue now has a seating capacity of over 1,000. The services are strictly orthodox and so well attended that the synagogue is filled to capacity. Numerous Young Judea Clubs make use of the congregation's meeting rooms and <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0401.jpg" n="2"/>under the personal supervision of Rabbi Erlander, study circles are conducted in Talmud, Hebrew, and Jewish history.</p>
   <p>Much of what has been achieved is due to the splendid work of its president, M. Skolnick, and with the efforts and cooperation of the Sisterhood which never fails to respond to the call of the congregation.</p>
   <p>The Beth Itzchak Congregation serves the spiritual needs of an important part of Albany Park Jewry and it is expected that many will participate in the exercises of today.</p>
   <p>The present officers of the congregation are M. Skolnick, president; M. H. Jacobson, vice-president; Jos. Lewis, treasurer; and H. L. Brody, secretary.</p>
