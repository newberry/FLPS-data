<title level="a">THE JEWISH CONVENTION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Jewish convention continued its session yesterday forenoon at 9:30. Mr. Rosedal was chairman.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vorsanger made a motion that for every community too poor to pay a rabbi one should be supported by the Union. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Another committee, which had been instructed to consider changes in the constitution, reported that changes were unnecessary.</p>
   <p>A special committee which had been nominated to investigate whether the curriculum of Union College was being properly adhered to by the president and the directorate of the institution reported that there were some deviations and recommended changes; the committee also recommended the elimination of some subjects heretofore required.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0332.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Lilienthal, principal of the institution, favored the report and made a motion that the matter should be considered by a special committee. His motion was carried, and a committee, consisting of the following gentlemen, was nominated: Dr. Felsenthal, Dr. Meyer, Dr. Milzuner, Dr. Ehrlich, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Huebsch, Dr. A. Moses, Dr. A. Wise, and Dr. J. S. Goldammer.</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued on a resolution proposed by Mr. Bloom. It was endeavored to prevent a community from obtaining the rabbi of another community unless his resignation had been accepted, or the community was willing to let him go. The measure was finally defeated.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wise of Cincinnati gave to the secretary the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"The Council authorizes the new directorate to give free scholarships financial help to all students of good character whose financial condition prevents them from attending Hebrew Union College, in order to enable talented youths to obtain an adequate education."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0333.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the afternoon session a motion, made by Dr. Jacobs, was carried, wherein the convention thanked the American consul at Morocco for his friendly efforts in behalf of Jews in Africa. Gratitude was also expressed to the King of Spain for the hospitality shown to banished Jews from Russia.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gross said that he regretted conditions prevailing in Jewish communities in the United States, which in his opinion were attributable to recently immigrated rabbis who were incapable of adequately performing their duties, and so a committee was appointed to investigate the ability as well as the character of the various rabbis of American Jewish communities.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wise's resolution to provide money for impecunious students was defeated because of the Union's nearly empty coffers. Thereupon Dr. Wise tendered his resignation as president of the theological seminary. His request was tabled.</p>
   <p>The new directorate consists of the following officials: M. Loth, president, Cincinnati; A. L. Sanger, vice-president, New York; Lipman Levi, secretary, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0334.jpg" n="4"/>Cincinnati; and Solomon Levi, treasurer, Cincinnati.</p>
   <p>The convention adjourned sine die.</p>
