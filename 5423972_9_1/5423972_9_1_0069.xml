   <p>The day is not yet set, but it is definite that the great Zionist Convention of the Zionist Organization of America will be held this year in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Just recently, Judge Brandeis, accompanied by Mr. Jacob DeHaas sailed for Palestine. The date for the Convention in Chicago will be set for some time following the return of these men, that their reports of Palestine may be scheduled.</p>
   <p>This coming Convention will be without a doubt one of the most brilliant ever held in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0070.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This in itself is insufficient.</p>
   <p>It is necessary that Chicago furnish a Zionist mass background which will give American Zionism the proper political tone and the necessary political influence.</p>
   <p>Chicago, with only eight thousand registered Zionists, cannot accomplish all this.</p>
   <p>If by the time the convention convenes Chicago cannot show a membership of at least twenty thousand, it cannot expect the convention to accomplish everything expected of it.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in every Zionist district in Chicago there has now been <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0071.jpg" n="3"/>organized a membership campaign committee.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the active Zionists, held last Wednesday at the Hebrew Institute, it was decided that each district carry on this membership drive.</p>
   <p>The names of the committees will be made known as soon as the Courier office receives them.</p>
   <p>To further the campaign, Mr. Samuel Blitz has come to Chicago and proposed his plan at the Hebrew Institute meeting.</p>
   <p>From New York, as a co-worker, has also come Mr. Mayer Goldberg, a man of learning, a Hebrewist, who will speak to Jews in Synagogues and lodges.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0072.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The movement has already started under the leadership of the executives of the four districts.</p>
   <p>The campaign is becoming very interesting. Its progress and increase in membership will be reported from week to week by the Zionist Bureau, under the supervision of Mr. Leon Zolotkof.</p>
   <p>Besides district organizations, the Chicago Hadassa and the Young Judea are aiding in this work.</p>
   <p>It is to be expected that before the huge preparations for the convention are ended, the Zionist membership will have more than doubled.</p>
   <p>The Joint Distribution Committee asks us to call to your attention this fact. All Jews in America who receive news through the Committee regarding their relatives in war ridden countries and towns, are indebted to <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0073.jpg" n="5"/>send to these relatives some money.</p>
   <p>The Joint Distribution Committee explains that many Jews in America come to receive news of their relatives but are never heard of again.</p>
   <p>The Committee goes on to say that every message from across the sea comes from a Jew in distress. None are any worse off or any better than the other. All Jews from war-destroyed Jewish communities, from whom the Joint Distribution Committee brings a message to relatives in America, are certainly in need of aid. It is a great injustice for American Jews receiving these appeals for aid, not to answer. The best answer to European relatives is a few dollars to help hold body and soul together.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0074.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The Joint Distribution Committee still maintains a department for sending money to Europe. It was especially organized to enable relatives to send their money through a safe route. No fee is charged for delivery service.</p>
   <p>Jews living near New York may send their checks to the Joint Distribution Committee, main office, 20 Exchange Place, New York City, enclosing the address of their relatives abroad. The money will be sent them promptly.</p>
   <p>In Chicago and in surrounding states of Illinois, apply at the local relief office, 728 W. 12 St. They will send as much money as you wish to give.</p>
   <p>Every Jew can use, free of charge, the services of this department of <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0075.jpg" n="7"/>the Joint Distribution Committee to send money to loved ones across the sea who suffer greatly as a result of need and want.</p>
   <p>Poles in America, in order to justify their brothers, the pogrom-makers, found a new excuse for pogroms. They argue that Jews are speculators.</p>
   <p>The Polish Information Bureau, supported by such good Poles as John P. Smulski: and the like, made the above remark regarding pogroms. This statement does not use the old excuse wherein Jews are accused of being Bolsheviks. This time they are blamed for the high cost of living. Jews are speculators.</p>
   <p>As issued by the Polish Information Bureau, it reads as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0076.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>"There is much provocation against Jewish elements in Poland for their tremendous profit sharing. Also guilty in this respect is the instability of Jewish political sympathies.</p>
   <p>"But the blinded man whose sufferings are augmented by the gruesome War which hovers on all Polish fronts, does not differentiate between guilty and non-guilty, making all Jews responsible. We know of many outbreaks directed against Jewish and Christian speculators alike.</p>
   <p>"At the same time, we must remember that among Jews now hovers a strong Anti-Polish attitude. Our earnest desire is to instill Polish patriotism of which Jews have oft given fine examples in the past and present, as the aid they have given the Polish government in <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0077.jpg" n="9"/>Warsaw."</p>
   <p>We regret that there are some Jews among whom figures prominently the renegade and deserter Nathan Calman Zlotnitzki, who sanctions such despicable excuse. On the other hand, we wonder how the capitalist Smulski and his kind have the courage to step forward with such arguments against Jews as speculators.</p>
