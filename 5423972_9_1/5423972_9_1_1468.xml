   <p>Last Sunday, in New York there was a gathering of 150 delegates representing eighty organizations of American Jewish Youth. They united into one group (the Verband) organizing as a national unit, with a national committee and a national council to regulate the work throughout the entire nation.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this uniting or Verband is to have all Jewish organizations, whose functions are social or educational in scope, work cooperatively under one basic idea and to help each other in words and deeds. The program, thus far, is limited, yet it carries the seed from which, in the near future, will blossom a mighty Jewish organization, that friend and foe will have to reckon with.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1469.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Let more and more national organizations be built, with any variety of objectives, yet in the end they will eventually intertwine into one large national organization, which will surpass the old Jewish organizations of Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish community or Federation that is founded only on a single aim, such as to regulate Jewish charity or to control religious matters, will no sooner come into existence than its narrow undertakings will have to expand and sooner or later, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, it will have to take its stand on all Jewish problems and seek a solution for them.</p>
   <p>Among Jews it is especially difficult to limit our problems whether of the home, the synagogue, charity or national interests. The Jewish Talmud Torah (school) is not of interest to the synagogue Jew only.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1470.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Every Jew is interested in giving a Jewish education to the new generation and wishes to have a voice in the matter. And, when the New York community took under its supervision the Jewish education it had to contend with the demands of hundreds of thousands who, at first, were not thought to be in the least interested in Jewish problems.</p>
   <p>The same is true of the charity organizations. The old-fashioned hospitality has developed into a modern immigration home and the immigration questions are such that they cannot be solved by simply extending charity. It is related to the national problem of Jewish life everywhere and with political and economic conditions of Jews throughout the world. Such an old institution as alms giving, to become modern, to partake fundamentally in <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1471.jpg" n="4"/>the Jewish migration question, must come in contact with all new Jewish problems from Nationalism to Zionism, that cannot be put aside with a smile or a threat. One feels this responsibility and diligently seeks to find a solution.</p>
   <p>The founding of a Charity Federation must sooner or later lead to the organization of a Jewish community that will embody in its active program all Jewish matters, and seek means to solve all those problems in our Jewish life. The organization of a Jewish community is the forerunner of a national organization. The fact alone, that Jews of various states gather to discuss Jewish problems, will in itself establish the true direction that seeks to find the root of all Jewish troubles and thus eradicate them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1472.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>All active workers who have Jewish problems at heart welcome with joy the national organization of the Jewish youth in America. They hope it will outgrow the bounds of this great country, extend a friendly hand to our brothers on the other side of the ocean and together build a universal Verband of all Jewish youth for the uniting and strengthening of their dear old people.</p>
