   <p>In yesterday's edition of the Courier, the executive committee of the Federated Zionist Society publicly declared that it will not tolerate any slates for candidates for the Jewish Congress, and protested against an attempt to make a slate without a concession by the Executive of the Chicago Zionist League. We can see that the Chicago Zionist League saw the logic and justice of not making a slate for Zionists, and annulled their previous decision thus clearing the slate that the Chicago Zionist League published in a moment of haste.</p>
   <p>We congratulate both organizations for taking this logical step. The Federated Zionist Socieites are worthy of recognition for not playing <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0168.jpg" n="2"/>politics when the American Jewry are trying to organize themselves democratically, embracing representatives from all classes of the people, and for eschewing disputes between one Zionist candidates and another.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Zionist League deserves congratulations for the sense of discipline and proper coordination to the principle it has shown when it determined to restore order.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0169.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We hope that the Jewish Congress will realize the logic of the Zionist ventures and profit by these ventures itself. But in order to make the work of the Congress effective the people must have complete, unrestrained freedom of elections. Any attempt to herd the Congress with delegates from one party through "political" connivance, will harm the fundamental object of the Congress.</p>
