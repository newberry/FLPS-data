<title level="a">THE NEW CONGREGATION ANSHE LIEBAWITCH OPENED WITH GREAT PARADE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, a large crowd of men and women witnessed the opening of the new synagogue which the Congregation Anshe Liebawitch has built on Clifton Park Avenue and Fifteenth Street. The ceremony began with a big parade from the congregation's temporary home at Albany Avenue and Roosevelt Road. The members of the synagogue, carrying the sacred articles, marched to the new synagogue preceded by a band from the Marks Nathan Orphan Home. Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon marched side by side with the rabbi of the congregation, Rabbi Mordecai Zevin. Many pedestrians joined the march and many people rode in autos.</p>
   <p>Representatives of Congregation Beth Jacob Anshe Kros, whose synagogues is located right across the street from the new synagogue, met the paraders with scrolls of the Torah and with a band playing Hatikvah [Jewish national anthem]. This made a great impression upon the crowd and added luster to the occasion.</p>

   <p>Mr. Barney Melnik paid two hundred twenty-five dollars for the honor of unlocking the doors of the synagogue. He made a present of his privilege to Mrs. N. H. Bolotin. Mr. Moses Israel Shapiro paid one hundred ten dollars for turning the key. The paraders then marched into the synagogue led by Mr. Jacob Disin, president of the synagogue, Mr. Jacob Wexler, chairman of the building committee, and Mr. Sam Rosenthal, treasurer. Cantor Krasnowsky sang a few psalms and intoned the proper prayers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carlstein then began to sell mitzvoth, which brought in the sum of five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Brilliant speeches were delivered by Rabbi Mordecai Zevin and by Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon. Mr. Joseph Weil also spoke. Refreshments were served after the speeches.</p>
