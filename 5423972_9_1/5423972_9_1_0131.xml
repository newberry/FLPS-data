<title level="a">THE ZIONIST CONVENTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Leon Zolotkoff</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Now it is really the eve of the convention. It is Saturday night. The delegates are gathered at an informal meeting, or gathering--to quote the exact wording of the program of the convention--"informal reunion of delegates".</p>
   <p>The informality is the most important aspect of this particular gathering. Here one feels so unrestrained, so free, so much at home, as though one were at the wedding of a very dear relative who does not even expect you to make a speech [in return for the feast].</p>
   <p>Here you see the faces of Zionist whom you may have met at large Zionist meetings; and a greater number of faces of people whom you are not certain of ever having seen before, especially are you in doubt as to the time and place of meeting them. Hence you are very often placed in embarrassing situations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>You see a lady coming toward you with a beaming face and a hearty "How do you do", as though you were the answer to her heart's prayer, and as though she came here for no other purpose than to meet and greet you, and to tell you how dear you are to her. You contort your face into a forced smile of friendliness--for that is only proper--and you press her hand in friendly fashion, not to be outdone in cordiality. In the meantime, you rack your brain, "God Almighty, who is she? Where have I seen her?" And you attempt, by every diplomatic trick, to have her commit herself by word or gesture [in order to enlighten you regarding the circumstances of your previous meeting].</p>
   <p>You do not want to exhibit your poor memory, nor to embarrass a lady who seems so glad to see you. And you feel a load off your chest when you find out that she is the financial secretary of the Podunk, Mississippi B'Noth Zion Society, and that you ate cheese blintzes at her home eight years ago on Chanukah. That was the time when you went there to address a mass meeting <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0133.jpg" n="3"/>at the invitation of her society.</p>
   <p>Here again you behold a familiar face. It belongs to a man who seldom misses an important Zionist meeting. You hurry over to ask him how he is,to express an idea and an opinion of your own, and to get a new impression of the activities and events in other Zionist circles.</p>
   <p>And everyone else in this beautifully decorated hall has similar experiences. In this great gathering of men and women delegates, we see groups--some large, some small--of friends who have met for the first time, after a long separation, of men and women Zionists who are always flippant and gay; here and there, we see a bit of flirtation. And here and there, among the great multitude, appears the face of a really important individual, one who will be among the main speakers and leaders of the convention.</p>
   <p>These personages smile, answer questions, press hands, just as others do.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0134.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But you can tell by the absent-minded expressions on their faces that their thoughts are far from their immediate surroundings, and their actions are mostly mechanical.</p>
   <p>Here is our friend, the magnetic De Haas, with his sly smile, joking and making repartee, moving about in the heavy crowd, stopping a person here, another one there; but all the time, he is really worrying about next year's budget which may need to be raised to three million dollars, or about the reorganization of the whole Zionist movement in America, which he considers even more important than the budget.</p>
   <p>And here is Louis Lipsky, the imperturbable Zionist leader who seldom becomes upset, yet who is always ready to put in a proper word at the proper time, and who has become so interested in the movement that he has become a part of it. It is an obsession with him.</p>
   <p>And over all, hovers a holiday spirit of bustle, noise, jumble and mishmash; <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0135.jpg" n="5"/>a confusion of laughter, of restrained rapture, of snatches of "Hatikvah" [The Hope--Jewish National Anthem], of friendly greetings; a jumble of shapes and colors, of the white and blue [colors of Jewish flag], among the American and British colors. Altogether it is perhaps a little too noisy, but it is very pleasant.</p>
   <p>And apropos the convention itself--it still exhibits a fine, dignified appearance to the world, and is to be admired, although from a less important angle [the pre-convention setup--the more important angle being the convention proper].</p>
   <p>The Soldiers Memorial Hall, where the convention opens tomorrow, is a magnificent building of Grecian architecture. It gives the impression of orderliness as well as festivity. The same thing could be said, even more appropriately, of the Syrian Mosque, a building belonging to the Free Masons, where the mass meeting is to be held on Wednesday evening. The two buildings are not far from one another, and both are located in one of the finest neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0136.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The delegates who have nothing better to do, wander, singly or in groups, from the William Penn Hotel to the Soldiers Memorial Hall, and then to the Syrian Mosque, to look at the buildings from the outside. And the representatives of the Jewish press made a special pilgrimage to the Syrian Mosque yesterday, to admire the building and the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>In regards to the delegates from the midwestern states, it is worth while to remark that there are more of them at this convention than were expected; that they are, in general, a fine, pleasant group, perhaps less informed on Zionist questions than the eastern delegates because they are younger, but no less intelligent, and no less ardent than the latter.</p>
