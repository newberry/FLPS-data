   <p>Will you correct your error?</p>
   <p>This question is put to the Agudath Israel, which now calls the Orthodox Jewry to a Congress that is to take place in Vienna in August. The Agudath Israel, as is well known, has carried on a bitter struggle against the Zionists and against their undertakings in Palestine. It opposed the recognition of the Zionist organization as the official representative body of the Jewish people, and in unequivocal terms urged the Jews not to support the Keren Hayesod [exchequer World Zionist Organization]. The Agudath Israel has done a great deal of harm to the Zionist movement, and by doing so it did not do itself a favor. By opposing Zionism, it lost a number of its adherents. Its influence has recently narrowed down to a small group.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0502.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Agudath Israel calls upon all Orthodox rabbis and laymen to participate in its congress. It is doubtful whether they will respond. Amongst the Orthodox rabbis and laymen there are a lot of Zionists or sympathizers of Zionism. How can these men meet with the Agudath Israel, when the latter designates them as being non-Orthodox, and even worse than non-Orthodox, just because they agree with Zionism.</p>
   <p>If the Agudath Israel would rectify its position, it would then have an honorable and fruitful congress. Its congress would elicit sympathy from the whole Jewish Orthodox world and its resolutions would be adopted for the good of all. According to a report from the Warsaw Jude, organ of the Agudath Israel, "the World Congress will have to determine matters of the greatest importance to the Orthodox Jewry.....There, it will discuss matters inextricably bound to every pious Jew, to everyone who wishes to see that the Jewish people exist.</p>
   <p>We do not know exactly what matters the Agudath Israel has reference to. Although it claims that its congress will not be a party-congress, yet it is most <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0503.jpg" n="3"/>likely that the question will arise as to Agudath's position toward Zionism. This question will be presented because it is the most sacred one to the people. If it will continue to oppose Zionism, then the Misrachi [Orthodox wing of the Zionist movement], which consists of hundreds of Orthodox rabbis and laymen, will make a dead set against it. Also, the Zionist masses will certainly not remain silent. And it will do harm to the entire Jewish people.</p>
   <p>The question, Will you correct your error? is in order, and it remains for the Agudath Israel to answer it without demurring in unequivocal terms. This we believe expresses the opinion and sentiments of the Orthodox rabbis and laymen of Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>[The Thompson Case]</p>
   <p>The decision handed down by the Illinois Supreme Court in the case of William Hale Thompson vs. the Tribune is of great significance, as it appears from the top down.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0504.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As it is well known, the Thompson administration, while he was Mayor, was continuously criticized by the Tribune. He, therefore, in the name of the city, brought suit against the Tribune for $10,000,000 damages "for calumniating Chicago in the eyes of America". Judge Harry M. Fisher of the Circuit Court, who presided over the case, rendered a decision in favor of the Tribune, declaring thereat that a newspaper or an individual has the full right and liberty to write or say anything against certain men or a government, provided the newspaper or individual does not instigate or organize a revolt against them. The city attorneys, or more correctly, the Thompson's lawyers, appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, and the latter upheld Judge Fisher's decision, thereby completely rendering void the suit.</p>
   <p>In handing down a decision in a $10,000,000 libel case, the highest court of the state has given utterance to a few important matters concerning public affairs.</p>
   <p>"To obtain freedom of speech was one of the reasons why the American colonists <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0505.jpg" n="5"/>had revolted. History teaches us the freedom is not enjoyed unless the people have the privilege of redressing their grievances. The people are supreme, and the members of the government, the administrators of public institutions, are their servants. The citizen, being supreme, has the right to discuss and criticize his government, as long as he does not advocate violence and insurrection. If he will not have freedom of speech, he will not be able to criticize and people whose mouths are shut often lose patience and resort to violence. That is why we must have the freedom of word and pen."</p>
   <p>Let the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the case between Thompson and the Tribune serve as an example in our own public life. Administrators of charitable institutions, leaders of mass movements, of congregations and communities may be criticized whenever they are in the wrong. They are no more than public servants. The public stands above them; the public selected them or did not oppose them when they crowned themselves as leaders. If it does not agree with the management or leadership, the public has the full right to criticize it. The same holds good with a newspaper which is the expression of public opinion.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0506.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The news about the Supreme Court decision spread like wildfire throughout America, and perhaps throughout the rest of the world. The decision affects the very foundation of a newspaper, and we are glad that a Jewish judge, who conducted the trial to its conclusion, had a hand in it.</p>
   <p>Born in Russia, came to America, became a citizen, studied law, elected as judge, Harry M. Fisher presided over a trial in which the mayor of one of the largest cities in America sued the world's greatest newspaper and ruled justly, thereby [rendering a decision] in keeping with the Constitution of this country, and which the highest court of the State upheld.</p>
   <p>Thank you Judge Fisher! Blessed be America!</p>
