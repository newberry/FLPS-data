   <p>"Chebra Anshe Emes" (Society of the Men of Truth) is the title of a new Hebrew congregation on the North Side, which dedicated its new Synagogue yesterday. This place of worship is on the third floor of a new unpretentious brick building, 262 Division Street. The hall is plainly but neatly and comfortably furnished. This is the second Hebrew congregation on the North Side. Its character is semi-orthodox, about the same as that of Dr. Norton's congregation, which worships in the New England Church.</p>
   <p>The new congregation has now thirty-three members, with the immediate prospect of a large increase, as a large number of Israelites reside in that portion of the city. The officers are as follows: K. D. Davidson, President, etc., etc.</p>
   <p>The dedicating service came off at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon in the presence of a crowded house. They were conducted by the Rev. Dr. Adler and the Rev. Dr. H. Bien.</p>
