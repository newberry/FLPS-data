   <p>The holding of the annual Delegates' Day of the Chicago Kehillah, the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations of Chicago, on Sunday, Nov. 19, brought to public attention again its widespread work and its outstanding importance to the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
   <p>The Kehillah the spokesman of the Chicago Orthodox community, is representative of 80 synagogues, and its woman's organization, the Orthodox Frauen Verband, is representative of forty-two separate auxiliaries. The various phases of its work are carried on through special committees, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0353.jpg" n="2"/>or Vaad, there being one for Chinuch, Kashruth, Yeshivoth, etc. The Frauen Verband is especially active in supporting educational work.</p>
   <p>THE CENTRAL VAAD HA-KASHRUTH.</p>
   <p>As is still very well remembered, the Kashruth conditions in Chicago before the advent of the Kehillah was indeed deplorable. Under the firm guiding hand of the Central Vaad Ha-Kashruth, the 370 kosher meat markets in the Chicago area are systematically inspected by thirteen competent "Mashgichim," besides the special inspectors assigned to markets by the "Beth-Din". The monthly budget of the Vaad is $650.00, of which $500.00 comes from fees for inspection, kosher signs, etc., and the rest is supported from the slender Kehillah budget.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0354.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Every Tuesday afternoon, the officers of the Vaad Ha-Kashruth meet with all the Mashgichim, who give a report of their work, reports violations of Kashruth by butchers, and receive instructions for future work. Serious charges against a butcher result in a "Beth-Din" of rabbis of the Vaad Ha-Kashruth, which investigates, hears witnesses, and issues its verdict. If found guilty, punishment is meted out in accordance with the gravity of the offense, the extreme penalty being the denial of being a kosher butcher. Special inspection is ordered in minor cases, ranging up to permanent inspection in serious offenses.</p>
   <p>The Central Vaad Ha-Kashruth replaced a system of local non- affiliated <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0355.jpg" n="4"/>Kashruth bodies operating in the various sections of the city with notable results. Attention is now being turned to the chaotic condition of Kashruth in other food products, and was the subject of the main debate at the Delegates' Day. A resolution was finally adopted for the better integration of Kashruth in Chicago through a unified control of "Hechsharim" issued on kosher products.</p>
   <p>THE "HECHSHARIM" PROBLEM.</p>
   <p>Long a subject of bitter controversy, "Hechsharim" were issued by individual rabbis, with the rabbinate as a whole having no voice in the matter. This system left the way open for unscrupulous people whose sole connection with the rabbinate was the possession of a long beard and the self-assumed title of "rabbi," to enrich themselves at the <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0356.jpg" n="5"/>expense of the good name of Kashruth in the city. There are instances where "Hechsharim" are still in use and whose authors have been many years dead! A bewildered public cannot understand why a product is denounced as "tref," when it bears a "Hechshar" signed by a "rabbi" attesting to its Kashruth. The new system will not interfere in the least with the income of bona fide rabbis from "Hechsharim," but is designed to bring order out of what has been chaos, to establish an authoritative voice in Kashruth matters, to aid destitute rabbis who have had no "Hechsharim," and to provide funds for other communal and religious purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0357.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>EDUCATION WORK.</p>
   <p>Probably the outstanding service of the Kehillah to the Jewish community is its labors for Chinuch, education. The Vaad Ha-Chinuch, with the loyal assistance of the Orthodox Frauen Verband in all its activities, raised about $20,000 during the past year for the support of the twenty-three Hebrew schools affiliated with it. These funds came from appeals, donations, Talmud Torah boxes, Education Day, Flower Day, Concert and Ball, $15.00 Plate Banquet, and through participation in Jewish Day. The Vaad-Ha-Chinuch has literally kept open the doors of the twenty-three Talmud Torahs this year, but its resources are inadequate for its needs for the schools, the teachers of which suffer greatly, as all of them are from six to eight months <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0358.jpg" n="7"/>in arrears of their salary. Delegates' Day adopted resolutions pledging the aid of the Kehillah for the activities of the Vaad Ha-Chinuch for the Talmud Torahs, as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To cooperate in making a success the Grand Bazaar which will be held in the Wolf Building, 3138-40 Roosevelt Road, from January 13 to 20.</p>
   <p>2. To launch a $15.00 scholarship campaign, each scholarship enabling a child to attend Talmud Torah for one semester.</p>
   <p>3. To urge every Jewish family to have a Talmud Torah box in the home, and to contribute at every opportunity.</p>
   <p>4. To sell "Talmud Torah" matsos before Passover, the net proceeds to be used for the schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0359.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>5. To ask the Jewish Charities of Chicago to give an annual subsidy to the Vaad Ha-Chinuch for the Talmud Torahs affiliated with it.</p>
   <p>6. To conduct an intensive campaign of information warning Chicago Jews who wish their children to receive a Jewish religious and national education, against the radical folk-schools where propaganda is mixed with education.</p>
   <p>THE VAAD HA-YESHIVOTH.</p>
   <p>The Vaad Ha-Yeshivoth, which raises funds for thirty world-famous academies in Europe and Palestine is bringing to a close its fifth annual campaign. It has already received nearly $10,000 and will receive more from synagogues which have not turned in their collections.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0360.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>When all the money is in, the Vaad makes its distribution. This is a vast improvement over the old system, when Chicago Jewry was constantly annoyed by solicitation by an army of "Meshulochim," and when it was often doubtful whether the funds reached the proper destination. The Vaad Ha-Yeshivoth is an excellent example of the work of the Kehillah.</p>
   <p>OTHER IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS.</p>
   <p>Other important aspects of the Kehillah work were treated in the following resolutions:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0361.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>Keren Kayemeth and Vaad Ha-Chinuch Boxes. To take immediate steps to stop the activities of a collection for certain Palestine institutions which are spreading malicious propaganda against the Keren Kayemeth and the Vaad Ha-Chinuch boxes, using the names of long-deceased rabbis as having prohibited such boxes.</p>
   <p>Broaden Kehillah Scope. To have the Kehillah's Administrative Committee join with a committee of rabbis of the Chicago Orthodox Rabbinate to attract into the Kehillah all elements of Chicago Jewry that are traditionally and nationally inclined.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0362.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>Kehillah Dues. To enable the Kehillah to meet its administrative expenses, to require every affiliated synagogue to pay from $50.00 to $100.00 annual dues, dependent upon size, and $25.00 for each auxiliary, with the delegates to be responsible for the collection and bringing the funds to the Kehillah.</p>
   <p>Vote of Confidence in Leaders. Delegates Day expressed its utmost confidence in the untiring work of President Abe Goldblatt of the Kehillah, and its able executive director, Rabbi Menahem B. Sacks, for his unselfish and extraordinary devotion to the manifold activities of the Kehillah; and to express its indignation at any calumnies cast upon them, and to extend the assurance of full moral and financial support in their plans for the welfare of the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0363.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>Anti-Nazi Movement. To appeal to Chicago Jewry for full support of Solomon Levinson in his work against the Nazis; and to appeal to the leaders of American Jewry to set aside personal differences, so that a united front may be presented to our enemies.</p>
   <p>Kfar Ussishkin. To urge every synagogue to aid in establishing "Kfar Ussishkin" in Palestine, to the extent at least of purchasing one dunam of land in the name of the synagogue.</p>
   <p>Young Israel. To aid the Young Israel movement, and particularly to lend support to the Mid-Western Young Israel Conference in Chicago, December 22 to 25, and to proclaim Saturday, December 23, Young Israel Sabbath, on which rabbis and lay leaders of the synagogues will speak on the work of Young Israel for Orthodox Jewish youth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0364.jpg" n="13"/>
   <p>RABBI SACHS WILL REMAIN</p>
   <p>One important result of the Delegates' Day was the retention of Rabbi Sachs as executive director. His resignation was unanimously refused. A thundering ovation greeted his decision to bow to the expressed will of the delegates and remain with the Kehillah. Rabbi Sachs, is truly the moving spirit of the Kehillah, and under his continued guidance it is hoped that greater unity of spirit and action may be brought about in the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
