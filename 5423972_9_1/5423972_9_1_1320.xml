   <p>What do youknow about A.Z.A? Do you know that Aleph Zadek Aleph is an international organization? Did you know that there are 12 chapters of A.Z.A. in the United States and Canada? It is disheartening to discover how many of our Jewish people are unaware of this wonderful movement A.Z.A.</p>
   <p>Readers, you probably wonder why the term disheartening is used in a previous sentence. This author believes he is fully justified in portraying thus a situation he believes exists. But why take valuable space to define a part of speech? It is the writers opinion that the best manner in which he could clarify himself is to tell you all about Aleph Zadek Aleph; Its ideals; Its endeavors; and why it needs your cooperation.</p>
   <p>Aleph Zaked Aleph is the subsidiary organization of the world-wide organization B'nai Brith. The B'nai Brith which is organized to eradicate Anti-Semitism, for many years realized that its hope of success lies in the youth of the Jewish race. Accordingly, the first chapter of Aleph Zadek Aleph was instituted in 1923, by the B'nai Brith Lodge at Omaha, Nebraska. It was but the manifest destiny, for an order banded for the perpetuation of the beautiful symbols of Judaism, to make the rapid studies and wonderful progress as did Aleph Zadek Aleph.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1321.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the six years of its existence, its chapters increased from 1 to 112 and its national membership from 30 to 8,000.</p>
   <p>The Constitution of the order has for its preamble the desire for the enrollment of every desirable Jewish youth from the age of 16 to 21 and development of the mental, moral and physical qualities of the member. Although the order has all the aspects of a college fraternity, inasmuch as it has a secret ritual, pass-word, handshake and emblem, it does not aim to be as exclusive as the aforementioned.</p>
   <p>It is in this manner, by instilling into the heart of the Jewish youth a desire to dedicate himself to honor, to truth,and to virtue, that we can hope to hasten the day when all mankindwill acknowledge the common fatherhood of God and the common brotherhood of men.</p>
