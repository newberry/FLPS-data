   <p>A meeting of unusual importance will be held Wednesday, February 1, 1928, at 8 p. m., at the Chicago Historical Society Building, 632 N. Dearborn Street. It is proposed to organize the Theodore Herzl Memorial Foundation, whose aims and objects are briefly outlined as follows:</p>
   <p>To create and foster a cultural revival among the Jews of America, especially the young generation. To give scholarships for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem to worthy students on a competitive basis, to the end that upon their return they may become leaders in Israel, and a leavening influence in American Jewish life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1553.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To establish a Theodore Herzl Chair of Journalism in the Hebrew University. To present a Medal of Honor, coupled with a substantial sum of money, to the Jew, who has contributed the most to the honor of his people during the past year. To offer scholarship and essay prizes among high school and college students of this country, and thus stimulate a pride in Judaism and a knowledge of its principles.</p>
   <p>To transfer the remains of Theodore Herzl to Palestine, as was the last wish of the great Zionist leader, and to erect a suitable memorial as an inspiration to generations to come.</p>
   <p>To publish a permanent form prize winning essays, sponsored by the Foundation and to foster creative Jewish endeavor in literature, arts and sciences. The call for the meeting is signed by Max Shulman, Rabbi Silber, Mrs. Julius Stone, Rabbi Felix Mendelsohn, and H. L. Meites.</p>
