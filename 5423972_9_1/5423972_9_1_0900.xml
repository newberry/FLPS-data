  <body>
   <p>We are cardinal opponents of the Judaism as it is understood and propagated by Rabbi Tobias Schoenfarber of the Kehilath Anshe Maariv Congregation. We have often had the occasion to criticize, at times perhaps too severely, and in no uncertain terms assail, the worthy rabbi who has been for the past thirteen years active in the Jewish Community of Chicago, particularly in his congregation, in the betterment of the Jewish Community.</p>
   <p>To what extent we chiefly differ, or better said, how little we understand each other, or how still less we are apt to understand each other, shall be seen in the future, which in turn will largely depend upon what he preaches and the principles he shall disseminate among Jews. As to our trend of thought at present, there is hardly any hope that we shall ever be able to agree with Rabbi Schoenfarbers in his tireless work for the good of the Jews and Judaism as he sees it.</p>
   <p>However, under any circumstances, in all times, notwithstanding how set we <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0901.jpg" n="2"/>have been against the venerable rabbi, we have never questioned his sincerity and honesty in advocating the principles in which he believes. We have never cast any reflections on his adamant personality, which he makes use of to promote these principles. We have always admired his strong Jewish character by sacrificing his pride and physical comforts whenever it boiled down to a question of principles.</p>
   <p>Such a personality offers strong opposition, nevertheless, it is pleasant to have an honest opponent, especially now, when materialism is the foundation of spiritual progress. We therefore, consider it a privelege to extend, through these lines, felicitations to the venerable Rabbi Tobias Schoenfarber on his thirteenth anniversary as spiritual loader of Congregation Kehilath Ansh Maariv, which is now being celebrated by him and his congregation.</p>
   <p>Among the many blessings bestowed upon the rabbi by his students, the members of his congregation, and the many people of various congregations in which he lectured, we herein send our blessing and wish that the rabbi may expend many years of preaching the principles he understands; that the God of Israel may <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0902.jpg" n="3"/>grant him adequate strength to devote his forthcoming years to the good of the intellectual Jewry and Judaism in such a manner that it should only bring peace and unity among the brethren of Israel, who are not only scattered throughout the four corners of the world, but also divided among themselves into hundreds of factions. And last but not least, we wish him the ancient Jewish blessing: in our generation may Israel be redeemed, and may his eyes witness a united Jewry built upon a strong foundation.</p>
   <p>We wish him all this from the depths of our hearts. We extend him the blessings which we know are dearer to him than wealth and all the material benefits that a man in Rabbi Schoenfarber's position can command and he sacrifices it on the altar of his devotion to his principles and to his love for Judaism.</p>
