   <p>The XXXIII Council of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations meeting in Chicago, is returning to the city which was one of the early strongholds of Reform in America. Since this convention is bringing some fifteen hundred (1,500) representatives of Reform Judaism to Chicago it may be of interest at this time to turn back the pages of history and to glance at the early Jewish community of Chicago, which has developed to such an extent from small beginnings that today it houses twelve large Reform Congregations, and boasts some 325,000 Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0375.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first Jewish settler arrived in Chicago in 1838, just one year after it was incorporated as a city. About twenty more German Jews arrived between 1840 and 1844, and the community increased slowly up to 1849, when there was a decided increase in the German immigration.</p>
   <p>The first Jewish religious services were held in the city in a private room on the Day of Atonement, 1845. There were exactly ten men present for the service, so that when one left the room the services had to stop. The following year services were again held on the same day, and strangely enough, were attended by the same number of men.</p>
   <p>The first Jewish organization in Chicago, the Jewish Burial Ground Society, was established in 1846. For the sum of $46 it acquired from the city one acre of ground to be used as a cemetery. The location of this first burial-ground was east of the city limits, along the shore of Lake Michigan, to the north.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0376.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The first Jewish congregation to be established in Chicago was Kehillath Anshe Maariv, whose constitution was drawn up in 1847, and signed by fourteen members. The Jewish Burial-Ground Society turned over to the congregation all its property, including the cemetery, and dissolved. Kehillath Anshe Maariv, held its first regular service in a private room on the second floor of a building on the southwest corner of Lake and Wells streets, and in 1849 leased a lot on Clark street (where the great Chicago Post Office now stands) on which it erected a frame synagogue.</p>
   <p>In 1868, the congregation purchased the northwest corner of Wabash Avenue and Peck Court and converted the church standing upon it into a synagogue. In the great fire of 1871 the synagogue escaped destruction but all the records were lost. In 1873, Dr. Merzbacher's Prayer Book was adopted. An organ, choir, and family pews had been introduced several years before.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0377.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Wabash Avenue synagogue was sold after the fire and the congregation purchased the church and site on the corner of Indiana Avenue and 26th Street. This church was also converted into a synagogue.</p>
   <p>In 1889, since most of the temple members had moved farther south, a new plot on Indiana Avenue was purchased. In 1902 the Einhorn ritual, in the English version, was adopted. The first Rabbi called to Kehillath Anshe Maariv in 1847 was the Rev. Ignatz Kunreuthei; he was followed by Dr. S. Friedlander in 1855; Rev. Liebmann Adler in 1861; Dr. M. Machol; Dr. Samuel Sale; Dr. Isaac S. Moses; Rev. M. P. Jacobson, and Dr. Tobias Schanfarber, at present Rabbi Emeritus. Dr. Solomon B. Freehof is the congregational leader today. Kehillath Anshe Maariv was the first of Chicago groups to join the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which it did in 1874.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0378.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The second oldest congregation in Chicago was B'nai Sholom, organized in 1852 by fourteen members.</p>
   <p>BEGINNINGS OF REFORMS IN CHICAGO.</p>
   <p>Sinai Congregation, the third oldest, was the result of the Reform Movement which was just starting in Chicago. In 1858, some members of the Kehillath Anshe Maariv Congregation, being dissatisfied with the services and the course of the congregation, formed a society which they called the "Reformverein," with the avowed intention of organizing themselves into a congregation as soon as their number reached thirty. At the first public session of the society, held on April 17, 1858, the secretary, Dr. B. Felsenthal who afterwards became its first Rabbi, delivered the following remarks:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0379.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"How can the abuses which have crept into our religion be corrected? We must separate the eternal indestructible kernel of Judaism from its tattered encasings, must remove the antiquated notions, and make the service fruitful and intelligible by the use of a language understood by all. Not two per cent of the members of any Jewish congregation, are sufficiently conversant with the Hebrew language to invest the service with dignity or to close it with intelligibility; the whole service has been degraded to the level of a dead formula."</p>
   <p>Two years later, in 1860, the society formed itself into the Sinai Congregation.</p>
   <p>The first House of Worship of Sinai Congregation was a frame building, formerly a church, on Monroe Street. At the dedication of this Temple in 1861 the Einhorn ritual was used for the first time in a Western congregation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0380.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Dr. Felsenthal was succeeded by Dr. Chronic,who founded in Chicago a German monthly in the interest of Jewish Reform. At the Rabbinical Conference held in Philadelphia in 1869, Dr. Chronic moved to transfer the celebration of the Sabbath to Sunday, but no action was taken upon the motion. Sinai Temple joined the Union in 1875. Dr. Chronic was succeeded by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch.</p>
   <p>In 1885, a change was made and Dr. Hirsch no longer preached on Saturdays. In 1892, the temple was remodeled and enlarged. It is the largest Jewish congregation in Chicago, and today its pulpit is occupied by Dr. Louis L. Mann.</p>
   <p>Zion Congregation, the fourth oldest in Chicago, was organized in 1864. Its rabbi was Dr. B. Felsenthal, who was succeeded by Dr. Joseph Stolz in 1866. For many years Zion Congregation was a prominent factor in the <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0381.jpg" n="8"/>spiritual and educational development of the Jewish community. B'nai Abraham was organized on the West Side in 1870 with Rev. Isaac Fall as its leader.</p>
   <p>After the fire the number of congregations increased rapidly. The most prominent among the younger congregations are the following:</p>
   <p>Beth El Congregation, organized in 1871 immediately after the fire. The first services were held in the home of one of the members but on the following week a hall was rented where regular services were held every Friday night and Saturday morning. D. Gottlieb and Ignatz Kunreuthei officiated. Six months later a frame church was purchased which was destroyed shortly after by a cyclone.</p>
   <p>That same evening a meeting of the congregation was called and a fund was raised to start the building of a new synagogue. The rabbis of this congregation were Herman Eliassof, Bonheim, Lippmannsohn, Bien, Jacob Donsk and Julius Rappaport. Rabbi Mayer Lipman is the present incumbent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0382.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Congregation Emanuel was founded in 1880. In 1889 moderate Reform and the Prayer Book, Minhag America were adopted, and later the cause of Advanced Reform was further strengthened by the introduction of the Einhorn Prayer Book and the practice of worshipping with the uncovered head. The rabbis of Emanuel were Austrian E. Brown, Julius Newman, Dr. Emanuel Schrieber and Dr. Felix A. Levy, who occupies the pulpit today.</p>
   <p>The Reform Congregation of Isaiah Temple was organized in 1895 by members of Zion Congregation, who had moved to the South Side. At the first meeting Dr. Joseph Stolz was chosen rabbi and still holds that position in an honorary capacity. Dr. Gerson B. Levi officiates at the Temple Isaiah-Israel.</p>
   <p>The twelve Chicago Reform Congregations which form a part of the two hundred and eighty-four constituent members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations are:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0383.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>Anshe Mayriv (Dr. Tobias Schanfarber and Dr. Solomon B. Freehof) ; Beth El (Rabbi Mayer Lipman); Beth Israel (Rabbi S. Felix Mendelsohn); B'nai Abraham Zion (Rabbi Samuel Schwartz); Chicago Sinai (Dr. Louis L. Mann); Emanuel (Dr. Felix A. Levy); Temple Judea (Rabbi David Rosenbaum); Mizpah (Dr. Jacob Singer); Temple Sholom (Rabbi Abram Hirschberg and Rabbi Maurice Hirschberg); South Shore Temple ( Dr. G. George Fox); The Temple Isaiah ( Dr. Joseph Stolz and Dr. Gerson B. Levi); North Shore Congregation Israel, Glencoe (Rabbi Charles E. Shulman.)</p>
