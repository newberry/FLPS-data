   <p>The Chicago Order, Knights of Zion, held their Twelfth Annual Convention and Banquet at the Hebrew Institute and made known to the world, what has been accomplished until now and what they intend to do in the future. Of the reports presented by the officers, we print the following:</p>
   <p>1. The income of last year was $641.00 and expense $538.00</p>
   <p>2. Three thousand votes were cast last year.</p>
   <p>3. Nine hundred and twenty-six dollars were raised for Jewish National Fund. For the Bezalel Synagogue $69.00</p>
   <p>4. They have one thousand and eight hundred members.</p>
   <p>According to these figures, the organization is very small, but the officers deem it a successful one as they continually repeated their speeches. From the <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0273.jpg" n="2"/>reports made by the officers we find that the past year was the first year of the organization independence and this came about after a long and hard struggle.</p>
   <p>Eleven years straight this organization was considered a branch of the Zionist Organization of America, who have their office in New York. On the twelfth year, which was last year, this organization requested the share-holders committee in Keln, to issue an independent charter for them.</p>
   <p>The Zionist Organization of America was very much opposed to any such charter, but after many heated discussions, they succeeded in obtaining such a charter. The organization is now operating as an independent order.</p>
   <p>The plans of the order for their future work were expressed in various resolutions, the most important of which are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The order shall send four delegates to the next Zionist Congress and pay $500 towards their expenses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0274.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>2. To organize youth clubs in order to teach the children Zionism.</p>
   <p>3. To support Dr. Huzanawitz's library in-Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>4. To appropriate twenty-five dollars for Zionist literature.</p>
   <p>5. That every member shall obligate himself to pay ten cents a year for the Bezalel Synagogue in Jerusalem.</p>
