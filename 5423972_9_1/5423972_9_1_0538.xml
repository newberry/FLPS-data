   <p>The Courier surprised its readers yesterday with the announcement that after a great deal of effort, the Chicago rabbis have finally founded an organization, which will be the highest religious authority in the community. The United Rabbinate--a very fortunate and well-chosen name for the rabbinical organization--should, in keeping with its character, do constructive work in every field of the religious and cultural life of the Chicago Jewish community, and should not satisfy itself merely with settling religious questions and disputes. The United Rabbinate of Chicago will be an active organization; not only will it answer questions, but it will also formulate its position on certain questions from the standpoint of rabbinical Judaism.</p>
   <p>We believe that the news that a United Rabbinate has been organized in Chicago, is good news, perhaps the best news published in regard to Chicago Jewish affairs <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0539.jpg" n="2"/>in the past few years. It isn't necessary to tell our readers that we share the opinion of the rabbis who wish to introduce order and to establish a system in our religious life by creating a religious authority in the city, consisting of all the real rabbis. We have often stated how necessary it is for the Chicago Jewry to have such an authority and we have often urged the rabbis and laymen to create such an authority. It doesn't make any difference whether this authority is called Beth Din [unofficial court of arbitration presided over by rabbis], Beth Ha Va-ad [board of rabbis], or Misrod Harabbonim [United Rabbinate]. It is not the name that matters, but rather the spirit of the organization; that this spirit has been created shows that something positive has been done.</p>
   <p>The moment the United Rabbinate is really organized and really effective, the rabbis will discover two things: first, the amount of important work there is to do in the purely rabbinical and religious field, and second, the amount of work they can do, if they are organized for the purpose of establishing order in the Jewish life of Chicago. When they see how much they can accomplish, they will wonder why they hadn't organized such a collective rabbinical authority <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0540.jpg" n="3"/>before, under this or that name.</p>
   <p>In keeping with its name, the United Rabbinate has already set itself a program of activity. It is not only a Beth Din, it is an active organization to formulate problems and find their proper solution. We are convinced that if the United Rabbinate will be what its name indicates it ought to be, order will be established in the Chicago Jewish Community, and our community will become a model for all other large Jewish communities in America. The Chicago Jews are conservative enough to understand the value of such an organization as the United Rabbinate, and are modern enough to help the United Rabbinate in all its undertakings.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that the United Rabbinate, if it is active and effective, will soon reinforce the partially undermined foundation of rabbinism in America, and will also revive the people's respect for rabbinism. It will no longer be possible for a shohet who has been repudiated by the rabbis, to keep his position, as if nothing had happened. Nor will the butchers who sell nonkosher meat, by <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0541.jpg" n="4"/>calling it "kosher," be able to continue this abominable practice. Whatever the United Rabbinate will decide, will be law. In all matters of religious life, the United Rabbinate will, and must be the authority and highest court of appeal. Rabbinism itself will thus elevate itself. Not everyone who wishes to become a rabbi, can become one, and it will be quite clear that he who is not a member of the United Rabbinate of Chicago, is not a rabbi, nor will he be allowed to call himself "rabbi". He may call himself whatever he wishes--speaker, magid [preacher], organizer--but not rabbi, because rabbinism is the privilege of the Bnai Torah [Sons of the Torah], honest and sincere Jews. When the public knows who is and who is not a rabbi, and knows how to distinguish between a rabbi and a speaker or magid, then it will have more respect for the rabbi and for his decisions. Only when a clear and sharp line is drawn between rabbis and pseudorabbis will the rabbi rise again in prominence and respect in the eyes of the public, and the latter will accept what the rabbi decides with regard to all religious matters.</p>
   <p>We hail the newly organized United Rabbinate of Chicago. We know how essential <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0542.jpg" n="5"/>it is and we also know what it can accomplish for this community--the second largest Jewish community in the world. We hope that the United Rabbinate will soon take up the great task of establishing order in this city. We hope that it will work systematically and methodically and that it will be energetic in its work. Only through intrepidity and energy will it gain the love and confidence of all classes of the Chicago Jewish population, and will become the spiritual leader of the Chicago Orthodoxy.</p>
   <p>The United Rabbinate can also be effective in an entirely different direction. It should be able to represent us on religious issues [that may arise] in the outside world. Such a rabbinical organization will be respected in the outside world, and we believe that we will be well represented because among the Chicago rabbis there are many astute minds and when a Jewish issue of importance arises, the rabbis, organized in a rabbinate, will certainly know how to deal with it.</p>
   <p>We can assure the United Rabbinate that the whole community will follow its activities with sympathy and interest.</p>
