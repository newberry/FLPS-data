   <p>The Jewish recruits of more or less Jewish communities will be sent to Camp Grant, Rockford. In every Jewish district, special committees were organized to arrange a nice farewell for the drafted Jewish young men.</p>
   <p>The 110 recruits of the 23rd district, eighty of which are Jews, will assemble in the Local Board, 12th Street and Ashland Avenue, this afternoon, where they will be addressed by county Judge Thomas Scully, Judge Bregstone, Dr. Jacob Gartenstein, chairman of this board, Alderman McNichol and others.</p>
   <p>The boys will be presented with nice gifts; they will then march in a body to the Illinois Central station, where they will board a train that will take them direct to the camp.</p>
   <p>At 8:30 tomorrow morning the 120 drafted boys of the 81st district (110 are Jewish), will assemble in the Herzel school; from there they will be <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1260.jpg" n="2"/>taken in automobiles to the Weiss-restaurant in the Loop, where they will be served a splendid dinner and be presented with gifts. At two in the afternoon they will march from the restaurant to the Grand Central station, 5th Avenue and Harrison Street, where they will board the train which will take them to the camp where they will be trained as soldiers of the National Army.</p>
   <p>The officers of the committee, who raised thousands of dollars towards this event for the boys of the 81st district, are Frank Samson, chairman; B. Hurwitz, treasurer; and Z. B. Komaiko, secretary.</p>
   <p>The drafted boys of the 44th district, the majority of which are Jews, will leave for Rockford Saturday afternoon, in military procession. The recruits will assemble at noon in the Marcy Bloom Center; from there they will march in a body to the Chicago and Alton station.</p>
   <p>All recruits that are now being taken into the service are of the second mobilization call; 40% of those drafted this week are being taken into active service.</p>
