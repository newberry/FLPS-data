   <p>In spite of the efforts of Congressmen Sabath and Siegel, who are aided by Congressman Box of Texas, to secure a change in the present three per cent immigration law which will operate with less hardships upon thousands of desirable immigrants who are at present barred from entering this country. The House Immigration Committee has recommended that the present law be extended for one year after it expires on June 30 next.</p>
   <p>In its report, the Committee points to the fact that during the past eight months, only 192,923 persons, including 1,769 temporarily admitted, entered, as compared with 566,343, admitted during the corresponding months of the year before. With these figures, the Committee observes, it is clear that the law restricts immigration to a marked degree.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1671.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The present immigration policy of this country is inspired by fanaticism. It encourages evasion and as long as it remains on the books, it will be evaded. The opponents of the present law keep pointing this out but it makes no impression.</p>
