   <p>Before our country entered the World War, the average American thought very little of soldiers. Everyone knew that of the several thousand regular soldiers in Uncle Sam's army, there were few who might be considered among the respectable or refined citizenry. On the contrary, the biggest percentage of them were lazy and good-for-nothing of whom little was heard, and less was thought. They were called mockingly, "tin soldiers". And little was actually expected of them. The state militia was composed of young men who were "taken in" by the brass buttons, the Friday night drills in the armory, the two weeks vacation at the government's expense. Of course they may have been respectable young men who were always ready to do their duty, and fight when the need arose. But the chances for a real war was very slim, hence the whole thing was given very little consideration.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1225.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At that time, every young man could enlist in the state militia and easily earn a "chin" [insignia of lieutenant], which was obtained of course through the votes of one's fellow militiamen. An individual who had the patience to serve two years in a regiment, could reach the rank of lieutenant. At that time--before the war--speaking with pride of the uniform, of the rank, or of the militia in general, was considered as a piece of egoism, a piece of swashbuckling.</p>
   <p>But times have changed since then. Everyone who knew even a little about the rules of military drill became a "big shot". He was given charge of teaching green recruits the science of the drill, etc. And these young men came in very handy; they accomplished miracles, it would have been practically impossible to organize the wonderful army which Uncle Sam organized in such a short time.</p>
   <p>Sam Goldman was a tailor; not an ordinary tailor, but an operator. And <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1226.jpg" n="3"/>he was not an ordinary operator, but a sample maker, and really an artist in his line. He was very proud of his trade. Furthermore, he was the only American-born employee in the shop. The rest of the dozens of employees were either foreigners or Americanized Jews, Poles, and Italians. "Bernstein, Arbeitman, and Cohen" was known throughout the country as an old, established firm with a fine reputation. Old Mr. Bernstein was particularly anxious to avoid anything untoward from happening in the shop or in the office, which might besmirch the good name that he had built for his firm.</p>
   <p>Bernstein himself, being a former tailor had little education. However, he saw to it that his son, Harry, received the best education and the best training. And when his son came home from the university with a degree, the old fellow took Harry into the shop as manager, and hoped that eventually he himself would be able to retire from the business.</p>
   <p>Harry, however, was the opposite of his father. He always wanted to show <pb n="4"/> that he was "boss", and at the first opportunity, fired anyone who did not carry out his orders quickly enough. Sam Goldman, or as he was sometimes called, "Yankee Sam", since he always boasted that he was a Yankee, refused to recognize Harry's authority, and went about his business as he saw fit. More than once, Harry attempted to oust him from the shop, and would have succeeded if his father had not interceded because he knew what a fine worker Sam was.</p>
   <p>Same was a steady worker, and was glad to work overtime in the evenings. But no money in the world would make him work overtime on one certain night of the week, and that was Friday night. It often happened that it was necessary to fill special orders which were to be sent into the country [districts] on Saturday, for a sale on Monday. This was naturally very important. Everyone remained Friday night to work overtime, but not Sam. When they would ask him why he was so stubborn, he would not answer. The fellows, however, found out. He belonged to the militia, and went <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1227.jpg" n="5"/>to drills in the armory every Friday.</p>
   <p>Then they began to tease him and to call him "tin soldier" instead of "Yankee Sam". Harry made a special point of hounding him and tried in every possible way to compel him to work overtime on Fridays. And finally they got into such an argument that Harry fired Sam--actually kicked him out of the shop. Sam obtained another job quite easily, and he was forgotten as though he had never existed.</p>
   <p>A couple of years later the war broke out and Harry enlisted in the army of Uncle Sam to do his duty for his country. After he was sworn in, he was sent to camp, together with many other recruits. Then they began to assign them to the departments where they were best suited. Harry was assigned to the kitchen as cook and waiter. He did not fit there, however, and was transferred to the cavalry.</p>
   <p>His first duty was to groom the lieutenant's horse, and to bring him at a <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1228.jpg" n="6"/>certain time to a certain place, to the lieutenant's camp. Harry found the work very hard. Since he was unaccustomed to working with horses, he was even kicked once by the lieutenant's horse while he was grooming him. When he finished, he brought the horse to the lieutenant and greeted the officer with the customary salute.</p>
   <p>The lieutenant was none other than "Yankee Sam" Goldman, whom Harry had treated so unfairly and had finally thrown out of the shop.</p>
   <p>"Hello Sam," Harry exclaimed joyfully.</p>
   <p>" 'Lieutenant,' if you please Private, you must know your place," Sam haughtily replied.</p>
   <p>Abashed, Harry lowered his eyes and two big tears appeared in them. His heart was filled with regret and remorse for the ill-treatment he had accorded Sam. And he felt that the latter was justified now in taking <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1229.jpg" n="7"/>revenge.</p>
   <p>But Sam did not let him brood. He slapped him on the back and said, "Harry, let bygones be bygones. Now we are both in the service of our country, and personal grudges have no place here. We must do our duty as befits loyal Americans, and thus bring honor to the Jewish name. I forgive you for all your ill-treatment."</p>
   <p>They embraced each other, kissed, and had a good cry.</p>
