<title level="a">LOCAL ZIONIST CELEBRATE NEXT THURSDAY EVENING. B. HORWICH TO BE GUEST OF HONOR AT "ZIONIST CONGRESS NIGHT"</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Next Thursday evening, September 8th, in the New Masonic Temple, the Zionist Organization of Chicago will celebrate the holding of the Fifteenth World Zionist Congress, which opened Tuesday at Basle, Switzerland.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor will be Mr. B. Horwich of Chicago, who has just returned from an extensive tour in Palestine. Mr. Horwich is a pioneer in the Zionist movement, and thirty years ago, together with Leon Zolotkoff, organized the first Zionist body in the United States. This was the Knights of Zion, which flourished for many years through out the Midwest, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1568.jpg" n="2"/>with headquarters at Chicago, and a decade ago was merged with the Eastern Zionist body to form the Zionist Organization of America.</p>
   <p>CONGRESS ADDRESSES AND PALESTINE REPORT.</p>
   <p>The program for next Thursday evening will include several of the foremost speakers in the community who will deliver adresses of welcome to Mr. Horwich and address the Congress. Mr. Horwich will present his report on present conditions and prospects in Palestine - a report eagerly awaited since his return, as he has long been known for his ability to observe and analyze, as well as for his open-eyed frankness in dealing with facts. His fellow-pioneer in Zionism, Mr. Zolotkoff, who is nationally known in Jewish literature and journalism, is also expected to be present, returning from the East especially for the occasion. Mr. Zolotkoff will speak on the Congress, the title of the address being, "The First Congress, and the Fifteenth."</p>
