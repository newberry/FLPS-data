   <p>Last week was Zionist week in Chicago. In many stores and offices, signs were displayed, Welcome Delegates. (Naturally these signs were printed by non-union men in a non-union shop.) Conferences, a ball, mass meetings, a banquet, and many speeches took a great deal of time away from the delegates to the nineteenth convention of the Knights of Zion, which was held at the well known Hebrew Institute, where well thinking workers don't go. The characters seen at this convention formed a study in itself.</p>
   <p>Rabbis with beautiful beards, or smoothly shaved; Jews who could speak no English and judges, who could not speak Jewish; progressives, former radicals, who are now reactionaries, reactionaries of the highest ranks; the very rich and the middle class...all these elements participated in the convention.</p>
   <p>Louis Brandeis, the new Messiah of Judaism, played the biggest part. Dr. S. Levin and Judge Mack, who just became a Zionist, said, "I cannot see how you can be a good American citizen and not be a Zionist at the same time."</p>
   <pb n="2"/>
   <p>Naturally a judge is not to be questioned; if the judge says it is so; then it must be so. He is not one of Uncle Sam's judges, who looks things up in the law books and is not to be questioned.</p>
   <p>Sunday night a mass meeting was held in which over three thousand Jews participated. The speakers, N. Kaplan, President, Attorney Brandeis, Levin, Judge Mack and other prominent Zionists tried to make the audience believe that redemption lies in Zionism.</p>
   <p>The delegates enjoyed the banquet very much. At two dollars and fifty cents a plate, or five dollars a couple, you can just imagine how many workers were present at that banquet, but the poor Zionists had to be satisfied with the meals that their wealthier brothers ate. S. Levin made an appeal for Zionism and large donations were given.</p>
   <p>The friends of Zionism also enjoyed themselves at a ball at the LaSalle Hotel.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0234.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A poor Jew, who received a ticket free, expressed his opinion in such a manner, that one dare not put it in black and white. The hall was full of half-naked women Zionists, and the men enjoyed this sweet dream immensely as well as the thought of eventual realities, when each one will be sitting under his own grape vines and his own fig trees; but in the meantime, they enjoyed the banquet and the ball, drinking wine and making merry, and not giving the least thought to the poor Zionists, who have not the means of coming to these places.</p>
   <p>It is plain to see that the Zionists are trying to hypnotize the masses. Mr. Nussbaum, who is versed in various languages, and Mr. Levin suggested the publication of a Hebrew Journal, claiming that Palestine and Hebrew keep Judaism together. Others suggested to teach the Jews English, so that the greatest Zionist newspaper, Der Folk (The People), might add an English page to its regular edition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0235.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>That is the way the poor Zionist is being dragged to various places and given work and hopes that never will materialize. In general, the convention was a success in its reactionary character and expression of antagonism to the laboring masses of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was a true bourgeois convention of people, with beautiful fantasies, high ideals and great pretentious, who do not for one moment deviate from capitalist principles, and bourgeois psychology.</p>
   <p>At this convention the Zionists, themselves, removed their own masks and were seen, in true form by their new vice-president, Mr. Laub.</p>
   <p>Enough said.</p>
