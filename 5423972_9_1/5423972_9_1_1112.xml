   <p>This congregation was first organized in 1867. Their first synagogue was on Superior Street, near Wells Street. Rev. A. Ollendorf, was the first minister. He remained with them for two years when he left for Quincy, Illinois, and the congregation remained for one year without a Rabbi.</p>
   <p>In 1870, Dr. Norden, the present minister, was called to the pulpit. In 1871, their temple was destroyed by the great fire. It was reorganized in 1873, and Rev. A. Norden was recalled from Europe. Since that time, they were worshipping in Unity Church, and lately in Grace Methodist Church.</p>
   <p>Three years ago, the ladies of the congregation arranged a grand fair at which they realized near $8,000. From this money the present lot was purchased at a cost of $5,100.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1113.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Last year, steps were taken to erect a temple, the first story of which is now completed, and was dedicated last Friday. Since the last nine years, they are worshipping according to minhag (custom) Einhorn. They have over one hundred members.</p>
   <p>On last Sunday, a special meeting was held for the purpose of selling the pews. Only sixty members were present and they purchased pews to the amount of $20,000, which speaks volumes for the generosity of these gentlemen.</p>
