   <p>The North Chicago Hebrew Congregation held its annual meeting and election of officers at the Ideal Club, Monday evening last. Several important matters were brought up, among which was the sale of the Temple, for which $20,000 has been offered. In case the sale is consummated, the Baptist Church on La Salle Street, will be utilized until the Congregation builds a new Temple.</p>
   <p>A change was made in the by-laws, admitting married men as members in Class B without being pew-holders, by paying the regular dues and five per cent, or the value of the pew they select. Young men will be admitted as members, for $16.00 per year, which entitles them to a seat and all privileges, except a vote on real estate matters.</p>
   <p>The Congregation is in a flourishing condition financially, and has ninety members, which is about the same number as last year.</p>
