   <p>Chicago Young Judaeans are going to have the time of their lives at the annual picnic to be held Sunday, August 14, at Harm's Woods.</p>
   <p>Jonas Meyers Heads Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>Because of the resignation of Meyer Handler as President of Chicago Young Judaea, Jonas Meyers was unanimously elected Chairman of the Executive Committee at a meeting of leaders held Tuesday evening, July 12, at the Young Judaean office. He is the leader of the famous Hakoah Juniors which produced Charles Saltzman and during the past year has done some fine work in Emek Yizrael, where he is supervisor. Due to his efforts, the number of clubs were doubled. Also Jonas was very active in the Young Judaean Magazine Campaign and aided greatly in making it a success. Jonas has some fine plans for the future of Chicago Young Judaea which he plans to put into execution at once so that when a new president is elected next Fall he will not have so much work to do.</p>
   <p>New Name For Leaders' Group.</p>
   <p>The Leaders' Group feels that its name is not indicative enough of its purpose and so the Executive Committee is planning on several new names to submit to <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1362.jpg" n="2"/>the leaders which will be more in accordance with the aims of the organization. Next Fall more stringent rules with regard to membership with this group will be enforced so that the Young Judaeans can be assured of the finest kind of leadership and supervision.</p>
