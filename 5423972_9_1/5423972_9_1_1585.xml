   <p>The Forward readers are well acquainted with the great aid that the "Haias" offers to thousands of immigrants and their friends in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The report of 1926 acknowledges every assertion that is made about the good work of the "Haias" in Chicago. We herein give, in brief, condensed form of the report:</p>
   <p>Three thousand, three hundred and twenty-four (3,324) people have called at the office, receiving information and counsel as what to do for their friends.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1586.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Two hundred and twenty-five (225) petitions were sent to Washington; 135 European affidavits were filed for immigrants; 94 affidavits for Ellis Island; 138 relatives were located for immigrants; 659 money transmissions were made through the "Haias" office reaching the sum of $24,401; 175 telegrams were cabled to Ellis Island, to Washington and to Rabbis; 49 special affidavits were filled out in the "Haias" office; 108 immigrants were greeted in Chicago and directed to their destination; 1,355 persons were supported in the "Haias" home in 1926; 16,355 meals were served.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adoph Kapland, president of the Jewish Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society pointed out, in his report of the "Haias" that steps should be taken to approach individuals, who are able to contribute a certain sum annually, in order to continue the work of helping the unfortunate poor immigrants.</p>
