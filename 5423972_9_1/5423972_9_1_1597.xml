   <p>Dr. Chaim Weitzman, president of the Zionist organization declared it is up to the American Jews to save Palestine from its present crisis.</p>
   <p>What crisis? We, here in America, have as yet not heard of a crisis in Palestine. On the contrary here in America, heard about a great prosperity in Palestine. Here we were told that Palestine today is the only country in the world where unemployment does not exist. We were told of a shortage of money in Palestine, but that is nothing new. Was there ever a time that Palestine did have money? And when was Palestine not in need of money?</p>
   <p>There is a mistake somewhere, it is one of the two: there was a mistake in the report of prosperity in Palestine, or Dr. Weitzman is mistaken about the crisis in Palestine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1598.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Palestine has no income from industrial profits, their only income is the money raised by the Zionist organization. All the economic laws that can be applied to all other countries, cannot be applied in Palestine. It is predicted that unemployment is caused by the shortage of money. So there is both unemployment and shortage of money, both exist in Palestine.</p>
