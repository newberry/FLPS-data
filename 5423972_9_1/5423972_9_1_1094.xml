<title level="a">ZION CONGREGATION DR. SAMUEL SALE CALLED TO MINISTER MAGNIFICENT PENSION OF DR. B. FELSENTHA.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The regular annual meeting was held by Zion Congregation last evening at the Vestry rooms of their temple. A full meeting was in attendance...An important feature in the budget was the salary for the rabbinical incumbent (Dr. B. Felsenthal,) which was fixed at $2,200 per annum unless he should be pentioned, or a successor to assume the position of rabbi. Great unanimity and an excellent disposition were evinced by the members in behalf of Dr. Felsenthal, who had well and faithfully served Zion Congregation for the past twenty-two years. Mr. Edward Rubovits read the following resolutions as one of the Board of Directors</p>
   <p>Whereas the time has come when it become necessary for Zion Congregation to have an English speaking minister in order to satisfy the demands of a large majority of its members, and whereas Zion Congregation deem it impractical to engage an associate minister, and whereas Zion Congregation holds its present <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1095.jpg" n="2"/>Minister, Dr. B. Felsenthal, in the highest esteem on account of his great learning and goodness and recognize his valuable services rendered this congregation during the past twenty-two years;</p>
   <p>Therefore:</p>
   <p>Resolved, to retire Dr. B. Felsenthal on a pension of $1,500,00 per annum during his natural life, payable quarterly.</p>
   <p>Resolved, to elect another minister who is worthy to succeed Dr. B. Felsenthal and who will be fully able to satisfy the timely demands of Zion Congregation.</p>
   <p>Resolved, that the pension of Dr. B. Felsenthal go into effect as soon as the newly elected Rabbi assumes his position.</p>
   <p>Some lengthy discussion ensued upon the amount of pension, i. e. that $1,500.00 was an inadequate amount, it was then unanimously adopted that $1,800.00 be the amount.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1096.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Henry Greenbaum, made the motion that Rev. Samuel Sale now of Anshe Maariv Congregation be elected as Rabbi of Zion Congregation at a salary of $4,000.00 per annum, subject to the action and approval of his congregation. This was almost unanimously accepted and carried.</p>
