   <p>PALESTINIAN RALLY.</p>
   <p>The curiosity of the hundreds of the Young Judaeans, who have been awaiting the Palestinian Rally, will soon be satisfied. On Sunday afternoon at the Northwest Jewish People's Institute, 1243 North Wood Street, the secret will be let out. The editor after much persuasion, was let in on the secret, but she has sworn not to give it away.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1326.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, the secret is a nice one and the Young Judaeans will enjoy it. Just see that your leader gets you there and be on time as the program starts promptly at 2:30 p. m. After the rally is over the leaders will be entertained by the members of the B'nai Yehuda and Junior Dagania clubs and they are therefore requested to remain after the program is over. Remember the day, Sunday, February 12; the place, the Northwest Jewish People's Institute, and be prepared for one of the most entertaining events of the year.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1327.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>DEBATING LEAGUE.</p>
   <p>Are girls better debaters then boys? Is America destined to become the greatest Jewish educational center in the world? What center will have the honor of holding in its midst a champion debating team? Who will win the silver loving cup? All these questions will be answered next Sunday at the Palestinian rally, when the Beth Gan girls led by Bertha Degan, and the Ain Harod boys led by Sidney Acberman, will debate in the final round of the intermediate league.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1328.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Miss Degan and the other members of the clubs at Beth Itzchok are certain the girls will carry away the honors. The members of the Emek and Mr. Aikerman are just as certain that the honors will fall to the boys. It doesn't matter for whom you are rooting, the urgent item is to be there. It has taken several weeks to go through the elimination contests but now everyone is ready for the climax. Be sure to be present.</p>
   <p>REUNION DANCE.</p>
   <p>Former Young Judaeans and present workers and friends are looking forward with great eagerness to the evening of Saturday, February 18, for it is on that evening that Chicago's reunion dance will be held. The dance will be entirely informal and is not a couple affair. It will be held in the South Ball Room of the Stevens Hotel.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1329.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>THE CHECKER TOURNAMENT.</p>
   <p>One of the features of the Palestinian rally this week will be a Checker Tournament. The tournament will be divided into divisions: Senior and Junior, and each district is to have a representative in each division try out for honors. Suitable awards will be made to the winning team in each district.</p>
   <p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE.</p>
   <p>At the rally also, this Sunday, an additional representative from Chicago to the National Executive Committee will be selected.</p>

   <p>SCRAP-BOOKS.</p>
   <p>Lena Brodsky, in charge of the Palestinian rally has requested that all clubs desiring to display their scrap-books can bring them along on February 12th.</p>
   <p>NATIONAL REGISTRATION.</p>
   <p>Revised hand-books, with very interesting information, have been received by all registered Young Judaeans; together with a membership card. If you have not received one of these, your club has not registered and you cannot participate in any of these events.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1331.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>MID-WEST CONFERENCE.</p>
   <p>Reservations have already been received from St. Louis, Denver and Cincinnati for the Mid-Western Conference to be held in Chicago February 18, and 19. Many more cities expect to sent delegates. Chicago will do its best to be a cheerful host for these visitors when they arrive.</p>
   <p>Chicago appreciates the unusal honor which has been awarded to it in making the conderence, and can assure the visitors that they will not be disappointed. All leaders and workers are asked to be present at the various sessions. A registration fee of one dollar will be charged.</p>

   <p>David Hirsch of the Zionist office has donated another book-case. All we need now is some additional material. Miss Ada Quiat has collected over forty dollars and more is to come. All books contributed are endorsed with the donor's name, and a seal is placed in them. Books in English, Yiddish and Hebrew are welcome. Send them to Sam Strauss, Executive Secretary, 155 N. Clark Street.</p>
   <p>Louis Agranat has brought up a plan which Chicago Young Judaea is to follow in honoring Mr. Strauss. An album will be purchased and in this album will be inscribed the names of all the Young Judaeans in Chicago. Clubs are asked to see that their members are present at the next meeting or two, so that everyone may have an opportunity to honor Mr. Strauss.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1336.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>GALILEE.</p>
   <p>The boys of the Macanaim Club have made arm bands for each member. These bands are very attractive, being made with a blue background and white letters. The club boasts a membership of nineteen. The checker team, which is to represent the North Side at the rally, is practicing diligently for the championship of the city. The team consists of Emanuel Julius, Seymour Simon and Sigmund Deutch. Lester Carmel is the leader.</p>
