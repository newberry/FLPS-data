   <p>The congregation Khilas Jacob Anshe Drohitsin is having a big parade before moving into their new synagogue, at noon today. The congregation recently bought the French Evangelist Church on Center street, and have remodeled the church into a modern synagogue.</p>
   <p>The synagogue now is one of the prettiest in the city, and the officers of the congregation deserve much credit for their accomplishment. The synagogue is located in the heart of a Jewish neighborhood, and it is requested of all Jewish citizens in all parts of the city to help us celebrate the dedication of our new synagogue.</p>
   <p>A grand parade will start at noon today from the old synagogue, 19 O'Brien street, and with great pomp, music, etc. the Jews will carry the holy scrolls and sacred books through the different streets leading to their new place of worship, which is located on Center street near Taylor street. Everybody is invited to come to take part in this dedication of our new synagogue.</p>
