   <p>Leaders of conservative Judaism in Chicago will gather today to discuss and accept plans for a merging of forces; these plans will be presented by the committees that formulated them. Today it will be decided whether the conservative Jews of Chicago are ready for the great movement they desire to make--an alliance of all their forces--or if they are not yet ready, are still condemned to live as in the wilderness.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm with which the plan for an alliance of all conservative forces in Chicago was received, proves however that the Chicago Jews are ripe for this great historical step which can effect great progress in the life of all of American Jewry. Second to New York, Chicago is the largest Jewish center in America. Chicago is the greatest Jewish center in the Middle West. Whatever Chicago Jews do to improve Jewish public life will certainly be admired by <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0809.jpg" n="2"/>other large Jewish centers in America. Should the highly important plans be carried out in a spirit of loyalty to principles and true democracy, the other Jewish centers in America will follow Chicago and in this way the movement which will have had its start in Chicago will spread throughout America and will bring new active forces to American Jewry.</p>
   <p>We are outlining these perspectives for Chicago Jews with the aim that they may realize that what they do today not only concerns Chicago Jewry, but the entire American Jewry as well.</p>
   <p>The reformed Jews have hitherto claimed that the orthodox Jews have no talent for organizing and are helpless therefore, although they form the largest majority of American Jewry. We have never taken this assertion seriously. We see that the orthodox Jews have built great and beautiful institutions which are in existence. We see that the great orthodox congregations in the country are solid and powerful, and we believe that as soon as the orthodox Jews recognize the absolute necessity of uniting their forces, they will show sufficient <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0810.jpg" n="3"/>talent to effect this unity.</p>
   <p>What is most important for the orthodox Jews of Chicago to understand is that now is not the time to discuss details and particulars. The only thing necessary now is to agree on certain principles and aims. Time will provide enough work for the new organization, more than enough. Everything must be built anew, for so much elementary work has to be done.</p>
   <p>Jewish education does not enter into more than thirty-five thousand Jewish homes in Chicago. Jewish families, therefore, grow up in ignorance, and it is the duty of the united orthodox Jewry of Chicago to put an end to this deplorable condition. Chicago, like many other Jewish communities of the Middle West, feels the lack of Hebrew teachers. Chicago, as the center of Jewish orthodoxy in the Middle West, must undertake the work at once, the sacred work of training Hebrew teachers. Even though Chicago is as large a city as it is, it has no Beth Din (Jewish religious court), and whenever two Jews have the slightest <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0811.jpg" n="4"/>disagreement between themselves, they immediately go to a city court. Chicago courts are always overfilled with Jewish customers. This disgrace could be easily averted by a well-organized Beth Din, composed of the Chicago rabbinate.</p>
   <p>The grown youth of fourteen and fifteen years of age has no center for its activities, and the result is that those who did receive something of a Jewish education in a Talmud Torah (Hebrew school) or private Cheder (private Hebrew school) immediately forget it upon leaving the Talmud Torah. They enter into a different atmosphere where they forget the last bit of their Judaism. For this youth the new organization must provide, and must see that it shall lean toward Judaism and shall become capable of taking over the great Jewish task in the future.</p>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to say that the organization of the union of orthodox Jews in Chicago in taking over all of the Jewish public work--which must be done if Judaism is to survive and have a future--must consider itself, as it must be considered by others to be the Jewish Kehilah (community) of Chicago. A group <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0812.jpg" n="5"/>must have a specific name, so as not to be confused with other groups. A Kehilah needs no special name for there can be only one Kehilah in a city. The moment a Kehilah adopts a special name it ceases to be a Kehilah and falls into the category of a group. Adopting a special name, the Kehilah acknowledges the fact that similar organizations may exist and perform similar work. What this can lead to, must be clear to everyone.</p>
   <p>The new organization of the orthodox forces in Chicago should be known by its work and not by its name. It should be the Kehilah of Chicago, no more nor less. The Jewish Kehilahs of Wilmo Warsaw, Minsk, Pinsk, Paris, Vienna or Berlin also have no special names. They are the Jewish Kehilahs of those cities and are known as such.</p>
   <p>Every prepresentative of the one hundred and twenty-eight Jewish orthodox congregations in Chicago should come today to the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah to assist in the laying of the foundation for the great Jewish Kehilah of Chicago.</p>
