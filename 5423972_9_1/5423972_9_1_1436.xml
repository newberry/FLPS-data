   <p>What the Maccabees School is to the former Hebrew instruction given by us, the Young Judea is to what formerly was our Sunday School. The Young Judea movement is nation wide and has branches in every city of the country; in fact, in our own city there are a number of branches, of which we are one. There is a branch in the Lawndale District and one on the Northwest Side, one on the South Side, and several others. The Institute Judea is quite a movement. It offers instruction in Jewish history and in Jewish traditions.</p>
   <p>The Festival Club, which the Institute conducted for a number of years and which prepared for the celebration of festivals on Jewish holidays as well as on legal holidays, has been turned over to the Young Judea and, through that club, all celebrations are now given. The plays produced are purely of a historical character, dealing with the portrayal of the events for <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1437.jpg" n="2"/>which the holiday is being celebrated. Where allegorical or symbolic figures are introduced, the greatest care is taken that they correspond with and typify only such conceptions as are in keeping with the Jewish conceptions of folk lore. The celebrations are usually given for Purim, Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles (better known as Succoth), Log B'omer, etc.</p>
