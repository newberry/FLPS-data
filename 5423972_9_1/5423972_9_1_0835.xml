   <p>The Rabbinical Association of America has undertaken an important task: the issuance of a new edition of the Babylonian Talmud. Contributions for this undertaking have already been received from many prosperous, Orthodox Jews in the Chicago vicinity and in New York. The total sum of sixty thousand dollars has already been received.</p>
   <p>However, before the project can be completed an even larger sum of money will be necessary. In fact, about a quarter-of-a-million dollars will be needed. The Rabbinical Association, therefore, appeals to the Jewish community of Chicago and to the Jews living in the Middle West (through the medium of the Courier) to respond generously to the new drive for funds. The Association is certain that all Jews will recognize the necessity of issuing a new edition of the Talmud and will follow the example of those who have <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0836.jpg" n="2"/>already contributed.</p>
   <p>The war has obliterated many aspects of Jewish culture. It is our duty to reconstruct our spiritual ruins in no less a degree than our material ruins. Jews of Poland and Russia, suffering from persecution, hunger and want, still do not neglect their spiritual needs. They establish their Talmud Torahs and their theological institutions and strive, feeble though the effort be because of the circumstances, to perpetuate the words of the Torah. Their vital concern is to uphold the torch of Judaism.</p>
   <p>These unfortunate Jews were the first to call the attention of the Orthodox rabbis to the fact that the Jewish printing establishments in the Russian Empire were being burnt. The Rabbinical Association received heart-rending letters from Jewish communities in Russia requesting that books be sent to them so <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0837.jpg" n="3"/>that the religious schools could be reopened. Similar letters from Palestine were received indicating a great scarcity of books. Frequently ten students were required to use one half-torn Talmud. Among the rabbis in Chicago who received letters from Russia and Palestine bearing these sad tidings were Rabbis Zvi Simon Album and Ephraim Epstein. These letters, gathered at the offices of the Association in New York, induced the Orthodox rabbis in this country to unite in bringing out a new edition of the Talmud.</p>
   <p>Well-known local rabbis have issued the following statement:</p>
   <p>In undertaking to issue a new edition of the Talmud the Rabbinical Association has taken upon itself one of the most sacred duties devolving upon the clergy. Every Jew, who in any way feels connected to Judaism, and who is ready to acknowledge that the Talmud is the very essence of our religion--that without the Talmud there is no Judaism--must assume as his sacred duty the task of gathering the necessary amount of money to enable the Association to issue a new edition of the Talmud. Every conscientious</p>
