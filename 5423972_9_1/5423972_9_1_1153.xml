   <p>The North Side is the seat of war at this time. Sometime ago about thirty gentlemen went together and organized a congregation to be known under the name of Congregation Emanu-el. They adopted "Minhag America" (American custom) and rented a hall for temporary services.</p>
   <p>While we ought to be glad and happy to see the Israelites of Chicago wake up and give some signs of their interest in Judaism, still our joy is not complete, for it is marred and disturbed by the way the work for the holy cause is inaugurated. Our brethren in Chicago do not try to open schools for the children of the poor Israelites. O, No, they start new Congregations, as though we had not enough temples in the city. The fact is that we have here too many congregations and only two of them are able to enjoy an easy existence. One has built a fine temple, but cannot afford to keep a minister, etc.</p>
   <p>About the same time a number of Israelites, also on the North Side, organized a new congregation with Minhag Polen (Polish custom) - (they have already <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1154.jpg" n="2"/>erected a synagogue which is to be dedicated next Sunday). An attempt was made by the better elements of these two chevras (groups) to unite in one congregation on a sound basis. Committees were appointed but unfortunately could not agree (the terrible Minhagin were the stumbling blocks) and Chicago is going to have two more congregations.</p>
