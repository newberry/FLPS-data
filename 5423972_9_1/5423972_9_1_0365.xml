  <body>
   <p>At the recent meeting of the Executive Kehillah, held under the chairmanship of A. Goldblatt, president; the following resolutions were adopted:</p>
   <p>1. Stating the evils of the "mushroom synagogues"which spring up in converted dance balls just before the High Holidays, the Executive resolved that "The Kehillah use all legitimate means to eradicate this plague and to impress upon the public the realization of the inherent ugliness of the use of such places of worship during the most sacred days of the year."</p>
   <p>2. Stating the needs of the Yeshivoth in Europe and Palestine and calling attention to the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth campaign, the Executive resolved "to assist the Vaad in launching the campaign and in bringing it to a successful fulfillment, and that in every Chicago synagogue an appeal should be made for the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth during the High Holidays."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0366.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. Stating the old custom of affixing Jewish National Fund stamps to congregation tickets for the High Holidays, the Executive resolved "That the Kehillah help realize the sacred aim of recovering Palestine for the Jewish people by requesting each synagogue to appoint a committee whose duty it shall be to see that every High Holiday ticket sold bears a J. N. F. stamp."</p>
   <p>4. Stating that problems have arisen in regard to poultry Shechitah which should be given immediate attention, the Executive resolved "That a conference be called of the Executive of the Kehillah, representatives of the rabbis and leaders of the Shochtim Union to take up these questions and to improve the situation of poultry Shechitah in Chicago."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0367.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>5. Stating that the Jewish Charities of Chicago give a considerable subsidy for educational purposes each year, but do not contribute to the twenty-two United Talmud Torahs of Chicago, situated mostly in the poorer neighborhoods, the Executive resolved that "The Kehillah petition the Jewish Charities of Chicago to abolish the injustice being done the twenty-two United Talmud Torahs and to ameliorate their grave condition by including these strongholds of Jewish elementary education in their subsidy."</p>

   <p>AVOID THE "MUSHROOM SYNAGOGUES".</p>
   <p>To the Jews of Chicago: We are now on the threshold of the High Holidays, the most sacred days on the Jewish calendar, which mark the renaissance of the religious instinct dormant in the heart of every Jew. During these sacred days, the Jew is truly lifted above his prosaic daily self; purified by penance and exalted by meditation and prayer, he faces his God with a clear conscience and emerges reconsecrated and rededicated for a new year of noble life.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, even these sacred days are not entirely free from the spirit of self-gain. Through the cupidity of certain grasping individuals, dance halls and gambling dens are converted overnight into synagogues and are arrogantly proclaimed the House of God, to which the Jew is lured, with economy as the bait, to come to pour out his heart in prayer for a happy New Year.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0369.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>What a grotesque mockery! Can the walls of such places, temporarily abandoned from the worship of Mammon, possibly offer shelter to the "Shechinan," the Divine Glory? Can the Jewish heart draw inspiration from such surroundings, which profane the very spirit of worship and reverence? Beyond the incalculable harm which these "mushroom synagogues" bring to the Jewish soul, they constitute a virtual menace to the established synagogues, the true houses of worship. Consecrated to the spiritual needs of the Jewish community, the true synagogues know no "season" of service - every day in the year they nobly wait upon the daily needs of the Jew, from the cradle to the grave, in their religious, educational and charitable capacities. Every day in the year the synagogues are occupied with prayer and Torah study, with the practice of deeds of charity; they celebrate with the Jew his happy occasions, the Bar Mitzvah confirmations and weddings, and sorrow with him on his sad ones, the memorial services and the daily prayers of the Kaddish.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0370.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is indeed unfortunate that these synagogues, for the two thousand years of Diaspora the very pillars of our faith, should be threatened by the annual appearance of "muchroom synagogues", which are operated solely for gain only three days in the year, and which give no thought to the dignity and one-inspiring majesty of the services of Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur. We therefore appeal to you, the loyal and right-thinking Jews of Chicago, to help us exterminate this plague which is afflicting the High Holiday spirit. Shun the "mushroom synagogues" - attend the High Holiday services in an established synagogue, where the "Shechinah" dwells the year round, where the very walls are changed with the echoes of prayer and Torah study. Every Jew can afford to attend a real synagogue his year, for all synagogues are offering seats at amazingly moderate prices.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0371.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>We insist at the same time that the leaders of the synagogues, whose cause we are pleading, do not abet the "mushroom synagogues" by loaning or renting them the Sacred Scrolls of the Law or other regalia for use during the Holiday season.</p>
   <p>We pray that your support of the real houses of worship during the High Holidays will invoke upon you and yours the benediction of a happy and prosperous New Year, a year which will see the glorious return of Israel to Zion and Jerusalem.</p>
