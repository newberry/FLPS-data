   <p>Zionists Organize State League.</p>
   <p>On Sunday September 17, a conference of various Zionist organizations was held in the Social Hall of the Institute, and an Illinois State Zionist League was formed. The league was formed in accordance with the plan of the National Federation of Zionist, to join organizations throughout the country, either wholly or partly given to the cause of Zionism, into state bodies. The Illinois League is modelled closely after that of Wisconsin which, though recently organized has proven highly successful.</p>
   <p>About one-hundred delegates and others have attended the business sessions of the conference. More than a score of gates, half a dozen of them down-state organizations, were represented. In two sessions lasting about two hours each, a permanent constitution was drafted and adopted, permanent officers were elected and installed, the scope and proposed activities of the new organizations were outlined by Leon Zolotkoff, chairman of the executive committee of Knights of Zion and other sponsors of the league.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0246.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Leon Zolotkoff explained that the league was formed principally for propaganda work and that it would undertake no activities which might bring various society members into conflict or in any way interfere with their affiliations outside of the league. The Knights of Zion undertook to finance the league for the first six months at least. After that the governing body will devise a method of obtaining financial support.</p>
