   <p>A telegram from New York, published in last Friday's Courier, discloses that the National Labor Committee consisting of Socialists and labor delegates, and which is chiefly centered around the Forward, has determined not to participate in the Jewish Congress. Two reasons are given to justify this action:</p>
   <p>1.. The election system is not satisfactory.</p>
   <p>2.. The Russian Revolution precludes the main task of the Congress, viz., the liberation of the Jews.</p>
   <p>Anybody can readily see that this reasoning is absurd. The first reason, that the election system is not satisfactory, is superfluous if the second one is substantial. Granting that the Russian Revolution makes the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0180.jpg" n="2"/>Congress unnecessary, it does not mean that the election system is not satisfactory. This is like the young man who, unable to get married due to financial circumstances, says that he decided not to marry because the bride had a freckle on her nose.</p>
   <p>The second reason, that the Revolution obviated the necessity of the Jewish Congress by granting equal rights to Jews, is not a satisfactory one, because the greater half of the six or seven million Jews in Russia are so completely ruined as to make indispensable a great amount of work among them. Furthermore, in other countries there are Jews who are not as yet free. And even if the Congress has nothing else to accomplish, why don't the leaders of the Jewish socialists wait until it declares so itself?</p>
   <p>However, the present action of the Socialist leaders in entirely refusing to take active part in the Jewish Congress, is the most logical things they have ever done in connection with it. To begin with, they were illogical <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0181.jpg" n="3"/>when they first participated in the affairs of the Congress.</p>
   <p>The position that the old heretic, the Forward's guard, has always taken, is that they are not Jews, but merely Jewish-speaking Socialists. They never recognized anything in common with the Jews,-not race,-not religion,-not historical consciousness,-not a common hope for the future of the Jew, positively nothing, except socialism. A Jew belonging to their clique is just a comrade, his Jewish descent being only an accident.</p>
   <p>With such attitude toward Jews from the very beginning, they should not have taken a hand in a movement supported by Jews and sponsored by one of their organizations. Of course, they could not have done it, were it not that the present times react like the fire of chemists on various human groups. The basis of affinity and friendship, is more effective now than in peace time. Even the segregated and estranged Jew is beginning to pense this. The instinct of commonalty characteristic of their race is not yet entirely <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0182.jpg" n="4"/>extinguished. By the way, a portion of them think that if they unite with the assimilated bourgeoisie, they will deal a death-blow to the Jewish Congress movement. This caused them to join this movement.</p>
   <p>But now they have discovered that the "bourgeoisie" is not as assimilatively inclined as it pretended to be in the beginning and, in addition to this, non-Jews are now speaking in favor of the official recognition of a Jewish nation. As was explained before, the Jewish Congress, regardless of any element composing it, will have to give attention to this phenomenon. In other words, it will actually have to deal with Jewish problems. Truthfully speaking, where do such people, claiming they are no Jews but merely Jewish speaking socialists, fit into this congress?</p>
   <p>They have no other way out but to withdraw, and this they have done.</p>
   <p>Will the movement lose anything by this? Nothing we hope. Sound Jewish socialism will be well represented through the Poale Zion and the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0183.jpg" n="5"/>National workers, and the Congress will be rid of an element which can only obstruct organized Jewish movements.</p>
