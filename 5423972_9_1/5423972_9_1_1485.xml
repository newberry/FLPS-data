   <p>It has long been contended by the Zionist leaders that the anomalous position of Hadassah had enabled that organization to retain its full autonomy, and at the same time to meddle at will with the affairs of the Zionist Organization of America. After a bitter fight, a subcommittee of Hadassah and Mr. Rothenberg worked out a solution of the problem, which was adopted by the convention after a heated debate.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1486.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>THE NEW AGREEMENT.</p>
   <p>The new understanding between the two organizations is featured by the following points:</p>
   <p>1. There shall be a joint standing committee between Hadassah and the Zionist Organization of America for joint work.</p>
   <p>2. Hadassah shall be entitled to a small representation in the Zionist convention.</p>
   <p>3. Hadassah shall pay $7,500 a year to the Zionist organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1487.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>4. Hadassah shall pay its Shekel Tax directly to the World Zionist Organization.</p>
   <p>5. Women may be admitted to the Zionist Organization of America, but the Hadassah shall be the official Women's Zionist Organization of America.</p>

   <p>OLD OFFICERS RE-ELECTED.</p>
   <p>At the business session of Tuesday, all of the old officers were re-elected for the coming year. Miss Henrietta Szold of Jerusalem is the honorary president; Mrs. Samuel V. Halperin of Brooklyn remains as president; Mrs. Robert Szold, Miss Pearl Franklin, Mrs. David Greenberg and Mrs. Henry Harris are vice president; Mrs. Samuel J. Rosenson, treasurer; and Mrs. M. P. Epstein, secretary.</p>

   <p>Resolutions adopted included one for a counter-boycott of Germany as an answer to the German boycott of Jews.</p>
   <p>SEEKS HOSPITAL FUNDS.</p>
   <p>A nationwide campaign to raise $200,000 for the building and maintenance of Hadassah University Hospital and a graduate medical school in Jerusalem was launched, following a report by Mrs. Halperin, who stated that the situation of German physicians made this step imperative.</p>
   <p>Hadassah, with a membership of 40,000 distributed throughout thirty-six states, Mrs. Halperin stated, was faced by the "unthinkable, unbelievable tragedy of the savage attack upon a loyal and devoted section of its own citizenry by the present Hitler leaders"</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1490.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Pledges of $30,000 were made by various chapters. These included Boston, $10,000; Chicago, $10,000; lower New York region, $5,000; Detroit $3,000 and smaller sums.</p>
   <p>Support for the campaign was pledged by the American Jewish physicians' committee, which informed the convention that Dr. S. Goldwater, former health commissioner of New York City, had consented to go to Palestine to help draft plans for the hospital.</p>
