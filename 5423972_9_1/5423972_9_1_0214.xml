   <p>The huge hall of the West Side Auditorium was over-run with people last evening at the Congress mass-meeting. It is estimated that more than a thousand came to hear well-known speakers discuss the present situation in the Congress movement, and explain the reasons for the split at the Workers Conference of last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Attorney Savitsky, told why the minority were forced to leave the convention hall. The minority wanted peace, but the majority, under the command of a dictator, [made it impossible for them to remain] with those who sought to disrupt the work of the Jewish Congress. The first speaker, Mr. William Nathan-son, stated that the majority are not in favor of a Congress. He urged all workers, both Socialists and Anarchists, to [stop their factional quarrel and unite] at the present critical moment in support of the Jewish Congress - to work together with all Jews toward the great goal of saving the Jewish race from decimation.</p>
   <p>Jacob Grossberg enumerated the attempts which have been made to unite all Jews in <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0215.jpg" n="2"/>the Congress movement and showed to what extent the work has been successful. Only a handful stand aloof, but he is certain that all will eventually join the movement. However even if this does not happen, it will not be a drawback. A Jewish Congress will be held. Dr. Max Dolnick spoke in the same view. D. Aberson showed that the minority who sense the seriousness of the present moment were forced to separate from the majority who are playing "politics."</p>
   <p>The principal speakers were Pinchas Ruttenberg and Dr. Chaim Zitlowsky. Both speakers told how the workers were called to the conference, [and of their eager response to this summons to] save the Jewish race. They claimed that had it not been for the demagogues, the entire Jewish working class would now stand united, with the remainder of the Jewish people in support of the Congress.</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting a membership appeal was made. Five hundred, [most of whom were workers] signed up with the new organization of the minority group.</p>
   <p>The following resolution was adopted at the mass-meeting!</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0216.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"This meeting approves the withdrawal of the minority from the Middle Western Labor Conference, and indorses its program to organize the Jewish working class for constructive work for the Congress and to prepare the working masses for the election of suitable delegates to it.</p>
   <p>"The meeting invites the above-mentioned executives to work with the Congress Executive Committee and to convoke, as soon as possible, a truly representative labor conference, independent of the National Labor Committee of New York."</p>
   <p>The mass-meeting was a great demonstration in support of the Labor Conference minority and a sign that the Chicago Jewry of all classes want a Jewish Congress.</p>
