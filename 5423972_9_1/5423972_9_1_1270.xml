<title level="a">UNVEILING OF MEISENBERG'S MONUMENT HALTED</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, the Meisenberg family halted the ceremony of the unveiling of the monument of Sam Meisenberg, the Jewish sailor from Chicago who was killed by Mexicans when an American expedition besieged Veracruz. The Order of the Western Star buried the hero in the Waldheim Cemetery, and established a special fund by taxing all its members for the purpose of erecting a monument.</p>
   <p>The ceremony was to take place yesterday afternoon, and a large crowd had gathered. But before the chairman had time to say anything, the Meisenberg family created a disturbance. Evidently, the Meisenbergs weren't even invited to the ceremony; nevertheless, they came and asked for a certain amount of money that the Order had allegedly promised them. They threatened that they would not permit the monument to be unveiled unless they got the money. The Meisenbergs won, and the ceremony was not performed.</p>
   <p>Edward, brother of the dead sailor, himself an ex-soldier, acted as spokesman <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1271.jpg" n="2"/>for the Meisenbergs. Before he started to speak, he turned over his watch to his mother, indicating that he was ready to use his fists, if necessary. This is what he said:</p>
   <p>"I demand that no public demonstration take place here, because it is only an advertising scheme of the Independent Order of the Western Star. I will not permit the ceremony to continue, and as an ex-soldier I will use my physical strength to enforce my demand."</p>
   <p>The crowd became excited as Eddie looked for the officers of the Order. When he found them, he said: "Your Order offered my parents the grave where my brother lies at rest. It was agreed that the Order should tax its members, and half of the proceeds were to go toward a monument and the other half, to my parents. You collected $1400 and my parents haven't received a cent. You did not even invite us to the dedication. You shall not exploit my brother's grave for an advertising scheme. The dedication will not be held and you can tell this to your members who have gathered here."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1272.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The crowd left and only the Meisenbergs remained at the grave. The officers of the Order, the ex-Grand Master, Nathan M. Brenner, the secretary, I. Shapiro, and Joseph Swartz denied Edward's assertion that the Order had promised to give the Meisenberg family any money.</p>
