   <p>Reports from the thirty leading cities of the United States, including New York, on the voting for delegates for the 18th World Zionist Congress to be held this year in Prague, Czechoslovakia, showed a smashing victory for the Poale Zion-Zeire Zion group of the Zionist movement. In a total vote of 15,529 votes tabulated from the thirty cities, the Poale Zion-Zeire Zion gathered 7,806.</p>
   <p>The Mizrachi ran second with 3,418 while the combined vote of the general Zionists and the Hadassah was only 3,047. The Brith Trumpeldor-Revisionists received 857 votes, and the Democratic-Revisionists got 405 votes.</p>

   <p>Only 2,080 votes were cast by shekel-payers in Chicago at the election last Sunday for delegates to the World Zionist Congress this August. The Poale Zion-Zeire Zion led with 838 votes for their list, followed by the Mizrachi with 644 votes, the General Zionists and Hadassah combined with 328 votes, and the Revisionists with 126 votes.</p>
   <p>The vote of the combined General Zionists and Hadassah was a great disappointment, as they had been expected to head the list, and instead came out a very bad third. The Poale Zion-Zeire Zion received active support from the Pioneer Women and the Worker's Organizations.</p>
