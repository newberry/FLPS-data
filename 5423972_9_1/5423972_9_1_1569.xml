   <p>From time to time the readers of this column have read notices announcing various activities conducted by the Gordonians. Undoubtedly the Gordonians have a large public who follow with interest every step taken by them. But there still remains that large majority which is ignorant of our ideals if not of our very existence.</p>
   <p>The "Gordonians" is a junior organization of the Zionist Labor Party - Hitachduth Zeire Zion. The ideals of this order have been recently transplanted to this continent from the old world, and the extent of its popularity may be judged from the fact that the branches now spread their wings over the entire United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that the organization is so young and no definite platform has been decided upon as yet, however, a convention, the first of its kind, is to take place this Fall at which a definite plan for future activities will be outlined. The principle underlying the existence of the Gordonians is to bring up the youth in a Jewish nationalistic spirit and to develop practical Zionists out of them. To achieve this end the Gordonians participate in various <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1570.jpg" n="2"/>activities. The meetings are conducted on the basis of half business and half cultural programs. A tag-day, whether it be for the Jewish National Fund or for the Palestine Labor Campaign, invariably finds the Gordonians conscientiously working on the streets. Social enterprises are also not lacking.</p>
   <p>Now let us turn to the development of this movement in Chicago. Approximately two years ago the first club was organized in this city on the Northwest Side. Almost immediately following it a second group was organized on the West Side. Within the last year, two more groups were organized on the West Side and one in Englewood. The outstanding feature of our Chicago groups is their individuality. In no two groups will one find the atmosphere and general work conducted to be alike. Number one, considered the most progressive of the five, is a rather mixed branch. There one finds high school students, college students, both day and night, office workers, or what have you. Number two, is mostly composed of young girls and boys working to support themselves. Here one finds Hebrew students and some high school students, but as in the former two groups, the majority work for a living. We shall now proceed to the most recent fruits of our labor - numbers four and five. Our fourth branch, which meets in Englewood, is wholly composed of high school girls, to them boys are nothing <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1571.jpg" n="3"/>but a nuisance and if we may judge them by the results of their activities in our recent campaigns, they may be excused to a great extent in holding that opinion. Our fifth branch, which is the youngest both in the length of its existence and the age of its members, is composed of young high school boys and girls aspiring to do "bigger and better" things. At their meetings one invariably hears discussions that are both educational and interesting. But by no means do we intend to stop at this number of branches, and we hope our membership will steadily indrease.</p>
   <p>About a half-year ago a City Council, on which all the groups are represented, was formed. Since then the progress of the Gordonians has been remarkable. The different groups now have a body to which to turn to for advice. The Council undertook several affairs which proved to be great successes. The Gordonia Bulletin, which was forwarded to practically all groups in the country, was acclaimed by everybody as another step in the direction of success. The publication of the second issue is only a matter of days. Undoubtedly the hot weather has handicapped us greatly, thus making it rather hard to make any headway with the Leaders Group, or the Dramatic Circle. But, notwithstanding this, the City Council is preparing a huge celebration on the occasion of the formal dedication of the nucleus of a Gordonian library in Chicago. At this event, which is to take place on July 30, at the Zeire Zion Club rooms, at 3317 W.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1572.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Roosevelt Road, the entire program will be furnished by the various groups. The outstanding feature being a debate on the subject: Resolved, That a Hebrew University be established in the United States.</p>
   <p>The writer of this hopes that he has succeeded in giving the reader a general idea of what and who the Gordonians are. What they do, however, cannot be stated in a few words. It may be confidently stated that they receive an adequate foundation which will help them in the future in their strife for the up-building of Palestine with action rather than words.</p>
   <p>Any further information concerning the Gordonians may be obtained by communicating either with the chairman of the City Council, Sol Kotzin, 2117 Humboldt Blvd., Phone, Brunswick 6555; or the secretary, Miss Ethel Bryan, 838 N. Campbell Ave., Phone, Armitage 2160.</p>
