   <p>Anshia Emeth (Men of Truth) Congregation was chartered two years ago last May. The congregation leased the second floor of 262 Division Street, West Clark which has a seating capacity of 300, and where they now worship. The room is handsomely fitted up in oak and contains all the paraphernalia of a nice temple.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bernheim, a layman, has officiated as minister, assisted by members of the congregation, since its organization. There are at present thirty-one members worshipping in the orthodox manner and using the Minhag Poland. This congregation has no Sabbath School at present. Their burial ground is located on the Harlem Road, which consists of one acre, 888 feet in depth, <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1127.jpg" n="2"/>53 Â¾ feet in width running from the east to the west with a tasteful picket fence inclosing it; it has also a Mithar house, which costed $900. This is paid in full. The cost of burial for a grown a person is $10; children $5. The organization does not belong to the Y. A. H. C.</p>
   <p>The congregation embodies a Benevolent Society and its President is empowered to donate to distressed bretheren $3, but in extreme cases when desirable he has the privilege of calling a meeting of the Committee, and they can donate $10 which is the limit. The congregation gives $5 to members in case of illness besides other stipends. The monthly dues are seventy-five cents.</p>
