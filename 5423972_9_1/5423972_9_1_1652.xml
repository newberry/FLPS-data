  <body>
   <p>Congressman Cable of Ohio, whose bill proposing independent citizenship for married women became a law September 22, 1922, has recently introduced in Congress a bill which would provide for the citizenship of children [of foreign-born parents].</p>
   <p>This bill provides that children under twenty-one, who live in the United States when one of their parents becomes naturalized, will be considered citizens. A child who is born in a foreign country of foreign-born parents would be considered a citizen through the naturalization of one of his parents, provided that the naturalization took place while the child was a minor, and the citizenship of the child would begin at the time the child began to reside permanently in the United States. Hitherto, this was only the case when the father became naturalized.</p>
   <p>According to the existing law, all children who are born in the United States <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1653.jpg" n="2"/>are considered citizens of this country, independent of the citizenship of their parents.</p>
   <p>Children who are born outside the United States are now considered American citizens only in the event that their fathers were citizens at the time of their birth. Mr. Cable's bill proposes that a child who is born outside the United States may be considered a citizen if but one of his parents is an American citizen at the time of his birth.</p>
   <p>We consider this bill a very desirable one, because it is logical, progressive, and will, in many cases, be a savior to those who could otherwise expect no protection from America.</p>
