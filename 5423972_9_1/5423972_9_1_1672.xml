   <p>with the Jewish masses on the East Side. He has found out that the great majority of them are affected with radicalism; so also, he "found out," are the Jewish college students and other intellectual Jews. He was present at many students' meetings at Columbia University and talked to many Jewish students, and he became "convinced" that most of them are atheists and radicals. Senator King said that he had conducted his "investigations", for the past two years, and during that time he spoke personally to two thousand individuals, and he found out that they all have a leaning toward radicalism.</p>
   <p>Senator King is particularly angry about the sympathy for Soviet Russia shown by the great majority of the audience recently during an open debate at Carnegie Hall in New York. He and Senator France were the speakers on this occasion. Eighty per cent of the leaders (sic), almost all of whom were Jews, he said, applauded wildly whenever the names of Lenin and Trotsky were mentioned.</p>
   <p>The senator maintains that he is not an anti-Semite. Oh, no! He is far from <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1673.jpg" n="3"/>it. Some of his best friends are Jews. One of them is Governor Bamberger of Utah, whose election he had supported. As a Mormon, he believes that Jewish blood flows through his veins. (The Mormons claim to be the real "Sons of Israel".) One of his sons married a Jewish girl and lives happily with her. The senator hates only the radical type of Jew--not the average Jew.</p>
   <p>"The radical Jew," said the senator, "has forsaken the God of his fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I look with sorrow and disappointment at their departure from Judaism. They have brought only trouble to the Jewish people, who have made the highest moral contribution to civilization. The Jew who denies his God is incomprehensible to me."</p>
   <p>No material which refutes his statements has been received by him up to now, said Senator King. He would be glad to have somebody prove to him that he has been wrong in his attitude toward Jewish immigrants. He will gladly study any literature about this question from Jewish sources. As far as can</p>
