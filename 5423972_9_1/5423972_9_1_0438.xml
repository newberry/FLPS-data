   <p>Three synagogues exist now in Albany Park--a Reformed, a conservative, and an Orthodox. The Reform synagogue might as well remain independent, because it differs fundamentally from the Orthodox, but why should not there be a merger between the conservative Beth Itzchok Synagogue, which is more Orthodox than conservative and which is now building a gallery for women, and the Orthodox Beth Mordecai Synagogue? United, they would create one strong Orthodox center in Albany Park. I hear that the members of the Beth Itzchok Synagogue are fine Jews and so are the members of the Beth Mordecai [Synagogue]. Why should not they unite? They stand to gain nothing by remaining divided but they can greatly gain in strength if they should unite. United they will be able to do a great deal for the Jewish youth in Albany Park. It is of the utmost importance that the Orthodox forces in that part of the city should unite. It is worthwhile to note <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0439.jpg" n="2"/>at this instance that the Beth Itzchok Synagogue tripled its Keren Hayesod quota this year. Were it United with the Beth Mordecai Synagogue, it could have quadrupled its quota and it could have become one of the leading synagogues in Chicago.</p>
