   <p>The new synagogue erected for the congregation known as Beth Hakneseth Israel, on the corner of Judd and Clinton streets, was duly dedicated Sunday last, at 1 o'clock. It stands on a square corner, but facing the west, and its size is 80 x 82 feet. The roof is surmounted by a tower which rises by the height of 140 feet from the ground. The interior of the temple is well planned and tastefully executed. The auditorium is almost square in form and is finished in light wood.</p>
   <p>The pulpit is situated at the extreme east end of the auditorium, and is surrounded by a brass railing.</p>
   <p>The holy ark, in which the scrolls and other sacred works are kept, is an interesting feature. It is made of hard-wood stained a dark color, and rises against the wall at the rear of the pulpit. A beautifully embroidered curtain hangs in front of it, and conceals from view the sacred contents. A large lamp with a red globe depends from the ceiling just in front of the holy of holies. It is the everlasting light.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1086.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The main floor is designed for the male portion of the congregation, and the females are relegated to the gallery, as in all orthodox congregations.</p>
