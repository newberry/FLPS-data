   <p>The leaders of Reform Judaism in this country, recognizing the need of strengthening the Reform Temple, have decided to raise a fund of three million dollars with the object of coming to the aid of the institutions dependent upon public contributions. With a three-million-dollar fund at their disposal, the Reform Jews can do a great many things to solidify their position. They can first of all make the Cincinnati Hebrew Union College a first class faculty, they can support Jewish learning, further Jewish scholarship, cultivate Jewish literature, come to the aid of the Rabbis, etc. There is no doubt in our mind that since the leaders of the movement, the most influential Jews in America, are taking a hand in the drive, that the campaign will be successful, and that within a short time the Reformed Jews will have at their disposal a considerable fund in cash, to cope with every emergency.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0727.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are only 375 Reform Congregations in America. A great many of them are wealthy congregations, and are by no means depended on the help from the outside. The average Reform Congregation is well to do and, as a matter of fact, only a few congregations would accept help from outside. The best part of the money will go to educational, cultural, and social institutions.</p>
   <p>There are from five to six thousand Orthodox Jewish Congregations in America. Among these five to six thousand Orthodox Congregations only a few dozens can be spoken of as wealthy. The rest of them consist of hard working men of the lower middle classes. The vast majority of the Orthodox Congregations in America are not financially strong, and cannot pay their Rabbis a decent salary, and for this reason they cannot get any men in the Rabbinate; they cannot maintain good educational institutions, and they cannot do much for the social and cultural welfare of the Congregations, because of their weak financial conditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0728.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>These Orthodox Congregations, however, weak though they may be, financially, form the backbone of American Jewry, and it is of paramount interest to every Orthodox Jew in America that the average Orthodox Congregation be strong and solid, and in a position to cope with all difficulties and with all problems with which it is confronted. But still none of the leaders of American Jewish Orthodoxy has the vision and the foresightedness to imitate the good example set by the leaders of the Reform Temple. If the much wealthier Reformed Jews deem it advisable to raise a fund of three million dollars to solidify and to strengthen the Temple, though it is by no means financially weak, the leaders of Orthodox Jewry have a thousand more reasons to do likewise.</p>
   <p>The majority of American Jews is Orthodox or Conservative. The radical Jew is much more in sympathy with genuine Conservative Judaism than with Reform Judaism. But still the Orthodox majority has not as many educational and cultural institutions as the Reform minority. The Orthodox Rabbinical Seminary in New York, headed by Dr. Revel, is a great institution, but, dependent upon <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0729.jpg" n="4"/>voluntary contributions, it cannot develop as fast as it is necessary, it cannot grant admission to all applicants, it cannot improve its staff, it cannot develop its library, it cannot grant scholarships, because of lack of funds. The same holds good of the newly established Orthodox Jewish Teachers' Training Seminary, and of a good many other educational, and cultural institutions supported by Orthodox Jews. But with a fund of from three to five million dollars at the disposal of the leaders of Orthodox Jewry, all the Orthodox institutions could be in much better shape, and the Orthodox Rabbinate would be better off too. It would command more respect and more influence, and would be a much stronger force in American Jewry than it is now.</p>
   <p>If the Reformed Jews deem it advisable to raise a fund of millions to solidify their institutions, the Orthodox Jews have many more reasons to do likewise. And we beg to suggest that the leaders of Orthodox Judaism in this country assemble in convention of the Federation of American Orthodox <pb facs="5423972_9_1_0730.jpg" n="5"/>Congregations, take the necessary steps with the view to organizing such a campaign. The organizing of the campaign in itself will be a boomerang for Orthodoxy, and there is no doubt in our mind that the campaign will be a success.</p>
