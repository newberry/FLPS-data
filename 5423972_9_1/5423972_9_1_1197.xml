<title level="a">THE HUGE PARADE OF THE 132ND BOYS AND COLONEL DAVIS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Regardless of contradicting reports, one scheduling 7:30 A.M., the other 11:30 A.M. as the hour of arrival of the 6,000 boys of the 132nd Illinois Infantry Regiment, large masses of Chicago people crowded the various depots to greet their kins and dear ones. Huge crowds also awaited the parade for which no definite time had been set.</p>
   <p>It was a parade of parades yesterday. The boys arrived at 7:30 A.M. At 9 A.M. they all gathered in Grant Park, where they received a mighty welcome from parents, relatives and friends.</p>
   <p>The parade started at 11 A.M. The boys marched first, headed by Colonel Davis, under whom they achieved a glorious record for themselves <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1198.jpg" n="2"/>in France. They marched from Twelfth Street and Michigan Avenue to the Loop amidst shouts of hurrah. All stores, offices, and homes along the route were decorated with American flags.</p>
   <p>At 12:30 a banquet was given in their honor at a downtown hotel. At 3 P.M., they were back at Grant Park, where great entertainment awaited them.</p>
   <p>Chicago, yesterday, was full of joy. The Loop was crowded with men, women, and children.</p>
   <p>The paraders, among them a group of Jewish boys, were reviewed by Major General Ball, Governor Frank A. Lowden, and other public officials. The boys all looked well, healthy,and happy.</p>
