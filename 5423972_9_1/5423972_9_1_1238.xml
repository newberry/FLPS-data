  <body>
   <p>Mr. I. Dua, a member of the editorial staff of the Jewish Courier for almost four years, will leave shortly to serve Uncle Sam in his war against Germany.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dua was drafted lately and immediately assigned to the Gun-Flying Aviation Corps. There he will have an opportunity of showing his ability in one of the most important divisions of military service.</p>
   <p>During the four years that he has been affiliated with the Jewish Courier, Mr. Dua has earned a fine reputation as a journalist and writer of short stories. He started with the Courier as a reporter, later became labor editor, and now upon leaving for "service", is one of the chief editorial collaborators.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_9_1_1239.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His colleagues on the editorial staff wish him success in his "service" and hope to see him come back from the war with several medals on his chest for valor on the battlefield in the fight against the brutal foe of Freedom and Righteousness--the German Junkers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dua was born in Sedletz, Poland, twenty-eight years ago. As a child he was brought to Warsaw where, at the age of thirteen, he entered the revolutionary movement and for many years was known in the circles of the Bund as an able worker under the name of "Edward". He used the same pseudonym in his feuilletons in the Courier.</p>
   <p>He came to America five years ago. And in the labor movement of this country he has also occupied a prominent niche.</p>
