   <p>In recent months, the American press has been devoting much space to life and events in the Soviet Union. Almost every day we see, in one or another American newspaper, articles and reports dealing with the "building of new Russia" and with the life of the Russian people under the Soviets. The American reading pub-lic has been following, with great interest, the articles on Soviet Russia which now have been appearing regularly in many American daily newspapers, and which have been written by two former leaders of the American Communist party--A. Smith and F. Bill. Both returned recently from Soviet Russia completely dejected, and disillusioned in their communist dreams. The public pronouncement on, and severe criticism of, the Soviets by the two foremost former American communists are bound to have a tremendous effect upon American public opinion and, indirectly, are sure to bring some benefit to the oppressed people of Russia. This writer met personally Mr. A. Smith, former American communist, after his return from the U.S.S.R., and had <pb facs="5423967_4_1370.jpg" n="2"/>a long talk with him, which was fully reported in Rassviet.</p>
   <p>The Hearst newspapers are now publishing a series of very interesting articles on Soviet Russia written by A. Tavdul, Russian-American technician, who recently returned from Russia after spending there three years as a technician in the employ of the Soviet government. This writer has known Mr. Tavdul for many years before his trip to Russia, and talked with him twice after his return to America. In his initial articles, Mr. Tavdul writes mostly about the famine, in the Ukraine and in other parts of the U.S.S.R., which swept the country and decimated its people in 1933. Some time ago, this writer published in Rassviet a lengthy article devoted exclusively to this most painful and sorrowful chapter in the history of the communist rule in Russia. Mr. Tavdul lived in the Ukraine at the time when death and starvation were at their peak, when thousands of villages were desolated by hunger, and when millions of men, women, and children prematurely went to their graves. Mr. Tavdul, in his articles, confirms what I stated in my writings, and what many other investigators declared--that eight million persons died of starvation in Soviet Russia during the famine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1371.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This writer believes that Mr. Tavdul, as well as the American writers, Long, Smith, and Bill, who write about Russia in the English language newspapers, are doing splendid, and humane work by informing the American public of the true conditions in Russia. This writer also thinks that this is only the beginning, and that the exposing of Stalin and his clique will continue.</p>
   <p>The people of Russia who survive the famine and continuous oppression by the Red rulers will be sincerely grateful to the American people for their interest in the gruesome lot of the Russian workers and peasants under the Bolshevik yoke.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: The writer of this article is well known to us. To our readers he is known through his articles in Rassviet and through his recently published book, both under the title,"What I Saw in Soviet Russia". The book is selling fast. Within a very short time, almost the entire first edition has been sold. The book contains many interesting chapters which have not previously appeared in Rassviet.]</p>
