<title level="a">WHAT STATISTICS SAY ABOUT CRIME AMONG IMMIGRANTS</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Flis</title></bibl>

   <p>A bill on the registration of foreigners recently introduced into the New York City Council was offered only "because of the unusual growth of criminal activity in this city". In the vehement campaign that is now being carried on against foreigners native-born Americans are presented with a picture of the total economic predominance of the foreign-born as a result of the criminal gangs organized by them and also with the picture of the absolute moral decadence of the aliens. At times one hears even from the immigrants themselves statements to the effect that "we should recognize such facts and purge our ranks of the evil element".</p>
   <p>But what are the facts about criminalism among foreigners? Exceedingly interesting in this respect are the statistical data just made public by Edward Hoover head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice in Washington. The data are based on 392,000 arrests made in the year 1935 by police <pb facs="5423967_4_0466.jpg" n="2"/>departments, sheriffs, and other officials all over the country.</p>
   <p>According to these data, in proportion to their numbers the inhabitants born in this country show a ratio of arrests almost twice as high as the immigrants. As far as serious crimes are concerned, such as murder, robbery, rape, fraud, and confidence games, the number of arrests among the native-born inhabitants is three or four times as high as the number of arrests among immigrants. Again we speak about the number of arrests in proportion to the numbers of native-born and of immigrants.</p>
   <p>Quite an imposing picture is given to us by the classification of the criminals according to the kinds of crime committed. Thus we see that among foreigners arrests predominate on such charges as disorderly conduct, violations of laws governing the sale of alcoholic drinks, etc., whereas among the native-born arrests on very serious charges predominate, such as armed robbery, etc. Thus, for every 100,000 native-born people there were 12.9 arrests on the charge of armed robbery as compared with 3.6 arrests on the same charge among every 100,000 <pb facs="5423967_4_0467.jpg" n="3"/>foreigners; on the charge of theft there were 33 arrests per 100,000 among the native-born, and 8.4 per 100,000 among foreigners; on the charges of fraud and operating confidence games there were 12.7 arrests per 100,000 native-born, and 7.1 per 100,000 immigrants. On vagrancy charges there were proportionately three times as many arrests among native-born people as among immigrants; on the charge of drunkenness twice as many.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, among foreigners there were more arrests made on the charge of violating anti-alcoholic laws, 11 against 7.6 per 100,000 native-born For all crimes together 382.6 arrests were made among every 100,000 native-born and 194.7 among every 100,000 immigrants. The percentage of criminals among American negroes is very high. For each 100,000 negroes 1,138 arrests were made, a proportion almost three times as great as among the white native-born inhabitants and almost six times as great as among the immigrants.</p>
   <p>These eloquent figures, coming, as they do, from the Federal Department of Justice, only confirm the data obtained in previous surveys of criminal activity among <pb facs="5423967_4_0468.jpg" n="4"/>various groups of the population of the United States. As far back as 1902 the Industrial Commission created by the United States Congress, while studying, among other things, the problems of immigration, came to the conclusion that "if the United States is taken as a whole, the white foreigners will be found less criminally inclined than the native-born inhabitants". In the year 1931 the National Commission on the study of Legislative Enactments appointed by President Hoover published several volumes of its findings on criminal activity in the United States and one separate volume on criminalism among the foreign element. This commission, headed by former Attorney General Wickersham, also came to the conclusion that "in proportion to their numbers immigrants commit far fewer crimes than native-born Americans".</p>
