   <p>With the beginning of September, the entire life of the country springs to a new lively tempo after a long summer lull. The activities of the local Russian colony also take on new life in the autumn. The Russian organizations, which had spent the quiet summer months in preparing new plans, are now busy in putting their plans into action. The most immediate and direct aims of most Russian organizations may be summarized as follows: The increasing of membership, the organizing of Russian youth, the establishing of good Russian schools for children, and the expanding of cultural activities by giving more frequent lectures, concerts, and literary discussions. The making of plans is one thing, however, and the realization of them quite another. Our great difficulty lies in our inability to materialize even the least pretentious, but at the same time the most essential, of our plans. The leaders of the more outstanding Russian organizations in this country for the past several years have been planning to unite their societies into one strong organization, <pb facs="5423967_4_0733.jpg" n="2"/>and, heretofore, nothing has actually been accomplished in this matter. But even though our organizations cannot agree upon a common action in the field of business--benefit insurance--they can and they should act as a unit in the cultural and educational activities among the Russian people in America. To make such cultural and educational activities more efficient and effective, all Russian societies and clubs in a given city or town should form one central committee. Such a committee could more easily handle all the educational activities and, besides, could act as a representative body for the entire Russian colony of the town before the American public.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, all Russian-American organizations would be much more successful in their work if they were more closely tied with American organizations and with some American social institutions. All former attempts at closer cooperation with American institutions have failed, because the society that tried it did not represent the entire Russian colony, in Chicago or elsewhere. The central committee representing all the Russian organizations in a town could also establish contact with the American press, in order to inform American newspapers about the life of the colony, as well as to facilitate, as need <pb facs="5423967_4_0734.jpg" n="3"/>arises, the clarifying of any news items, articles, or editorials about the Russian people or about Russia which may appear in these newspapers and which may not be true (like the recent statement in one of the local American newspapers that the majority of the Russian people in America are communists). When the central committee will have been organized, the Russian colony will gain prestige among the Americans and among the several foreign language groups in our city. It often happens that some American political organization or private individual wishes to establish contact with the Russian colony and is ready to support its high aspirations, but is usually at a loss where to turn and to whom to offer support, when there are a number of Russian societies and clubs, not only lacking any central co-ordinating body, but usually fighting each other.</p>
   <p>Considering all the foregoing facts, it appears very important for the Russian colonies (at least in all big cities) in America to form such central co-ordinating committees. If the Russian organizations continue to act separately and to ignore one another, they will never be able to achieve any worthwhile <pb facs="5423967_4_0735.jpg" n="4"/>success, and will never be able to turn to good account the influence and control they exert separately over the Russian people.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Russian organizations would do well to get together, before fall business gets into full swing, to discuss the chances and possibilities of a closer union between the Russian organizations in Chicago and those in other American cities.</p>
