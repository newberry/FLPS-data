   <p>One of the burning questions in the life of our Russian group is how to hold the growing younger generation and prevent it from slipping away from us. This problem is now being seriously considered by our mutual aid societies, political organizations and religious groups, and also by parents themselves. It is a serious and complex question; it must be solved without further procrastination if our work as a national group is to continue.</p>
   <p>Our young people are growing older every day, and we are gradually losing our control over them. They do not stay within our midst, but rather prefer outside company. They spend their time in the Polish section of the neighborhood or in American company, or they simply idle their time away on the streets, looking for fun and recreation. Under proper influence and environment the same young people would strive for self-improvement and higher education. But the old generation has no facilities, no institutions of its own to attract the growing new generation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0569.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The situation with younger children is much more satisfactory. We have our own Russian elementary schools, and special classes to take care of children up to ten years of age. But we need a school with a junior high school rating if not a complete high school. After learning the Russian language in these schools, and after acquainting themselves with the works of such Russian writers as Gogol, Lermontov, Turgenev, Pushkin, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, and such Russian composers as Tschaikovsky, Rimski-Korsakov and others, our young people then would be able to recognize the power and profundity of Russian thought. Then our youth could properly estimate the great value of Russian literature and Russian arts. Then our young people would readily acknowledge their Russian origin, and would be pround of it.</p>
   <p>In addition to a Russian high school, we need Russian youth clubs, libraries, dramatic circles, choirs, bands and orchestras, and sporting activities, to provide for better intellectual and physical development of our young people, and at the same time to keep them within the orbit of our group. If we fail to provide all these things for our sons and daughters, the American "street" will <pb facs="5423967_4_0570.jpg" n="3"/>finish their education. There they will fall into the clutches of corruption and disrespect for law and order. They will begin to commit petty larcenies and burglaries, like rifling mail boxes, breaking of vending machines, then stealing automobiles and gang robberies. And they would end, or perhaps begin, their outlaw careers in the house of correction or in prison. It is time for us now to think quite seriously of all these possibilities. If we do not undertake some action now, it may soon be too late, and we will lose our younger generation.</p>
   <p>At first it may appear that the establishment of our own high school, our own clubs and other attractions is above our power and beyond our possibilities; but, as the saying goes, there is nothing impossible in this world--better late than never. Once we decide to do it, we must start doing it; then everything becomes attainable. If other national groups have all these things for their young people, then we can have them too.</p>
   <p>Our youth can always be inspired with the great benefits to be derived from such <pb facs="5423967_4_0571.jpg" n="4"/>activities and education. The best proof of the truth of this statement can be found in our elementary Russian schools and classes. When we first organized these schools, there were many who would not believe they would be a success. And there were many parents who thought it impossible for the schools to teach their children the Russian language, as they could not speak a word of Russian even in their homes, where Russian was used by their parents. But after several months of schooling the youngsters in their native tongue, the parents were pleasantly surprised to find their children able to speak Russian. It is most pleasing to Russians of the older generation to hear their youngsters recite in their native tongue the tales of Krylov or the poetry of Pushkin and other Russian authors during public exercises; or during our conventions to hear the representatives of our younger generation get up and appeal in the Russian language to their elders to give them their own schools, where they can continue their education in the language of their parents.</p>
   <p>In view of the seriousness of this problem, which the entire Russian group is now facing, it seems advisable that Rassviet open its columns for free discussions of <pb facs="5423967_4_0572.jpg" n="5"/>this question, so that every Russian may express his free opinion on this matter. Maybe, by a collective action, we can succeed in finding a solution for this important question.</p>
