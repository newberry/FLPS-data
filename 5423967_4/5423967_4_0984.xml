<title level="a">CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS OF THE WHITE RUSSIAN PEOPLE'S SOCIETY OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Part I.</p>
   <p>1. The name is: "White Russian People's Society of the City of Chicago."</p>
   <p>2. The seal: on the seal there is the following inscription in Russian and English: "The White Russian People's Society of the City of Chicago."</p>
   <p>Part II.</p>
   <p>1. The purposes of the society are as follows: to carry on an agitation for the separation of White Russia from Poland and its incorporation into Soviet White Russia. (Note: The authors of the 'constitution' of the society evidently meant by the term 'White Russia, - or 'White Ruthenia,' as it is sometimes called now, - only those provinces of White Russia which had been given to Poland by a treaty <pb facs="5423967_4_0985.jpg" n="2"/>concluded by the Bolsheviki. D. S.)</p>
   <p>2. The unification of all White Russian workers in the United States and Canada on the basis of the struggle against Polish oppression of White Russia and other nations. In this struggle the White Russians must observe solidarity with the Polish workers.</p>
   <p>3. The carrying on among the White Russians of educational work, such as arranging lectures, meetings for discussion, etc.</p>
   <p>4. Giving financial aid to White Russian political prisoners in Poland.</p>
   <p>5. The money to be sent as directed by the General Assembly of the society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0986.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Part III.</p>
   <p>1. Funds of the society: the funds of the society consist of admission fees and monthly dues, donations and money derived from theatrical performances, concerts and other enterprises.</p>
   <p>Part IV.</p>
   <p>1. Membership: all persons accepting the constitution and by-laws of this society can be admitted to membership.</p>
   <p>2. Applicants must be recommended by two members of the society.</p>
   <p>3. Candidates to membership must pay an admission fee of fifty cents.</p>
   <p>4. Members of the society have to pay twenty-five cents dues monthly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0987.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Part V.</p>
   <p>Members who are carrying on any activities incompatible with the constitution of the society will be excluded from the society.</p>
   <p>2. Members who have failed to pay their monthly dues for two months are regarded as being not in good standing. Those who have not paid any dues during four months are thereby automatically deprived of their membership.</p>
   <p>Part VI.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the society takes care of the work of the society during the periods between the general assemblies.</p>
   <p>2. The officers of the society are elected every six months by the general assembly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0988.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>3. The executive committee consists of seven members, including the recording secretary, the financial secretary and the treasurer.</p>
   <p>4. The revising committee consists of three persons elected from among the members.</p>
   <p>5. Regular meetings are held at least once in every two months.</p>
   <p>6. For a meeting to be legal, a quorum of one half of the whole number of members is required.</p>
   <p>7. If a meeting of the society can not be held because there is no quorum, another meeting is called which is considered to be legal if one-third of the members is present.</p>
   <p>8. Only members of the society have the right to vote.</p>
   <p>9. A chairman is elected at every meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0989.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Part VII.</p>
   <p>1. If the society stops its activities, a meeting must be called for the liquidation of the society in order to decide how the property of the society should be disposed of.</p>
   <p>(Note: It should be pointed out that the small group of White Russians, which was pursuing the aim of separating a certain part of White Russia from Poland in order to reunite it with Soviet White Russia, had no success in its propaganda. In spite of the fact that the leaders of this group, Mr. Zmagar and Mr. Voronko used all the means at their disposal in order to further their aims, they did not succeed in acquiring the sympathies of the American White Russians and in interesting them in their ideas. During the years 1923 and 1924 they shouted in the pages of Free Russia and of the Russian Herald, making a lot of noise, conducting polemics with their opponents, trying by all possible means <pb facs="5423967_4_0990.jpg" n="7"/>to prove that they, Mr. Zmagar and Mr. Voronko, were right, but their voices were like "the voice of one crying in the wilderness."</p>
   <p>The American White Russians had to face the following dilemma: while theoretically all White Russians uphold the view that historically White Russia in an integral part of Russia, yet, considering the problem in a practical way, they prefer that the White Russian provinces which had been annexed by Poland should remain under Polish rule. The American White Russians understand perfectly well that, if they agree with the views of Mr. Voronko and Mr. Zmagar, and if with their assistance the separation of White Russian provinces from Poland and their union with Soviet Russia would be realized, they would have practically helped thereby the Bolsheviki to exterminate their White Russian brothers. Therefore the American White Russians did not consider this new-fangled White Russian propaganda as something serious, but as something extraneous that has been imported into America from Europe by Voronko and <pb facs="5423967_4_0991.jpg" n="8"/>Zmagar who were trying to instill artificially into the minds of the American White Russians separatist views. The American White Russians regarded all this propaganda with great diffidence, knowing beforehand to what disastrous results it could lead. By the by, it must be mentioned that in spite of two years of propaganda, both oral and in the newspapers, Mr. Voronko and Mr. Zmagar did not succeed in creating in any city, except Chicago, even a small group of White Russians who would share these separatist views. The American White Russians regard those who make propaganda for these separatist ideas as agents either of the Polish or the Soviet government who have been sent to the United States in order to disorganize Russian societies and Russian public life in America. Here, in Chicago, this propaganda made by White Russian separatists was very energetically supported only by the Bolsheviki and their sympathizers. As far as I know Mr. Joseph Voronko was sent to America by the Bolsheviki for a definite purpose: in order to carry on propaganda among the American White <pb facs="5423967_4_0992.jpg" n="9"/>Russians against Poland and in favor of Soviet White Russia. It must be said, though, that later Mr. J. Voronko gave up this harmful propaganda of White Russian separation here in Chicago; but he did it only after having found out by experience the uselessness of the efforts which he and Mr. Zmagar had been making during five years.</p>
   <p>It may be timely to tell here that, if the propaganda made by Mr. Voronko and Mr. Zmagar would have been successful, it would have been a powerful disorganizing factor in all Russian anti-Bolshevist societies in America. In fact, all these societies consist chiefly of White Russians and Ukrainians of the old immigration. Therefore the White Russian separatism could have easily started a process of dissolution in these societies by introducing an element of national enmity between the Russian and the White Russian members; and only the Bolsheviki would have profited by that. But fortunately this did <pb facs="5423967_4_0993.jpg" n="10"/>not happen, and the Russian colony in America succeeded in preserving its unity and inner solidarity in its common Russian work. Nicholas Korecki.)</p>
