   <p>P. Zaychenko has written several articles in Rassviet in defense of priests and other clergymen. The life of clergymen even at its best is not enviable at present, and they need some defense, as other people do. Of course not all clergymen are so good as Zaychenko portrays them and they are not so bad as they are represented by the other side, by those who do not believe in churches. [These latter say that] if one goes to church, the priests will teach him something bad. On the contrary, they teach something good, and it seems that if people would only recognize a supreme power over them and would follow the precepts of religion, we should not have the conditions that exist to-day.</p>
   <p>It often happens that people who do not go to church and do not hear what the priests preach are the ones who attack the clergymen, not [really] knowing what the clergymen are doing.</p>
