   <p>Just when Mr. Nemirovich, senior deacon of the First Russian Baptist Church of Chicago, had given me all the information about the Russian Baptists in Chicago I could obtain from him (see my interview with him on Sunday, Augsut 22) the pastor of that church, Rev. N. I. Siberiakoff returned from a religious meeting he had to attend somewhere else. On my request to give me some additional information he invited me to see him a little later at his home. He lives in the house where the meetings of the First Russian Baptist Church take place. Our conversation lasted about three hours, and I derived from Rev. Siberiakoff the following information:</p>
   <p>Biography. Nikolai Ivanovich Siberiakoff is the son of one of the brothers Siberiakoff, who belonged to a family of very rich merchants and businessmen well known in Siberia. Nicolai Ivanovich, however, <pb facs="5423967_4_1163.jpg" n="2"/>was born not in Siberia, but in Moscow where his parents were residing at the time of his birth, in 1899. He has received his first education at the Imperial Moscow School of Commerce, from which he graduated in 1918. After that he left Moscow for Vladivostok, but was detained on the way by the rising of Bohemian troops which were kept prisoners In Siberia. In Irkutsk he was forced to join Kolchak's army, and when that army was defeated he served in the people's revolutionary army of the Republic of the Far East.</p>
   <p>Before he joined that army, however, he studied law for one year in the Irkutsk University. From Irkutsk he went with the army to the Transbaikalian district to fight the Japanese troops and those of General Semenov (from 1920 to 1922). When in the summer of the year 1922 the regiment to which N. P. Siberiakoff belonged was demobilized, he went to Khabarovsk, and in the autumn of the same year left for Harbin, where he stayed till the year 1927 with his relatives. During his sojourn in Harbin he took up the interrupted study of law again.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1164.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>and for one year attended lectures at the Harbin University.</p>
   <p>In April, 1927, Mr. Siberiakoff came to America (to San Francisco). He stayed there till the year 1929, and was working in a furniture factory.</p>
   <p>During his sojourn in San Francisco he became acquainted with the well-know Russian Evangelical missionary, Urbar. Even in his youth Mr. Siberiakoff had been interested in religion. Under the influence of the Rev. Urban his yearning for a religious life revived. He was converted and decided to dedicate all his life to the preaching of the Gospel. In order to prepare himself for this work, he joined the Los Angeles Bible Institute, where he studied for three years. After that he went to Kerman, Cal., where he organized a Russian elementary school for children in a colony of Russian sectarians called Pryguny (Jumpers).</p>
   <p>In the autumn of the year 1933, Mr. Siberiakoff joined the Berkeley <pb facs="5423967_4_1165.jpg" n="4"/> Baptist Divinity School (in California) where he studied two years. In the summer of 1935, at the request of the Russian Baptist Union, Mr. Siberiakoff made a tour visiting all those American cities where there are more or less considerable communities of Russian Baptists. When returning from this tour in September 1935 he stopped in Chicago and resolved to stay here as the local Russian Baptists desired him to accept the office of pastor. In Chicago he joined the Northern Baptist Theological Seminary and in 1936 graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Theology. Since the autumn of the year 1935 Rev. Siberiakoff has been the pastor of the First Russian Baptist Church in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Educational activities of the Russian Baptists in Chicago. The Russian language (Reading and writing and the rudiments of grammar) is taught to children and adults at the quarters of the First Russian Baptist Church. The class gathers once a week, on Thursdays, in the evening.</p>
