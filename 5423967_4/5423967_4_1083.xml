   <p>At a special meeting of the parishioners of St. George's National Independent parish, which took place on the twenty-second day of July, 1933, it was unanimously decided to construct new buildings: a church, a school, and a hall for theatrical and other activities.</p>
   <p>A special construction committee was elected to conduct all activities in connection with the construction of the buildings, namely, the working out of plans, the adoption of means to obtain contributions and offerings, the arrangement of special social affairs to raise funds, the collection of funds in the church bank; and the distribution of subscription lists among members of the local Russian colony. The construction committee was elected according to the strictest rules, and every member of the committee is placed under a personal bond. The committee consists of the following members: Dmitri Mikhalchik, <pb facs="5423967_4_1084.jpg" n="2"/>chairman, Ivan Udovich, treasurer, Dmitri Vorobey, secretary, Daniel Grib and Kiryl Volnistyi, trustees, and Kiryl Riabchuk, F. Kostielanchik, Gregory Kasperovich, O. Protana, and Reverend G. Geltonoga, directors.</p>
   <p>The parishioners and the brothers of the order of St. George the Conqueror have found it necessary and proper to establish a cozy corner for the Chicago Russian colony, in which children as well as grown-ups will find rest for their souls and cultural and educational aid.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
