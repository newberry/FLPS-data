   <p>Mikhail Gruzenberg among the Americans called Michael Berg, is at the present time in China and calls himself Jacob Borodin. Mikhail Gruzenberg was a person with little education. In America he did not experience much suffering and need. While at the Valparaiso University he did not distinguish himself in any way. Coming to Chicago he tried the field of teaching. He opened a school of English and turned it later to a preparatory school, which, nevertheless, was not recognized. When Russia was struck by the revolution, Gruzenberg agitated against Bolshevik impudence, cursed, called them bandits and usurpers, and other sweet names. But the reader should not believe much in his sincerity.</p>
   <p>Gruzenberg was aggravated that he could not benefit from the situation, but when he realized how the Bolsheviks had overpowered the Russian people, he changed his tactics and through certain tricks became an official of the Foreign Office in Moscow. Here be found ground to <pb facs="5423967_4_1696.jpg" n="2"/>distinguish himself in the field of Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>And this was just in his line. The bolsheviks value such individuals and offered Gruzenberg to conduct their intrigues among the Chinese Cantonese revolutionists. It is characteristic that during the time Gruzenberg decleard himself to be the Soviet representative Borodin in China, the commandant of the Chinese armies ordered that the mouths of the Bolshevik agitators be shut.</p>
   <p>Then what? O God! Our former Chicagoan Gruzenberg betook himself again to Chicago, where his friends were trying to apologize to the Americans, calling him a "spets" (specialist), but not a Bolshevik or Communist. There you are! A Bolshevik official agent in China, and not a Bolshevik. The Russian colony of Chicago well remembers how Gruzenberg tried to make advances to the mission of Kerensky's government, which was greeted by the Russian colony of Chicago at the Auditorium. Everybody remembers well how this intriguer, with the assistance of his friends at the <pb facs="5423967_4_1697.jpg" n="3"/>meeting, succeeded in getting the role of president of the committee of the meeting and even of censor of the speeches of orators who greeted the mission. Flirting with Kerensky's mission and America, Gruzenberg tried not to permit the orators to be too bad in their speeches; he did not want to allow even the presence of the local Bolsheviks at this solemn meeting, proof of how much of a rabid anti-Bolshevik Gruzenberg was is shown by the fact that during the greeting of Kerensky's mission, he interrupted the orators who mentioned the free revolutionary government of Russia. Probably the Chicago Bolsheviks do not know what to make of this sudden turn from a staunch Menshevik to a rabid Bolshevik. For some people (according to the American expression) "business is business." Therefore, reader, dismiss all year former ideas that the Borodin who is making such a noise in China is the composer Borodin or is a member of that family. It is generally the way at the Bolshevik camp to assume good Russian names in order to make oneself appear more important and to take advantage of the situation. In short, the Borodin in China is nobody else but our Chicagoan resident of the West Side, Michael Gruzenberg; <pb facs="5423967_4_1698.jpg" n="4"/>his empty school is still there, maintained on the money of the Russian peasants.</p>
   <p>One does not have to be a prophet to foretell that in the near future we shall see some of the good friends of Gruzenberg - Borodin appear on the Bolshevik horizon.</p>
   <p>Chicagoan.</p>
