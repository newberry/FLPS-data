   <p>The Russian population in America is in a constant state of anxiety over the latest and most pertinent question: who is going to be the Sovict ambassador in the United States--a Jew, an Amenian, a German, or a Russian?</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact this political representation will not play an important part in the future relations between the two countries, and will not be instrumental in bringing about more a friendly relations between the two nations. The official representative of a foreign country is, as a rule, respected just as and no no more than the flag that flies over its building.</p>
   <p>Let us take as an example the last Russian envoy, sent here after the first revolution. His name was Boris Bakhmietiev Bakhmietian, an Armenian. What did he do for Russia? He used to travel through the entire East Side of New York, calling meetings at which he talked of the greatness of Russia. He used to print here Russian rubles for the Koltchak government. Several <pb facs="5423967_4_1491.jpg" n="2"/>million of these rubles have disappeared. He lived comfortably at the Russian embassy in Washington, and spent money lavishly, both in America and in Europe. He sold to this country a big order of Russian potash, for $700,000, instead of $7,500,000. Such was the first envoy of the Russian revolutionary government.</p>
   <p>Czar Alexander the I, having recognized the "irreligious" republic of the United States, sent here, in the year of 1809, as an envoy, a certain Andrew Dashkov, who spoke but little Russian. His native language was French. From this time until now there have been twenty-seven Russian envoys to the United States. Of these, twenty-two were either by birth, extraction, or education Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Germans. There was one Armenian, and only four Russians. And the last "guardian of the Russian treasure" in this country was a Rumanian--Uget.</p>
   <p>Read the book by Tatishchev about the Russian government, and you will learn much about the higher circles of Russian autocracy. You will learn that Russian <pb facs="5423967_4_1492.jpg" n="3"/>ministers often were unable to speak Russian at all; instead, they spoke French or German. During the years of Czarist Russia the Russian language was kept in the background, and it was regarded as the language of the common people, the ill-bred. Even the Russian autocrats frequently could not speak Russian. Their Russian vocabulary was confined to swearing.</p>
   <p>Who will now occupy the luxurious private residence in the Russian embassy in Washington? Will it be Finkelstein, Sokolinkov, Yurenitch, or some Kohn? But what difference does it make to the Russian peasants? They worked hard, starved and lived in misery during the times of the Czars. They sweat, suffer and starve even now. And no one but themselves can pull them out of this political mire where they have put themselves because of their own ignorance.</p>
   <p>A Russian consul in Boston could not utter a single word in Russian. A Russian consul in Philadelphia could pronounce scarcely a few Russian words. Then we should not wonder if the new Russian envoy, the consuls, vice-consuls, attaches, secretaries, office-workers, and commercial representatives in America prove <pb facs="5423967_4_1493.jpg" n="4"/>not to be Russians, but masters belonging to other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Such is the history of Russian diplomacy in this country from the beginning. Such is the national character of the Russian people. And such is the power that rules them. Russia has been ruled by many nations and many rulers, by Tartars, by Poles, by Germans and by Frenchmen. But the Russians themselves have had the least to say about the destiny of their own very extensive country, for which they have often given their lives.</p>
   <p>Let us examine for a moment the most recent emigration from Russia into the United States. There are not many Slavs in this recent group of immigrants. And yet these people have played an important role in Russia. They were rich, possessed high titles and enjoyed extensive power.</p>
   <p>In Russia the local gods have always been less regarded than their foreign counterparts. Native Russian personages of local note have always been considered less important and less worthy of esteem than those coming from foreign <pb facs="5423967_4_1494.jpg" n="5"/>lands. This undervaluation of its own kind is prevalent in Russia even today, and more so because internationalism is being stressed at every point.</p>
   <p>We really should not get alarmed or excited over the question of who is going to be the Soviet representative in Washington. Ho will be only a shingle, an expensive shingle, of no use to anybody. He will be busy enjoying dainty dinners or trying to rub shoulders with those close to the White House, or signing official papers.</p>
   <p>Nations are in real need of true business and cultural relations and of mutual understanding. But these should be brought about, not through envoys and plenipotentiaries, but directly through the people themselves. And in this connection the Russian population in America may be called upon to play an enormous and very important part. It may bring America closer to Russia and explain Russia to America, thus bringing together two of the great nations of the world.</p>
