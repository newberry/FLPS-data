   <p>This question, addressed to the Russian colony in America by the editorial staff of the newspaper Rassviet, is by no means an idle one; it deserves the greatest attention on the part of the readers.</p>
   <p>For my own part, I want to communicate to the Russian public, readers of this newspaper, my views concerning this question. Perhaps it will be possible to derive some practical benefit from the following considerations...</p>
   <p>What, then, should we do in order to improve our material and spiritual welfare? The first thing is to open an inquiry in the pages of Russian newspapers in America, as to the number of Russians residing in this country. Personally I am inclined to regard as a Russian, anyone who sincerely and unswervingly considers himself as such. The questionnaire for the proposed inquiry may be formulated approximately as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(1) Name, first name, and middle name.</p>
   <p>(2) Nationality.</p>
   <p>(3) Married or single (Underline).</p>
   <p>(4) Wife's nationality.</p>
   <p>(5) Number of children: Their age.</p>
   <p>(6) How many years have you resided in America?</p>
   <p>(7) Do you desire to contribute by all means at your disposal to the material and spiritual welfare of the Russian colony in America?</p>
   <p>(8) What is your education?</p>
   <p>(9) Your profession or trade.</p>
   <p>(10) To what Russian organization do you already belong? How Long?</p>
   <p>(11) Do your children attend a Russian school? If not, why?</p>
   <p>(12) Do you suffer from unemployment? How Long?</p>
   <p>Editor's note: We request all our readers to inform their Russian friends about this inquiry and to beg them to participate in it.</p>
   <p>An exchange of information received by various Russian newspapers published in America will enable us to summarize the statistical work done. Thus we shall <pb facs="5423967_4_0626.jpg" n="3"/>arrive at an exact figure of the number of Russian immigrants in America. The answers of the readers (to questions 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the questionnaire) will inform us exactly as to what intellectual forces are at the disposal of the colony for creative, constructive work; also about the degree of national solidarity, and of material and spiritual want.</p>
   <p>Thus the practical solution of the questions raised by the editorial staff of the newspaper Rassviet will be a matter of the near future after the completion of the proposed inquiry. Meanwhile, all that is possible is a purely theoretical discussion of these questions according to the following plan: (1) Community of the economic interests of the Russian immigrants; (2) community of work (of profession or trade), and (3) community of spiritual ideals and views.</p>
   <p>The community of economic interests points to the necessity of close, numerically strong groups, centering around Community Houses; of creating Russian co-operative institutions, enterprises, farms, etc. The community of work induces people to create trade unions and "Artels" (workmen's guilds) federated around centers; insurance societies and savings and loan associations; sick benefit associations, etc., and labor exchanges. It also induces the Russians to get into contact with American professional labor unions and public <pb facs="5423967_4_0627.jpg" n="4"/>institutions. The community of spiritual interests of Russian immigrants will subserve the preservation and strengthening of Russian culture by means of creating clubs, circles and other organizations having as their main object to promote Russian culture abroad. For the furthering of the welfare of the Russian colony there should also be organized lectures, readings of reports, meetings, theatrical performances, concerts, etc.; also the publishing and sale of Russian books, newspapers and magazines; the development of a network of Russian schools, Russian circles and unions for the Russian youth, and the creation of a Russian college in America.</p>
   <p>Such are, in short, the paths into which should be directed, as into the common channel of Russian colonial life, Russian thought, Russian national feeling, and Russian solidarity. The positive results of such public work may surpass all expectations; but this can be achieved only under one indispensable condition; namely that every Russian immigrant shall always firmly remember, feel and cherish in the depth of his heart this thought: "I am a Russian."</p>
   <p>Naturally, when such organizing work is undertaken, purely political and religious questions are to be eliminated from the program of constructive activities, as the introduction of such questions is apt to give rise to disturbances, <pb facs="5423967_4_0628.jpg" n="5"/>discords and splits. Political, religious and atheistic organizations should not be allowed to put any pressure upon or to influence in any way, the activities of the "All-American Russian Center of Culture and Mutual Aid" which should unify all Russian Mutual Aid Societies in America.</p>
   <p>A. F. Kolesnikov.</p>
   <p>(Note: As far as I know, the idea of mailing questionnaires to Russian immigrants, proposed by Mr. A. F. Kolesnikov and supported by the editors of Rassviet, did not give any practical results because it gained the approval of only comparatively few immigrants. Furthermore, the other Russian newspapers did not give their support to this idea and practically ignored the question raised by Mr. Kolesnikov. N. Korecki.)</p>
