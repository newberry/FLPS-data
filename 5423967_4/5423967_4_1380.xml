   <p>The Moscow correspondent of the Chicago Daily News wrote the other day that the weakest link in the Soviet defense is the railroad transport. During the past two or three years the Soviet government has appointed the most active party members to the post of commissar for transport, and yet the conditions on the railroads have not improved in the least.</p>
   <p>At present the work of reorganizing and improving the railroad transport has been entrusted to Commissar Kaganovich, but whether he will be able to accomplish anything at all, it is difficult to say. The difference between the former commissars and Mr. Kaganovich is that his predecessors attempted to reorganize the transport facilities by issuing orders frmm Moscow, whereas Mr. Kaganovich is almost constantly on the wheels and is engaged in personal investigation of the conditions on the spot. Furthermore, former commissars always laid the blame at <pb facs="5423967_4_1381.jpg" n="2"/>the door of some mysterious wreckers, and Mr. Kaganovich discovered the disrupters, thieves, and defrauders among the Communists themselves--those who work on the railroads. At a recent conference of the railroad employees, held in Moscow, Mr. Kaganovich declared:</p>
   <p>"Superintendents in charge of new railroad building should, with Bolshevik determination, put an end to the thievery and frauds that are found on construction jobs. Stealing is going on right and left on every project, and thousands of crooks in places adjacent to the jobs are living off the proceeds of the sales of stolen materials and goods. Such abominable conditions should not be tolerated for even one day, when the socialist property of the state is involved.</p>
   <p>"Many party workers engaged in the transport industry--and this is their misfortune--quickly reconciled themselves to the disorders prevailing on our railroads: disruption of schedules for train movements, absence of labor discipline, carelessness and disobedience to orders. We can and must organize the work of <pb facs="5423967_4_1382.jpg" n="3"/>the railroads in such a way that they will give us efficient and accurate performance, just like clockwork." (Pravda, April 24.)</p>
   <p>Such was the demand made by Kaganovich of the railroad employees, and it was made, probably, because one of the Soviet engineers, after visiting the United States, wrote in Pravda that American railroads really perform like clockwork, and compared them with Soviet railroads.</p>
   <p>Kaganovich also told the railroad workers that during the current year, the Soviet government has decided to spend four billion roubles on transport, or eighteen per cent more than last year. For the acquisition of rolling stock alone, the government has appropriated seven hundred and thirty million roubles, for building new railroads and laying second tracks on the existing lines, eight hundred and eighty-four million roubles. For technical reconstruction of the existing network, the appropriations amount to one thousand two hundred and fifty-two million roubles.</p>
   <p>Despite these huge outlays, the Bolsheviks are not certain whether they will be <pb facs="5423967_4_1383.jpg" n="4"/>able to raise the railroad performance to the level attained by the American railroads so that the Soviet transport industry would not hold back military movements in the event of a war. For the purpose of improving their transportation facilities, the Bolsheviks are even willing to seek a loan in France. The improvements planned thus far will be carried out primarily in the western provinces bordering on Poland, and the work of railroad reconstruction will be entrusted to French specialists.</p>
   <p>What the outcome of the negotiations for the loan will be, nobody knows. Paris newspapers consider that it will be difficult for Bolsheviks to obtain such a loan because many Frenchmen still hold the railroad securities issued by the czarist government, and thus far unredeemed. The Bolshevik government, as is well known, refused to honor these obligations and has not paid interest or any of the principal on these securities.</p>
