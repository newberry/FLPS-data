   <p>Every member of the Russian-American Colony who thinks even a little cannot help but notice the temporary confusion of the colony. In the midst of the colony one can see a temporary apathy. Whether you speak to an almost illiterate worker, or to one well educated and conscious, or to an intellectual, you will hear indefinite answers to questions about the situation in Russia and the cultural enlightenment work in the colony. You will notice in them weariness, some doubts, despondency and confusion.</p>
   <p>The passions of party and fraction have quieted down. Died out temporarily is the deep faith in the cause, in which one believed not so long ago.</p>
   <p>People of different views do not debate any more with such ardour. Pessimism has taken the upper hand over optimism. Everywhere there is a wearisome expectation of something. The colony has quieted down as if asking, "What will it be?"</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1622.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These confusions and apathy are very natural. The Russian-American colony mostly lives with the life of their native country. Russia has lived through great events, and due to that the population of the country, and the Russians in foreign countries, were in high spirits.</p>
   <p>The civil conflicts, famine, sicknesses, cold and other disasters, which followed later lowered the courage, considerably weakened the people and assisted the occurence of apatny. The Russian colony, indissolubly connected with its country, did not take part in the civil conflicts, did not suffer from nunger, from epidemic sicknesses, did not stroll around in poor clothes, but they were deeply suffering in their souls from all the hardships of their native country, its misfortunes, sorrows and failures. Besides that, every Russian, who is living in America deeply loves his country, feels homesick and, in addition, everyone of them has people on the other side of the ocean who are similar to their blood and spirit. The hardships of relatives deeply affects the soul of every Russian, and there arises in him a desire to help his <pb facs="5423967_4_1623.jpg" n="3"/>country and relatives with whatever means possible. A trutnful description of the events in our native country is necessary for the nealthy, courageous condition of the colony. The confusion of the colony will not last long. The courage of the colony will improve according to improved conditions in Russia.</p>
   <p>One firmly believes that the time is not far distant when one country will begin to recover. The incessant fight for the freedom of elections to the Soviets, for the full freedom of the press, speech and unions, the right against bureaucracy, the persecution of political enemies and the fight on the economical front, will bring our country out of the condition of the present time. With the improvement of the situation in Russia, the apathy and the despondency of the Russian colony will disappear.</p>
