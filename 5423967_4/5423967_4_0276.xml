   <p>".... When we came to Chicago we found there a very active non-partisan organization of Russian Socialists and Socialist sympathizers of all shades of political opinion, working under the name of Relief Society for Political Prisoners and Exiles in Russia. It collected large amounts of money that went to the victims of tsarist oppression in Siberia, penitentiaries, and other places of exile and imprisonment. The leading spirit of this organization was M. Stolar, at present city editor of Moscow News. Others active included F. Kogan, a druggist, and Esther Rovsky, who alternated for years as financial secretaries of the organization. Both live now in Chicago, where they own a drug store at the corner of North Oakley and Chicago Avenue. This organization numbered at one time more than 100 members, and among them the Dubrov family, Ivan Lagoda, Mrs. F. Berg, and Miss Sheinman, seem to have been the most active."</p>
