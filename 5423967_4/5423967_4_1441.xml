   <p>At the present time, when every hope of reaching an amicable agreement between the United States and the Bolshevik regime concerning debts and other claims has to be definitely and irrevocably abandoned, loud voices are raised among the Senators demanding the severing of diplomatic relations with the U S S R. Senator Barbour (New Jersey) declared that he would insist on the adoption of his resolution concerning the break with the Soviets. Congressman Hamilton Fish declared: "Recognition of the Soviet government was a colossal error. American industrialists and cotton planters were assured that the recognition of Russia would enable them to sell not less than one billion dollars' worth of goods annually to the U S S R. Since the Soviets were recognized, fifteen months have elapsed, and instead of showing any increase, our export trade with the Soviet has actually decreased." The severing of diplomatic relations with the Soviet government is demanded also in a telegram sent to Vice-President Garner by the chairman of the Affiliated Patriotic Societies, John B. Trevor.</p>

   <p>The preparations for closing the Export-Import Bank, created especially for the purpose of trading with Soviet Russia, are proceeding hurriedly. The men at the head of the bank are preparing to call a meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of deciding what to do. The closing of the bank, however, will not prevent private firms and individuals from dealing and entering into commercial relations with the Soviet organizations. They will be permitted to extend credit facilities to the Soviet government at their own risk, without any guarantee by the bank.</p>
