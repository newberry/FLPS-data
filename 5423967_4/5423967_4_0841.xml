   <p>Leavitt Street, Wood Street, and Division Street are the names given to the main Russian groups in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the last twenty years these three groups have been fighting each other. At the beginning the fight was between the Leavitt and Division Streets groups, which in 1912 were not called by these names, even though they existed at the time. Since then the quarrels between the Leavitt and the Wood Streets groups have continued up to the present time.</p>
   <p>Although a serious battle has never occurred between the Leavitt and the Division Streets groups, the "Levitsi" (Leavitt Street) group spends much energy in an attempt to smash the "Vudskuiu" (Wood Street) organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0842.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now that times have changed and the people are tired of this continual strife, the groups are growing and expanding to adjust themselves to present conditions.</p>
   <p>Geographically as well as in importance, the Wood Street group is the "Zolotaia Seredina" (Golden center), and on this account it has had more success than the left or right groups. The Wood Street group is the founder of the largest Russian mutual aid organization in the Central States, comprising approximately fifteen hundred members. The Leavitt Street group has only three hundred members, and the Division Street group even less--only sixty members.</p>
   <p>The people, like water rushing into the sea, are drawn towards their center--the national center at Wood Street. The Division Street group, alarmed by the scarcity of new members, adopted during the last eighteen months all types of measures to crush the Wood Street organization, but the latter, being well organized, has been successful in parrying all attacks. The result of all this was that many members of the Division Street group--after frequent disappointments, errors, and experiments,--decided that the Wood Street group was the better of the two and joined it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0843.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And then, suddenly, the battle abated in the east. The Division Street group began to think and figure out the reason behind it all. They thought: We are all Russian peasants, and the majority of us are from the same state of White Russia. Why should we oppose our own brothers? Why should we throw dirt at our own native Russians? Does it bring any gain to any one of us? No, no. Then why not live together as brothers? Let any person have his own opinion,provided he does not interfere with the opinion of others. And why should our common cause suffer?</p>
   <p>We are Russians, all of us equally dear to our own native land, to our own brothers and sisters who live there. All of us have a rich, great, wonderful, and free Russian language. Before us lies a great deal of important and urgent work that requires the united efforts of the three groups--Leavitt, Wood, and Division.</p>
   <p>At present antagonism seems to have subsided, probably because the Division Street group and the one from Leavitt Street are setting their houses in <pb facs="5423967_4_0844.jpg" n="4"/>order. After this truce the action will begin anew. What this action will be is just the question, and a very important one at that. Will it be more mudslinging and slander? Will it be again brothers fighting brothers, or will it be that our Chicagoan colony at last has taken into consideration the constructive work of unification that lies ahead of us--the work of erecting our own public buildings, of uniting the schools under one body of competent and capable persons devoted to this task, of organizing the farms and the consumer co-operatives and hundreds of other necessities felt among Russian-Americans?</p>
   <p>We hope the fight between the Division and Leavitt Street groups--a fight between the Russian people and their stupid egoistic leaders--will end in victory for the group with the most common sense, that is, the one that will work not for itself and its own selfish affairs, but for the benefit of all, for the happiness of our own nation, and for the interest of the working class.</p>
   <p>Every broad-minded person considering himself in the above-mentioned group, everyone holding highly his native land, the name of Russia, and the destiny of the Russian colony in Chicago, must participate in this fight and endeavor <pb facs="5423967_4_0845.jpg" n="5"/>to conquer the enemy of the Russian colony and to throw him out of his organization.</p>
   <p>Then, brothers, you will know where is evil and where is good. If you perform properly your duty towards the destroyers of the Russian colony, then we will be rewarded with peace and brotherly love.</p>
   <p>By working together we will accomplish in Chicago many great tasks and will leave after us a memory not only to our children but also to Americans.</p>
