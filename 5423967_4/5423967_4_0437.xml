   <p>An Appeal to the Generous People of America.</p>
   <p>The World War left in its path many hundreds of thousands of Russians wounded and invalids. More than 25,000 of this number are stranded in different countries outside of Russia, and out of that number over 6,000 are not fit to work and are in great need of relief.</p>
   <p>Who then must and can help them?</p>
   <p>There is no Russia, no Russian national government, and it is not the communists, bolsheviks, the usurpers of Russian power, who will help Russian invalids, all of when did their sacred duty towards their Fatherland and the Allied armies, and paid with blood, death and wounds for the salvation of Europe, and of the whole world.</p>
   <p>Bulgaria and Serbia, where the majority of Russian invalids is concentrated, are not able to help them in an efficient manner, as these <pb facs="5423967_4_0439.jpg" n="3"/>countries are economically far from wealthy; unless relief can be secured, those of the invalids who are not able to work are doomed to starvation and death.</p>
   <p>The Russian emigrants took upon themselves the task of relieving the invalids, and have instituted an Invalids' Day or Week, for collecting contributions for the worthy cause all over the world. The Invalids' Day is in the third year of its functioning.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the sums collected last year for the purpose were far from adequate, and it appears that such relief must be forthcoming continuously.</p>
   <p>For that purpose the Russians in the United States have organized the Society for the Relief of Russian Invalids, which society is raising money for a continuous support of this cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0440.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Is the task of helping Russian invalids to be borne exclusively by Russians, or should it be borne by all those who warmly respond to human needs and sufferings?</p>
   <p>Americans have always been prompt and generous to open their hearts to sufferers, and their charitable, crusade in Russia during the famine of 1921-1922 will never be forgotten by the grateful Russian people.</p>
   <p>Guided by the above considerations, the Society for the Relief of Russian Invalids appeals most earnestly for help, and trusts that the hearts of Americans who fought the same battle as the Russian invalids, will be reached by this appeal.</p>
   <p>Indeed, continuous relief is greatly needed; without such relief the invalids, who deserve a better fate, will go through innumerable privations and sufferings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0441.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Contributions are accepted at the headquarters of the Society for the Relief of Russian Invalids, Division YMCA, 1621 W. Division St.</p>
   <p>Checks and money orders should be made payable to the order of Russian Invalids Fund, and addressed to Mr. B. J. Antziferoff, 1834 N. Kedzie Avenue, to Mr. <gap unit="chars" extent="5" reason="illegible"/> Ozefovich, at the address of the headquarters.</p>
