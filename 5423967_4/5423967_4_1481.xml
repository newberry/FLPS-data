   <p>Last Sunday Ukrainians of Chicago staged an impressive protest demonstration against the Soviet government that has doomed millions of Ukrainians to starvation. At two o'clock, after they had formed their ranks at North Oakley Boulevard in front of the Ukrainian church, the demonstrators began to march south along the Boulevard and then swung left on Madison Street. The Ukrainians were escorted by a squad of motorcycle police.</p>
   <p>When the demonstrators approached the elevated structure of the Humboldt Park branch, which crosses Madison Street at the 1800 block, they met many spectators who lined the sidewalks on both sides of the street. Many among the latter were Bolsheviks who were lying in wait to attack the demonstrators. They met the demonstrators with hostile shouts, hisses, and catcalls. Meanwhile, on the platform of the elevated station above the street, about two hundred communist <pb facs="5423967_4_1482.jpg" n="2"/>"shock troops" took up strategic positions.</p>
   <p>As soon as the vanguard of the demonstrators began to pass under the platform, it was showered with stones and brick bats from above. The demonstrators halted; the Bolsheviks, who had been hiding among the spectators on the side walks, threw themselves on the demonstrators. A fight ensued. The Ukrainians anticipated the assault and were not caught unawares. They were prepared to defend themselves with blackjacks and other weapons.</p>
   <p>In about ten minutes, several squads of police arrived on the scene. They, with the help of members of the Ukrainian militia, put an end to the fight and established order.</p>
   <p>One of the women Bolshevik sympathizers "worked" energetically during the melee, wielding a heavy piece of iron pipe wrapped in a handkerchief. Many Bolsheviks were armed with blackjacks, iron bars, and other weapons.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1483.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There were approximately one hundred persons injured in all, although the exact number is not yet known because some of the injured did not need medical aid.</p>
   <p>Those who suffered serious injuries were taken to the Cook County and Jefferson Park Mospitals for treatment; there were fifty patients. After receiving first aid, some of the injured were taken to police stations, and those Ukrainians who participated in the demonstration and were injured, were sent home.</p>
   <p>Ten Bolsheviks and the woman with the pipe were detained and booked for disorderly conduct; in addition, two of them are charged with carrying weapons without permits. The ringleaders of the attack were: Sam Brets (a Russian Bolshevik), thirty-eight years old, 1330 North Talman Avenue, in whose pockets a blackjack was found, and Sam Groski, fifty-one, 1210 South Morgan Street, in whose trousers the police found an iron bar. Among the arrested was Fania Tetrova, fifty years old, 1407 South California Avenue. Most of the arrested denied that they were members of the Communist party.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1484.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>More than three thousand Ukrainians took part in the demonstration, after which they held a protest meeting at the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers' Hall, 1340 West Washington Boulevard. The speakers who appeared at the meeting accused the Soviet government of starving millions of people in the Ukraine despite the fact that the Ukraine has some of the most fertile soil in the world. The wholesale death of masses of people, the speakers pointed out, was entirely due to the general policy followed by the Soviet government. It is its act of vengeance upon the Ukrainian people for their unwillingness to accept and follow the farm collectivization program.</p>
   <p>According to the latest information three Bolsheviks have already died from fatal injuries received during the [street] fight. About fifty still remain in the hospitals. The condition of some of them is considered critical.</p>
   <p>One of the Bolsheviks died of a deep knife wound received during the fray. The Ukrainian militiamen punished the attackers by using their rifle butts. None of them was wounded seriously. The Ukrainians were well prepared to meet the assailants, and gave the Bolsheviks a thoroughly deserved lesson.</p>
