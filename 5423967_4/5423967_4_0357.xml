<title level="a">CONCERNING THE SENDING OF PACKAGES TO RUSSIA</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A few days ago the superintendent of the United States parcel post made an interesting declaration in which he repudiates all responsibility for the safe delivery of packages which are being sent from America to Russia.</p>
   <p>The packages which are sent from America to Russia and the value of which averages $10 to $15 are taxed by the Soviet government with a custom duty amounting to $100 and even more.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the addressees are not able to pay these $100, and therefore the package becomes the property of the state.</p>
   <p>For several years there has been practiced in Soviet Russia such a confiscation of packages sent from America. Enough has been said about that. There have been complaints and protests; but no improvement in the delivery of packages is noticeable. They are still being confiscated <pb facs="5423967_4_0358.jpg" n="2"/> by means of this clever trick of levying exorbitant custom duties, while those who do it know that poor people cannot pay so much money.</p>
   <p>Who is sending packages from America to Russia? Farmers and workmen. To whom do they send these packages? To their relatives and friends who are also farmers and workmen.</p>
   <p>That these packages are being sent by speculators, by bourgeois to other bourgeois, can be said only by foolish people, or else simply by dishonest people who profess that they want to "serve the peasants and workmen," and who under this pretext rob these poor people of all the presents which they get from America.</p>
   <p>The American superintendent of the parcel post department cannot be suspected of telling an untruth.</p>
   <p>The tricks perpetrated on Russians who are receiving packages from <pb facs="5423967_4_0359.jpg" n="3"/> America are well known to everybody. They are known even to the local Communist organizations which already a year ago had prom sed "to settle the misunderstandings arising in connection with the sending of packages."</p>
   <p>Did they settle that? No!</p>
   <p>And until now we are not able to send Christmas presents to our relatives and friends with any assurance that they will receive them; we have still reasons to fear that the Soviet authorities will demand from the addressee $100 or $200 custom duties on the present sent by us.</p>
   <p>Truly one cannot but wonder how the "workmen's and peasants' government" serves the workmen and peasants!</p>
   <p>We who are living in America think that the Russian government cares for the welfare of the people, protects its interests and does not allow that the poor would be despoiled of what should belong to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0360.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But meanwhile we are getting news which shows that instead of being protected the poor are being treated in just the opposite way.</p>
   <p>What right then to the appellation of "friends of the people" have those who have organized that trick with packages sent by the poor to the poor?</p>
   <p>Russian peasants and workmen who have been marooned in America! Tell us: are those who levy custom duties of $100 or more on your packages that are worth $10; and who, when the addressee is not able to pay so much, give the package to any person except the one to whom it was sent, - are all these Soviet authorities doing what is right, or are they wronging the people?</p>
