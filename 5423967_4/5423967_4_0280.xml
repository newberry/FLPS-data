   <p>The Society of the R. I. M. A. S. founded the Russian Daily newspaper in Chicago, Svobodnaya Rossiya (Free Russia) which was published for eight years. The society is a non-partisan and non-political organization and adverse to the ideas of the bolsheviks and to all political organizations, which are trying to foist their ideas on the society. The society is especially opposed to the local bolsheviks, because they have been trying continually to disorganize the society. The society periodically issues Jubilee Almanacs, and papers. The society R. I. M. A. S. will celebrate its 25th anniversary, during the autumn of 1937. The R. I. M. A. S. has three clubs for young people, which specialize in various American sports. The youth is interested in the cultural work of their parents, which is going on among the Russian organizations.</p>
