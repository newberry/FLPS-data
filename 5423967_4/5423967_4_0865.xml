   <p>With the coming winter season the Znanie (Knowledge) Society is preparing to fulfill the program of cultural enlightenment was prepared in advance. The season was opened by an intimate social gathering held on September 29th of this year on its premises. This friendly evening gathering was a great financial success.</p>
   <p>In addition to members of "Znanie," there were many other guests among whom were several prominent social workers. The event proved to be gay and enjoyable with the informality of a small family gathering, united by the same interest, aims, and thoughts.</p>
   <p>During the intermission the guests held a business discussion. They talked of holding a series of lectures on popular science, on organizing classes, a string orchestra, etc. Znanie already has organized a choir of good voices under the direction of the well known conductor, V. V. Shumkov. Rehearsals are held every Thursday. The next entertainment by Znanie will be given on the 27th of October at Walsh's Hall. On that day Znanie has decided to present to the colony a special feature.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0866.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A group of artists who have successfully appeared on the stage of Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, and other cities of Russia have been invited. A comic opera, "The Groom and the Parrot," will be produced in addition to the excellent program of instrumental music singing, dances, poetry, and humorous short stories. Znanie earnestly asks the public to come not later than 5 o'clock in the evening, because the performance will begin punctually at 5 o'clock, and begs all to remain quiet during the performance in order to hear it well and cause no disturbance to others.</p>
   <p>The names of the artists will appear in the newspapers and on the posters, which will be distributed in advance.</p>
   <p>In the near future Znanie will present popular science lectures; already the best lecturers have been invited. Registration for evening courses for adults has begun. The subjects to be taught will be selected by pupils; that is, if there are enough pupils wishing to study a certain subject, it will be included in the curriculum.</p>
   <p>A life insurance policy can also be obtained on very easy terms through the <pb facs="5423967_4_0867.jpg" n="3"/>Znanie Society which is a branch office of the Roova (Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society in America) which is one of the largest Russian-American insurance organizations, having 54 branches all over the United States and Canada, with a capital of $110,000 (insurance fund). Remember that it is not a private organization aiming for profit, but a Russian benevolent institution for mutual aid. That is the reason why a very good policy can be obtained from it by the hard working Russian people.</p>
   <p>Znanie invites all the Russian people to join its organization in order to work together in the field of social welfare.</p>
