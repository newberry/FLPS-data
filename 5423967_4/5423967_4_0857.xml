<title level="a">THE RUSSIAN CENTER IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Some time ago there was organized in the city a club under the name "The Russian Center of Chicago." To what extent this organization represents a real Russian center is difficult to determine because it is rarely that the Russian colony hear about it. Besides, there is in Chicago a genuine and active Russian center which unites members of all Russian groups without asking who they are or where they came from. This center is the Znanie Society, and organization the purpose of which is culture and mutual aid among Chicago Russians.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday the Society held a private gathering, and to observe the large crowd that attended to it was enough for one to understand why the Znanie Society claims to be what it is, a center in which all Russians are welcome, regardless of who they are, politically or otherwise. So far as the society is concerned, they are neither "Reds" nor "Whites," Orthodox nor Jews, but only Russians who leave their political and religious 'galoshes' behind the door and enter the hall as true Russians, children of a common Mother, Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0858.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At this gathering, rubbing elbows together, were such figures as General Uzefovich and S. R. Chernov, both sincere about doctrines that make them enemies in theory, yet here brothers sharing in common their love for Russia. Here we see Prince Obolensky and a peasant, Karpuk, brothers in their love for Mother Russia, engaged in conversation; also engineers and laborers, "Leavitts" and "Indepentents," even the Pierces; children all of one land, who want to be together.</p>
   <p>In other words, the gatherings of the Center could be likened to a bit of Russia transplanted to Chicago. In these gatherings the word "Russian" stands above Red or White, Monarchist or Democrat.</p>
