   <p>Last Tuesday evening the Congress of Evangelical Christians opened its sessions in Chicago. I was present at the opening session in the capacity of guest.</p>
   <p>When I entered the hall, I. Kozak was reading to the delegates the greeting sent from various cities of the United States and Canada. After this there were speeches by many of the delegates. Of the speakers, I recall the names of Hook, Sidoruk, Kolesnikov. The names of others I do not remember.</p>
   <p>From what had been said by the speakers one could tell that their aspirations were centered around strict observance of moral precepts in the relation of man to man, which was the cardinal point in Christ's teachings.</p>
   <p>Several religious hymns were sung. The surprising thing was that all the <pb facs="5423967_4_1054.jpg" n="2"/>delegates sing their religious songs very beautifully.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago community of Evangelical Christians possesses a remarkable choir composed exclusively of young people numbering about twenty-five voices.</p>
   <p>The first session of the Congress was closed with choral singing of a religious hymn. The choral singing loudly resounded throughout the hall. It is a pleasure to listen to such a choir, for its singing is always inspiring to every hearer. After the singing was over the delegates rose from their seats and retired.</p>
   <p>It is quite noticeable that all the delegates are permeated with the spirit of brotherly love and have the friendliest attitude toward every man. Almost all delegates approached, stretched their hands out to me and greeted me in the most cordial way, although they knew that I was only a stranger in their midst. One of the delegates offered me the courtesy of an invitation to attend freely every session of their Congress, which will last a whole week.</p>
