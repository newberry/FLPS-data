   <p>How fast had the twelve years elapsed, and had written in the memory the important fact for the Russian colony of Chicago of that time!</p>
   <p>Chicago plays its role among the Russian-Americans. A stormy city, the center of the middle states, Chicago is on the highway between east and west of the United States. It was the time of the collapse of the Russian mission in America. The heads of the orthodoxy were staggering, sinning, and were up to mischief. They were sinning with body and soul. And they were tricking so much that the mission started to reek, not with the smoke of incense, but with the sins of the bishops and archpriests, of bigger and smaller measures. Now the Orthodox Mission is incurable sick. But then it was only starting to get sick with this malady.</p>
   <p>The Russian people of Chicago understood it and got roused about it. They rebelled against the unseemliness of the church and clergy and began to <pb facs="5423967_4_0122.jpg" n="2"/>grieve about the independency from the priests, who had been supported by the government and their adultery.</p>
   <p>They seceded, bought a church and house, and invited their own priest.</p>
