   <p>There appeared recently in the United States one more claimant to the property of the Russian Orthodox Church mission, in the person of one calling himself a "temporary exarch" of the Archbishop Benjamin. Archbishop Benjamin also came here from Paris not long ago.</p>
   <p>Archbishop Benjamin had sent from Moscow to our newspaper here a whole stack of ukases and other papers, drawn up in a very stern church style, with citations from and allusions to the Holy Scriptures, with exhortations, anathemas and threats of God's punishment for those who disobey the church. But throughout all these documents and papers one thought stands out in relief and is constantly emphasized: the metropolitan Platon, as one who has disobeyed the orders of the Moscow "patriarch," should now give up all the property belonging to the Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church, and transfer it to the "exarch" now in America, representing the Russian Church in Moscow.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1081.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some time ago similar claims to the property of the Russian Mission in America had been made by the metropolitan Kedrovskyi, member of the Russian Living Church. He had even succeeded in tearing away from the Mission a number of churches and a cathedral at 97th Street, together with the bishop's quarters. He took over this property on the principle that it had been built by the Russian state. But the same cannot be said of the remaining churches and other property acquired not by Russian state money but through the voluntary contributions of the parishioners themselves. Thus, the claims of the Moscow patriarch, inspired by the Soviet government, have absolutely no foundation. Were the Moscow churchmen really interested in spreading the Russian Orthodox religion in America, they could do it without taking over our churches, which are under the jurisdiction of the metropolitan Platon. But they are not in the least interested in preaching the Russian Orthodox gospel, and yet they strive to take over what they have not built, and what does not belong to them.</p>
   <p>In one of these patriarch orders sent to the metropolitan Platon, there are <pb facs="5423967_4_1082.jpg" n="3"/>reproaches for his "counter-revolutionary" activity, and his anti-Soviet attitude. But these obedient servants of the Soviet government do not protest against the destruction by the Soviets of almost all the churches in Russia, and against the persecutions of the people for their religious convictions. The quarrels among the Russian Orthodox clergy point up the fact that the years of bitter experience of the Russian Orthodox Church have not taught it anything, just as in the time of the Diocletian persecutions of early Christians in the first half of the twelfth century (sic). Julian, the apostate, in reality did an extremely good service to the early Christians when he forbade them to take retributions and persecute the heretics, the dissenters, and freethinkers.</p>
   <p>It is well that the present Soviet action is confined only to threatening ukases, to newspaper polemics, to excommunications and to prohibitions of religious services. These actions will no longer scare anyone.</p>
