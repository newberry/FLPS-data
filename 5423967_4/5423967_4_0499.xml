   <p>Wiley Post and Will Rogers--two great Americans--met a tragic death last Friday in Alaska. Both of them were born in Oklahoma, and both of them enjoyed great popularity throughout the entire world. Both lost their lives at the same time and in the same accident.</p>
   <p>Wiley Post was one of the best aviators in America. Aviation was his native element. He felt safer and more comfortable in the air than on the earth. Wiley Post successfully accomplished two around-the-world flights and many transcontinental flights, always breaking existing time or speed records. He attempted, several times, transcontinental stratosphere flights. These attempts were unsuccessful because the airplanes now in general use were not built for stratosphere travel. Wiley Post himself has been working on a new design of <pb facs="5423967_4_0500.jpg" n="2"/>an airplane which could fly in the stratosphere. Wiley Post's tragic death has ended the most useful and active period of his life and his work. In Wiley Post's death, not only American aviation, but also world aviation, has lost one of the best and the bravest workers.</p>
   <p>Will Rogers' popularity was even greater than that of Wiley Post. He was beloved by the people of the entire country, from the President of the United States down to the humble worker, the farmer, and even the tramp. Will Rogers was the greatest American humorist since Mark Twain, but his wit and his philosophy lay in a different direction. Will Rogers was a profound thinker, a brilliant actor, and a fine man. He was everybody's friend. Will Rogers's wit was not malicious or bitter. It was rather soft, mellow, friendly, and filled with common sense. His wit could not harm or offend anyone. On the contrary, Will Rogers always tried to cheer up people and make their life burdens lighter. Wherever he appeared, all sadness and pessimism disappeared.</p>
   <p>The Russian group knows probably little about Will Rogers as a writer and <pb facs="5423967_4_0501.jpg" n="3"/>humorist, because Russian people as a whole do not read English language news papers. Will Rogers has written several books, among them one about his trip to Russia. His short remarks on current events, published daily in many American newspapers throughout the country, won him additional fame and warm friendship among the people of this country. The Russian people, however, know Will Rogers well as a fine and inimitable film artist.</p>
   <p>The last tributes to Will Rogers and Wiley Post were paid by the outstanding personalities of American life during a special radio broadcast over the N. B. C. network last Friday night. The lives and the work of the two great Americans were highly eulogized and set up as examples for the young generation to follow.</p>
   <p>Will Rogers and Wiley Post were truly great Americans. Will Rogers represented the passing American generation, with its simplicity, sincerity, and romanticism, while Wiley Post was the reflection and the embodiment of contemporary America with its high technical development, its dynamics, and its speed.</p>
