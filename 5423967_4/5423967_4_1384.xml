   <p>In connection with the renewed rivalry of European countries in the sphere of military aviation a great deal of attention is being paid at present to the Soviet air fleet. Many military experts consider the Soviet air force to be the most powerful in the world, and that, therefore, the Soviet Union may be a valuable and powerful ally for some countries and a very dangerous enemy for others. As a result of this speculation, bourgeois France has concluded an agreement with "Socialist" U.S.S.R. and Fascist Germany has set itself the task of creating an air fleet which, in numbers and efficiency, will not only equal but will exceed the Soviet fleet.</p>
   <p>Recently, some very interesting information concerning the Soviet air force appeared in the Paris newspaper Journal de Debat. According to this newspaper, the Soviet Union at present possesses 3,500 airplanes, of which 500 are <pb facs="5423967_4_1385.jpg" n="2"/>bombers, 1,000 destroyers, 1,000 reconnaissance airplanes, and about 500 hydroplanes. The bombers can carry up to 1,000 kilograms of bombs and develop a speed up to 200 miles per hour. The best airplane-destroyers attain speeds up to 360 miles per hour. They are armed with machine guns capable of firing 600 shots per minute. In the opinion of this newspaper, the Soviet air fleet represents a serious force, but the average skill of the Soviet aviator is not very high.</p>
   <p>One of the English aviation experts declared that Soviet military aviation is so strong that the Soviet Union cannot be successfully attacked either from the East or from the West, although a serious blow can be dealt to it by a sudden air raid. However, he makes one reservation and says that the Soviet military air force is adequate only for a defensive role and for the application of collective sanctions which may be imposed, but is inadequate for an independent action and for carrying the war into enemy territory.</p>
   <p>"Everybody knows," he says further, "that aviation, in its present state, <pb facs="5423967_4_1386.jpg" n="3"/>can serve only as an auxiliary arm, the role of which in war will be considerably weakened within a few weeks after the military operations begin. In the laboratories of every country there are to be found improved models (armed airplanes for flying in the stratosphere, etc.), which are not being built for lack of money, but which of course, will be manufactured as soon as war is declared. The country that is to be considered the best prepared for war, therefore, is not the one which has the largest number of aircraft ready for action, but the one which can replace the airplanes lost in action in the shortest possible time."</p>
   <p>He, therefore, concludes that the Soviet Union may represent a formidable force only in the event that it acts in collaboration with other countries. If, however, the Soviet Union is left to act alone, it cannot represent a serious force. The English expert believes that for this reason, despite all the talks about the military might of the U.S.S.R., the Bolsheviks are striving to conclude nonaggression pacts or collective security agreements not only with the large states, but with small nations as well.</p>
