   <p>Dear comrades! There exists at present in the city of Chicago a new organization called the Russian Youth Alliance. The Aim of this organization is to unite all young Russian immigrants of Chicago and suburbs into one society which will offer a useful educational program, as well as other cultural facilities and entertainments.</p>
   <p>In addition to these objectives, the Russian Youth Alliance will establish a library for its members and for outsiders as well. Also a dramatic circle and an orchestra will be organized. Classes in singing and dancing, lectures, etc., will be conducted.</p>
   <p>The Russian Youth Alliance will also give financial assistance, legal advice, and medical care for members in cases of illness, injuries, or death.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1225.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Forty-two members joined this organization at the initial gathering.</p>
   <p>The Russian Youth Alliance is non-partisan and will analyze the programs of the several political parties now at grips in Russia, elucidating the truth about them impartially.</p>
   <p>The Russian Youth Alliance invites all Ukrainians from Russia and Galicia to attend meetings of the alliance and to join it. This alliance was founded in 1917 (December 10).</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
