   <p>Chicago, March 10 - Mme. Borodin, a prisoner of Northern Chinese forces, is a former Chicago school teacher. She was born Fanny Orluk and met Borodin, now Russian adviser to the Cantonese government, when both were students at Valparaiso University. She assisted her husband in conducting the Berg Preparatory School. Borodin was known as Berg. When he went to Russia by way of Mexic after the fall of the tsar and the rise of the Kerensky Government, she remained here in charge of the school.</p>
   <p>Berg, or Borodin, later returned, but has been in various parts of the globe since, as a diplomatic attache of the Russian government. According to Dr. Henry R. Krasnow, a former teacher at the Berg School, Borodin <pb facs="5423967_4_1694.jpg" n="2"/>is a "Spetz," or a prominent man in Russian politics, but is not a Communist.</p>
   <p>Mme. Borodin joined her husband in Europe and recently has been teaching in China.</p>
   <p>The Borodins' school here was located in a foreign community and was intended to teach English to immigrants.</p>
