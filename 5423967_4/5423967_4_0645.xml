   <p>The Douglas Park district between California avenue and Rockwell street and between Roosevelt road and 19th street has a pretty large Russian population. The number of Russians living in this district increases steadily. This locality is a Russian center. As we know, in this district there is a Russian school where over fifty children are being taught; there are even courses for women in that school. Often lectures in Russian, evening entertainments, gatherings of various kinds and meetings are organized by Russians in this district. Now the Russians intend to erect a building of their own for the school.</p>
   <p>Apart from such public undertakings, there are here also private Russian enterprises; several meat markets, a barber shop, a tailor's shop, two restaurants, etc. In short, this locality is a lively Russian nook.</p>
