   <p>The above-named Society is the noblest institution of the Russian colony in America. It was founded ten years ago by a small group of generous people who even now, in collaboration with other people who joined the initiators later, are working without stint to collect funds to provide help to Russian children living in extreme poverty and scattered over all the countries of the world.</p>
   <p>The World depression strikes hard blows at all the Russian people scattered by the revolution. In most countries, because of the existing unemployment, our compatriots cannot find any work, for if there is any, it is given to natives <pb facs="5423967_4_0295.jpg" n="2"/>in preference to strangers, and our people have no means to support their children. Under such conditions, without outside help, the children grow-up on the street just as if they were homeless orphans. They go hungry and dirty, without a chance to go to school; they grow wild and become human refuse. Ultimately they perish, forlorn and forgotten by their compatriots.</p>
   <p>In its ten years of existence the Society has grown immensely. It has numerous branches in the United States and Canada. But its size and the funds collected by it are still insignificant compared with the real need which constantly grows in connection with the influx of refugees from Soviet Russia into western Europe. The Society so far has been receiving aid only from a small part of the Russian colony.</p>
