   <p>The extraordinary meeting of the parish of St. George at 917 Wood Street, on October 16, 1926, was a very stormy one. First there was a heated discussion of some serious irregularities on the part of the Committee of the Parish, such as selling a lot of land belonging to the parish in order to pay taxes. The Committee did it irregularly, without the agreement of the parishioners and even without their knowledge. It was also proved that the Committee had been squandering considerable sums of money, i.e. paying $177.00 to lawyers for writing documents either unnecessary or even harmful to the interests of the parish, etc. After these questions had been discussed, the president of the parish, Mr. Gulko, raised the question of the necessity of discharging from his office, the Reverend Zheltonoga, priest of the church of St. George, whose activities had been on many occasions harmful to the parish and whose character and conduct made him unfit to be a priest. Mr. Gulko and several other respected members of the parish charged the Rev. Zheltonoga with having, together with the members of the Committee, illegally, without the <pb facs="5423967_4_1106.jpg" n="2"/>agreement and knowledge of the parishioners, made out documents making him, the Rev. Zheltonoga, and his confederates the owners of the property, belonging to the parish; of intriguing and fostering dissensions among the parishioners; of systematically appropriating for his personal use wine, bought for Sacramental use, to the amount of 630 gallons, during two years and of combining his sacred office with that of an agent of an insurance company.</p>
   <p>The question as to whether the Rev. Zheltonoga should be dismissed from his office was put to the vote, and only two of the parishioners voted in favor of still retaining the Rev. Zheltonoga as priest. Mr. Zheltonoga protested, declaring that he considered his dismissal as a breaking of the contract signed by the parish. But the parishioners stuck to their decision, holding that it was really the Rev. Zheltonoga who had broken the contract, and told him that he had to consider himself as dismissed.</p>
   <p>(Note: In spite of that the Rev. Zheltonoga succeeded in holding the office of priest of the St. George parish till about two years ago, when he was definitely dismissed from his office, which is now held by the Rev. Nervana. D.S.</p>
