  <body>
   <p>On December 1, 1933 the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society opened a new membership campaign. During this campaign all admission fees are suspended. Normally, the admission fee is four dollars. Many of you participated in a special meeting of the board of directors of our society and the representatives of all our branches which was held September 24 of this year. You took an active part in the discussion of the question of new members for the R.I.M.A.S. You remember what decisions were taken. We resolved to bring into our society one thousand new members before the next convention, which will be held in the spring of 1934.</p>
   <p>But five or six months separate us from the convention. The time is short. Let us begin now, lest we be unable to fulfill our proposed task in the designated time. I hope we all well understood the pledge we gave at that meeting--that we would spare no effort to increase our membership by one <pb facs="5423967_4_0826.jpg" n="2"/>thousand before the day of our twenty-third convention.</p>
   <p>One thousand Russian immigrants, now outside their fatherland should be brought into the ranks of the R.I.M.A.S. The question now before us is to determine with what seriousness we approved and passed the resolution at the September conference, requiring the enrollment of one thousand new members. Personally, I think we were serious in our decision. It could not have been otherwise, as we are grown-up persons, and the leaders of our people. And it is not becoming for leaders to engage in empty talk. Such a course would impel our rank-and-file members to consider us unworthy and incapable of directing the destiny of our organization. It would be a deadly blow to us.</p>
   <p>What then should the chairmen and the secretaries of our branches do to fulfill this little task--to bring one thousand new members into the R.I.M.A.S. as a present for it at the time of its twenty-third convention?</p>
   <p>In the first place, it is necessary to remember that the well-being of our <pb facs="5423967_4_0827.jpg" n="3"/>society requires it. In the second place, it is necessary to feel assured that it can be done. The task is not so difficult.</p>
   <p>These one thousand new members need not necessarily all be men. Adults, women and especially children will be welcome as new members of our organization. We already have children and youth groups in our organization. There are many members of this society whose younger and older children are not yet in the organization. These should be brought in first.</p>
   <p>And how many members there are whose wives and sisters are not yet members of our society! And how many of your friends and acquaintances might become members of this Russian organization! They are probably waiting for us to come and explain to them the benefits accruing to the members of this society. It is a known fact that Russians are upon their own initiative, not apt to join their organizations, and it is necessary to use strong, persuasion to overcome their lethargy. Such is our nature. Far too few Russians understand and realize what it means to us, strangers in a foreign land, to have our own <pb facs="5423967_4_0828.jpg" n="4"/>organization of mutual aid. This thing has to be explained to them.</p>
   <p>The chairmen and the secretaries of the branches of the R.I.M.A.S. should mobilize in their respective branches all active, willing, and capable members into compact groups, which could be called "new membership committees". These committees would be responsible for increasing the membership of their respective branches. During July and August of this year, the last two free admission months, we enrolled two hundred new members, despite the fact that we used our old inefficient method, not our new organizing system, in our membership campaign. Now, when we have before us a definite number of prospective new members, whom we must enroll by all means, and when the campaign is to be conducted in an efficient, business-like manner, it should not be difficult for us to enroll one thousand new members before the next convention.</p>
   <p>It is true that some of our members will say: "This is nonsense; it will not be possible to enroll one thousand new members in such difficult times as we have now." Naturally, if all of us are so skeptical about it we shall not <pb facs="5423967_4_0829.jpg" n="5"/>be able to enroll the thousand, or even ten new members. We recognize the fact that we are in the midst of economic depression, but we should not slow down our work on that account; we should do just the opposite. Never before have we had a better chance to increase our membership than we have now. The following are the reasons why: People more often now think of the rainy day; many people who had insurance policies in private insurance companies have lost them, because of their inability to keep up payments, which are much higher in such companies than in ours. In the private insurance company it is impossible to buy a smaller policy than one for five hundred dollars, while even a two-hundred dollar policy is issued by our society. Even an unemployed man can afford to carry such a policy. The membership dues on a two-hundred dollar policy are very small. For instance, a person thirty years of age pays only twenty-five cents a month; a person thirty-five years old pays thirty cents a month; a forty-year-old person pays thirty-five cents a month.</p>
   <p>In a word, the time is ripe. We should enroll one thousand new members at any price. The possibilities are with us.</p>
