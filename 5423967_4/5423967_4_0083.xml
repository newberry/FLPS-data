   <p>The improvement in the economic conditions of our colony becomes more and more noticeable.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen eat better food, dress better, buy automobiles.</p>
   <p>They buy lots, houses. An important role in the matter of improving the standard of life of the members of our colony is being played by the Russian National Building and Loan Association connected with the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>At present this building and loan association has more than two hundred members.</p>
   <p>It has accumulated a capital of more than $45,000. There is a kind of benefit society connected with this building and loan association.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0084.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The interest paid on savings is somewhat higher than that paid by banks - 4% instead of the usual 3%.</p>
   <p>Since this association was started it has loaned money to twenty-five members of our colony. Twenty-five of our countrymen have acquired houses of their own.</p>
   <p>Judging by the observations of the committee of the association, almost a fourth part or a third of all Russian residents of Chicago live in their own houses.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that in a few years this third or fourth part will grow so as to become a half.</p>
