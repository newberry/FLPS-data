   <p>In 1908 when the Tzar's Government sentenced several revolutionists to death, the mournful cry burst from the lips of my father, Lev Tolstoy: "I cannot be silent!" And the Russian people have taken up that lamentation and made it a single protest against slaughter.</p>
   <p>At present, when in the North Caucasus region, bloody massacres occur, when thousands of people are shot down and exiled daily and since my father is now deceased, I feel that I should raise my weak voice against these villainies, because I worked for the Soviet Government for twelve years, and during that time I witnessed the development of the terror.</p>
   <p>The world was silent. Millions were banished, and died in prison, in concentration camps in northern Russia. Thousands were shot down in their steps.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1515.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The bolsheviki began with class enemies, religious enemies, clergymen, scholars, professors, and at present reach and turn to the workers and peasants. But still the world remains silent.</p>
   <p>For fifteen years the people have endured slavery, famine and cold. The bolshevik administration exploited the nation, seized bread and other products and sent them abroad, because it was necessary to have trade not only to purchase machinery, but also in order to spread bolshevik propaganda all over the world. But if the peasants hid bread for their own hungry families or protested, prompt retribution was meted out; they were shot down.</p>
   <p>The Russian nation cannot bear it any longer. Mutinies arise here and there, the factories and mills revolt, individual villages, and even whole districts rebel. The starving peasants, by the thousands, run away from the Ukraine where they are threatened with death by starvation, and they leave their homes and farms.</p>
   <p>What did the Soviet Government do about it? It issued decrees exiling hundreds <pb facs="5423967_4_1516.jpg" n="3"/>of thousands of people from Moscow (one-third of the population); by imprisonment and death they soothe the aroused peasants. Since the era of Ivan the Terrible, Russia has never seen such brutalities. And at present, when the Kuban Cossacks in southern Russia have revolted, the Soviet power has committed dreadful and unprecedented atrocities against the population. Whole families of Cossacks were shot down; 45,000 of them, including women and children, were exiled to Siberia to certain perdition by the order of Stalin.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that even now the world will remain silent? Is it true that governments will calmly continue relations with bolshevik murderers in order to strengthen the bolshevik position, and yet by so doing, weaken their own empires just as termites eat into wood?</p>
   <p>Is it possible that the League of Nations will calmly adjudicate questions of universal peace with representatives of the country which, in the progress of state construction, uses bloody terror? Is it true that such idealistic authors as Romain Rolland who so clearly understood the souls of the two greatest pacifists of the contemporary era, Gandhi and Tolstoy, and others, <pb facs="5423967_4_1517.jpg" n="4"/>such as Henri Barbusse and Bernard Shaw, will continue to glorify the socialistic paradise? By doing so, they are morally responsible for spreading the bolshevik infection and threatening the world with corruption and perdition.</p>
   <p>Is it true that people still believe that the bloody dictatorship of this group of people, who are endeavoning to destroy universal culture, religion and ethics, is called "socialism"?</p>
   <p>Who now is willing to shout all over the world: "I cannot be silent"? Where are you who claim to be Christians, genuine socialists, pacifists, authors, social welfare workers? Where are you who are defenders of love, truth, and the brotherhood of man? Why do you keep silent? Is it possible that you need more proof more evidence from witnesses, more facts? Is it true that you do not hear the cries for help? Or perhaps you think that the happiness of the people can be established by force, murder, or forfeiture of the freedom of the whole nation?</p>
   <p>In my appeal I do not speak to those whose sympathies have been bought with the <pb facs="5423967_4_1518.jpg" n="5"/>money rifled from the Russian nation! I appeal to all those who still believe in the brotherhood and equality of the people--to religious people, socialists, authors, social welfare and political workers--to wives and to mothers! Open your eyes! Unite together in protest against the tyrants of the defenseless nation of one hundred and sixty millions.</p>
