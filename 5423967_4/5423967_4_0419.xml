   <p>On November 4, 1917, a play was arranged for the benefit of the Russian prisoners of war, which was successfully performed. In spite of the large expenses of this undertaking, which amounted to $380.85, after covering all the expenses there was $404.26, net profit.</p>
   <p>The big Walsh's Hall was overcrowded with visitors. The representative of the Russian civil authorities, the consul-general, Mr. Volkov, also took a very active part in this charitable enterprise. Mr. Volkov during one of the intermissions of the play made a short speech from the stage, in which he characterized the unbearably distressing conditions of life of the Russian prisoners of war in Germany and Austria. In conclusion Mr. Volkov called on all present to contribute for this unfortunate sufferers, after which he himself, together with others, began to collect contributions from the visitors with hats. The hat collection gave a sum of $110.</p>
