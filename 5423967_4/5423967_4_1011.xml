   <p>Schools and other cultural institutions and activities connected with the churches.</p>
   <p>With each church is connected a parochial school. Usually it takes three years to finish the course. The children get religious instruction and are taught the Russian language, singing and an elementary course of Russian history.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1013.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Connected with the Holy Trinity Cathedral and with the other Russian churches are youth's organizations which organize games, picnics, etc.</p>
   <p>The clergy of the Holy Trinity Cathedral is organizing from time to time courses for young people for the study of the Scriptures and of church history.</p>
   <p>The Most Rev. Metropolitan Theophilus has given several lectures in Chicago and has written in English a course entitled A short history of the Christian Church, and the Ritual of the Eastern Orthodox Church, its history and meaning. (To be had at the Mikhailovskaya Church. Published in San Francisco in 1933.) He has also written a booklet entitled The Shorter Catechism (also in English) which has been published by The Holy Trinity Cathedral.</p>
   <p>Conventions of the Russian clergy held in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The last convention of the clergy of the Chicago diocese took place on October 30th and 31st 1933. Last year, (1936) in November there was held in Chicago <pb facs="5423967_4_1014.jpg" n="4"/>a Council of Russian Orthodox bishops at which the Metropolitan Theophilus presided (from Nov. 17 to Nov. 21). Ten bishops attended this Council.</p>
   <p>Financial condition of the Russian churches.</p>
   <p>The total yearly gross income of the Holy Trinity Cathedral before the depression was about $12,000; now it is from $8,000 to $9,000.</p>
