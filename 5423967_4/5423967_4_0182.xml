   <p>The House Physician (we take the liberty of suggesting 'Household Physician' as coming nearer the purpose of the publication) has come to our desk in its first number, for July 1916. This is a popular publication in Russian, the only popular medical publication in that language in the United States. The editors and owners of the little journal seem to be physicians, and it is intended for lay reading and lay instruction in sanitary and hygienic matters.</p>
   <p>The Review Editor is informed that the articles in the first issue deal with the care of babies and with problems of food and health. There is a story or two, and several poems lend variety to the more <pb facs="5423967_4_0183.jpg" n="2"/>serious discussions. We are informed by a Russian friend that the articles are very good indeed, and the fact that the picture of our good friend Dr. George F. Butler is used as a frontispiece bears out this judgment.</p>
   <p>We wish the editor Dr. Henry R. Krasnow and his associates success in their undertaking to enlighten their countrymen in matters pertaining to hygiene, sanitation and domestic medicine.</p>
