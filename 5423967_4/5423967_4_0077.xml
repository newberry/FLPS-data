   <p>The editorial relates the inner struggle that was going on in the various branches of the Russian organizations for mutual aid in Chicago, as well as in other cities where delegates had to be elected to the general convention of these organizations, to be held at Philadelphia on October 9, 1926. The author points out that owing to the intrigues of the Russian Bolsheviki, the convention could be converted by them into a political demonstration, frustrating thus its real aim and entirely misrepresenting the attitude of the Russian colony toward important issues.</p>
   <p>Those who were organizing the convention wanted it to consist only of delegates of the various societies for mutual aid who would discuss only questions concerning the work and interests of such societies, leaving aside the differences between various political parties. However, it had become known that delegates had been elected from groups and <pb facs="5423967_4_0078.jpg" n="2"/>societies that have nothing to do with mutual aid. Little was heard about delegates of the Chicago societies of mutual aid, but delegates were elected from the Communist Russian restaurant on Division Street, from he House of the Worker, and other Bolshevist organizations.</p>
   <p>Similar news had come from other cities. The aim was evidently to pass Communist resolutions by a majority of bogus delegates, thus misrepresenting entirely the true aims and aspirations of the membership of the Russian non-partisan organizations.</p>
