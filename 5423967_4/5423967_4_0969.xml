<title level="a">WORK DONE BY THE CONVENTION OF THE INDEPENDENT SOCIETY</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>The 20th annual convention of the Independent Society, as was to be expected, has successfully accomplished its work. During several months the Bolsheviks "worked" assiduously in order either to split this society or to get it under their own control, as they had done with R. N. O. V. (Russian Pittsburgh Society of Mutual Aid), but their work has not brought any results. Their ravings and slander directed against the old general administration of the Independent Society did not split the Independents and did not sow among them the seeds of dissolution, but, on the contrary, set them even more against that Slanderous Communist sheet which started the campaign of vilification. After that the Independents understood that the Bolsheviks are wolves in sheep's skins, against whom it is necessary to carry on a relentless war. Therefore the convention assigned to them not the honorable places, but the last ones. They all were convinced that they will play the first fiddle at the convention, but they found themselves in the last rows. They felt so depressed that they even did not dare to seat their reporter at the press table. When just <pb facs="5423967_4_0970.jpg" n="2"/>before the adjournment of the convention their leader Devyatkin attempted to make a speech, the delegates unanimously declared that they have no desire to listen to him, need no advice from him, nor his agitation. Mr. Devyatkin, thus, has suffered a heavy moral blow and was compelled to leave the premises.</p>
   <p>The Independent Society carries on its register 1572 members. Its capital reaches the figure of $50.000. Many of the Russian colonists considered the society to be a religious organization, but this opinion is quite erroneous, for the convention has adopted a resolution not permitting the clergy to join the Society.</p>
   <p>The convention adopted also resolutions on the necessity of state insurance of workers from unemployment. This testifies to the fact that the Independents go hand in hand with the organized American workers, striving to establish such a form of state insurance.</p>
   <p>Their resolution to this effect will be published in the Russian papers and a copy of it will be sent to the government in Washington.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0971.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>One main defect of the society so far has been that it paid very little attention to cultural and educational work. But this drawback has been recently understood by the members, and the society now decided to eliminate it as soon as possible. Members of the old administration as well as the delegates expressed themselves in favor of intensifying of the cultural and educational activity by means of arranging lectures, talks, debates and creating new children's schools in connection with its branches. The schools, in conformity with the Society's decision will serve as nuclei for Russian culture among the Russian-American youths, but not as dissiminators of religious or political doctrines. For that reason the schools should be freed not only of religious, but of Bolsheviks or monarchist propaganda as well.</p>
   <p>So far the Society has not had good lecturers at its disposal, neither had it any good organizers, but this draw back also will be dealth with, for the convention has instructed the new administration to prepare, disregarding expense, a staff of lectures and experienced organizers.</p>
   <p>As to the unification of the Society with the one in Pittsburgh(R. N. O. V.), which was captured by Bolsheviks, the delegates unanimously agreed <pb facs="5423967_4_0972.jpg" n="4"/>that no talk about joining hands with that Society will be permitted until and unless R. N. O. V. ceases to carry propaganda against the Independent Society and call the workers elected to the general administration of the Independent Society white guards and lackeys of the bourgeoisie. And as Bolsheviks from the R, N. O. V. (Russian People's Mutual Aid Society) will never discontinue this propaganda, it is safe to assume in advance that the Independents will never become amalgamated with their Pittsburgh Society. The Independents feel very friendly toward the rank and file of R. N. O. V., but they do not want to have anything in common with the Bolsheviks, who are the leaders of the Society. If ever the Independents are to invite with any Society, they will unite with Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America, (R. O. O. V.) for there is no distinction between the two.</p>
   <p>To the general administration of the Independent Society were elected old tried organization workers. All of them are workers, earning their daily bread by hard work, and we may assuredly say that Bolsheviks will call the new administration both monarchist or anarcho-white-guardian, as they used to call the old administration, and their chairman I. Goroshchenia (worker) will be elevated to the post of colonel <pb facs="5423967_4_0973.jpg" n="5"/>or general.</p>
   <p>But we shall hope that the new administration will give a proper rebuff to these slanderers and disorganizers, and will continue to work with added energy in the cause of unifying and enlightening the Russian colony.</p>
