   <p>Svobodnaya Rossiya in its editorial of December 20, 1920, gives full sway to its indignation at the Society for Medical Aid to Soviet Russia for failing to present an account to the newspaper (therefore, also to the entire Russian colony by implication) of the several affairs given by it. The proceeds of these undertakings were to be used for medial aid to U. S. S. R.</p>
   <p>"We repeat that until we have made an exhaustive investigation of the reasons for the society's refusal to submit its ledgers for revision to the conference (Chicago conference of workers' organizations) and our paper, we decidedly do not wish to throw on the society any shade. Nevertheless we hold that the duty of the society makes it imperative that it <pb facs="5423967_4_0396.jpg" n="2"/>should give a reply to the colony on the questions put by us, and it should present to the colony and the newspapers a full acount of its activities. "The Russian colony expects it without delay." The opening sentence of the editorial is a stimulation of its remarks in a previous editorial that "this society should in everything co-ordinate its activities with the demands of the Russian colony."</p>
   <p>The editor assures his readers that he was not actuated by lack of faith in this society, or in any of its members, when he made those remarks, but only by a desire that nobody in the Russian colony should harbor mistrust toward this society so that its work would be all the more fruitful.</p>
   <p>Then the editor complains that throughout the several weeks of its existence, this society has given but little information of its doings to the colony, and had sent to Svobodnaya Rossiya only one proclamation <pb facs="5423967_4_0397.jpg" n="3"/>in English, with a receipt for $715 collected from an affair given by the newspaper. "And how about the sums this society collected at various other affairs given by different organizations in Chicago, the affairs which the society itself gave; and the sums which it probably collected by other means but never reported them to the newspaper.... the colony is vexed, particularly by the disclosure of expenses of several individuals of this society in Detroit. This was disclosed by the Revision Committee of three.</p>
   <p>The editorial categorically requests an answer to its questions:</p>
   <p>(1) Why did the society deny its ledgers to be checked by the conference of workers' organizations? (2) Why did the society not send a report to the paper, and to other papers, on its activities and sums of money collected?</p>
   <p>The editorial warns the society that "to ignore these questions may <pb facs="5423967_4_0398.jpg" n="4"/>undermine the confidence of the masses." In such a case the society, having lost the patronage and support of the Russian colony, will not be able to develop its activities on a wide scale. The editorial approves of the purpose for which the society was organized.</p>
   <p>"But then the society must act so that the Russian colony can fearlessly give the dollars.... Let the society then become part of the Russian colony, and assume the obligation to render to the colony a full account of its doings, and accept the colony's control over itself. Then the colony will not be stingy with its dollars, which will pour in rapidly, and the aim of ten million dollars for Russia will be attained much sooner."</p>
   <p>The editor, in conclusion, threatens that in the event of a continued stiff-necked policy on the part of the society, the colony will not patronize the society's affairs, and will not give its money to the society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0399.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Let the society realize all this and immediately start on a policy of co-ordinating its actions with the demands of the Russian colony."</p>
