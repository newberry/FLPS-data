   <p>The well-known Bolshevik, V. Kuibiishev, (who died recently from heart failure) declared at the Moscow Re<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ional Congress of Soviets that "the currency of the Soviet Union is the most stable in the world" (Pravda, Jan. 12,).</p>
   <p>What was the purpose behind this senseless pronouncement of Kuibiishev's? Nobody knows. The stability of the Soviet currency is familiar, not only to the Russian workers and peasants, but to those foreigners who are interested in matters of international finance.</p>
   <p>According to the latest statement made public by the the Soviet State Bank, gold reserves of the bank are valued at 822,000,000 rubles as compared with 1,620,000,000 rubles in 1914. Even if we assume that the figure given is not exaggerated, we find that the Soviet ruble is only backed by 11.7 <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> gold. However, it seems to us that the value of the gold held by the bank is strongly exaggerated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1452.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If we were to determine the intrinsic value of the Soviet ruble by investigating the prices of bread and other articles of first necessity, we would find that the "stable Soviet ruble" is worth only a kopeck [Translator's note: one hundredth part of a ruble]. Thus, for instance, prior to the World War bread of good quality was sold in Russia for about two kopecks per pound. At present the price of bread of a lower quality is two rubles. Therefore, it can be readily seen that the present Soviet ruble is equal in value to one pre-war kopeck. If the Soviet currency is the most stable in the world the question inevitably arises: Why is it without value, not only abroad, but within U. S. S. R. as well?</p>
   <p>If Soviet rubles had any value they might be sold to foreign banks, but as a matter of fact nobody wants them. In Poland, Latvia, and other countries the Soviet rubles are sold for from one to two cents a piece. If some foreigner abroad buys a batch of Soviet rubles and attempts to carry them into U. S. S. R., the money is confiscated as if it were counterfeit.</p>
   <p>Besides this, in many Soviet institutions, as in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> only foreign currency <pb facs="5423967_4_1453.jpg" n="3"/>is accepted in payment for goods, and nothing can be bought with Soviet currency. This fact alone indicates that any foreign currency is more valuable to the Bolsheviks than their own ruble.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, we must remember that many Russian colonists still believe Bolshevik talks about the stability of the Soviet ruble.</p>
   <p>Recently, the following incident took place. One of our Chicago colonists somehow acquired several Soviet chervontsii [Translator's note: ten-ruble notes]. He telephoned inquiries to the various newspaper offices as to where these notes might be sold and at what price. When he was advised that the Soviet ruble is worthless and cannot be sold, he became indignant and declared that Soviet rubles have a very definite, fixed price. He was then told to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>o to any large bank and attempt to exchange his rubles for American dollars. Subsequently it became known that the inquirer who had been misled by Bolsheviks really went to the banks and tried to exchange his rubles for <pb facs="5423967_4_1454.jpg" n="4"/>dollars, but without sucess. The tellers in the banks even refused to accept them gratis. Only in this way did the Russian colonists find out the real value of the "most stable currency in the world". The Russian who had tried to exchange the rubles for dollars called Bolsheviks the greatest liars and cheaters in the world.</p>
