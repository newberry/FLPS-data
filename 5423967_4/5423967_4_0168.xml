   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society can now offer its members the same types of insurance as are handled by regular insurance companies. But the premiums or membership dues in this organization are much lower than those charged by regular insurance companies. The latter have tremendous overhead expenses, which must be added to the cost of the premiums and which must be paid by the policy holders. The mutual aid societies have very small overhead expenses, as their whole system of conducting the insurance business is based on the principle of fraternal aid; they employ no high-salaried salesmen or highly paid executives. For this reason, their insurance rates are very low for the types of protection which when provided by private insurance companies are very costly. This is why the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society can give its members much lower rates on any type of insurance usually handled by the private insurance companies.</p>

   <p>If a man wants to be the master of his own well-being and not a slave of the exploiting class, against which we are all waging a struggle, he should join an organization composed of men of his own social and economic class. In such an organization he will enjoy the full right of exercising supreme control over the money he deposits toward his old-age insurance.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the leading Russian organization in the Middle West. It not only gives its members economic protection, but it also serves as the foundation and the starting point for all activities concerned with the preservation and further development of the Russian group in Chicago and elsewhere in the Midwestern states of the United States of America.</p>
