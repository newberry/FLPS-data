   <p>As to the territory included in the Chicago Russian Orthodox bishopric, Rev. Sneghirev gave me the following information: The bishopric includes the states of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas and Iowa.</p>
   <p>The benevolent societies connected with churches of the Chicago bishopric are all branches of the following large organizations:</p>
   <p>1. The Society of Mutual Aid at Wilkesbarre, Pa. (Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi v Wilkesbarrye, Pa.) Address of headquarters: 84 E. Market St. Wilkesbarre, Pa.</p>
   <p>2. United Russian Brotherhoods in America at Pittsburg, Pa. (Soyedineniye Russkikh Bratstv v Amerikye.) Address of headquarters: Columbia Bldg., 248 4th Avenue, Room 311, Pittsburg, Pa., P. O. Box 1043.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1000.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3. Society of Russian Brotherhoods in Pennsylvania. Address: 1732 Brandywine St., Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
   <p>4. Society Lubov (Obshchestvo Lubov), Mayfield, Pa., P. O. Box.</p>
   <p>5. Women's Orthodox Mutual Aid Society (Zhenskoye Pravoslavnoye Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi.) Address: 62 Katchum St., Pittsburg, Pa.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are eight brotherhoods and sororities intimately connected with the Holy Trinity cathedral. Rev. Sneghirev was able to give me information about the approximate date of the founding of only a few of these brotherhoods. It would require a special investigation in order to find out all the particulars about the rest of them.</p>
   <p>These are the chief eight brotherhoods and sororities:</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1001.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>1. The Troitskoye Bratstvo, a branch of society no. 4 of the previous list. This is the oldest brotherhood. It was founded 25 years ago.</p>
   <p>2. Nikolayevskoye Bratstvo, a branch of society no. 3, founded 20 years ago.</p>
   <p>3. Vladimirskoye Bratstvo, a branch of society no. 3, founded only 2 years ago.</p>
   <p>4. Blagoveshchenskoye Sestrichestvo (Sorority of the Annunciation), a branch of society no. 5, founded 20 years ago.</p>
   <p>5. Pokrovskoye Sestrichestvo (Sorority of the Patronage of the Holy Virgin), a branch of society no. 5, founded 4 years ago.</p>
   <p>6. Trekhsvytitelskoye Bratstvo (Brotherhood of the Three Saints), a branch of society no. 2. The date of founding could not be ascertained.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1002.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>7. Krestovozdvizhenskoye Bratstvo (Brotherhood of the Erection of the Cross), a branch of society no. 2. Date of founding not ascertained.</p>
   <p>8. Kirillo-Mefodievskoye Bratstvo (Brotherhood of the Saints Cyril and Methodius), branch of society no. 4. Date of founding not ascertained.</p>
   <p>D. Stranden</p>
   <p>(Note: Rev. Sneghirev told me that there were nine brotherhoods and sororities connected with the Troitsky Cathedral, but this must be a mistake in the list he gave me (where) there are only eight names. D. S.)</p>
