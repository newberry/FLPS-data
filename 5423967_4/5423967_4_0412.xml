   <p>Fellow citizens!</p>
   <p>Powerful Russia is drowning in blood in her struggle to liberate mankind from ages of oppression. Russia has sacrificed millions of human beings on the altar of freedom. She is now on the verge of exhaustion. In that country all strongholds are about to crumble down.</p>
   <p>The great Russian nation is left naked and bare from head to toes. Some months back the Russian people sent its representatives to America with instructions to state the truth, i. e., to unfold before America the true state of affairs in Russia and to petition America for help.</p>
   <p>One of these emissaries, Mr. Kladnitsky, came to us, representing 70,000 railway workers, skilled and unskilled. He said to us that these 70,000 people are sending their supplication to us that we collect old shoes for them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0413.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second emissary was Mr. Fabian, delegate of the All-Russian Peasant Soviet, also of the Moscow Regional Committee for Provisions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fabian was even more definite in his statements. He said that all of Russia is not only barefoot, but naked as well, and is begging us to collect old shoes as well as clothes for Russia. In a conversation with me in New York, Mr. Fabian told of the real condition of Russia and begged me upon my return to Chicago to appeal to all Russians of Chicago that they help organize collections of old clothes and shoes.</p>
   <p>Fellow citizens!</p>
   <p>It is clear from the above that our brothers and sisters in Russia are in a horrible predicament. We must therefore begin at once gathering donations and relay the gifts to them as soon as possible, Delay is unthinkable. It spells death.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0414.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Fellow citizens!</p>
   <p>Let us discard all differences at least temporarily. Let us unite in the name of this great cause, and with concerted efforts start gathering appeal and shoes to send to our brethren across the ocean.</p>
   <p>Is it not true that everyone of us is closely following events in Russia? We hardly speak of anything else. Just as soon as order is restored there, and the life of the Russian nation once again flows normally, we shall all go back to our native land, and this is why we must help her now, all we can.</p>
   <p>The Russian organizations in Chicago should be first to start this activity and should thus set an example for the entire Russian population in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Fellow citizens, let us unite for this purpose. Let us create a joint committee from our representatives, who will honestly and conscientiously discharge this sacred duty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0415.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Russian Club "Znaniye" (Knowledge) takes the initiative of calling the first organization meeting of this committee to take place in the club rooms. Select your delegates and we shall inform you by mail as to the date of the meeting.</p>
   <p>I. Erin.</p>
