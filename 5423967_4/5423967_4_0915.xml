   <p>Today, workers in many countries [of the world] will celebrate their own workers' holiday. This holiday, however, will not be a solemn one because it will be marred by Communist speeches and demonstrations. Everybody knows the Communists defile anything they touch. They besmirched the name of freedom, revolution, the word "comrade," the workers' hymn, "The International," as well as the holiday of May Day. As a result, many workers have discarded "The International," the Red banner, and even May Day.</p>
   <p>This is quite natural. Formerly, May Day was a day commemorating the workers' struggle for freedom and their fight to improve their economic lot. The Bolsheviks have made May Day into a day of struggle for the destruction of freedom and the greater enslavement of the workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0916.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is true that they will speak of freedom and of fighting capitalism, but when they speak of freedom, they mean slavery. As far as captialism is concerned, they are not fighting against capital, but for the possession of it; they are not fighting to destroy it, but to take it away from those who have it, and to put it into their own pockets. They will shout from the roof tops against exploitation and capitalist governments, but they will do it only for the purpose of placing themselves in the positions of the exploiters and rulers. The Communists will also denounce the barbarism of those capitalist governments which will not permit them to hold demonstrations, but they will not utter a word against the unheard-of barbarities perpetrated by the Communist government of Russia.</p>
   <p>In Posledniye Novosti [Translator's note: a Russian daily newspaper published in Paris], I. Solonevich, who just recently escaped from Russia, tells of how the Communists suppress insurrections. The revolts that took place at Chechen and Kuban in 1932 were brutally suppressed, with the aid of airplanes and gas bombs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0917.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I know of a revolt that took place near Moscow (in the region of Bogsrodsk, in 1931) where such methods were used. Tanks were employed for the final liquidation since some of the peasants had managed to run away. The business of putting down uprisings has been perfected by the Communists to the last degree. They use the most up-to-date technical means; they employ the most modern espionage tactics (G. P. U.), the most up-to-date means of communication (telephone and radio), and the latest weapons of destruction (tanks, airplanes, and gases). Uprisings are suppressed in such a way as to discourage any repetition of expressions of discontent."</p>
   <p>As a result of this procedure, no one is left unharmed in the places where uprisings occur. None of the people or cattle are left on the scene. Everything is annihilated by the artillery fire and poison gases. The whip was used as a weapon of punishment in the feudal period. Now yperit (a highly poisonous gas) has taken its place. The landlords used to punish peasants by flogging them, but the Bolsheviks destroy and exterminate whole villages by the use of shell and gas. This is the kind of freedom for which the Communists are fighting today.</p>
