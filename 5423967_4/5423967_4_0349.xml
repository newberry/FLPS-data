<title level="a">IMMIGRANTS FROM SUKHOTENTSY SHOW SOME ACTIVITY</title>

  <body>
   <p>A group of Russian Chicago immigrants from Sukhotentsy, a village in the province of Volyn, decided some fifteen months ago to have a school built in that village by means of money collected here.</p>
   <p>During fifteen months that group of farmers from Volyn succeeded in raising the sum of $725. Now a school is being built in Sukhotentsy. The immigrants from Volyn are rejoicing because they have been able to realize their modest plan, and now they are thinking about giving some further help to their countrymen in that district.</p>
   <p>It is a modest plan, but one deserving to be fully endorsed and encouraged by the colony.</p>
   <p>How desirable it is that more similar tasks would be undertaken and realized in the same unobtrusive, modest way ....</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0350.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some good has been achieved with the help of the money raised by the Vlynians: a school has been built. And the population of the province of Volyn needs schools very badly.</p>
