   <p>The American Information Bureau (Flis) appeals to the readers of your newspaper to co-operate as much as possible in fighting prejudice and intolerance with respect to foreigners and citizens of foreign origin. Like many other countries, America has always shown a certain degree of unfriendliness toward "foreigners". The lack of employment and general conditions created by the crisis have only deepened these prejudices. At present bills are being introduced in Congress which provide for the deportation of all foreigners from the country, and some of them would even prohibit their employment. Of course, one should not admit even for a moment that any of these rash proposals are ever destined to be enacted.</p>
   <p>For both the immigrant coming to this country and for the United States it is very important, however, to put certain restraints upon this prejudice and distrust. The first thing that should be done in this matter is to establish certain facts and make them known. The injustice of putting obstacles in the way of those people whom we voluntarily accepted for permanent <pb facs="5423967_4_1267.jpg" n="2"/>residence in this country is too obvious and glaring. We may rely on the sense of fair play of the country once the facts are established and properly presented to the judgment of the public.</p>
   <p>But what are these facts? We request your readers to advise Flis of all personally-known cases of unjust treatment to individuals or groups of people just because they happened to be either foreigners or people not of native descent; or of cases where national prejudices manifested themselves in matters of rendering help, or giving employment; of cases where unfriendliness was manifested in schools, or in public life; of cases where intolerance was manifested just because of the nationality of the person or group involved, etc.</p>
   <p>We need such facts from all over the country. As far as possible, indicate the names and places where such incidents happened. In all possible cases steps will be taken to verify the facts and repair the harm done. Correspondents' names will not be made public under any circumstances, of course.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1268.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At this time even many of the native citizens suffer from various injustices. We are interested at present not in the general conditions and tendencies, but only in cases where men and women suffer indignities because they are not citizens or because they were not born in this country.</p>
   <p>We hope that the readers will give us their co-operation in such a vital fight against prejudice and injustice.</p>
   <p>Please address all letters written either in English or Russian to:</p>
   <p>Fair Play Editor, F.L.I.S., 222 Fourth Avenue, New York City.</p>
   <p>Reed Louis, director of Flis</p>
