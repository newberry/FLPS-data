   <p>During the last three or four years there has been in existence in New York a relief fund for needy scientists, artists and writers in Russia. During that time several thousand dollars have been collected and spent for that purpose.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sophia A. Novakovsky was the Chicago representative of this fund. She has succeeded in enrolling here a good many members. The membership fee is $3.00 per year. Besides these fees the fund was being replenished by the proceeds from various enterprises, such as lectures, concerts, etc. A concert which has been arranged a short time ago in New York with the participation of artists of the Moscow Arts' Theater brought about $1,000.00 of profit.</p>
   <p>As to its purposes this organization is a strictly non-partisan one; it has nothing in common with any institutions or organizations of a political character and pursues only the aim of relief to the above mentioned needy people.</p>

   <p>A Committee of this Relief Fund has been organized recently in our city, and this Committee aims to become a branch of the New York organization. Last Friday this Committee arranged for the first time a concert which took place in the private apartment of Dr. Zhak, who was so kind as to put at the disposal of the Committee this large apartment. This enabled the Committee to save the considerable sum of money which would have been spent otherwise on the renting of a hall.</p>
   <p>The best artists of the Chicago Russian colony participated in this concert. They refused to accept any renumeration proving thereby that they were in sympathy with the purpose of the concert. About 150 persons attended the concert and were very pleased with it. Among the artists who participated in the concert were: Mr. Amtek (a young talented violinist); Mr. Aster (a wonderful pianist who has recently come from Russia); Mr. S.A. Borovsky (an opera singer, very popular in Chicago); Miss Mina Isayev (a favorite of the Chicago public); Mr.L.I.Kopelevich-Luganov, ( a popular dramatic artist) and his talented wife, Mrs.E.L. Les-Luganov, an actress; Y.P. Lukin (a celebrated barytone of the Russian opera and a member of the troupe of Baliev's "Bat"), and the talented young pianist, Mr.J. Rayev.</p>

   <p>The public appreciated the performance of everyone of the talented artists, and there was a lot of applause.</p>
