   <p>Allow me the hospitality of your pages so that I may speak directly to your readers in a matter of vital importance to every foreign-born person living in this country who is not a citizen of the United States.</p>
   <p>The fact that Bruno Richard Hauptman, accused of kidnaping Lindberg's child, is an alien who illegally entered this country has served as an impetus for renewing the clamor that our deportation laws be strengthened and that all aliens be registered. As a result of this anti-alien campaign, the American people may become inoculated with the idea that all aliens living in America are undesirable and should be deported.</p>
   <p>Such an assumption is absurd and does not conform to reality. According to the report of a special commission appointed by President Hoover for the <pb facs="5423967_4_1273.jpg" n="2"/>purpose of studying law observance in this country, the foreign-born population of the United States has a much lower crime rate than the native-born American population. If registration is desirable, it should include all the people of the United States, not merely the aliens and immigrants as a group set apart from the rest of the American people. It may be noted here that the kidnaper Hauptman was an alien liable to deportation throughout his entire residence in the United States. The fact that he had not been discovered and apprehended before, is not to be attributed to any defects in the present immigration law.</p>
   <p>This does not mean, however, that our present immigration laws are perfect and are in no need of revision and improvement. In some cases, our immigration laws are too severe; in others, they are not sufficiently rigorous. For instance, there have been cases where alien criminals have been repeatedly imprisoned as habitual lawbreakers; yet they could not be deported because of some technicality in the present immigration statutes. The Labor <pb facs="5423967_4_1274.jpg" n="3"/>Department recently introduced an amendment to the immigration law, according to which an alien criminal who has been found guilty of two serious offenses may be deported to his native country at any time the law decides. This is a reasonable and desirable improvement of the present law, and we hope it will be passed by Congress.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, there exists an obvious necessity of modifying those clauses of the present immigration statute which concern alien residents in this country who have never violated any of the criminal laws of this nation. The Foreign Language Information Service, an American organization, is working for changes in the present immigration law, so as to make it more flexible and more easily applicable to individual cases. These changes, if approved by Congress, will eliminate many unnecessary worries and privations now suffered by thousands of innocent people who might be liable to deportation because of the lack of clarity and the ambiguity of the existing immigration law. The Foreign Language Information Service opposes compulsory registration <pb facs="5423967_4_1275.jpg" n="4"/>of foreigners and is against any harsh measures tending to make life difficult for the alien population of the United States. This organization demands that all law-abiding aliens who entered this country illegally, but who are no longer subject to deportation, be given an opportunity to legalize their residence here and to become citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>There are other phases of the activities of the Foreign Language Information Service. Many of the readers of foreign-language newspapers published in this country are well acquainted with our work through the articles released by our organization to the foreign-language press. We receive thousands of letters from foreign-born people throughout the United States on all questions pertaining to their legal rights, their citizenship status, and their families abroad. These inquiries are given careful attention before answers are returned. Persons who are unemployed or who are otherwise unable to pay for this service receive the same consideration and attention as those who are able to pay a small sum to cover the expenses incurred.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1276.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Foreign Language Information Service is able to carry on its useful work through membership dues and through voluntary contributions. At the present time, this organization is greatly in need of funds to continue its work. Soon Congress will convene, and we will then be very busy in exerting all our efforts to secure the changes in the immigration law outlined in preceding paragraphs. Readers of foreign-language newspapers who wish to join us in our work can be of great assistance. Their contributions, no matter how small, will be greatly appreciated. A membership card costs two dollars a year.</p>
