   <p>Meetings are held every second Sunday of the month.</p>
   <p>Persons between the ages of sixteen and thirty years are accepted at this bureau in January and July without an initiation fee; between forty and forty-five, for half of the initiation fee. Those desiring to enter the bureau may register every Sunday at the quarters of the Russian National School, 917 N. Wood St., telephone Monroe 5179.</p>
   <p>We risk our life daily, which is dear to us and our relatives, by working in factories. After an unfortunate accident in a factory, frequently the family of the victim, having lost its breadwinner, is placed in a critical <pb facs="5423967_4_0142.jpg" n="2"/>condition. With little children on her hands, the poor widow does not know where to lay her head and how to get the means for feeding her children.</p>
   <p>In the majority of cases the victim himself is at fault. He has not protected himself and his family against accident.</p>
   <p>In order not to get into a situation of this kind, hurry to register before it is too late.</p>
   <p>D. Michalchik, President</p>
   <p>Radion Poleshuk, Cashier</p>
   <p>Andrei Hapanowich, Secretary.</p>
