   <p>A Russian colonist who is dreaming about his return to the native country, in talking to one of the local Bolsheviki, reproached the Soviet government for closing the borders of Soviet Russia and forcing him to roam aimlessly in foreign countries. In replying to him, the Bolsheviki remarked that the Soviet government would welcome the return of the Russians, but cannot help them because there is no representative of that government in the United States. If the colonists desire to return to Russia, they must try to get such a representative. Such reasoning is not right, says the editor.</p>
   <p>The political break between Russia and America has nothing to do with the return of Russians to their native country. In the years of 1920 and 1921 there also were no representatives in America, still many colonists, both single persons and whole groups, went to Russia without hindrance. Thus, the assertions of the local Bolsheviks do not stand criticism. The Russian people cannot return to Russia, to their relatives <pb facs="5423967_4_0879.jpg" n="2"/>and friends, only through the fault of the Soviet government, because it closed the borders.</p>
   <p>The Soviet government must open them again for the Russian workers, irrespective of the fact that they have or have not their representative in this or some other country.</p>
