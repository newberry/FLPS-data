   <p>The editorial office of the RNzOV, Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) summons all branches of the RNzOV to protest against the heinous murder of our fellow independent, Vladimir Semenovich Levkovich. The assassination was committed from behind a corner by several bolshevik gangsters, who with their weapons attacked the helpless worker of the fifteenth branch of the RNzOV.</p>
   <p>The deceased V. S. Levkovich was one of the most active members of the editorial office of the RNzOV, an active member of the fifteenth branch of the RNzOV, an important member of the school board of the RNzOV, and a great and ardent defender of the interests of the RNzOV, against the attacks of the bolsheviki <pb facs="5423967_4_0474.jpg" n="2"/>upon the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>V. S. Levkovich was born in the village of Kartuz-Berezi, county of Pruzhansk, state of Grodno, Russia. While he was still a young and vigorous man, he met his death at the hands of a murderer; he was only thirty-eight years of age. He leaves his widow, Sophie Iakovlevna Levkovich and two children, Victor, nine years of age, and Theodore, seven.</p>
