   <p>The Ukrainian Workers Home, whose Chicago branch is located at 2457 W. Chicago Avenue, is a national organization the purpose of which is to spread culture and education among its nationals in the United States. Headquarters of the above organization is in New York City.</p>
   <p>The Chicago branch was organized in 1914, but was re-organized in 1924 under the name of the United Ukrainian Toilers Organization. It is also connected with the I. W. O. (International Workers Order), and Ukrainian Women's Educational Society under the name of Lesia Ukrainiska. The United Workers Home also extends help and aids its nationals abroad whenever the opportunity arises. The above organization is non-partisan, and any Ukrainian, regardless of his political affiliations, may join that organization. They hold their meetings <pb facs="5423967_4_0146.jpg" n="2"/>twice a month at the People's Auditorium, 2457 W. Chicago Avenue. Frequently lectures and plays are given by the Ukrainian Workers Home, in which the youthful organization of the I. W. O. takes a large part. The membership of the Ukrainian Workers Home is between 350 and 400.</p>
