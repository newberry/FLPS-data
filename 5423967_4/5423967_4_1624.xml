   <p>Our life in America is closely connected with our peasant brothers in Russia, or, as they call it, the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. The link that binds us is our common peasant interests. Everything that is going on over there, good or bad, is deeply interesting to all of us, since we greeted in the past the revolution against tsarism and its military, clergy and civil opritchniks (henchmen of the tsar), and expected that with the victory of the revolution the three-headed dragon would pass into the domain of history, and instead of it the cherished idea of freedom and equality will triumph. During the six years since that time and now, the people of the former Russian empire, who suffered so much, have survived many revolutions and counter-revolutions. During that period of time we have heard and read many undescribable horrors about our country on one hand and many attractive things on the other.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some exaggerate and others lie. Who is to be believed? Who is right? Who is guilty of the horrible experiences of the weary people? One thing is clear: it is an axiom that he who is strong in power and a conqueror is also right, because conquerors are not judged; but woe is to temporary conquerors! There is hardly a more beautiful moment in the whole of human history than the great February Revolution of 1917. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> without bloodshed, unspeakable joy of a world fond of liberty incarnated in those happy days, the high ideals of the best fighters for the liberation of millions of people, who are deprived of their rights from bondage. All the people of new Russia felt like brothers, were kissing each other, and were weeping from joy. The World War was a terrible inheritance of the revolutionary Russia. While the new revolutionary government was clearing up the inherited tsaristic horrors, international war and chaos, the Bolsheviks took advantage of <pb facs="5423967_4_1626.jpg" n="3"/>the revolutionary freedom and confusion and skillfully using all kinds of slogans, suggested to the army they leave the lines and enjoy the hard won liberty, etc. The results were: the disbandment of the disbandment of the Revolutionary Constituent Assembly with the aid of bayonets; the Bolshevist regime; the Brest-Litovsk farce or the concluding of peace; the horrible Chrezvychayka; the general exile and destroying of those people and intellectuals whose ideas were opposed to the ideas of the Bolsheviks; idiotic money experiments; the thorough abolition of the freedom of press, speech, and meetings; exciting the criminal civil war, which, if not for the Ukrainian ataman, Machno,would have signalized the restoration of tsarism in Russia; the most horrible famine in the history of the human race; exile to Siheria and the far Siberian swamps, executions of upright revolutionaries who gave away everything for the fight for the liberty of the people, and many other traps, which were arranged by the Bolshevist powers against the will of the great majority of the whole population. These are the indisputable achievements of the Bolshevist or Communist powers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1627.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There was a time when, if we could not agree, at least we could reconcile ourselves to supporting the Soviet regime during the monarchical counter-revolutionary period of Kolchak, Dienikin, Yudenich, and Wrangel. "Help us to defeat the tsarist generals who are attempting to re-establish the tsar," cried the Bolshevist leaders, "and we will begin to live again a free brotherly life." The Bolsheviks at that time had not yet shown their teeth to the people, and the people, preferring the lesser evil, absolutely destroyed all the counter-revolutionary plots of the tsaristic generals.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks triumphed and forgot about the people, in the same manner as the Russian tsars in the past. The Communist clique felt that it was the master of the situation. The salt of Russian and Ukrainian soil, the peasants, were plundered, worn out, unscrupulously deceived and deprived even of the sacred right to decide their own affairs; they were almost deprived of the right to vote. And all for the sake of a few <pb facs="5423967_4_1628.jpg" n="5"/>uncalled for, newly arrived rulers. One should be insane to believe in the good intentions and soundness of the Bolshevist authorities.</p>
   <p>Russia moaned three hundred years under the Tartar yoke. But what comparison! The Mongols at least did not pretend to be liberators; they did not lie. The Bolsheviks had, seemingly given to all nationalities national freedom on the basis of the Union of the Republics, but from Moscow was sent a decree "to hold and not let it go." The red army and its commanders are trembling for their lives; silently and dejectedly they are obeying the orders from the Kremlin. But, will that be always the way? The iron discipline!. Such is the secret of their power. Is there even one family in Bolshevist territory which did not suffer, or did not lose some relatives as victims of the Bolshevist fury? Who, if not the Bolsheviks themselves, are exciting the anger of the people, driving the people to despair and into a state of submission even to the monarchical regime which is emerging again in Russia? We should not protest against <pb facs="5423967_4_1629.jpg" n="6"/>the recognition of the Soviet power by other countries, as we did not demand in the past the cessation of relations with the tsaristic power by other countries. On the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> relations with the outside world, together with a certain pressure exercised by the love of liberty, can either bring the Bolsheviks to their senses, or else against their will they will have to face the same fate the same fate which befell the tsarist regime of blessed memory.</p>
   <p>We must hope that by some means or other the torturing of the people of our country will be stopped. It is impossible to stand it any more and be silent. The cup of patience is overflowing. We, peasants, more than the rest, have been suffering under the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of one tyrant or another. We must make them feel that we are a class which gives all and gets nothing but insults, oppression and mockery.</p>
   <p>We who demand land, <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and liberty, are peasants, but we are peasants of the past. We are persons, able to sacrifice, to fight, <pb facs="5423967_4_1630.jpg" n="7"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="unk" reason="[blank]"/></p>
