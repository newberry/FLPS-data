   <p>[Sabbatarian--one who prefers Saturday as a day of enjoyment rather than Sunday].</p>
   <p>The program given by the "Subbotniki" (The Sabbatarians) of the Russian-American Citizens Club on Saturday, November 26 was highly successful. The performance of the artists led by Caesar Arrigoni was gay and exciting. All performances of the artists on the program received generous and hearty applause.</p>
   <p>After the concert, guests and members of the club danced until late to fine music.</p>
   <p>An excellent buffet with choice foods and real Russian tea, served from the samovar,were served by the beloved Mamasha, A. A. Michaylowskaia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0851.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In general, this affair was much different from our regular run of entertainment. Gaiety, comfort and hospitality prevailed.</p>
   <p>The guests, as they departed, extended their heartfelt thanks for the fine program to the sponsor and C. Arrigoni, and voiced the hope that it would be continued regularly.</p>
   <p>It was a pity that comparatively few attended the affair. The reason was that four other Russian affairs were held on the same evening, and there were other unforeseen complications.</p>
   <p>Because the hall of the R.A.C.C. has been rented to other organizations, it is a pity that our "Sabbatarian's Eve" will not be held again until Saturday, December 17, instead of each Saturday, as had been planned.</p>
   <p>Caesar Arrigoni, with his troupe, is preparing another program, which promises to be very interesting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0852.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We beg you to remember that at each Sabbatarian affair you attend, you will see an entirely different program.</p>
   <p>Again we remind our friends in the Russian colony that our next "Sabbatarian Eve" will be held on Saturday, December 17.</p>
   <p>The Russian-American Citizens Club and Caesar Arrigoni with his troupe extend a cordial invitation to you to attend the above-mentioned affair.</p>
   <p>With sincere welcome,</p>
   <p>R.A.C.C. and C. Arrigoni.</p>
