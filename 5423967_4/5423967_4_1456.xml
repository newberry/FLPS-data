   <p>Esteemed friends and workers! Who cannot but remember the year 1917, when we were fired with enthusiasm and energy, when we were responsive to every worthy cause! Our most active comrades were everywhere awakening the toiling masses from their century-long slumber, and were doing everything in order that freedom might triumph.</p>
   <p>We also remember how mercilessly Mr. Palmer broke up Russian organizations. The majority of our most progressive and active men were jailed and deported to Russia. In those days deportations did not frighten us; on the contrary, we rejoiced at the thought: They were deported yesterday; we shall be deported today. We took pride in the thought that we were leaving for a free Russia, and that there, on the ground of our fallen revolutionary comrades, we would build a new life based on equality, freedom, and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>At that time, we were imbued with the single idea: freely organized workers' and peasants' soviets. We rejoiced that the Russian people had freed themselves <pb facs="5423967_4_1457.jpg" n="2"/>from their century-long oppression and slavery. But our joy was short-lived. Our dreams were shattered. Heavy clouds again hang over Russia; gloomy darkness pervades the country. Marxian communism has destroyed all the achievements of the revolution. A new Asiatic Tamerlane, Mr. Stalin, has appeared with his gang of degenerates. The Bolsheviks, with their Jesuit dictatorship, have outdone the Spanish Inquisition and John the Terrible. The victims of the Inquisition and of John the Terrible were numbered by the tens or by the hundreds, whereas the Bolsheviks destroy human lives by the thousands. They still continue to shoot down innocent people. They have driven all free-thinking Russian workers into concentration camps and jails, and have deprived them of all contact with the outside world. Consequently, their groans and protestations cannot reach our ears.</p>
   <p>For this very reason, the Russian Mutual Aid Society has appropriated twenty-four dollars from the proceeds of its evening program to help political prisoners in Russia. Part of the money should be used to maintain the Kropotkin museum in Moscow.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1458.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We call upon all Russian organizations and groups to follow our example--to arrange entertainments and to contribute at least part of the proceeds to help those who endure torture, hunger, and cold at Solovki [concentration camps on the islands in the White Sea], in Siberian forests, and elsewhere.</p>
