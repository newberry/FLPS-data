   <p>In the development of military aviation and the chemical industry of Soviet Russia, a tremendous role was played by officers of the German Army (Reichs-wehr), who after the defeats of the war of 1914-1918 were unemployed.</p>
   <p>The beginning of German influence can be traced to 1922, when the Soviet government and Germany concluded a secret agreement concerning armament and equipment of the Red Army by air and chemical means.</p>
   <p>From the economic standpoint, this agreement was beneficial to Germany to some degree, for part of the chemical supplies and aviation equipment, which were supposed to be destroyed, was sold to the Soviet government.</p>
   <p>However, Germany did not receive even one hundredth part of what she expected. Germany expected to entrench herself on the limitless plains of Russia, if not <pb facs="5423967_4_1430.jpg" n="2"/>forever, at least for a few decades, because the Bolsheviks, as Germans were well aware, lacked their own experienced aviation and chemical experts. To a great many aviation and chemical men, the German dreams were real and grandiose, indeed.</p>
   <p>Shrewd and experienced German industrialists, who entered the agreement with the Bolsheviks, thought they took every possible circumstance into consideration. However, in reality, that was not true. The practical Germans failed to take into account a very important consideration: the fact that the Bolsheviks' tactics were to utilize somebody else's capital and technical knowledge, and then to throw the benefactors overboard as useless refuse. That is what the Bolsheviks did to the Germans three and a half years later.</p>
   <p>In the second half of 1922, German aviation experts arrived in Moscow, signed a contract for five years and in Fili, near Moscow, built the first airplane factory. All technical equipment was brought from Germany. The technical personnel and workers were also German at the beginning. During the same year, the first Russo-German aviation company named Deruluft came into existence, and organized <pb facs="5423967_4_1431.jpg" n="3"/>the first air line between Moscow and Koenigsberg.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1923 another group of German officers built a small chemical plant twelve miles from Moscow, between the towns of Liubertsi and Liublino, which was designed to produce chemicals for military purposes. In the beginning, only a few score men were employed at this plant and the entire personnel was German. In the beginning the plant did not produce any chemicals, but was engaged in loading mines, chemical artillery shells, poisonous smoke grenades, and inflating gas balloons. All this was done on the territory which later on was assigned as a scientific research testing field.</p>
   <p>In the beginning the process of loading and testing, as well as the experiments in the use of gas, were performed in the most primitive way.</p>
   <p>As the country grew economically and the Bolshevik authority became stronger, the influx of chemical materials from Germany also increased, and with it the activity at the plant increased.</p>
   <p>This development was short-lived, however. Gradually the Bolsheviks trained <pb facs="5423967_4_1432.jpg" n="4"/>their own specialists, and began to build two huge chemical plants of their own: one in Moscow, named later the Chimik-Rezintcshik, producing rubber goods, and the second, in Bogorodsk, forty miles from Moscow. When, toward the end of 1925, both plants. But as the contract was to continue until 1927 the Bolsheviks resorted to their choicest method of removing obstacles from their path. One autumn night, during the month of September, they set the plant, and the living quarters of the German personnel, on fire. Only a warehouse with chemicals remained intact. The living quarters were consumed to the last ember. Later on the Bolsheviks charged the Germans with wrecking the plant, which in another year would have reverted to the Soviet government.</p>
   <p>Soon after that, the other group of German officers in Fili was thrown out of the aviation plant. It is true that some of the German specialists worked at the plant until Hitler appeared on the scene in Germany, but they remained there only as Soviet employees.</p>
