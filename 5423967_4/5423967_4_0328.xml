   <p>A meeting arranged by a group of Russian workers for the purpose of organizing a branch of the Russian Emigre' Children's Aid Society was held on Thursday, October 12.</p>
   <p>The order of business was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The report of the organizing group</p>
   <p>2. The election of a temporary committee</p>
   <p>3. The institution of an "Aid Day" for the benefit of Russian children</p>
   <p>4. The working out of further plans of action</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0329.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>5. Miscellaneous matters</p>
   <p>Twenty persons were present. They all warmly approved the idea of organizing such a branch. Mr. I. F. Erin, unanimously elected chairman of the meeting, read the report of the initiating group. This report well presented the unhappy lot of the Russian emigrants' children, scattered all over the globe. The chairman mentioned the work of this Russian society in other countries, and pointed out the necessity of organizing the proposed branch in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The report made a deep impression upon those present; and it was decided to form a branch society under the above-mentioned name, and immediately to start collecting funds and begin active work in the aid of Russian children.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Huber made a motion that a collection be taken at the meeting. The motion was unanimously carried. The collection totaled ten dollars,thus <pb facs="5423967_4_0330.jpg" n="3"/>marking the beginning of this charitable institution of the Russian colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A temporary committee of seven was elected, composed of the following persons: P. Maksakova, chairman; N. I. Vishnievsky, vice-chairman; I. E. Erin, recording secretary; A. V. Maksimova, financial secretary; Mrs. Huber, treasurer; Mrs. Bernard and A. D. Dobrokhotoff, members of the committee. The committee was instructed to add other useful co-workers from among the colony. After the committee had been elected those present at the meeting made a solemn promise to help it in its work. Then the members began to make various recommendations, many of which had been well thought out, and were very useful. One of the recommendations suggested the issuance of subscription blanks, to be used in securing contributions; another proposed collecting old tinfoils, old furniture, old clothing, etc., which could be sold, the proceeds to be turned over to the Society. Another recommendation proposed asking the cooperation of all Russian organizations; also asking the Russian Emigres' <pb facs="5423967_4_0331.jpg" n="4"/>Children's Aid Society in New York for literature on the activities of that Society. Other suggestions referred to arranging a concert and ball as soon as possible, and to asking Russian artists in America for help and co-operation. One suggested that the committee write a letter to the Slavonic League at the University of Chicago, a student organization.</p>
   <p>The temporary committee of the Russian Emigrees' Children's Aid Society of Chicago made the following declaration:</p>
   <p>1. Having before us the great and sacred aim of bringing help to unfortunate Russian children, we take upon ourselves this difficult task, feeling deeply our moral duty toward these young unfortunates.</p>
   <p>2. In the near future we shall call a meeting of all Russians taking part in our welfare interests, in order to elect a permanent committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0332.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We have heard it asserted that woebegone critics in the colony are beginning to harm our great work by spreading complaints, and are asking why we do not organize aid for needy Russians of all types in Chicago. And hereby we declare that it would be beneficial to organize aid for local needy Russians of all kinds, like the aid to Russian children; but we find that nobody suffers such sharp and urgent need as the Russian orphans, children of the Russian emigrees, because they are defenseless and without aid. The large majority of them are complete orphans; others have parents who are invalids or are suffering from insanity, tuberculosis, or other grave diseases which exclude them from any possibility of gainful work.</p>
   <p>Of such unfortunates we speak here, and of such orphans. There are tens of thousands of them here, in Europe, and in many other countries. Can any one of sound mind protest against organizing aid for the unfortunate children of Russian emigrants scattered over the world? These unfortunate children find life extremely cruel, as they are completely neglected, or in the care of <pb facs="5423967_4_0333.jpg" n="6"/>orphanages or other philanthropic institutions. In the majority of cases, however, they are kept at the expense of the Russian Emigrees' Children's Aid Society. And therefore we consider it necessary to organize a branch of this Society in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we appeal to all Russian immigrants in Chicago and vicinity for support of our new Society, and for contributions at the altar of the sacred cause of helping these unfortunate sons and daughters of the Russian emigrees everywhere.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Temporary Committee of the Russian Emigrees' Children Aid Society:</p>
   <p>I. F. Erin, secretary</p>
