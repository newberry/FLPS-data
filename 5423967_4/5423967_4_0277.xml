   <p>On February 20, 1937, I had the opportunity to interview the president of the Chicago Society for relief to the children of Russian emigrants, Mr. Ivan Philippovich Erin, at the headquarters of the Russian American Citizens' Organization, 1902 W. Division Street. Mr. Erin's address is 2150 Cortez Street.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Society for Relief to the Children of Russian emigrants was founded in October 1933. Mr. I. F. Erin has been the president of this society since that time. The names of its other officers are as follows: Mr. N. Vishnevsky, vice-president; Mrs. A. V. Maksakov, financial secretary; Mr. A. D. Dobrokhotov was the recording secretary until October 1934; since that time the archdeacon Alexander Lovanov has taken his place; Mrs. Anna Guver was the first treasurer; later this office was held by Mrs. E. K. Derezyuk, and lately Mr. M. Levandovsky had taken her place. At present it is filled by A. V. Maximov.</p>
   <p>After the society had been organized, the following persons joined it:</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0278.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>the archpriest Rev. Serghey Sneghirev and his wife; the Rev. Vasiliy Antsyferov and his wife and the Most Rev. Leontiy, bishop of Chicago and Minneapolis, who is the Honorary President of the Society. Later were added the following members: the archpriest Pavel Nervana; the Archimandrite Timon and the Rev. Mular. The total number of members of the society at present is thirty-eight.</p>
   <p>The object of the society is to give relief to the children of Russian emigrants in European and other countries. The work done by the society consisted in collecting donations in the form of money and of various articles, in collecting membership fees and dues and voluntary contributions, and arranging entertainments, etc. The sums collected by the society were as follows: in 1933 the net profit was $45, in 1934, $257.08, in 1935, $363.82; in 1936, $389.82. Before the first of January, 1937, the total amount of money collected by the society was $1,055.72. This money has been sent to orphanages.</p>
