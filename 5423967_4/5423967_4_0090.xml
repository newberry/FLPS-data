   <p>Under such a title there appeared on the pages of the newspaper Russian Herald an article by the people's priest, Rev. Zheltonoga. This is a new and very interesting undertaking in our colony. But for some reason the members of the colony who are so eager to see the Russian colony united into one family kept silent about the very thing which should not be passed by or suppressed by keeping mum about it. Maybe, writes the priest, if we have not been able until now to get organized because of various dissensions and conflicting political views, our children will be an example for us in this respect. Children, he says farther, do not know anything about politics, and therefore it is easier for them to get organized. This is perfectly true. Children ignore politics, there is no malice in them; they are still perfectly free of all those impure, coarse thoughts and feelings which permeate all our being. The children will help us; I believe in that. But we also must help our children from the very start in their good undertaking. It seems to me <pb facs="5423967_4_0091.jpg" n="2"/>that the newspaper should be helpful to the children and should find on its pages some room for juvenile literature, for reports about the activities of juvenile organizations; and, what is most important, the newspaper should try to interest persons who can wield a pen in the needs of the children in order that such persons would write plays for children and help thus to organize a juvenile theater in our colony. This work has bean already done in Boston where plays staged by a troupe of children amateurs had more success in the local Russian colony than these staged by a troupe of grown-up persons.</p>
   <p>The priest writes further; as yet we are alone in helping the children start this praiseworthy undertaking but we think that the other schools will join us and will open in their quarters branches of a juvenile mutual aid association. And it seems to me that not the children of our People's School alone, but the children of all Russian <pb facs="5423967_4_0092.jpg" n="3"/>schools in Chicago should tackle right away this enterprise under the leadership of their teachers and parents. And the parents ought to point out to the teachers that the latter should explain to the children the utility of a juvenile organization and help them to build up such an organization. We are living in American and we do not observe what American children and children of more progressive foreign colonies are doing. We Russians alone have got used to lagging behind. We are always expecting that somebody will come to us and drag us along with a rope towards the light and towards the good. Well, somebody may come and drag us; yet perchance he will drag us not towards the light and towards the good, but towards the saloon or the jail. It is deplorable that every leader of an organization, be he clever or a dolt, wants to be at the head of the whole colony of the any undertaking that is going to be started. Egoism, self-interest are always the cause of the ruin of all that is good. We are all acquainted with that period of the history of our native country when it was divided into appanages, <pb facs="5423967_4_0093.jpg" n="4"/>and we know what terrible suffering was caused by the quarrels and fights of petty rulers. It was the people that had to bear the burden of these fights and to get broken skulls and maimed bodies. Yet in spite of all that we have not learned to stand together as one well-knit body; instead of that we are following like sheep various storytellers, believing their yarns about the necessity of autonomy not only of every nation, but almost of every district of Russia.</p>
   <p>The dismemberment of the nation (of the Russian nation) into nationalities is useful only for separatists. We, old people who have been demoralized by dissensions and politics, are approaching the end of our lives being disunited; but could we possibly desire that our children should be shattered, ground to dust and crushed by the iron heel of stronger, solidly united people? I do not think that any father could be a conscious enemy of his child.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0094.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Perhaps someone will say: But what good can come from something that is undertaken by church people? Well, in some strange way almost every useful innovation that we have here in our Chicago colony has been started and accomplished by the church people of the people's parish. Where have the Russian people's schools in Chicago come from? The beginning was made by the people's parish. Its members founded the first Russian school on Wood street. The second school, that on the South Side, was founded by the people's priest, Rev. Zheltonoga and parishioners (the South Side School, near Douglas Park...) and only much later there arose some other people's schools. Is this a bad record? The first people's organization was the Independent Mutual Aid Society on Wood street which after thirteen years has grown into a colossal society having many thousand members.</p>
   <p>Last year there arose in Chicago several other benefit societies for women and for men. The people of the Independent parish must be given full credit for the work done by them for the benefit of the whole <pb facs="5423967_4_0095.jpg" n="6"/>colony; they deserve praise for their initiative in starting useful undertakings. The Juvenile Mutual Aid Society which is being organized now in connection with the Wood Street People's School cannot but acquire the sympathy of the colony and of the teaching personnel of the other schools. Be of good cheer, children of the "Independents!" Do not lose courage if you meet with some set-backs. You will not be left alone to work in the sacred cause of helping the poor; all the children-pupils of the Russian people's schools of Chicago will follow in your steps.</p>
   <p>May we see as soon as possible a program to be performed by children at an entertainment to be given by children for the benefit of the hungry and the crippled. And I believe that if such an entertainment were announced, the West Side Auditorium would be too small to hold all the public that would like to get in. May God grant success to the young organizers.</p>
