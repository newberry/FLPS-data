   <p>Recently there have been a great many arrests in Moscow among communists, anarchists, and even among other people who at one time or another belonged to revolutionary organizations before the revolution. Most of the arrested men had not participated in politics for many years.</p>
   <p>Among the arrested men there are many foreign communists, including German immigrants. Particularly unlucky are those who seriously supported the United Front policy, and collaborated with Socialists abroad and expressed their approval of such collaboration.</p>
   <p>The arrested foreigners are given the choice of repatriation or exile within the boundaries of the USSR, with an assignment to work on orders from the Communist International. Among the arrested are former anarchists <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and Sandomirsky, and several foreign journalists.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Lately a great deal of friction has developed between the communists of the older generation and the communist youth. In many communist families a dram is taking place within the family circle: a relentless struggle is going on between parents and children. Youth is complaining about the ever-narrowing sphere of independent activity. Youth hates the fact that it is being compelled, more and more, to act on orders and instructions from above. When the Soviet press cites certain incidents and practices [common] in Germany under Hitler, many young communists point out that "the same thing is being done to us; we too, are having our will subjected to an ever-increasing flow of orders from above; we too are being intimidated."</p>
   <p>It is rumored that young <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>ikolaev held such opinions. It is said that Nikolaev carried a diary with him at the time he assassinated Kirov, and that he wrote down all his thoughts and disillusionments during the seventeen days preceding the crime. From the entries in the diary, one can readily understand that personal and political motives were interwoven in Nikolaev's mind, and <pb facs="5423967_4_1419.jpg" n="3"/>this resulted in his ultimate decision to kill Kirov, one of Stalin's strongest supporters. When one reads the diary, one can clearly see Nikolaev's growing resentment against things as they are and his ever-deepening conviction that under the prevailing order of things, nothing could be done, nothing could be improved. <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to the assassinagtion, he had handed in to his superiors two written statements: one addressed to the Politburo (Translator's note: the Political Bureau is the highest body in the Communist party of Soviet Russia), and the other, to the Control Commission.</p>
   <p>Upon his return from Leningrad, where he personally conducted investigations in connection with Hirov's murder, Stalin called a conference, during which the dictator proposed two ways of handling the episode: first, he recom-mended that all communists who had had even the slightest and most indirect dealings or contacts with Nikolaev, should be severely punished; second, that <pb facs="5423967_4_1420.jpg" n="4"/>consideration should be taken of all circumstances which breed resentment and hostility among that part of the population on which the Soviet government has a perfect right and logical reason to rely. For this purpose he proposed to give greater freedom to political expression and to undertake certain steps for a rapprochement with the peasantry.</p>
