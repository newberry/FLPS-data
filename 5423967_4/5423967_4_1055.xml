   <p>On Sunday, December 30, 1934, in the schoolrooms at 1121 North Leavitt Street, the annual business meeting of the congregation of St. George's Cathedral took place, under the chairmanship of His Grace Bishop Leonty of Chicago. The meeting was opened with the singing of "Our Heavenly Father". Before proceeding with the agenda, Bishop Leonty briefly described the activity of the congregational council during the year 1934, and explained the reason for the success or failure of this or that undertaking.</p>
   <p>The Bishop said:</p>
   <p>"Even though last year was a depression year, the affairs of the congregation are not in a bad state. It is true that at times our financial pledges were late in coming in, but, nevertheless, the congregation has not gone into debt. Social gatherings during the past year brought only a small income. To say, <pb facs="5423967_4_1056.jpg" n="2"/>however, that members of the congregation did not co-operate fully in the undertakings, would not be a true statement. They put all their efforts into every undertaking.</p>
   <p>The drawback was that many active members had to divide their time between the purely congregational matters and those of numerous other organizations. In order to avoid the scattering of energy in the future, we shall eliminate this condition by taking the proper steps. There was a time when the task was to build new organizations, and now the time has come to unite the existing ones.</p>
   <p>"Last year, our parish arranged a jubilee affair with the help and participation of members from other congregations. This year, other parishes had their own jubilee and we had to help them.</p>
   <p>For this reason, our members have not had sufficient time to devote to the affairs of their own parish."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Bishop Leonty expressed his thanks to the trustees, to the <pb facs="5423967_4_1057.jpg" n="3"/>managing committee, to all the members of the congregation and to all those who, in one way or another, had participated in the affairs of the church and parish.</p>
   <p>Then the semiannual report of the committee was read into the record with the unanimous approval of all those present. The report of the committee did not reveal anything of importance. A report of the finance committee approved by the auditors, was adopted. In this report, the cemetery ground was also appraised at over $10,000, according to the member who gave the report. If we included the amounts which are due for burials, we may consider that the cemetery ground has been paid for in full.</p>
   <p>The election of officers was next, and the interest of those present became more lively. The head of the board of trustees was to be elected first. A motion was made to re-elect the present chairman of the board. He accepted the nomination and was re-elected. He received forty-three votes as against thirty-six for the other candidate.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1058.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Meetings of the members of this congregation are in no way different from meetings of other organizations. Lack of discipline interferes with the smoothness and efficiency of the procedure. The limited space on the school premises is conductive to a full display of temperament by those members who are emotional by nature. A large number of people attend and the room is small. All officers whose candidacies were opposed, were elected by secret ballot.</p>
