   <p>The author of the article is trying to make it clear that it is not his intention to deny the horror of the shocking crime committed by Loeb and Leopold, but he would like to clear up the question as to whether Loeb and Leopold are really such highly intellectual youths, as some of the papers are representing them to be , and super-intellectuals, as the reporter of the Chicago American portrays them. They did not discover any new laws of nature, says the author, they did not create any immortal works in the domain of literature, science, or philosophy. There is nothing that these heroes have ever contributed to the above fields.</p>
   <p>If the journalists, in hunting for cheap sensations, would not exaggerate and attribute extraordinary qualities to persons who are not higher than any average intellectual, then maybe we would not witness inhuman acts committed by the "cultured," "educated," and heartless Leopolds. If.....</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0481.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If there were no Leopolds there would be no sensations, and if there were no sensations there would be no means of existence for "literary" workers, such as reporters of the Chicago American and other papers.</p>
