  <body>
   <p>Our Mutual Aid Society, which is the oldest and most reliable Russian colonial organization of that kind in the central states, issues this appeal to you, being sure that it will attract your attention. The Russian People's Orthodox Society in Chicago, at 917 N. Wood Street, usually known in our Russian colony under the name of "The Independent Society" - serves exclusively the interests of the Russian immigrants to the United States.</p>
   <p>You all know how lonely and estranged from the new American surroundings a Russian immigrant often feels. You know how difficult it is to the Russian newcomer, when he gets into trouble - meets with accident and is injured, or falls sick - how difficult it is for him in <pb facs="5423967_4_0038.jpg" n="2"/>such cases to get help from the surrounding people, to get some comfort or some good advice.</p>
   <p>Conditions are still worse when a Russian immigrant is dying under circumstances when there are neither relatives nor good friends near him, and when he does not even belong to some organization that takes care of such cases. And even if the dying man has friends, these are sometimes kept so busy by various matters that they cannot fulfill properly the last duty they owe him.</p>
   <p>In such cases it is invariably our people's organization for mutual aid that comes to the rescue - an organization created by immigrants, people of the same class to which the deceased man belonged, being one of those Russians who have left their native country and have come to the United States, hoping to be able to earn here their daily bread. This people's organization which takes care of its members in cases of sickness and accidents, and also in cases of death, is the Russian <pb facs="5423967_4_0039.jpg" n="3"/>People's Orthodox Society in Chicago, Ill. It exists already 18 years and is well known in many cities and towns of the central states.</p>
   <p>Until lately the R.P. O. S. has been able to give relief to the family of the deceased person only to the amount of either $400 or $800, according to the rate of payments. But since the last (the 18th) convention of all the branches of the R. P. O. S. there are four categories of members. The sums paid to the beneficiaries in case of death of the insured person now depend on the payments, as follows: $400, $600, $800, and $1,000. The applicants for membership must be not less than 16 years old, healthy and possessing all the other qualifications enumerated in the by-laws of the R. P. O. S. These by-laws can be had in every branch of the R. P. O. S. There are branches in Chicago; Argo, Il.; Indiana Harbor, Ind.; Benton Harbor, Mich.; Detroit, Mich.; and in some other cities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0040.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As it was previously, now also those wishing to become members of the society, can do so on exceptionally easy terms during the period from July 1 to August 15 inclusive: those less than 30 years old, without paying any entrance fee, and those in the age of 30 to 45 years - by paying a smaller entrance fee than usual. Every year many of the Russian immigrants avail themselves of this opportunity offered to them in the summer. Every year the branches of our society, brotherhoods, etc., and sororities - recruit many new members during the period of time mentioned before. The exceptionally easy terms offered at that time to those wishing to join the society seem to be much appreciated by the Russians, as most of these are comparatively poor people who earn every dollar they own by hard labor.</p>
   <p>Avail yourself of this opportunity and become a member of one of our branches.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0041.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Not only adults, but also children can have their life insured in our society. There are branches for children, from the age of 1 to 16 years. The premium paid in case of death is $300.</p>
   <p>The R. P. O. S. is very busy now organizing such branches for children (connected with the regular branches for adults), because these branches will provide our society with successors to the older members. We can trust the young members to continue the work undertaken by their fathers.</p>
   <p>Finally in places, cities, suburbs and towns where there are not any branches of the R. P. O. S. in existence as yet, nor any individual members, any seven persons, desiring to join the R. P. O. S. and to insure themselves against disease and accidents or to apply for death insurance, can form an independent branch. All necessary information, the by-laws, etc., can be secured from the Board of <pb facs="5423967_4_0042.jpg" n="6"/>directors of the society, at 917 N. Wood Street, Chicago, Ill. In case of necessity the Board can send a special organizer (paid by the board) who will help the new branch to get organized the right way and give the necessary information about the activities of the society.</p>
   <p>Thus, citizens and compatriots, do not lose any time and join your own people's organization for mutual aid, the R. P. O. S. in Chicago. In doing this you will support the people's cause, so important for all of us, who have had to settle in a country that was foreign to us.</p>
