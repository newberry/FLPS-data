   <p>The meeting is called to order at 1:45 P. M. S. G. Prokopov being chairman and Dr. L. G. Pertzov (Kaluzhin), secretary; K. L. Kotsyubinsky, treasurer, and the members S. Gladyk, V. V. Kotov, V. I. Pustovoitov and the following non-members: Nikolai Kotov, Ivan Osipik, R. Birunov, Y. M. Prokopov and some others.</p>
   <p>The order of the business of the day:</p>
   <p>1. The question as to the further work of the organization.</p>
   <p>2. The question as to the debate about the White Russians.</p>
   <p>3. About the yearly entertainment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0218.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>4. The financial report.</p>
   <p>5. Current business.</p>
   <p>The chairman reads the order of the business of the day which is accepted unanimously. In connection with the discussion of item (1), the right of the floor is given to Mr. Pustovoytov, who insists that the Center should not only exist, but also progress as before; and in order to achieve that,business should be tackled energetically.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Pustovoytov's speech the secretary reports about the measures which had been taken in August in order that the cultural work of the organization should be revived with new energy.</p>
   <p>Resolved: To sanction several measures taken by the secretary, such as invitation of lecturers, negotiations concerning securing convenient quarters, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0219.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As to item 2 of the order of the business of the day, there arose a lively discussion between the secretary on one side and Mr. Kotov and Mr. Pustovoytov on the other. The right of the floor is given to one of the non-members, Mr. Ivan Osipik, who believes that "no one else but the organization bearing the proud name of 'Russian Center' must protect Russian culture from the attempts of such men as Mr. Voronko to detract this culture; therefore, the Russian Center must arrange this debate."</p>
   <p>"These men are nonentities," Mr. Ossipik agrees in this respect with the opinion of the chairman. "But," says he, "by their activities they are doing a great deal of harm to Russia by influencing the minds of the uneducated masses, and therefore, it is necessary to oppose them."</p>
   <p>A motion made by the chairman that the debate should be organized is accepted. It is declared to the secretary that the assembly does not find anything in his actions that would transcend the authority with which he is invested as secretary of the organization, and that a <pb facs="5423967_4_0220.jpg" n="4"/>statement to this effect should be communicated to the press. While all this was under discussion, the chairman broached the question about the notorious appearance in the local press of an article, the author of which was V. Kotov, a member of the Center, who had signed the article adding to his name the title of "assistant chairman," while no such office exists in the organization. Kotov begs pardon for this action of his, and declares that he understood that "with us all offices are only temporary" and that therefore, he used the title of "assistant chairman" as one which he had assumed only temporarily. Mr. V. Pustovoitov moves that Mr. Kotov's action in using this assumed title in the press, should be considered as a misunderstanding, and that this matter be dropped.</p>
   <p>As regards item 3 of the order of the business of the day, a delegation is elected. consisting of Mr. K. L. Kotsyubinsky and Dr. L. G. Pertsov (Kaluzhin), which should negotiate with the newspaper Rassviet about a reduction of the sum owed to this newspaper for advertising the last ball.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0221.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As it is getting late the chairman moves that the discussion of the remaining items of the order of the business of the day be postponed till the next meeting. The motion is carried unanimously.</p>
   <p>The following persons are nominated as candidates for membership in the Center:</p>
   <p>1. Mrs. Y. M. Boreisho</p>
   <p>2. Mrs. R. Birukov</p>
   <p>3....... (Note: Two names are crossed out. D. S.)</p>
   <p>4.........</p>
   <p>5. D. Sedlovsky</p>
   <p>The discussion of their eligibility is postponed till the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting is adjourned at 3:15 P. M. The next meeting is to take place on Saturday, September 24, at 9:15 P. M.</p>
