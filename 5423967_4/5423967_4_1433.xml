   <p>The Soviet Embassy in Berlin has made public some interesting information concerning the external indebtedness of Soviet Russia. According to this information the external debts of the U.S.S.R., which were fourteen hundred million roubles in 1932, have been reduced by four hundred and fifty million roubles. During the year 1934, a considerable part of the remaining sum was paid. (In all probability gold roubles are meant in the statement.) The Bolsheviks claim that Soviet Russia, in contrast to all other countries, is the only country that pays its financial obligations (!).</p>
   <p>The indebtedness of the U.S.S.R. to Germany, according to official German data, was reduced from eleven hundred million marks in the beginning of 1933 to eight hundred million marks by January, 1934, and later on was further reduced to five hundred and fifty million marks.</p>
   <p>The payment of Soviet debts to Germany was covered partly by the sale of<pb facs="5423967_4_1434.jpg" n="2"/>goods and partly by shipments of gold.</p>
   <p>During the most recent period Germany received over two hundred million marks worth of gold. This was made possible by the ever-increasing production of gold in the U.S.S.R., which stands second in the world after the Union of South Africa in this respect.</p>
   <p>The improvement of the credit standing of the U.S.S.R. in Germany gave the Soviety Trading Agency in Berlin an opportunity to appear with the statement that in regard to foreign credit, the Soviet commercial policy has reached a turning point, and in the future the U.S.S.R. will purchase goods only for cash and will reject all offers of credit if the credit charges, as in the case in English transactions, are too high. The plan of the U.S.S.R. to switch to cash purchases was reported in the press some time ago, and now the Soviet Trade Agency in Berlin only confirms this report. The English financial press, on its own behalf, remarks that the interest rate on Soviet credits, together with the "risk premium" amounts to eleven per cent. These charges, in the opinion of the Soviet government, are too high. The U.S.S.R. feels <pb facs="5423967_4_1435.jpg" n="3"/>that the Soviet state will be able to dispense with the purchase of certain commodities abroad, and that the Soviets have only to bide their time and wait for the credit terms to improve.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that recently the credit charges on Soviet purchases in Germany have been lowered. This is partly due to the reduction in Soviet purchases, because the number of promissory Soviet notes presented for discount is also falling.</p>
   <p>According to informations supplied by a reporter from a Swiss newspaper, negotiations between the U.S.S.R. and Germany concerning new trade deals have not yet begun in earnest; the new Soviet trade representative, Mr. Kandeliaki has not taken up his duties. German government circles count on the possibility of signing a general trade agreement with Russia on the basis of which Germany will be able to open the U.S.S.R. credits amounting to two hundred million marks. In the industrial circles, however, it is considered doubtful whether that amount of credits will make possible the receipt of large Soviet orders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1436.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As far as the range of prices bid by the Bolsheviks is concerned, on the average it is thirty-five per cent lower than that of two years ago. This decrease in prices by the Soviet trade agents is not acceptable to German industry. Therefore, if the negotiations reach the stage when large deals are to be closed, besides the state guarantees on credits, state export subsidies will be required. The German government will hardly consent to this.</p>
