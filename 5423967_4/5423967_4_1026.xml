   <p>The actual foundation of the Chicago parish was laid by His Grace Nikolai at the time of his visiting the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, when he consecrated the pavilion of the Russian section of the fair. Let us also mention, while about it, that the dedicated pavilion was given as a gift to the Streeter Russian Orthodox parish after the World's Fair was closed, and that the parish erected out of it a very beautiful temple. As if it were only yesterday, do I remember the first Russian church in Chicago: a three room house which was rented at 13 Center Avenue, with Father Ambrosy Vretta as superior. The parishioners were few. Later on, when Father Joann Kochar was assigned to Chicago, having just then graduated from the Petrograd Ecclesiastical Academy, the work of developing the parish became twice as hard. Through donations from Russia, Father Joann secured a suitable plot of land on North Leavitt Street, in 1899, on which he built the present cathedral and the big rectory.</p>
