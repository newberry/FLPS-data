   <p>Last Sunday St. George's parish, 917 North Wood Street, celebrated its church holiday. The church services were conducted by the Right Reverend Archbishop Tikhon of San Francisco; the Reverend P. Nirvana, the Reverend A. Mazura, and the Reverend Mr. Andronikov assisted. The church was filled to overflowing with worshippers. Around it crowded people who were unable to get in. Sermons were preached by Archbishop Tikhon and by other officiating priests.</p>
   <p>After the church services a banquet was arranged at Lenard's restaurant, where representative people from various Russian organizations gathered for the occasion. Members of the church on Wood Street predominated at the tables.</p>
   <p>Toasts were prenounced by the Right Reverend Archbishop Tikhon, the Reverend P. Nirvana, Mr. M. Rubezhanin, representing Rassviet, and others.</p>
