  <body>
   <p>Bruno Austin, who was arrested on the steps of the Russian cathedral church, at Leavitt Street, while emerging from the church after his wedding ceremony, of which fact we had already informed our readers, is charged by Federal agents with participation in the plot to kidnap an old Polish banker by the name of Bremer. The plotters demanded $200,000 for his release. Twenty-two accomplices are implicated in the case, among them Austin. He is also charged with the theft of an automobile.</p>
   <p>Austin is a Lithuanian by descent. He married a Russian girl by the name of Brenko, 18 years old. He was not given a chance to stay with his young bride, because Federal agents arrested him as he was leaving the church.</p>
   <p>The bridegroom is being kept in the county jail pending an investigation.</p>
