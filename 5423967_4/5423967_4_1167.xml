   <p>A short account is given of the foundation in American cities of Russian Churches independent from the Holy Synod. The priest Pieshkov in Chicago is mentioned as the pioneer of this movement among Russians in America. The chief aim was to have priests elected by the parishioners, and the Church funds to be under the control of the same.</p>
   <p>The Independent Churches, according to the author, "are also more sensitive to modern ideas, are willing to satisfy the cultural needs of the parishioners and their desire for enlightenment, keeping at the same time aloof from any political movements."</p>
   <p>In 1917 there were in existence two "Independent" Russian Churches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>(Note. The origin of the Independent Church in Chicago was due not to any disagreements with the ruling hierarchy about dogmas or political views, but to some quarrels about the expenditure of church funds.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1168.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As to the "non-political" character of the movement, it is, as far as I know, not quite exact. Some of the Priests of the Independent Church on Wood Street did use it for the propaganda of socialistic and communistic ideas.</p>
   <p>At present the Independent Churches in Chicago have been reconciled with the Russian Orthodox Church of Chicago and recognize the authority of its bishop Leontiy. More information can be had from the Rev. Nirvana. D. S.)</p>
