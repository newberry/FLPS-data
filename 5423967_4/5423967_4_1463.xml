   <p>The Bolshevik diplomats sent to this country from Moscow are now beginning to take notice of Russian emigrants living in this country. Because they have nothing more important to occupy themselves with, they propose to devote their attention to the task of "re-establishing" the Soviet citizenship to all Russian emigrants living in America. They will also receive petitions for amnesty from those White Guards and other enemies of the Soviets living in this country who now desire to become loyal to the Soviet government. The Soviet diplomats will also try to register all the actual citizens of Soviet Russia who now reside in this country.</p>
   <p>The official announcement, placed in American newspapers by Mr. G. I. Hoffman, director of the consulates, which are under the control of the plenipotentiary of the U. S. S. R. in the United States, states that <pb facs="5423967_4_1464.jpg" n="2"/>"former Russian citizens now living in the United States may have the opportunity of applying formally for the re-establishment of their U. S. S. R. citizenship."</p>
   <p>Striking in this announcement are the words "former Russian citizens" instead of "former Russians." But who deprived them of their country and of their right to call themselves Russians? We were deprived of our Russian citizenship by the Bolsheviks, who, as internationalists, argued that the workingman had no fatherland, that the whole world was his fatherland, and that any country that offered him a better living was his country. If this is so, it would seem to be of no point for the Bolsheviks to worry about Russian or any other citizenship. By one of their first decrees they deprived of Russian citizenship all those who left Russia before November 7, 1917, and all those who left for foreign countries with the permission of the Soviet government before June 1, 1922, and have not returned, and have failed to register at the Soviet consulates in foreign countries as U. S. S. R. citizens. "But now, if you please, you may again <pb facs="5423967_4_1465.jpg" n="3"/>become a Soviet citizen, if you take proper steps," say the Soviet authorities. And in order to hasten things up Mr. Hoffman sets a six-month period within which petitions should be filed for the restoration of the Soviet citizenship.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoffman is willing now to go even so far as to spread these Soviet citizenship benefits upon the former common soldiers of the White Army and upon other participants in armed uprisings against the Soviet regime. Even these counterrevolutionaries are now offered the Soviet citizenship, if only they express their desire to that effect in a special petition which must be filed not later than December 15, 1934.</p>
   <p>However, Mr. Hoffman does not mince words when he speaks to the real Soviet citizens who reside in this country. He tells them plainly to register immediately either at the official headquarters in Washington or at one of the Soviet consulates. He gave two weeks' time to register to those who were sent here by the Soviet government on official business and failed to report their whereabouts, and three months' time to those Soviet <pb facs="5423967_4_1466.jpg" n="4"/>citizens who came here on private business and failed to return.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the U. S. S. R. representatives in America first want to "restore" Soviet citizenship to Russian emigrants in this country, and then take them under their guardianship and control.</p>
   <p>Prudently, Mr. Hoffman's announcement mentions nothing of the fact that the restoration of citizenship, and registration, and other official functions are to be paid for by the petitioner with good American money. How much? We do not know at present. It is known, for instance, that the Soviet government skins its citizens well and pretty for similar services in Russia. For the foreign visa the U. S. S. R. charges five hundred dollars in foreign currency. The fee for the entry visa into the U. S. S. R. is twenty dollars.</p>
   <p>This is not bad business, and it is no wonder that Soviet diplomats in this country, needing badly the American dollars, have hit upon the idea <pb facs="5423967_4_1467.jpg" n="5"/>of restoring Soviet citizenship to Russian emigrants in America, in order to use it as a pretext for extracting their dollars.</p>
