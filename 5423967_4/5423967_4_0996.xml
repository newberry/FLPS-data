  <body>
   <p>The archdeacon told me that the Independent church on Wood Street is under the jurisdiction of Archbishop Vitaly of New Jersey and East America, not under the jurisdiction of Bishop Leontiy.</p>
   <p>As to the income of the churches of the Chicago diocese, Rev. Lobanov could not give me any exact information. Each church has a record of its own, but the cathedral could not give any correct information now as to the period from 1907 to 1917. Some of the old records have already been destroyed, and it would take a long time to ascertain all the data that could be useful to us.</p>
   <p>Rev. Lobanov gave me, however, a book entitled Na Nivye Bozkiyey (On God's Field), published in 1931 by the Russian Orthodox Church in Gary, Ind., in Southbury, Conn. (The Alatas Printing Shop)</p>
   <p>I take from pages 193 and 194 of this book the following data which, according <pb facs="5423967_4_0997.jpg" n="2"/>to Rev. Lobanov, are also typical for the Chicago churches, except the cathedral and a few of the minor churches.</p>
   <p>Income (net profit) of the St. Mary's Russian Orthodox Church of Gary, Ind.:</p>

   <pb facs="5423967_4_0998.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This total does not include the money acquired through mortgaging church property.</p>
   <p>As to the parochial schools could not give me any exact information either. There are no classes for adults. With almost every church there is connected a school for children. These schools had names of their own, while the Russian Orthodox Seminary existed. Since this seminary has been abolished (in 1918 or 1919), the schools are simply called: Parochial School of the St. Michael Church, etc. (according to the name of the church).</p>
   <p>Number of pupils of the Gary schools:</p>

     <cell>Total number of pupils</cell>
     <cell>135</cell>

   </table>
   <p>To get any exact information about the Chicago churches and schools would require a special investigation.</p>
