It has a membership of about 200, varying in age from 15 to 25 years, with girls predominating, that is, about 40% boys and 60% girls. In addition to the death benefit which this organization offers its members (from $100 to $2,000), the purpose of the organization is social and cultural advance. Lectures, dancing and dramatics are the chief cultural undertakings in which its members indulge. The organization has given several plays in the past. Dances are given a number of times during the winter season, and in the summer, open air picnics are arranged. The organization helps in bringing out the best qualities of its youth, whether they be vocational or otherwise.</p>
