   <p>A much-publicized editorial concerning the improved living conditions of workers in U. S. S. R. appears in Pravda on January 19. It states that the average annual earnings of Soviet workers in 1934 amounted to 1,791 rubles, or 149 rubles a month.</p>
   <p>During the current year, due to the abolition of ration cards, wages of workers and employees will be increased 10%. The average earnings will, therefore, amount to 165 rubles per month.</p>
   <p>Since the whole matter revolves around average wages, this means that many workers and employees earn more, and a great many others, considerably less. From this same editorial it can be seen that in U. S. S. R. there exists an immense army of workers and employees who during the last year <pb facs="5423967_4_1447.jpg" n="2"/>earned less than ninety rubles per month.</p>
   <p>If the Soviet ruble now had its pre-war value, we would have been forced to agree with the Bolshevik statements which tell us about the betterment of living conditions for workers and employees. But their claims will not hold water, because the Soviet ruble of this period is worthless.</p>
   <p>To obtain a true picture of the situation confronting the Soviet worker, one must evaluate the workers' earnings in relation to the prevailing prices of the most important consumer articles. The prices are as follows:</p>
   <p>When ration cards were in existence workers and employees were paying from 50 to 60 kopecks for a kilogram of bread; now, the Soviet workers pay a ruble for a kilogram of black bread and the equivalent of over two dollars for a kilogram of white bread. For a kilogram of millet they formerly paid 27 kopecks; now the price is 3 rubles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_1448.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>According to the newspaper, Sovietskaya Torgovlia (Soviet Trade), of December 17, 18, and 20, a kilogram of butter in the Soviet stores costs from 26 to 32 rubles; a kilogram of sausage, from 17 to 25 rubles. New trading prices in many cases are high r than those existing in the open market places.</p>
   <p>Prices at the open market places, according to the same newspaper, are as follows: butter (per kilogram) from 19 to 23 rubles; vegetable oils from 12 to 18 rubles; liter of milk from 2 to 21/2 rubles; ten eggs from 5 to 8 rubles; meats from 6 to 12 rubles.</p>
   <p>A single worker, if he earns about 165 rubles a month,has a difficult time subsisting. He can buy bread, a kilogram of butter, and some other products with his money. But if a worker is burdened with two or three children, all his earnings will have to go toward buying bread. As far as other products <pb facs="5423967_4_1449.jpg" n="4"/>are concerned he cannot even think of buying them.</p>
   <p>Knowing the earnings of Soviet workers and the prices they have to pay for products of the utmost necessity, our readers can readily see what "prosperity" Russian workers enjoy under Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>
