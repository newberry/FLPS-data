   <p>Strange as it would seem, yet we Russians are constrained to raise our voice against recognition of the government, of the country of our birth by the government of the United States. In doing so we have in mind the future well-being of the people concerned directly and welfare of the humanity at large.</p>
   <p>No matter how interpreted and taken, recognition means support, promotion of the system we recognize. Seemingly inconsequential as a mere formal act it gives prestige and weight to those whom we recognize not only in the eyes of people outside of Russia, but, what is more important, of the people of Russia, depriving them of the impulse to fight and struggle against the system which has been foisted on them by a group of unpractical power-mad visionaries.</p>
   <p>Unlike many sentimentalists in this country who know nothing about the government system they favor, we base our attitude on intimate knowledge of the general conditions in the country over which the bolsheviki rule for the last fifteen years. We know their aspirations, their methods and the results so far attained. We are not being deceived by any falsehood or unscrupulous propaganda spread far and thick to mislead millions of innocent and honest people abroad into thinking that there has been something accomplished in the land of soviets. As Russians we have only pity <pb facs="5423967_4_0675.jpg" n="2"/>for the Russian people groaning under the soviet rule. As Americans, we hold near our hearts the interests of our adopted land. As socially conscientious citizens we endeavor to promote the welfare of humanity at large. We have no personal grievance against the soviet government, we do not belong either through birthright or personal achievement to inimical classes which the soviet government seeks to exterminate. We are plain American citizens of Russian extraction. We came here to seek personal freedom and opportunity to work and prosper. No one can accuse us of being prejudiced or biased.</p>
   <p>Let us, then, state our case and the conditions as we know and understand them. Ever since the question of recognition of the soviet government gained prominence in public press and discussion, the proponents of it dangled before the American people the commercial gains and advantages to be derived through diplomatic rapprochement between the two countries. Sordid appeal to commercial gain has been the decoy in the hands of those who themselves denounce and deny any personal aggrandizement at the expense of others. There is no sincerity in the appeal itself nor in its implications.Large market and big profits are held out to those who are near-sighted enough to sell their birthright for a pot of porridge. For all those who know Russia of the present day, the country represents an immense vacuum filled only with want, distress and desire. It is true, this vacuum can absorb and consume all that America may furnish in the way of agricultural produce and industrial goods, but it is also equally true that such an economically prostrate country can not give anything <pb facs="5423967_4_0676.jpg" n="3"/>in return and every commercial transaction will have to carry either an aspect of charity or be based ultimately on the promise to pay in the future. Even the advocates of the recognition do not conceal that a system of credits guaranteed by private or government financial agencies is essential to the development of Russian-American trade to any extent. Use of credits furnished by America will be the means of paying for what is bought. In other words, the American people will be arrogantly asked to believe in success of the soviet system in the future, to take a communist promise instead of cash for the goods sold, and, thus, to bolster up the system of governing people which proved to be complete failure in the eyes of those who are most intimately and immediately concerned. True enough, Germany, England, Italy and other countries through individual firms made fat profits on the soviet trade; on some contracts signed when the bolsheviki had the money, enormous profits were made on goods and services rendered, but all that has been accomplished at the unwarranted expense of pauperizing the whole country.</p>
   <p>Ever since the revolution, the soviet government has been squandering lavishly accumulated resources of the country for non-productive, chimerical ideas, schemes and enterprises yielding nothing tangible to the Russian people. As a result the country now is totally prostrate and destitute, thousands of people are daily dying from hunger in a country that used to feed half of Europe in former days. From many regions we are daily in receipt of letters reporting numerous cases of cannibalism. All over the country prevail conditions unbelievable to the civilized people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0677.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In many places rage epidemics of typhoid fever and other diseases accompanying such distressful conditions. The backbone of Russia- the Russian peasant- has been ruined completely and on their ruin stark hunger rears its head over the immense land. The whole scheme of industrialization has crumbled for lack of raw materials, fuel, food and men able to work and endure. Instead of relieving the unbearable conditions of life, instead of giving the people proper tools, draft animals, food and clothing so that they might again work and produce, the soviet government was spending the proceeds of confiscatory taxes on military and industrial equipment useless or uneconomical under the conditions prevailing in the country. Enormous sums of money has been spent on building immense factories, mills, mines, dams and power stations.</p>
   <p>From the standpoint of the country's economic life, all that vast wealth has been frozen after it was taken from the productive, natural, economic channels of Russian agriculture and small industry. As a consequence, the country is denuded of every vestige of usable goods. The country finds itself in the throes of unbelievable want and misery. Hundreds of letters received by our readers from Russia testify to that. Thousand of heart-rending pleas for help and succor from all over Russia profoundly speak in plain terms of the true state of conditions in our hapless country of birth. And yet many naive people in this country believe that trade with a country like Russia of today will relieve their own condition of unemployment, want and misery.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0678.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Our intimate knowledge of the conditions of Russia and causes creating them dictates to us one, and only one proper course for the United States to follow in relation to the soviet government.</p>
   <p>Let the United States government send a group of competent men to study Russia without any bias or prejudice. Let them stay there for at least six months and see for themselves just what the conditions are, what are the causes, and whether America stands to gain or lose through recognition of a government that ruined one country and would ruin others if given a chance. No man of sound mind and integrity will ever be deceived by what he is shown or given chance to see and hear. The evidence to the contrary is overwhelming even to a casual observer, and deep study of socially minded American men will reveal before them a picture unprecedented in human history.</p>
   <p>As far as we are concerned, we know that Russia during the last fifteen years has gone from bad to worse both spiritually and materially and now conditions prevail that would horrify the American people distressed as they are themselves. We know also that conditions in Russia will grow worse yet, if that is at all possible, unless the soviet government reverses entirely its economic policy toward people who work in general and toward the peasants in particular by releasing and giving free expression to the instinctive inborn desire of man to work freely, to gain, to possess.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0679.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>While these natural incentives to labor remain trammelled and subdued by force and coercion, Russia is a liability, not an asset to any nation dealing with it commercially or otherwise.</p>
   <p>By recognizing the soviet government we open our doors widely for all the foul play of political charlatans without gaining any single commercial advantage, even if that should be the only primary consideration in the minds of civilized men.</p>
   <p>By recognizing the government we recognize the system that ruined Russia and will, ruin the rest of the civilized world if given sufficient prestige and weight by the rest of the countries.</p>
   <p>Be on guard, humanity! Your future is in danger!</p>
