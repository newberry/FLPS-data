<title level="a">AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE RUSSIAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE</title></bibl>

   <p>Mr. Erin, the vice-president, in the absence of the president, called the meeting of the Russian-American Democratic League to order at exactly 8:30 P.M. In a brief but sensible speech Mr. Erin explained the reason for the president's absence, and read the report about the activity of the League during the past year. He says:</p>
   <p>"From the beginning our activity rapidly developed and the organization grew. We were joyful and we worked, full of energy, disregarding all obstacles. We hoped that we could form a powerful organization. However, it only seemed that way; soon dissentions and friction appeared in our well-adjusted family. The president conducted himself badly. As you know, he appeared at meetings while intoxicated, and treated the members disrespectfully and refused to issue calls for business meetings. When a committee notified members through the press and fixed the date for this meeting without his consent, he began to intimidate the members, so that they would not attend the meeting, 'as the whole bunch,' as he <pb facs="5423967_4_0759.jpg" n="2"/>put it, 'will be arrested.' He told me personally over the telephone that he had hired a number of hoodlums who would square accounts with me. I have never opposed him; but I resented his conduct very much. The editor of Rassviet told me that he threatened him, also, for giving space to the notice advising members to come to the meeting. In the future the newspaper will have nothing to do with our organization so long as our house is not in good order. But we cannot exist without support from the paper. I have worked faithfully thus far and will continue to work the same way for the benefit of the Russian colony, if we can only succeed in bringing order out of chaos at this meeting. I am not afraid of his threats, and therefore, I make a motion that we elect a chairman for this meeting."</p>
   <p>The motion was seconded and adopted unanimously. Those nominated for chairman were Bernoff, Olesiuk, Staber, Erin and N. Grib. Nominations were accepted by Olesiuk and Bernoff, while the others declined; however, Bernoff then declined the nomination in favor of Olesiuk. Mr. Olesiuk, thus took the chair and called the meeting to order.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0760.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At once the members opened a discussion about the president. Erin again took the floor and, in detail, described the president's conduct. Novin spoke about the aims pursued by the organization, and in very strong words condemned the president's conduct, which would have been unsuitable for the head of any organization. "His conduct is bad, indeed," concluded the speaker. Novin's words were approved by a thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Kopernik, one of the founders of the League, related what tricky conduct the president had used toward him. "I worked for the benefit of the Russian colony without stint or restraint. I spent my own money, disregarding the needs of my own family. All this I did because I trusted our president. I propose that at this meeting we elect some other man in his place."</p>
   <p>A great deal was said later about the conduct of the president of the League, and then the members unanimously agreed to put another man in his place.</p>
   <p>Novin and Bernoff accepted nominations for the presidency, which were voted upon. As a result of secret balloting, Novin received twenty-four votes, Bernoff ten <pb facs="5423967_4_0761.jpg" n="4"/>votes, and Kishun (the incumbent president) one vote. Seven members refrained from voting. Novin thanked the members for the confidence put in him.</p>
   <p>Bernoff and Karpin were elected vice-presidents. Mr. V. Beriuk, a young fellow with a thorough knowledge of both the English and Russian languages was elected recording secretary. This is a very commendable selection for the members of our colony. Mr. Sambora, Jr. also a young man, who just graduated from high school, was elected as assistant secretary; the post of financial secretary was voted to I. Stankevich; Mr. Tureyko was elected treasurer, and Mr. Kopernik, organizer. The control committee will be composed of Sambora, Sr., Olesiuk and Erin. Cheslavsky and O. Lobanoff were elected to the publicity committee.</p>
   <p>After the election debates were opened about the expulsion of the former president from the organization. The whole question was finally put to a vote, and by a vote of twelve to eleven Mr. Kishun was expelled from the League.</p>
   <p>This concluded the business for which the meeting was called. The chairman adjourned the meeting after a statement made by the Carpatho-Russian Branch through <pb facs="5423967_4_0762.jpg" n="5"/>its delegates. In this statement Kalinin and Rodjilsky declared that members of the Russian Branch for the sake of the entire organization and its growth, should cease quarreling among themselves and work harmoniously in the future, since a new president had been elected.</p>
   <p>"But, so long as there are squabbles and dissentions among you," declared the delegates, "we Carpatho-Russians shall refrain from co-operating with you in our common work."</p>
