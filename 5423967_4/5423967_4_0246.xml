   <p>As a result of the telegrams Russkoe Slovo announces that Governor Edward F. Dunn advised the following: "Replying to your request I am informing you that the State Supreme Court has ruled to postpone the execution of Nikolai Gavrilovich, sentenced to death for murder.</p>
   <p>This renders any action on my part, with reference to your request, superfluous.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>E. F. Dunn</p>
   <p>Russkoe Slovo thereupon urges further action. Suggests pressing for a review of the entire case or else at least a commutation from death to <pb facs="5423967_4_0247.jpg" n="2"/>imprisonment.</p>
   <p>Attorney R. G. Louis, a Russian Immigrant of many years, and influential in politics, is engaged for the case. A large expenditure is imminent,--"yet judging by the response from the Russian Colony this will not impede the work of saving a young life from the noose."</p>
   <p>In still another article, headed Campaign in Chicago Against Execution of Gavrilovich, Russkoe Slovo reproves slackers in the campaign, mentions branches 1 and 4 of The Socialist Party, which decided to start a campaign in earnest. Tells that the local priest promised to get his parishioners interested in the affair, and if necessary, also to give material aid. It states that the politically influential lawyer, Roman G. Louis, requested a brief on the case, but will evidently have to go for it to Edwardsville.</p>
   <p>It regrets Jane Adams' temporary absence from Chicago, but it feels certain <pb facs="5423967_4_0248.jpg" n="3"/>that upon her return she will voice her protest against this death sentence inasmuch as she has always vigorously denounded capital punishment.</p>
   <p>It concludes with the hope that despite the short time in which to do it, the life of the doomed man will surely be saved by energetic work.</p>
