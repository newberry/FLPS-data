   <p>The society 'Knowledge" planned for the summer season to arrange a series of scientific excursions to all the noteworthy places in Chicago and suburbs. For this purpose a special committee was elected which is to work out a program for these excursions, invite experienced persons to manage them, and should also communicate beforehand with all the institutions which are to be visited.</p>
   <p>The excursions will be arranged on holidays, so that all interested persons can participate in them. The committee will try to organize these excursions so that they would be useful in two respects.</p>
   <p>First, these excursions will be pleasure trips. Second, the excursionists will become acquainted with the noteworthy places of Chicago and suburbs under the guidance of experienced persons.</p>
   <p>The committee has al ready prepared the program of the excursions and <pb facs="5423967_4_0871.jpg" n="2"/>has also invited some experienced guides. Outsiders are to be admitted to all these excursions. All those interested in these excursions are welcome to get more information at the headquarters of the society "Knowledge," 1920 W. Division Street, daily from 7:30 P. M. to 9:30 P. M.</p>
