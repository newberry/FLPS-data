   <p>The "Russkiy Vecher-Kontsert" (Russian Evening Concert) , arranged by the Russian Colony of Chicago and held on Sunday, December 4 for the benefit of the United Charities of Chicago, met with great artistic and financial success.</p>
   <p>The broad-minded section of the colony showed its sympathy with the difficult conditions of their suffering, unemployed brothers. It was very pleasant to see the fraternal unity of the Russian people gathered together to aid the unemployed. The Princess Theater, located in the center of the city, was filled long before eight o'clock. All admission tickets were sold and many people could not attend the concert. The audience in return for its participation in this benevolent deed, was offered an excellent program.</p>
   <p>With a deep feeling of sincere gratitude, we can speak of the participation <pb facs="5423967_4_0335.jpg" n="2"/>at this charity entertainment of the best representatives of Russian art living in Chicago. Because of their participation, the concert resulted in a celebration of Russian art.</p>
   <p>The newspaper, The Daily News, outlined in its review, besides the variety of the excellent program, the high quality of the choirs of three churches and the exceptional talents of the participating artists.</p>
   <p>The comprehensive program consisted of the following:</p>
   <p>1. "Osanna"--Fateev.</p>
   <p>2. "Otche Nash" (The Lord's Prayer) --Kedrov. (by the Choir of Holy Trinity Cathedral, under the direction of V. F. Griviskiy).</p>
   <p>3. Popular Music (by a string orchestra under the direction of A. W. Grech).</p>
   <p>4. Romances and Songs (by S. I. Shuchvostova, accompanied by K. S. Kamenskiy).</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0336.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>5. Folk Dances (by Marusia Fanek and L. Lobov).</p>
   <p>6. Violin Solo--compositions of Liubin, Bach, Rimsky-Korsakoff, and L. Vochcherini-Dushkin, (by Florentin Piatetskiy).</p>
   <p>7. "Lezginka" (Caucasian Dance)-- (by G. Kirsov).</p>
   <p>8. "Shchedrik"--Leontovich; "Vdol po Piterskoy" (Along the Peter Street)-- Folk Songs, "Uzh Ia Zoloto Horoniu" (Already I am hiding the Gold) -- Rimsky-Korsakoff, (by the Choir of St. Michael's Church, under the direction of I. K. Nazarenko).</p>
   <p>9. "Zahod Solntsa" (The Sunset)--Folk Song, "Oy, Moia Divchina" (Oh, My Girl) and "Zhuravli Uleteli" (The Cranes departed) --(by the Choir of St. Peter and Paul Church, under the direction of Ignaliy Begun).</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_4_0337.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>10. Russian Songs--(by George A. Nelidoff, baritone of the Imperial Opera of Petrograd).</p>
   <p>11. Piano Solo--compositions of Mendelssohn, Tchaikowsky, and Schubert--(by Professor P. P. Zaychenko).</p>
   <p>12. Russian Ballet (by L Volkova, K. Andreeva and M. Mullen). "The Bee"--Rimsky-Korsakoff (by Ruth Pryor, Prima Ballerina of the Chicago Opera House). Russian Dances--(by L. Volkova, and Edward Caton, Premier of the Chicago Opera House).</p>
   <p>13. Russian Songs, (by V. Dubinskiy) .</p>
   <p>14. "Gopak" (Cossak Dance) (by P. Grib and I. Antsiferoff).</p>
   <p>15. "Choir of Peasants" from the Opera "Nizhegorodtsi"--E. Napravkin, "Solovey" (The Nightingale)--Tchaikowsky and "The American Hymn" (by the Choir of <pb facs="5423967_4_0338.jpg" n="5"/>Holy Trinity Cathedral, under the direction of V. F. Grivskiy).</p>
   <p>The orchestra was under the direction of V. S. Vorontsov.</p>
   <p>It is my privilege, extended by the United Charities of Chicago and the committee who arranged the Russian concert, to express their profound gratitude to all the participants in the program and to all the kindhearted people who contributed food and clothing for hundreds of poor families in the city of Chicago.</p>
