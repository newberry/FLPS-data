   <p>The Foreign Language Division reports that it has sold $1,716,350 in Victory Loan Bonds. The Czechoslovaks are is first place, with sales amounting to $265,100; the Poles are second, with $253,900; and the Germans are in third place, with $158,000. This is very deplorable, for the amount should be much larger--greater, in fact, than the amount raised by any other nationality, because of the great number of Americans of German descent. Apparently, the continual appeal of this publication that the word "German" be inserted in the appropriate column has not always been heeded, partly because the purchasers were negligent, but partly, too, because many Germans lack the courage to admit their origin. Very likely, these people do not know what great harm their procedure is doing them; for if it is said later that the Germans deserted their adopted country, these timid souls, too, will suffer ignominy. Only by willingly co-operating in this great cause can they take the wind out of their opponents' sails.</p>
