   <p>Talk is still the only outstanding accomplishment of our legislators in Springfield, where nothing is as rare as action. The Democrats of Illinois evidently have not found a leader within their organization who recognizes the seriousness of the present situation, and who has the ability to govern the state as successfully as President Roosevelt has governed the nation. The President is aware of the danger; he knows that only by directing the nation in the opposite direction from "the same old trot," and by adopting necessary measures to aid economic conditions, can he save the nation from being plunged into an abyss. Those men in Springfield upon whom responsibility rests obviously do not comprehend the approaching danger, or else they must be utterly indifferent to it. This attitude must not be misinterpreted as courage--to be more exact, it it an extreme lack of understanding. The voters of Illinois decided last November to place the destiny of the state, and consequently that of the population, into the hands of the Democratic party for the next few years. They did this to put an end to <pb facs="5418474_5_1624.jpg" n="2"/>the Republican party's inactivity, and they calmly looked on while the majority of the people of the state were being reduced to destitution. As for the rest of the citizens, they were faced with the problem of figuring out a way to continue financing the unprecedented extravagance of the state administration and the municipal administration as well. The Democratic landslide--victory for local and state government--placed a tremendous responsibility upon the party. However, their success must not be misconstrued as the result of previous accomplishments. Not at all; it was [the result of] an outright call for assistance from people ruined by exhorbitant taxation, undesirable laws and by the politicians' avid desire to plunder by means of corruption, graft, and petty favoritism. Apparently the leaders of the Democratic party are not yet aware of their responsibility. After having attained power, what have the Democrats accomplished as heads of the administration and as bosses of the legislature? Since his inauguration six weeks ago, President Roosevelt has commanded the respect of the entire nation, including many of his former enemies, through his outstanding achievements. What have the Democrats in Springfield accomplished during that period? The voters of Illinois have sufficient cause, indeed, to <pb facs="5418474_5_1625.jpg" n="3"/>be discouraged with their chosen representatives, who up to now have proven to be absolutely inadequate and to lack understanding, entirely aside from their tendency to play small party politics and to indulge petty favoritism.</p>
   <p>....The campaign pledges are utterly disregarded. Tax reductions were promised, but instead they have multiplied. Nor were the administrative expenditures decreased as was expected. However, the Governor did make an earnest attempt in that direction, but without the co-operation of the legislature his power as chief executive of the state is of course limited. It is therefore imperative that the state administration undergo a radical simplification, and that its expenditures be drastically reduced. Furthermore, the administration in Springfield must reduce its spending program, as well as the assessment of taxes to conform with the enormously curtailed income of the taxpayers. That was the mandate of the people of Illinois. The legislature in Springfield has done nothing to meet the present day requirements--while under the responsible leadership of the Democrats--except to take recourse to the adoption of the most foolish <pb facs="5418474_5_1626.jpg" n="4"/>law of them all, the sales tax law.... The legislature has indeed no cause to pride itself upon that achievement. Incidentally, our state legislators may rest assured that at the next election the voters will not fail to show their reaction to those who so ably assisted at the birth of that law.</p>
   <p>The legislature has, in addition, neglected to introduce measures in regard to the regulation of the sale of beer--although there was ample time. Thus racketeers and bootleggers have a splendid chance to force respectable businessmen out of business and to take advantage of this opportunity to seize control of the business.... The patience of the people cannot endure forever. Even the patient donkey will balk when under too great a strain. Party racketeering whereby they, as well as their supporters, accumulate wealth must not be allowed to continue. They must be replaced by honest men interested in the welfare of the people. Where is the Messiah who would drive the money changers from the temple of the legislature, and restore it to its original purpose: constructive and beneficial work for the good of the people? If Springfield could produce <pb facs="5418474_5_1627.jpg" n="5"/>such a man he could be assured of the wholehearted support of the people. Such a man would have to be a keen observer of what is most needed at the present time, and would have to possess the iron will and energy to fight for the achievement of his goal. He would also have to be endowed with the great endurance necessary to combat the selfishness and stupidity of his colleagues. If there is such a qualified leader in our state capital, or among those whom we have elected, his name has not yet come into prominence.</p>
