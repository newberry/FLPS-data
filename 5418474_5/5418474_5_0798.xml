   <p>The letter which Secretary of State Bryan has directed to the Chairman of the Senate Committee for Foreign Affairs (Senator Stone of Missouri) is regarded as the most unusual document pertaining to the war and its involvements, which the Government has ever sanctioned for publicity. And that is easy to understand.</p>
   <p>The letter serves both as an explanation and a defense of certain policies. It takes up, one by one, all the points of criticism which have been advanced against the Administration and attempts to prove that the Government is neither anti-German nor pro-British but that it only acted in accordance with established laws and in pursuance of the traditional policies of this country.</p>
   <p>The letter is quite significant inasmuch as it was written in a defensive tone <pb facs="5418474_5_0799.jpg" n="2"/>although no formal accusation was made. It is an attempt by the Administration to exonerate itself from a verdict voiced by a portion of the general public. Whether the explanation served its purpose we cannot say. That the Administration considered it advisable to make an attempt to defend its polices shows that the Government attaches great importance to that part of public opinion which accused the Administration of harboring an unfriendly attitude toward Germany and Austria-Hungary and favoring England and her allies, and that the Administration is eager to justify itself and win the unanimous approval of the public.</p>
   <p>This part of the public, with whose criticism the Administration takes issue, whose good will must be regained, who must be made to believe that the Government could not have acted any differently under the prevailing circumstances, this part of the people, we say, is none other than the German-American element!</p>
   <p>The Administration, through a communication from the Secretary of State to Senator Stone, is in fact addressing the German-Americans and the Austrian and <pb facs="5418474_5_0800.jpg" n="3"/>Hungarian Americans; each phase of the complaint [U. S. arms shipment to Allies] is taken up in detail and explained from the Government's point of view. The Administration is eager to eliminate the bad impression its attitude has made on the German-American population, and is attempting to regain their good will. We don't go to any trouble for a thing unless we value it highly!</p>
   <p>But all this does not mean that the letter of the Secretary of State will convince those for whom it was intended. The great majority of the German-Americans and their sympathizers will not necessarily applaud now where they used to boo. But it is incumbent upon them to ponder and study the explanations and arguments of the Administration carefully, to assay the situation and the circumstances, and to try to arrive at a just verdict.</p>
   <p>Bryan's letter to Senator Stone has been reproduced in a close and abbreviated translation elsewhere in this paper, and we hope that the reader will avail himself of the opportunity of reading it carefully, and that he will then form <pb facs="5418474_5_0801.jpg" n="4"/>his opinion calmly and objectively.</p>
   <p>That is the duty of every German-American.</p>
