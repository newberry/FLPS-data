   <p>In government circles at Washington, a number of doubts have arisen with respect to the effectiveness of the measures taken by the administration to revive our economic life. It is possible that these doubts are unjustified. Experience has taught us that economic tempo is retarded each year at the height of the summer season; this repeats itself in good, as well as bad, times. This year the reaction came a little later than usual, and it was therefore to be expected that it would last longer. Moreover, it is possible that the depression has at last reached its lowest point, and that improvements which may be noticed in many fields would have come without the measures taken by the government.</p>
   <p>How things actually stand cannot be definitely established. The situation may become better with the approach of the cold weather; but perhaps the <pb facs="5418474_5_1605.jpg" n="2"/>retrogressive tendency will continue. In this respect, we must consider that the situation has been nearly hopeless for years that a speedy and sudden improvement can by no means be expected. Concerning all these things, one has to depend on assumptions. One thing, however, is certain: The government's control of economic life will have to be either expanded or entirely removed. There is no middle way.</p>
   <p>It is all very well to raise wages and to shorten working hours. But these measures can be taken only if, at the same time business firms are permitted to raise prices in proportion. Otherwise they simply cannot exist. To be sure, the raising of prices is included in the program of the administration, although it seems that the regulation of prices is absolutely impossible in the field of wholesale and retail business.</p>
   <p>At any rate, successful regulation of prices would eliminate cutthroat competition, and that would be a great advantage. But nothing would be gained by it as yet, because it would at once become necessary to buy at higher prices <pb facs="5418474_5_1606.jpg" n="3"/>Here regulation ceases. No power in the world can force people to buy merchandise at a certain price if they cannot pay that price, and there is no doubt that there are millions who cannot buy at all. The number of unemployed has been estimated at sixteen millions. Assuming that this number has now been reduced by three millions, there still remain thirteen million unemployed, many of whom are public charges. These persons cannot be counted as buyers or consumers in the economic sense of the words. The others (almost all of them) are so deeply in debt that they can buy only the most necessary things, and this condition cannot put the wheels of industry back into motion again. It is entirely superfluous to stage big buying campaigns, because, if the American has money or credit, he buys. Experience teaches us that many buy more than they can pay for. But where there is neither money nor credit, every attempt to increase turnover and consumption artifically is utterly useless.</p>
   <p>And so the country faces the same economic problems as it did six months ago. When the administration came before the public with its economic program, the <pb facs="5418474_5_1607.jpg" n="4"/>latter was all but unanimously received with great applause. The situation was so desperate that every attempt to bring about an improvement was greeted with a limitless feeling of relief. To some people, however, the plans of the government elicited suspicious shaking of the head. Others by no means enthusiastic, but in a receptive mood, argued in this manner: Pure individualism has failed us; we want no socialism: Therefore, we must try a system which embodies a modification of the individualistic system, but which is not fully socialistic.</p>
   <p>It turned out that this is impossible. Once the state starts regulating economic life, it must regulate it completely; it seems that a compromise between free, individualistic economy and state-regulated economy is an impossibility. It is fortunate that President Roosevelt, to whom Congress turned over almost limitless power to regulate our national economy, is no doctrinarian. He has frequently emphasized that he has a clear conception of the experimental nature of his measures. One may assume that, even now, he stands undaunted and unbiased, facing the situation squarely, and that he <pb facs="5418474_5_1608.jpg" n="5"/>is ready to revise his program at any time.</p>
   <p>In what manner this revision will have to be made is not difficult to guess. In the first place, the revised program must contain a clear rejection of inflation, for it is more than obvious that continued and undenied rumors of inflation have a paralyzing effect upon commerce and industry and upon the credit situation. The second point in the program would be the restoration of the gold standard. This is necessary in the interest of private and government credit. The government's great building program will naturally have to be executed in its essentials, but for the rest it seems best to slow down, as soon as possible, all measures for regulating and aiding agriculture, industry, and commerce.</p>
