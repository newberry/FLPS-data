<title level="a">WORLD GERMANISM; GERMAN-AMERICANS FACE GREAT TASK</title><title level="a" type="sub">The Conflict of Ideas by Professor Kuehnemann</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>During a luncheon given by Harry Rubens at the Kaiserhof, Professor Kuehnemann expressed his conviction that in the titanic conflict between the Anglo-Saxon and Germanical thought, a World Germanism will be born and the task of disseminating it in the United States, falls to the German-Americans. The object of the informal meeting was to enable well-known Germans of this city to become more intimately acquainted with Professor Kuehnemann.</p>
   <p>In his masterly, thought-provoking and therefore fascinating speech, Professor Kuehnemann first mentioned the rather infirm connection between the Germans and German-Americans, a condition which has been completely <pb facs="5418474_5_0613.jpg" n="2"/>reversed since the war. Germany was so preoccupied with its internal affairs that it was not able to give much attention to its sons and daughters across the ocean, with the inevitable result that their distant members believed it unwarranted to manifest any display of reciprocity because of this apparent lack of interest. But with the advent of the war, when England did its utmost to foster anti-German sentiment by resorting to lies and vilification, then the Germans in America at once recognized their duty. It became a question whether the Anglo-Saxon thought should rule the world henceforth, or if the German belief was equally privileged to share such a universal control; immediately the Germans here proceeded to prevent a continuation of this Anglo-Saxonizing. What the Germans have accomplished here during this sinister period, the awakening of a faithful love for the old fatherland, is the resultant of England's actions. One feels that a world Germanism is formulating; a new era approaches, and everyone who speaks German must help in banishing all obstacles.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0614.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The speaker showed further that the American press has been completely contaminated by English propaganda, and that the profound German achievements at the beginning of the war have been entirely ignored. He showed that the United States, ruled by a school teacher, is not the genuine free state, whereas in Germany the spirit of unselfishness prevails; that under the German administration, a new, better Belgium and Poland were created, and that no one in the World, England as well as France, doubts Germany's final victory.</p>
   <p>Continuing, he spoke of the fearful devastation in Eastern Prussia, Russia's handiwork; of the Phoeniz-like resurrection of the villages and cities, <pb facs="5418474_5_0615.jpg" n="4"/>through adequate contributions by Western-German cities. A monumental deed of the true brotherly love. But this magnificent work is incomplete if German-Americans fail to cooperate. New houses will be built in Ragnit, a boundary district in Eastern Prussia. The cost will be 6000 marks per building, under the supervision of a German-American architect. The financing of this, we feel assured, will be regarded as a duty by our brethren here in the United States. May this hope materialize.</p>
   <p>At the end of this exceptionally convincing speech, Mr. Rubens gave an account of a New York society established recently to help the Eastern Prussians. Therefore, we Chicagoans should emulate this noble work by organizing a Chicago branch. Harry Rubens was elected president.</p>
   <p>Dr. Emil Hirsch gave a further account of German unity, showing that there <pb facs="5418474_5_0616.jpg" n="5"/>are many Jewish officers in the army, and that about 4000 Jewish soldiers were awarded the Iron Cross of the second class; and nineteen Jews earned the Iron Cross of the first class. It is the realization of a universal sense of duty. We speak so much about liberty here, but fail to realize that without this sense of duty it is doomed to failure. We desire a world Americanism but it cannot be realized until it follows the German conception of a true sense of duty. Germany will give this new Americanism a hearty reception, based on the principle of brotherly love. Both will henceforth work in unison.</p>
   <p>We know Germany will be victorious, but ardently hope for an early peace.</p>
