   <p>The June issue of the American Magazine, published in New York, contains a picture, showing a Chinese handing an opium pipe to a white man reclining on a couch. According to the explanation underneath the picture, the white man once was a well-respected American journalist who degenerated to a criminal through continued inhalations of the vicious poison, and who is now spending his days behind iron bars in bitter self-condemnation.</p>
   <p>Every time I look at this eloquent picture, I unconsciously find some analogy to our present times. The Chinese turns into Johnny Bull, who lets the half-intoxicated American journalists take deep draughts out of an opium pipe. This pipe is filled with London made opium pills, meaning cleverly fabricated and poisoned reports on world events. Without restraint, the <pb facs="5418474_5_0686.jpg" n="2"/>Americans greedily inhale the blue vapor of the sweet-tasting poison, and in their brain confused pictures take shape, devoid of reality, exactly as Johnny Bull wishes that they should see them. The highly civilized Germans appear as uncouth barbarians, led by a grim war lord who, like a maniac, shoots everything in sight, kills the goddess of civilization with his blood-dripping sword and together with the rest of the European rulers, wades into a river of blood, inviting the Italian, still standing reluctantly on the bank, with the words, "Come on in, the blood is fine!"</p>
   <p>We just have to look at cartoons like these, actually published by New York newspapers, to realize the alarming degree to which John Bull has succeeded in poisoning the morale of the American people by means of his opium factories--the London news agencies. Propaganda of this kind is not a new invention. England has practiced this means for a long time in order to influence the world to her advantage and camouflage her own intentions. All the cables and telegraph lines of the world, the pens of many thousands of <pb facs="5418474_5_0687.jpg" n="3"/>adroit journalists, the columns of countless newspapers and unlimited finances are at England's disposal, to achieve this purpose. If we could prove how many journalists, living in the United States, are in British pay, how many American newspapers open their columns to British propaganda or play England's tune, the revelations would simply be amazing.</p>
   <p>That England maintains such agents and stooges here in the United States is revealed by those hateful attacks, those maliciously brutal cartoons which some American newspapers have let loose on the public during the past months. Justified as the protests by German-Americans, Austrians and Hungarians against such journalistic rowdyism have been, we still say that the Government of this Union of states, made up of a great variety of national groups, should feel obligated to do something on its own accord to fight such assaults against public morale, just as it would an epidemic of a communicable disease.</p>
   <p>The above is not an exhausting survey. If we should undertake to make a comprehensive study of all the misdeeds committed by England, one book <pb facs="5418474_5_0688.jpg" n="4"/>volume would hardly cover the subject. We would have to show how England, like a greedy and insatiable shark, roved the seven seas to devour every coast line insufficiently defended by its inhabitants and every unprotected island as well. We would have to tell of her attempts, at thousands of places on this globe, in Afghanistan, Persia, Tibet, Maskat, Aden, Ethiopia, in Somaliland, Asia Minor, and on the Euphrates, to devour territory. We would have to describe how she got Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus, how she obtained domination over Egypt and cheated the Russians in Sebastopol and the French in Faschoda.</p>
   <p>Insatiable in her desire to increase her territory, unscrupulously crushing the prosperity and happiness of other people; thus England strides through the centuries, a curse to all nations incapable of coping with her power and intrigue. When, do I ask, will the day of accounting, the day of world judgment, be at hand for this defiler of nations?</p>
