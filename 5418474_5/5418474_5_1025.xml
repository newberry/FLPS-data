   <p>The president of the United States a few weeks ago expressed his disappointment and his deep grief that his neutrality proclamation had not turned to blood in all American citizens. This reproach was directed mainly against the citizens of German descent because they had the unheard of nerve to request the highest peace and neutrality apostle of this country not to permit the Belgian emissaries to kindle the fires of passion in America. The president branded this peaceful demand of American citizens a violation of neutrality, and assumed himself the right to give us lessons. And the Germans gulped this lesson and remained silent. They did not consider it necessary to treat us with consideration, and Germany's enemies found vast support and encouragement in words and deeds. They supposed that the twenty million citizens of German origin would not have the courage to revolt against the anti-neutral and anti-German decrees. And they were not disappointed. "Michel" clenched his fist in his pocket, "Michel" bit his lips in impotent rage, but "Michel" kept silent. And this spiritless silence has encouraged the opponents of Germany to such a degree that finally today, in the national legislature, they showed a hostile attitude towards Germany. Whether Mr. Wilson's heart will also bleed on account of this anti-German demonstration, and whether he will be induced to demand respect for his neutrality proclamation from congress, which he rules, the respect <pb facs="5418474_5_1026.jpg" n="2"/>which he asked from us Germans at the wrong place and at the wrong Time? Mr. Gardner, whom that same state Massachusetts sent to congress which at a time when the desire for liberty lived in their hearts and from where the movement to shake off the English yoke was started. Mr. Gardner tore up the president's neutrality proclamation, and threw it in his face. Mr. Gardner avowed his principles and openly proclaimed to the world that he considers German's cause unholy, as a danger to the principles of true democracy. And while a nation, at the president's command, has lately prayed for an early peace, Mr. Gardner has, in the national congress of this country, executed another prayer: he implored the war god to crush the Germans! We do not care much about the personal feelings of Mr. Gardner. A lot of Gardners are running around in America, trying to hide their empty headedness behind bombastic, demagogical figures of speech. And Mr. Gardner of Massachusetts has undoubtedly filled his mouth because he wants to be noticed and because abusing Germany, is today the most effective means of acquiring notoriety, which otherwise would be denied to empty headed people. As little as we want to trouble ourselves about the views and feelings of such an unimportant man as Gardner, this Gardner is a member of the national congress. And while we do not hold the president responsible for the enunciations of unimportant demagogues, it is, nevertheless, the supreme duty of the president, to stigmatize openly this miserable demagogism, in case the president wants to be taken seriously and wishes <pb facs="5418474_5_1027.jpg" n="3"/>that his honest intentions should not be doubted. In his unreasonableness, in his straining after effect, which borders on treason, this Gardner painted the danger of war with Germany on the wall, and introduced a resolution, that the readiness for battle of the American forces should be investigated. For as Germany is concerned, this resolution is laughable. But it is the seed from which the poisonous plant of fraternal strife might rise. Therefore, it is the duty of the president to stamp out this seed. Whoever loves peace, will try first to maintain it between its own four walls. If he does not do it, then his procedure is nothing else, but a loathsome disgusting act of hypocrisy, which we as citizens of this country are unwilling to tolerate. The president of the United States has the floor!</p>
