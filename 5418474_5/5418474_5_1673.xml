<title level="a">HIGH WAGES GOOD--HIGHER WAGES BETTER!</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In answer to complaints about the high prices of food and other commodities, merchants and manufacturers call attention to the high wages which they must pay all classes of workers.</p>
   <p>Although, because of the exorbitant prices, estimates for the erection, extension, or repair of buildings are rejected and manufacturers buy only what they need immediately, deferring the larger purchases until prices are reduced, contractors and manufacturers counter with the statement that prices will not decline, but probably will rise, because wages are not being cut, but probably will be raised.</p>
   <p>In support of this statement, it is pointed out that organized labor is determined <pb facs="5418474_5_1674.jpg" n="2"/>not only to tolerate no wage reduction, but also to force wage increases whenever contracts with employers terminate, and that the Federal Administration of Railroad Employees has just granted a general raise in pay, etc.</p>
   <p>As a result, many people today hold that high wages are partly, if not altogether responsible for the high prices of foods and all necessary commodities. They are inclined to blame high wages if the disapproval of the high prices demanded should lead to a sharp decline in the sale of commodities, and thus to a general decrease in business, and finally to a general drop in productive activity--in short, to "hard times". Further, in certain quarters it is believed that high wages constitute an economic menace to the country. There are innumerable complaints about high wages, and it is maintained that a general wage decrease is not only desirable and timely, but is also necessary to the welfare of the people.</p>
   <p>Such attitudes are regrettable. For, as such opinions are spread and take root, the danger which is so greatly feared increases. High wages are not dangerous. They who deplore high wages and regard then as a hindrance to the return or <pb facs="5418474_5_1675.jpg" n="3"/>beginning of a great prosperity, and who want to see wages decline, may be honestly solicitious of the welfare of the so-called "working classes," but they are shortsighted, and look at the situation from either a false, or a one-sided point of view.</p>
   <p>High wages are always good for a "working" people like ours--nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every one thousand inhabitants belong to the working class. And increasing wages are better. When the so-called lower strata of our working population receive higher wages, then the upper strata of workers will also command more pay. The better the financial situation of the working masses, the more they will be able to spend, and industrial and commercial activity will increase proportionately. The higher wages, the more labor-saving devices will be invented, thus releasing more workers from tedious and monotonous machine work, which virtually makes man a part of the machinery, and affording them the opportunity to work under more humane conditions and at more respectable, better-paid jobs.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1676.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Bolshevism is spoken of and feared as a danger to our country; high and rising wages are insurance against this menace. There can be no better insurance. Only people who believe that they have nothing to lose; and who despair of their future under the present social order, could accept or show any interest in Bolshevism. The American worker has something to lose: present high prices. And through the movement to have wages increased and working hours decreased, he will have more to lose in the future. Also he is assured that under the present social order he may have not only great aspirations, but also the opportunity to progress.</p>
   <p>It is wrong, fundamentally wrong, to deplore high wages, for a moderate rise in wages is beneficial to all. In this respect it is also true that "trees do not grow as high as heaven," and "what goes up must come down". Labor has a limited value which, if overstated, will result in a limited demand for labor and a curtailed rise in wages; this would eventually do great harm to the country's economic system. Perhaps this limit has already been reached, or even exceeded in several fields of labor or in various types of work. But these can be but a few insignificant exceptions, which will be adjusted without any disturbance. They do not <pb facs="5418474_5_1677.jpg" n="5"/>warrant a general complaint about high wages and are not to be held solely responsible for the exorbitantly priced necessities and manufactured articles. Not, for instance, as long as bricks, for which twelve dollars a thousand is demanded, are made at a cost of seven dollars per thousand, and anthracite coal, which is mined for five dollars per ton, sells at twelve dollars.</p>
   <p>Profits must decline from their war level to a reasonable percentage before a cut in unreasonably high wages may be thought of.</p>
