  <body>
   <p>The American citizens of German descent did not need to be challenged by a message of the President to give thanks for the blessings in which they have participated. The sense of gratitude is a characteristic trait of the Germans on this and the other side of the ocean. They always gave voluntarily, obeying an inner impetus, to God and Caesar, what is due to God and Caesar. Over there, the Hohenzollerns gave the Germans a home. Over there, the Hohenzollerns united the Germans into our nation, which is compelling respect in such measure that the respect is accompanied by fear and envy, and because a Hohenzollern has, for decades, in a peaceful way enriched the nation with ideal and material goods, because a Hohenzollern stood as a laborer for decades in the service of German thought, German culture and the economic welfare of the German nation, the German nation responded in the hour of danger to the call of the Emperor, that they may repay their debt of thanks by bringing the necessary sacrifice and by shedding their blood for the just cause. On this side of the ocean, where the German has found a new home and in this home and opportunity to utilize German knowledge and German diligence in this country, it was also not necessary to appeal to the duty of thanks from the German. The German has always repaid every dollar he owes to this country with 100 cents of gratitude. He not only was ready to serve the country in every respect, but he was to be found in the first ranks. He served the country as a <pb facs="5418474_5_0941.jpg" n="2"/>of culture. The German in this country has never done any half baked work in any sphere. In many cases he had to defend the fundamental principles of the Republic against the pretended Democracy of the original children of this country. Especially since the last few months, during which the American people, the American Press and the American Government have caused the same German painful wounds, they do not cease, even today, to be true sons of this country. They are willing even today to subordinate their own interests to the interests of the Republic. People, Press and the Government have in a treacherous manner with drawn from the Germans. People, Press, and Government, have pushed aside their best friends, to humbly lick the English hand, which had previously beaten, and is still beating them. People, Press, and Government, to would the German, have disgraced the spirit, which led to the founding of the Republic. Lies have become the leading principle in this once idealistic country and in the Government places, as wll as in the Editorial rooms, altars have been erected to hyprocrisy. Today is, upon instructions from the President, Thanksgiving Day, which we German-Americans should also celebrate in a festive way. Even if we cannot participate on Thanksgiving Day in the manner the President prescribes, we shall pray nevertheless, fervently and devoutly. We shall pray that a beam of light fall upon the soul of the Government, shrouded in darkness, that they may acknowledge and fulfill the true duties they owe to all the citizens of this country. Our prayers, which originate in an honest heart, and are poured from honest lips, might be sooner <pb facs="5418474_5_0942.jpg" n="3"/>listened to, than that, which was murmured in accordance with a higher command and from old habits, and the fountain of which is not the wishing heart.</p>
