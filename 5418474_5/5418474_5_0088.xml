   <p>The following resolutions were made in regard to war and declaration of war, at the conference of the North Illinois district of the Evangelical Lutheran Missouri Synod, which is taking place in Chicago:</p>
   <p>"Although war is a deplorable disaster for humanity, inflicting suffering and misery and although we always strive for peace among the nations of the world, and will defend and favor each honorable and just measure to prevent war and to promote peace, yet we feel as an assemblage of Lutheran Christians that it would be presumptious on our part, in other words, it would be a matter of confusing state affairs with church affairs, if we as a church would take a definite stand towards declarations of war.</p>
   <p>The general and only mission of the church is the rescue of men throught the gospel of Christ. May the church ever be loyal to this their highest mission, and at the same time use their influence to promote peace among the nations and virtue among the citizens, but always willing and ready to serve God and the country.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0089.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The dissensions between fundamentalism and modernism is according to our view point, a conflict between truth and error, between light and darkness, virtue and sin. It is not a question of more enlightenment about an old theory, but a matter of diminished faith in the old truth...."</p>
