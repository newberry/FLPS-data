   <p>This morning the president of the American Security League, Harry H. Merrick, made the following statement to a representative of the Abendpost regarding the end of the war:</p>
   <p>"Peace has come on earth and all the world is jubilant. We Americans, regardless of birth or origin, know today that we are one people, inseparably and permanently joined together in the glory of our flag and in the ideal of liberty for ourselves and for the rest of the world.</p>
   <p>"Americans of German descent and German birth have given splendid proof of their patriotism and their loyalty toward the United States and, in times to come, they and their descendants can always look back on this showing with pride. The casualty lists from all battlefields where our boys have fought contain a large number of names which are undoubtedly of German origin.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0498.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The old order of things is past. Autocracy, Kaiserism, and Prussianism have fallen into the dust. Today the nations of the world are free. The tremendous charges that have taken place in Germany and Austria indicate that the men and women of these countries have recognized the evils of the past and are now trying to adopt the ideals for which our country stands. These far-reaching changes will undoubtedly help to ease the difficulties which are involved in the drafting of the peace treaty, for there is no trace of a sentiment of revenge or of a desire to punish. The peoples of our enemies were led astray and ill-advised. If they see the light now and act accordingly, we Americans and our Allies will aid them to the utmost of our ability.</p>
   <p>"Our fellow citizens of German and Austrian origin here in Chicago have acted splendidly, and there must and will not be any thought of division or separation either in interests or in sentiments.</p>
   <p>"For all of us these are days of victory, for which we have fought by undivided co-operation, and in this fact lies the greatest justification for our proud joy."</p>
