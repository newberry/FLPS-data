   <p>England slowly awakens to the danger of the fire she is playing with. Even in case of a victory over Germany, it can only be regarded as a pyrrhic victory; in place of one peaceful competitor in the commerce of the world, she will have now two powerful enemies, France and Russia. Remarkable is a statement of George Bernard Shaw, the celebrated author. He declares that England, France and Germany are only acting for the advantage of Russia to the detriment of civilization and that it is foolishness to state that they are fighting for the ideals of humanity. Mr. Shaw's comment has caused great excitement in Europe and the United States but we differ with him to the effect that the crime has been comitted by England and France in supporting the Russian plans while Germany fights the battle of despair to prevent such an occurrence. If Germany succeeds in holding up the march of Russia, they have brought the heaviest sacrifice to humanity in the service of the western cultural powers, France and England. George Bernard Shaw has taken in the situation in the right light. Whom the gods want to destroy, they strike with blindness. England's old policy, used for hundreds of years, has made her <pb facs="5418474_5_1119.jpg" n="2"/>blind to future dangers, when she planned with Germany and Austria-Hungary. England already sees that she has gone too far and whether she will have the courage to withdraw before it is too late, is to be seen.</p>
