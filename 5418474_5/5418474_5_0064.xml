   <p>The sixteenth annual convention of the American Legion which took place in Miami, Florida is over. These meetings are usually closely followed by the press. The interest was especially great this year, because it was generally expected that the Legion would take a position on the bonus question. Last year, by making a personal appeal, President Roosevelt succeeded in sidetracking the bonus question. That was not possible this time. Even before the convention opened it was well known that the Legion would take up the matter, and would demand the immediate payment of the veterans' bonus.</p>
   <p>In fact, this was the only question of general interest with which the convention dealt. This was frankly admitted by those who advocated immediate payment of the bonus. Ray Kelly of Detroit, the chairman of <pb facs="5418474_5_0065.jpg" n="2"/>the committee which dealt with this matter, declared that the committee's report was the point on the agenda "for which we were all waiting". The convention did not have to wait long. The fate of the resolution was decided beforehand. During the short debate, the Legionnaires clearly showed that they did not want to argue but to vote. The resolution passed with the huge majority of 987 to 183.</p>
   <p>It would be wrong to reproach the American Legion for their action. A year ago, the Legion did not declare itself for the payment of the bonus. In the meantime, however, the Veterans of Foreign Wars managed to get the House of Representatives to pass a resolution which provided for the payment of this money. In this resolution it was even stipulated that the Government was to raise the money by issuing two billion dollars worth of paper money not backed by gold. The adoption by the Senate of this, extremely dubious resolution was prevented by the Administration.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the Veterans of Foreign Wars made capital of their partial <pb facs="5418474_5_0066.jpg" n="3"/>success in the campaign for the payment of the bonus. It is natural that they made a great impression on the veterans. Most of them would like to have the money, and they cannot be blamed for it. They consider them selves all the more justified in taking this position because the Government--as is stressed in the preamble of the resolution--spends large amounts of money for the restoration of normal economic conditions. Under these conditions it is easy to see why the Legion has decided upon the same policy; it was, to a certain extent, compelled to do so, in order to meet the competition of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.</p>
   <p>One might take the position that it would be best for the Government to grant the veterans' demand, and thus get rid of this matter of dispute. But this argument is quite specious. By the payment of the bonus the question would by no means be settled, because the leaders of the veterans would promptly make new demands. It was always thus, in this country, and it will surely be the same this time. After every war, for decades, in one form or another, new amounts have been granted in one form or another, <pb facs="5418474_5_0067.jpg" n="4"/>to the veterans, and not only to them, but also to their wives, widows, and children. The amounts paid out in this manner, were much larger than the actual costs of war. Sometime this will have to stop; otherwise the country will be completely ruined.</p>
