   <p>Last Wednesday the Republican Club of New York gave a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in honor of the memory of Abraham Lincoln. According to a reporter, however, Lincoln was just about forgotten on the occasion, and, instead, a violent and malicious attack was made upon Woodrow Wilson. Besides Nicholas Longworth, the son-in-law of the great "Colonel," Senator France of Maryland, and other prominent Republicans, a Mr. James M. Beck considered himself especially called upon to express his unqualified dissatisfaction with the President of our country.</p>
   <p>This gentleman said: "He (President Wilson) is now attempting to force a peace which is not based upon a victory, upon our allies. His foreign policy <pb facs="5418474_5_0220.jpg" n="2"/>is the blackest stain on the history of our country. Last fall I saw Lord Grey in London. He said: 'We have no fight with America. Enlarge your navy to twice the size of ours, if you wish. But if your President tries to bully us we will not permit it. Why invite another war with Germany?' I agree with Lord Grey. Never before has an American president done anything that is as contemptible as the attempt to force his personal, selfish aims upon our allies. Should England and France accept Wilson's conditions (of peace) it would be an invitation to Germany to fight again. In any other country Wilson would be forced to resign from office or summoned to court for trial."</p>
   <p>First of all, one is forced to reply that in any other country Mr. Beck's venomous tongue would be silenced, and he would be thrown out; like all others who continually hearken unto London, comply with every British hint, are more British than the Britishers, consider everything that England says inviolable gospel, and look upon England's wishes as absolute law, he would <pb facs="5418474_5_0221.jpg" n="3"/>be sent to the place where he--to judge from his attitude--belongs. Our country should have no more room for people whose loyalty belongs to England or to any other foreign nation, and who subordinate America and her interests to those of some other nation, than it has for people who disseminate the doctrines of Bolshevism and thus endanger the peace and security of our country and seek to undermine her institutions.</p>
   <p>The just anger which was aroused by Beck's attack will soon abate and give way to a gentler spirit, for it is all too evident that the fine little verse, "A graybeard sits on the roof quite puzzled, Helpless and obviously somewhat bamboozled," is applicable to Mr. Beck and his henchmen, who condemned the President's foreign policy and his efforts in behalf of peace. The "old man" who evokes our sympathy is doing only what one who is angry and envious usually does--he indulges in slander.</p>
   <p>That is the sole criterion for evaluating Mr. Beck's statements. Only with <pb facs="5418474_5_0222.jpg" n="4"/>this fact in mind and with the belief that the slanderer always condemns himself and his cause can one endure the discourse of people like Mr. Beck. One must not take them seriously; otherwise only two courses would be open, either to deport them or to confine them in a safe place, perhaps in a sanatarium where they may recover from their mental derangement and regain their memory.</p>
   <p>For if the "Becks"--we refer to all those who speak as Mr. James M. Beck did at the Lincoln banquet of the Republican Club in New York--when the Becks" mention "our allies" and state that President Wilson is trying to force them, especially England, to accept his conditions of, and plans for, peace, they must have forgotten that "the Allies"--not "our allies"--accepted the President's peace plans and conditions long ago; they voiced their assent immediately at the time when Wilson's proposals and terms for peace were published. Hence, all that is necessary now is that the President admonish "the Allies" or persuade them to keep the promise which is <pb facs="5418474_5_0223.jpg" n="5"/>implied in their assent. And we infer that the "Becks" are mentally deranged from their assertion that the President's endeavors to persuade "the Allies" to keep their promise, and to adhere to the great idea of bringing about a permanent world peace through absolute justice to all nations, is a stain upon American history. Just the opposite is true. The verdict of these critics would be in order if the President, and with him the American nation, did not make every effort to realize the great democratic ideas which are embodied in the President's program for a league of nations and universal peace.</p>
   <p>Lord Grey says, "We have no fight with America." Well, we, we good one-hundred-per-cent Americans, say, "We have no fight with England." And we have no fight with Lord Grey or any other Englishman, or with any Frenchmen, etc., who do not like President Wilson's program, now that they are no longer in need of America's help. We are opposed only to those "Also-Americans" who, because of party hatred or envy, are so un-American as to turn against the President, or so British as to place England's interests above those of <pb facs="5418474_5_0224.jpg" n="6"/>America. However, we do not look upon these "Also-Americans" as our enemies; we do not hate them; we have naught but sympathy for them. "A greybeard sits on the roof quite puzzled. Helpless and obviously somewhat bamboozled." Their own helplessness induces the international "leaders" of the Republican party to slander and mock the President because of his foreign politics. They can find nothing else and know of no other way to help themselves.</p>
