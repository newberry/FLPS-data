   <p>The present political situation offers loyal Americans of German blood a chance to remove the unjustified suspicion which is still entertained toward them by a large part of the population. In this way they will do a service not only to America but also to the German people. This chance consists of voting next Tuesday only for those candidates who are known to be willing to carry out President Wilson's war and peace program to the letter!</p>
   <p>This is the most effective means for Americans of German descent to regain the respect due them. On the other hand, it must be said that they will probably soon be sorry for every vote which could be interpreted as having been cast as a protest against America's entry into the war and its continuation.</p>
   <p>Isn't it time to look at facts in the proper way? President Wilson has acted consistently since the day war was declared. He stated then that the <pb facs="5418474_5_0513.jpg" n="2"/>war was directed against the autocratic and militaristic German Government and not against the German people. This distinction he has never lost sight of, regardless of the extent to which many others have tried to blur it.</p>
   <p>At the present time he is trying to induce the German people to get rid of their military rulers and to establish a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. After this has been done, peace will soon be concluded, and countless human lives will be saved from destruction.</p>
   <p>But what do President Wilson's opponents want? The socialists, hostile to war, aim to implant the spirit of Bolshevism over here because they believe that this would aid Berlin. They pretend to care nothing about class distinctions, but continually appeal to class hatred, whereas what we need, more than anything else, is unity in thought and action.</p>
   <p>Still other opponents of President Wilson are trying to seize power in <pb facs="5418474_5_0514.jpg" n="3"/>order to continue the war, and are determined not to make any distinction between the German Government and the German people at the peace conference table. Such a procedure would be a grave injustice since the German people never were given a chance to make their will known.</p>
   <p>What should be done under the circumstances is therefore obvious. Every American of German descent should vote only for candidates who are known to be supporters of the President.</p>
   <p>[Letter to the Editor by M. F.]</p>
   <p>As I understand it, the United States Senate has the power to conclude treaties. The United States Senate determines the nature and the terms of America's treaties. In case a Republican Senate is elected, Senator Lodge will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and will draw up the peace terms. Will such a treaty, sponsored by Senator Lodge, be based on true democracy or on partisan interests? I believe the latter. Can we, after all, expect from Senator Lodge a treaty which is based on <pb facs="5418474_5_0515.jpg" n="4"/>justice, full justice for all peoples--justice not only toward those to whom we want to be just, but also toward those to whom we should be just? I don't think we can. Everybody should think of that before he votes.</p>
   <p>[Letter to the Editor by Otto Schweikardt]</p>
   <p>Those people who do everything possible to take from the President the power to conclude treaties and conduct peace negotiations, and who try to transfer this power to Senator Lodge, who, in case a Republican Senate is elected, would become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, have done, and are still doing, all that they can to prevent an early peace. They are using all their influence to maintain the autocracy of high finance and of the giant corporations in our country.</p>
   <p>It is the old struggle--older and more vicious than the World War--the struggle for the privilege of dominating people and nations. If we make this privilege the master of the world at the coming elections, then we really deserve what we will get; and we'll get more than we probably like.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0516.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>[Letter to the Editor by Dr. M. Schwimmer]</p>
   <p>To all Americans of German origin this question should seem important: What candidates for the Senate should be elected and what candidates absolutely must be elected? President Wilson said to his people, "Give me men whom I can use to establish a just and permanent peace."</p>
   <p>President Wilson may have been misunderstood by millions of German-Americans and, to be frank, I was one of them. But today I see him in a different light and I recognize in him the greatest idealist whom the world has seen for thousands of years. If he is not he should certainly drop his mask; then the halo which is surrounding him today would disappear in utter darkness. But this will never happen, for even his worst enemy must admit that he is one of the smartest politicians in the world and is ambitious. Whoever follows his speeches and policies will find that he is very hostile to the German aristocracy and the government ruled by it, but never hostile to the German people.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0517.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Today Germany has need of the man who has the greatest influence and has the power to protect her. Don't we have to admit that Wilson feels a moral obligation to make good every word he utters? The whole world looks to President Wilson in the hope that he will restore order in this chaos--to the man Wilson who has always emphasized his friendship for the German people. So let us stand by him, that he may crown his work with human dignity and justice.</p>
   <p>The war has freed Germany from class and caste spirit and President Wilson will find a different Germany to negotiate with. May his idealism and his sense of justice guide him, so that everything will turn out well.</p>
   <p>Now let us look at his opponents. They desire and advocate war until Germany is destroyed. Can a voter of German origin entertain any doubt as to how he should cast his vote? Let President Wilson prove that everything he says is true; that he is a friend of the German people. But, at the same time, let every American of German descent prove that he appreciates this attitude by voting for those men of whom President Wilson approves in <pb facs="5418474_5_0518.jpg" n="7"/>order to carry through his program. He is the one who can save us from grief by protecting the German nation from annihilation.</p>
   <p>Cannot everybody of German stock consider President Wilson the greatest, best, and most efficient leader of the American nation, if by virtue of his power and influence everything is settled without the destruction of the land of our fathers? The world and the millions of German-Americans, especially, will look up to him as a savior and benefactor of mankind, and he will live on in history as an idealist and intellectual leader of the American nation.</p>
   <p>It is inconceivable that President Wilson, with his keen mind, should fail to realize all this and act accordingly. The enemy he set out to destroy is defeated; the time has now come for him to act for the benefit of all nations of the world.</p>
   <p>If they have the welfare of their native country at heart, all German- <pb facs="5418474_5_0519.jpg" n="8"/>Americans must and should disregard party affiliations and vote for Senator Lewis. Vote for a just peace.</p>
