<title level="a">AN UNSUITABLE BILL</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The United States Senate has adopted a bill which limits the working period to thirty hours per week....Fifty-three votes were cast in favor of the bill, while thirty votes were cast against it. The bill provides that any employer who violates this law, regardless of his kind of manufacture or produce, shall be excluded from foreign export as well as from interstate trade.</p>
   <p>According to reports from Washington, many voted in favor of the bill merely to impose upon the United States Supreme court the task of deciding upon the constitutional rights of this and similar measures. If credence may be given to this report, the representatives have indeed acted foolishly and in utter disregard of their duty. No legislative body should ever attempt to supply the Supreme Court with test cases; their duty is to create laws and to assume full responsibility for such laws.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1629.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The bill is supposed to provide work for many more job seekers, thus reducing the number of the unemployed. The principle is, of course, beyond criticism, but to expect that it could be applied uniformly to every phase of the field of industry is simply an error.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly there are thousands of factories which could easily adopt a thirty-hour working week, and others where a curtailment of working hours could be introduced without the slightest interference with their daily routine work, even if carried out more extensively than in the proposed measure, but there are also those businesses which would experience great difficulties in attempting to conform to such laws.</p>
   <p>The forcing of such measures upon industry always meets with failure. Legislation should never become involved, since this is a subject which concerns only the employer and the employee, and should therefore, be discussed and settled by these parties. Any meddling by authorities would have a detrimental effect.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1630.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us focus our attention upon the brewery business, which is at present very active. Does a single person believe that the employees of these breweries, which are now operating above the normal schedule, have any intention of protesting against the increased working hours? On the contrary. These employees are well aware of the fact that an extra heavy demand has been placed upon the brewing industry, resulting in extraordinary efforts on the part of the workers who must carry on under any circumstances until normal conditions can be established. Furthermore, these men, whose enforced idleness has extended through a period of several years are not averse to earning extra money. And since similar conditions are apt to arise in almost any field of industry, it is simply unthinkable that a uniform measure could be applied to all industries throughout the country.</p>
   <p>The President's attitude toward this particular legislative measure was not revealed in the report from Washington. However, a statement was made by Senator Robinson of Arkansas, the Democratic leader in the Senate, which would lead one to suppose that the amended measure would greatly <pb facs="5418474_5_1631.jpg" n="4"/>please the President. It now depends solely upon the President whether the proposed bill will go to the House, or whether it will receive no further attention. Of course the latter of these alternatives would be preferable. If the proposed measure becomes a law, it must of necessity prove a failure, because the enforcement of the law would require an army of inspectors; a procedure which would decidedly increase the expenditures of the Government.</p>
   <p>However, the measure does provide that the law shall be in force for a limited period, not in excess of two years. But this may be only a lofty phrase. It has been demonstrated more than once that Federal bureaucracy, once established, is not easily abolished.</p>
