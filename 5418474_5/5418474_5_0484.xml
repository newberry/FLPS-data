   <p>The following letter and contribution received by Mrs. Eitel to swell her fund towards the purchase of the ambulance for the Red Cross in Stuttgart, Germany, gives ample testimony of our Swabians' sympathy towards Mrs. Eitel's efforts!</p>
   <p>Enclosed please find a check for $5.30 to augment the fund for the ambulance for Stuttgart, the noble deed so ardently supported by you. The donors of this little contribution represent a family with eight children who earned this meager amount by making small, wire articles in order to help the good cause.</p>
   <p>The father is a Swabian who served in the Wuertembergian Army and he has a <pb facs="5418474_5_0485.jpg" n="2"/>number of relatives who are now fighting in the war; one of them died recently for the fatherland.</p>
   <p>Wishing you all possible success in your commendable work and hoping that the terrible war will s on end in favor of our beloved German Fatherland, we remain,</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Amann Family,</p>
   <p>5437 Bishop Street.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Eitel hopes to bring the collection to a satisfactory close and begs all Swabians who thus far have not participated, to help her. Contributions may be sent to Eitel Brothers, 173 W. Randolph Street, or to Mrs. Emil Eitel, 660 Irving Park Boulevard. The total, up to the present, amounts to $630.05. Since our last accounting the following sums have been received: Nathias Uttenweiler, $1; . . . . Unnamed, $100;. . . . total $211.30. Formerly acknowledged, 418.75; total $630.05.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0486.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>[The list contains 45 names, altogether. Among them the separate sums earned and donated by the Amann children. Thus: Johann and Emma Amann, $2; Florence Amann, 50 cents;..... Baby Bern'd Amann, 10 cents. Transl.]</p>
