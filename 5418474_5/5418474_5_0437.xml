   <p>More and more, peculiar aspects are produced through the hatred of all Germans, which nearsighted people, contrary to the wishes of the President and the government in Washington, are trying to stir up here. Now one Thomas A. Willoughby demands that the German House in Jackson Park, which was saved in response to a general request after the World's Columbian Exposition, should be demolished. A building of such architectural beauty and substantial construction was worthy of outliving the fleeting dream of the exposition, by a quarter of a centruy. Hundreds of outliving the fleeting dream of the exposition, by a quarter of a centruy. Hundreds of thousands enjoyed its appearance, not because it reminded them in any way of Germany, or the relation of America and Americans to the German State, but on account of its peculiar beauty, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the German Government with which we are at war.</p>
   <p>Does this Mr. Willoughby, or the editor of the column of an English morning paper, who printed this silly stuff, really think that with such a proposition, or its execution, we will be able to further the noble war aims of America, even by one inch? The newspaper can not convince anybody, that it is not responsible for such incitement. It goves the papers the honorable name "The voice of the people", but it selects very carefully from the letters those, which it considers <pb facs="5418474_5_0438.jpg" n="2"/>as the voice of the people, in the sense of ideas represented by it. Instead of referring to the fact, that art and its associate, the style of architecture, is sacrosanct, that the war, which unfortunately destroys civilization everywhere, should never be carried to this ground, the Tribune incites and agitates. Nothing has hurt Germany more in the eyes of the world, even among those of German heritage, that at the be sinning of hostilities they tolerated a song of hatred and phrases like: "God punish England", and even furthered the same. The smallest, even intentional, injury of an artistically valuable building in Belgium is credited to Germany as barbarism and is used as a bitter weapon against German culture. And then comes a leading American newspaper, and gives place in its columns to such a senseless proposition as "God punish Germany". All this would be just as true as it is objectionable, if it should not be directed against a German edifice, but against an artistic memorial symbol which had originated from another nation. The sentiment, which we express here, is shared by many distinguished, highly patriotic Americans who with all their power, are working for the defeat of the German Government. It is our special duty to point out the discord, which is spreading among certain groups of the American people. Since the first hours of the war we have been working with all the power at out disposal in the severe conflict of soul, which the Americans of German blood have to endure, to bring them not only to right action, but to right sentiments as well. The Tribune <pb facs="5418474_5_0439.jpg" n="3"/>declares in an editorial, on the same page on which it publishes the bungling work of Mr. Willoughby, that it fully understands the sentiments of the German American citizens. Nevertheless, it permits that the exhausting labor, which we and all leaders of German -American are performing with patriotic devotion to America, should always be disturbed by senseless and aimless injuries. Really it is high time to put an end to such actions and to call: "Videant consules, ne quid detrimenti respublica capiat";(in English, "Lay off:")</p>
