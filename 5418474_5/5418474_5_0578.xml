   <p>Thousands of German and Austro-Hungarian war prisoners, among them numerous women and children, suffer fearfully from exposure and lack of clothing, particularly in Siberia. Many of them were not enabled to take anything along-aside from what they wore-when they suddenly were dragged into Siberia during the early part of the war. In the winter their condition can only be ameliorated with money. In the Canadian concentration camps delivery is assured and therefore clothing, shoes, and similar articles are preferred.</p>
   <p>A number of ladies, in collaboration with the German Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, have made it their goal to help our unfortunate brothers and sisters in Siberia and Canada and, therefore, have opened an office on the premises of the Hamburg-America Line, 16 North La Salle Street, near Randolph Street, where donations of money, warm clothing, shoes for men, women, and children, blankets, new and used, and similar articles will be received. Small presents <pb facs="5418474_5_0579.jpg" n="2"/>will also be gratefully accepted, because, when combined with other goods, it helps to make a sizable shipment.</p>
   <p>The office is open from 10 o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>All who are willing to aid this cause can become members of The Ladies Aid for War Prisoners. Membership cards can be obtained for one dollar, at 160 N. La Salle Street. Telephone: Main 3650.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna M. Schaedler, Chairman;.... [nine names listed, in all. Transl.]. Assist us in helping the sufferers in Siberia.</p>
