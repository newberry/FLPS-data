   <p>The President of our Republic has solemnly admonished the people to preserve the strictest neutrality in regards to the great war, not only in their actions but also in their words and attitude. He has made it the duty of every citizen to refrain from any public demonstrations or expressions of sympathy. American citizens of German descent, mindful of their duty towards the Republic, have heeded the words of the President. They have refrained from any actions which might be construed as or might lead to a demonstration in behalf of Germany or Austria-Hungary. They have advised the Irish and the Swedes to remain quiet. These nationalities sympathize with the German cause because they expect nothing from an Allied victory but disaster for their homelands and the United States, and therefore they have instigated protest meetings against the baiting of Germans in this country. German-Americans have complied with the President's demand, even though it was difficult for them under the circumstances; even though in Washington they did not bother <pb facs="5418474_5_1122.jpg" n="2"/>to explain why it was necessary to subject the German [transatlantic] wireless stations to such a strict censorship while reports transmitted through British cables pass uncensored. And the German language press has not only adopted the same attitude [of impartiality] but has asked so urgently for compliance with the President's request that occasionally it has been accused of pussyfooting.</p>
   <p>The non-German population acts about the same way as the German element and their sympathizers, but the English language press plays a quite different game. They continue with their anti-German propaganda, even on a larger scale than before the President's warning was published. They keep on fomenting hatred against anything German. They do their utmost to foster and disseminate chauvinistic hatred within our Republic. They do not heed the President's warning, but make a mockery of it by their conduct.</p>
   <p>How? In their editorials they assume a righteous tone; they pretend impartiality, or at least try to give the impression that the welfare of our <pb facs="5418474_5_1123.jpg" n="3"/>great Republic is their first concern. But they fail at that. From start to finish, between the lines and even between two words they betray in their editorials their pro-British partisanship which almost degenerates into a slavelike servility to British interests. But even that isn't the worst feature. That can be excused. The English language press in America probably cannot help having British inclinations. But their manner of reporting is inexcusable, malicious, and downright criminal.</p>
   <p>The papers we have in mind deny that of course. All they do, they say, is publish the reports they receive. As simple as that. If the reports happen to be of an anti-German tendency, it is not their fault. But that is a poor and dishonest alibi. It is usually not customary for newspapers to reproduce indiscriminately any reports they receive. They are not allowed to do that. It is the duty of every reputable paper to check upon the veracity of the incoming news dispatches, and as a rule this is always done. That procedure is ignored only at present, when overseas dispatches tend to paint a black picture of the Germans and the German cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1124.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We may overlook it if they dress up every irresponsible rumor of allied victories, every wild and fear inspired dispatch of Belgian, French, and English deeds of heroism, regardless how ludicrous and absurd, as reliable front page news. We will let it pass if they depict German soldiers as being slaughtered by the hundreds of thousands like stupid sheep, first by the Belgians and then by the English--on paper, of course. Such news loses its importance and value if that same paper has to admit the steady and victorious progress of the German armies. The lies prove to be a boomerang for their disseminators. But it is inexcusable and a crime for them to reproduce all the wild stories about German atrocities, as only the fiendish mind of the British can invent them, without hesitation or commentary, below screaming headlines on the front pages!</p>
   <p>Surely they must know themselves that the stories about bestial German atrocities cannot be true. To believe them to be true would repudiate everything that has ever been said or written for decades and centuries <pb facs="5418474_5_1125.jpg" n="5"/>about Germany and the German people, about German ideals and German culture; that all the cultural values which Germany has created and all the contributions to civilization she has made exist only in the imagination; that the German people culturally are standing on the land of Attila or Ghengis Khan and his hordes; or that the Germans have suddenly gone mad, from the Kaiser down to the lowliest worker.</p>
   <p>The English language press know the reports they are receiving to be false. But they are printing them just the same--without pointing out the unreliability of their sources; they make front page news out of them in order to arouse in the American people a hatred against Germany and everything that is German and to drive this Republic into dependency on England. Is that American patriotism? Is that the way to heed the warning of the President? Or does it not mean to scorn his wise words and to betray the best interests of the United States to the English and their lackeys, the French, Russians, Japanese, Africans, and [east] Indians?</p>
