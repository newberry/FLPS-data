   <p>The President's veto message and the passage of the vetoed Patman bill by the House make it clear that, in the final analysis, there is only one reason for passing the bill, and that is the representatives' fear of the votes of the organized veterans. The arguments advanced by President Roosevelt against the bill are irrefutable. No attempt was made in the House to refute them. The message was very much to the point. It refrained from making attacks; one could even maintain that, in his statements, the President did not even give expression to his personal views. He merely made reference to undeniable facts, and above all to one fact, namely, that, in the year 1924, an agreement was made between the government and the veterans. It is his opinion that this agreement should be adhered to.</p>
   <p>There has been much discussion of the bonus, and just as much has been <pb facs="5418474_5_0049.jpg" n="2"/>written about it, so that the President can hardly be expected to have new views. Yet, he achieved it. He began by dealing, with some thoroughness, with the history of the bonus question, and, in so doing, he reminded us of some facts which are undeniably correct, but which have been forgotten by many. He emphasized, in particular, that the country has already done much for the veterans and has proved itself quite generous in this respect. He brought to mind that the bonus originally provided an insurance capital, to which was to be added a small sum for each day of active service, and also a further increase of twenty-five per cent. The whole amount, including interest, falls due in the year 1945.</p>
   <p>These were the most important stipulations of the agreement made in 1924 between the government and the representatives of the veterans. The immediate paying of the bonus would mean that the veterans are to receive now the interest due them in 1945. This would increase the amount agreed upon by $1,600,000,000. Roosevelt further attacked the reasons advanced in favor of immediate payment of the bonus. He takes these reasons, one after the other, <pb facs="5418474_5_0050.jpg" n="3"/>and refutes them so that an unbiased observer cannot deny that his arguments are sound and irrefutable.</p>
   <p>One of the most weighty of the President's arguments is that the immediate payment of the bonus would benefit nobody. The veterans who are employed are not in need of the bonus; those on relief will lose the relief the moment they get the bonus. Likewise, the President's arguments against the payment of the bonus in paper money, for which there is no collateral, deserve attention, although, because of the confusion that exists concerning the question, they will find little understanding among the large masses of the public.</p>
   <p>But all the President's arguments made no impression upon the members of Congress. Only ninety-eight of them had the courage to vote to sustain the veto, and three hundred and twenty-two voted against it. That was to be expected from the beginning and, strictly speaking, one cannot blame the congressmen for voting in favor of the bill against their own convictions, for, in spite of the most convincing arguments, the fact still remains that scarcely a <pb facs="5418474_5_0051.jpg" n="4"/>congressman may hope to be re-elected if he opposes the will of the organized veterans. The fate of the delegation from Illinois is particularily in-formative in this respect. When, in a session of the last Congress, the bonus bill came to a vote, the representatives from Illinois voted almost unanimously in favor of it. Only one of them voted against it, Representative James Simpson, Jr. He was the only one who was not renominated at the following primaries.</p>
   <p>If one is to draw a lesson from these events, one cannot reproach the representatives for having voted in favor of the bill. They are aware that their own political future depends on organized groups, and so they bow to the will of these groups without argument. Naturally, they should place the common weal higher than their own comfort, but only a few are possessed of so much heroism. Senators are candidates for re-election only once in six years, and for that reason they usually show a little more independence than their colleagues on the other side of the Capitol. This time they supported the President's veto. But with this, the affair is not yet closed, for now the veterans' lobby will probably seek the passage of one of the other bonus bills, and the <pb facs="5418474_5_0052.jpg" n="5"/>play will be resumed.</p>
