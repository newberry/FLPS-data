   <p>"It may appear as though everything is in order," it is stated in a report published by two officials of the Federal Employment Service, "yet it is possible that the cook who was engaged by the lady of the house has an agreement with the private employment agency to conduct herself in such a way that she will be 'unemployed' in three weeks' time and can be assigned to some other household. A laborer may pay two or three dollars for the address of a firm that wants workers, only to find, upon arriving at the firm's place of business, that he is the nineteenth man sent by the agency, whereas the firm had work for only ten men. Or he may be employed by the firm and pay the agency ten per cent of his first month's wages, and be dismissed after one week. Such agreements between employment managers and employment agents are by no means rare. It is not our intention to ascribe like practices to all employment agencies, but some employment firms are guilty."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1679.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is the verdict of Messrs George W. Kirchwey and Charles P. Barnes, two prominent Federal Employment Service officials who studied private employment agencies for many years.</p>
   <p>"It is equally difficult for employers and employees to prove existing dishonesty and exploitation, "said Mr. Kirchwey," yet it can be truthfully stated that many private agencies are unscrupulous, and many are incompetent, and that even honestly conducted agencies limit their activity to a restricted field and can afford but little opportunity of employment. Then too, they are not actuated by the proper motives and lack the necessary facilities to do things which are indispensible to the interests of those who seek employment".</p>
   <p>"The greatest disadvantage of private agencies," said Mr. Barnes, "consists in the fact that they are tempted to cheat and exploit their clients. The law allows the agent a certain percentage of the first month's wages. Even if the client is not hired the agent charges something for his efforts. I do not assert that the agent always lies about a job, but he can easily send twenty people, whom he charges <pb facs="5418474_5_1680.jpg" n="3"/>one or two dollars each, to an address where only ten men are needed. We have found some cases in Chicago which appear to be revolting. An agent admitted that he charged a man sixteen dollars for furnishing the address of a Montana firm which paid only $1.75 per day, and the agent did not even guarantee that the man would be hired. Men not only can be, but have been sent to other remote states where there was no work for them and many clients have repeatedly been the losers through such schemes. Agreements with employment managers who engage, but soon dismiss, persons recommended by agencies, in order to give the agencies opportunity to get new commissions, which are shared with the employment manager, are especially reprehensible. Applicants for house work are also fleeced in this manner. I shall cite only one of numerous instances: The agent charges the lady of the house six dollars, and was supposed to charge the applicant, a girl, two dollars. According to a secret pact made with the agents, the girl conducted herself in such a way that her dismissal was necessary in a few days, and she received a share of the six dollars. Then the lady of the house was obliged to pay an additional six dollars to the agent as his fee for <pb facs="5418474_5_1681.jpg" n="4"/>procuring another girl. The first girl was sent to another housewife, who also paid six dollars, and she to was compelled to dismiss the girl 'for cause'. There were many instances of such dishonesty.</p>
   <p>Again, agencies are often requested to furnish men or women for certain kinds of work for which they have no applicants. Bitter competition between the agencies precludes any co-operation in filling vacancies, and thus they send applicants who are unable to render satisfactory services; and the in-efficient man or woman, who is hired, also suffers."</p>
   <p>From the above statement and other facts, the authors of the report deduce that a permanent and reliable employment agency should be organized and placed at the service of employers applicants, and agency which is not influenced by selfish interests, which is in constant touch with labor conditions and the labor market in the entire country and thus can care for the lack of workers in one section by sending a part of the labor surplus of another area. In this respect <pb facs="5418474_5_1682.jpg" n="5"/>the service rendered by the bureau which has been organized by the Federal Government has been very satisfactory. The appropriation necessary to operate it is included in proposals which the last Congress resolved to reconsider. Meanwhile this service will be maintained, though to a limited extent, in the expectation that the next Congress will make capacity operation possible by furnishing the necessary money.</p>
