   <p>The following information has come to the Abendpost from the War Department at Washington:</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor: The War Department is familiar with and grateful for the splendid work done by the German press in America to help demobilized soldiers and sailors obtain employment. The German press is doing the community a real service by arousing public interest in this problem and by enlisting the aid of businessmen in its solution.</p>
   <p>"This division of the War Department is endeavoring to unite the various phases of the employment question and to establish itself as a central office by means of which all efforts to solve this problem may be centralized. The Division has no intention of supplanting any organization which tries <pb facs="5418474_5_0109.jpg" n="2"/>to procure work for persons who have been released from military service; it strives to supplement such activity and to provide a basis for co-operation among such groups.</p>
   <p>"For this purpose, and to enable you to continue the excellent service which you render the nation, we are sending you some readily adaptable articles....(sic) We are certain that if you use them they will aid in convincing soldiers, sailors, employers, and workers, as well as the general public, that their continued help and co-operation are necessary to solve this problem. In this way, the War Department's activity along these lines will be publicized.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Arthur Woods,</p>
   <p>"Assistant to the Secretary of War,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0110.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Abendpost will publish these articles in their prescribed order.</p>
