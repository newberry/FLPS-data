   <p>"Peace on earth, good will to men"--this is, in brief form, the ordinary interpretation of President Grant's lengthy statements on Cuban affairs. After all, one asks with some surprise, why should Mr. Grant use so many thousands of words to say that he has nothing to say about Cuba? But the numbskulls of Madrid seem to think differently; to them the very fact that Grant talked so much about Cuba--although in an aimless and rambling fashion--is a threat and a challenge. The Spanish attitude is akin to that of the Irishmen at Donnybrook Fair, where the Hibernians permit their coattails to drag in the street in order to provide a pleasant excuse for starting a fight should any one happen to step on that appendage. And now the Spaniards believe, hope, wish (and at the same time fear) that President Grant stepped on their coattails.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1336.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nothing happened. The President's lengthy speech about Cuba amounts to this: That the United States is not concerned with Cuba; that the United States cannot recognize the revolutionary Cubans as a nation or as belligerents; that the United States finds no cause for immediate intervention between the fighting Cubans and Spain; and that what may happen later should preferably be considered in the future.</p>
   <p>These peaceful declarations of President Grant have been completely and most foolishly misunderstood in Madrid, while in this country they have proved an exceedingly pleasant surprise because, due to the propaganda of certain papers which, presumably, enjoyed the President's confidence, the belief has prevailed that Mr. Grant, in his message [to Congress?], would resort to saber rattling and war whoops--to provide a new issue for his third term presidential campaign.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1337.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If the reports of the Washington correspondent for the Chicago Times are reliable, then Mr. Grant actually had some such intentions. That part of the President's message--so this correspondent assured us--was originally written in a bellicose and war-provoking manner. But the election of Kerr as Speaker changed the entire program.</p>
   <p>If Randall had been elected, the President would have considered it proof that the Democratic Congressional majority faces disintegration through exposures of graft, corruption, and malfeasance in office, and that the Republican party, by following a deliberate--yes, even bold--war policy, would be able to maintain its leadership. But Kerr's election changed all this. The President saw in this that the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives cannot be bamboozled; that they pursue their own policy in an unperturbed manner; that politically they act in a positive manner, and cannot be bluffed. And now the President considers it expedient to draw in his horns. And thus at the eleventh hour the paragraphs having to do with Cuba were stricken from the President's message, and a suitable patch was inserted by the prudent Hamilton Fish. <pb facs="5418474_5_1338.jpg" n="4"/>As circumstantial evidence confirming these assertions one might call attention, for instance, to the totally different styles of the purported insertion by Fish and the nonsense which exuded from Grant's own pen.</p>
   <p>Be that as it may, it is very gratifying that the message will silence the war clamor. There is now hope that vile will-o'-the-wisps will not induce Congress to deviate from that course which a sane and sober observation of the country's true requirements prescribes.</p>
   <p>The problems of Congress are definitely of a peaceful nature: No involvement in disputes with other nations, no playing in other people's back yards; it is the duty of Congress to consider the rights and economic conditions of our own nation.</p>
   <p>Only if it can settle this problem to the satisfaction of the people will the public entrust the administration of the nation's affairs to the party which has the majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
