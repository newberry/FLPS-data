   <p>Representatives of the German Division of the Foreign Language Organization met in the North Side Turner Hall last evening, with Mr. Henry G. Zander in the chair. The purpose of the meeting was to devise ways and means for a general participation in the Victory Liberty Loan by American citizens of German parentage during the remaining days of the campaign. It was brought out that the German response has been greater than official reports have indicated. Many owners of large establishments subscribed as representatives of their firms, and naturally, these subscriptions were not credited to the German Division. Others made purchases as employees of large firms, and their subscriptions are listed among those of "nonnationality" groups. Nevertheless, all who were present in the meeting promised to work for the cause during the last few days of the campaign, and accepted the necessary material. Several societies will also send letters to all of their members.</p>
   <p>The white silk banner which the Government presented to the members of the German Division was on display. It was resolved to award it to the Society which raises subscriptions for the greatest amount of money. The German <pb facs="5418474_5_0113.jpg" n="3"/>Unity Club is in first place at present. Another noon meeting will be held early next week, and the result of the work of the German Division will then be reported.</p>
