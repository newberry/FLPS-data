   <p>At the beginning of the war, the Allies claimed,-and this includes the Americans who are unaccustomed to independent thinking and rely upon the "World opinion" as their morning papers serve it, "fresh on the street car," all cut and dried for consumption,-that the powers with the most money are bound to win. Forth-with the statisticians came to the rescue and supplied their figures, based on an estimated amount of hoardings available to the Central Powers, and then came the comparisons with the Allies' inexhaustible reserves, the tremendous wealth of England, France, and Russia. Evidently, something went askew in their involved, convincing computations; Germany and Austria-Hungary should have surrendered long ago, instead of making preparations for a new drive as admitted by the Anti-German press.</p>
   <p>The error is simply attributable to the antiquated belief of the British and a <pb facs="5418474_5_0582.jpg" n="2"/>large part of our citizenry, that everything can be bought for money, even a victory. Weapons, ammunition, and men can be procured with coins, but that does not make an army, regardless of the prevailing enthusiasm for a cause, including a most copious supply of super-excellent and suitable materials. The Allies raised, in a very short time, an army numerically and vastly superior to what the Central powers could offer. Money and other things necessary for a war were available and of the best quality,-only victory could not be coaxed into existence.</p>
   <p>Obviously, nations are blessed with various kinds of riches, but the Allies lacked the right sort. England sat on its well-filled gold bags and opened them when the war began. While it did not broadcast the precious metal, it nevertheless poured out its pound notes to a thirsty world, and in the midst of this golden shower it felt as safe as if resting in Abraham's lap. If it continues this persistent drizzle, then Germany and her Allies must drown in <pb facs="5418474_5_0583.jpg" n="3"/>the eventual, relentless deluge. The national wealth of Central Europe, expressed in marks and pfennige was, of course, not as overpowering as the resources of their adversaries. But these continental people were endowed with unfathomable treasures in the form of capability, conformability and hardiness. Therefore, this wealth was overlooked by the erudite statisticians when they delved into their assuring predications.</p>
   <p>At that time, these mathematicians defined accurately, to the last man, just how large an army the Allies could eventually produce, and told almost to the day and date, when the Central Powers would be exhausted. But that permitted limit passed long ago and no one, so far, has perceived that the German and Austro-Hungarian man power is diminishing or insufficient. These Teutonic races defend themselves on a 400-, 500- and even a 1,000-mile front, and keep their enemies at bay; their troops have not lost the spirit of aggressiveness as they certainly would, if reserves had not been available to fill the depleted ranks. The German is known for thoroughness and prudence. Useless and hopeless daring do not enter his mind. Were it impossible to replace the <pb facs="5418474_5_0584.jpg" n="4"/>disabled soldiers, then Germany would desist from constant attacks which exact a larger toll of casualties than the mere defence of already attained positions. Today such indications are not apparent. On the contrary, it is claimed that a new drive is being planned against the Allies in Northern France, a new kind of diversion. This proves positively that Germany has large reserves available, which are prepared to tax most severely the patience of the enemy.</p>
   <p>The great conflict proves beyond a doubt that the theory whereby the last dollar wins the war, is fallacious. Funds are not as important as morale, that self-sufficient, inner, abundant strength of a people, of which Germany, with its associated nations, is better supplied than the Allies. Regardless of the duration of this terrific struggle, whether it will terminate within a few days, months, or be carried on for years, -hardiness, capacity and courage will win over English money bags, French heroic vengeance, Russian yokels, and conceited Italian fourflushers.</p>
