   <p>At the approach of the New Year's season, prominent men once again express their opinion about the economic situation, making all kinds of predictions more or less favorable, for the future. In recent years, however, these prophesies went out of fashion. In keeping with the American tradition, the prophets usually predicted a distinct improvement of the situation and, since this improvement absolutely refused to materialize, they finally gave up the difficult and thankless occupation. At this New Year's season, however, the prophets may point to quite reliable and convincing signs when they see a good outlook for an improved economic situation.</p>
   <p>The situation is improving in most fields. There is a good outlook that building activities for purposes of industry and commerce are going to show a considerable revival next year. An increase in building activities for dwelling purposes is, under the circumstances, not to be expected, nor is there a possibility for a steady decrease in unemployment. The great <pb facs="5418474_5_1523.jpg" n="2"/>increase of the national debt is, in the first place, the result of the aid given to the unemployed in direct or indirect form. In itself, the growth of the debt is not formidable. When, once again, the general economic situation becomes normal, the money with which the interest and the entire debt would be paid could easily be raised without new taxes.</p>
   <p>What is formidable about the situation is that the debts may continue growing, because a marked decrease in unemployment is not to be expected for some time to come. The whole land faces a vicious circle which is beginning to assume remarkable proportions. Owing to the aid given to the unemployed, the demand for goods for immediate consumption remains favorable. Therefore, capital is continually poured into industry and commerce. These occupational groups thus consume a part of the invested capital much greater in proportion than their actual size. Among others the heavy industries have to suffer.</p>
   <p>The aid given to the unemployed is further the reason why persons who were previously employed in heavy industries now persist in their demands for <pb facs="5418474_5_1524.jpg" n="3"/>higher wages. This is why industry is unable to rise again. If it stays that way, a condition is likely to arise compelling persons previously employed in heavy industry to receive aid permanently. It is, of course, not feasible to abolish relief with one stroke, for this would, in some instances, entail grave hardships. The existing condition, on the other hand, is likewise untenable, for it has the tendency to render unemployment permanent, or even to increase it.</p>
   <p>These final conclusions are confirmed by statistical data, for in spite of the undeniable improvement in the economic situation, extended as it is to numerous fields, there were, according to official figures, 13,920,000 persons unemployed in October of this year. This number constitutes more than twenty-six per cent of all persons capable of being gainfully employed. That general improvement of the economic situation is out of the question with such a high percentage of unemployed, needs no further proof. Here is a problem which will occupy Congress quite seriously when it convenes. The government has begun to interfere with the economic life in an effort to bring about normal conditions again. It has already done much, but it may <pb facs="5418474_5_1525.jpg" n="4"/>never succeed in solving the problem unless it brings the heavy industries back into a sound working condition.</p>
