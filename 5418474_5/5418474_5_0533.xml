   <p>No matter how much the Republican Congress and campaign leaders holler about the President's appeal to the citizens to back him up by electing a Democratic majority for Senate and House--this appeal is, under the circumstances, not only permissible but even imperative; and the reproach made that the President indulges in party politics is absolutely unjustified and lacks foundation.</p>
   <p>This reproach is automatically refuted and proved false by the utterances of Republican statesmen during the Congressional election campaign of 1898. At that time the Spanish-American War was in progress. If what the Republican leaders said then about the patriotic necessity to provide the President with a sympathetic Congress was right and proper, it must also be true today.</p>
   <p>On July 26, 1898, Spain asked for peace, and on August 12, the document was signed which provided for the appointment of a peace committee. This committee <pb facs="5418474_5_0534.jpg" n="2"/>was in session during the election campaign.</p>
   <p>In a campaign speech Theodore Roosevelt said the following: "Don't forget that, whatever your intentions are, the European nations will judge your vote from only one point of view. They will not differentiate. A refusal to back the President this year will be interpreted as a repudiation of his policy of prosecuting the war."</p>
   <p>Former President Benjamin Harrison said, according to the Philadelphia North American of November 1, 1898: "If the world knows that the American people stand unanimously behind the President, the task of the peace committee will be an easy one; but if there is dissension in the ranks--if Democratic members of Congress and Democratic governors are elected--then Spain will feel new hope and a renewal of hostilities, more war, may become necessary in order to make secure what we have already gained."</p>
   <p>At a banquet of the Republican Club of Massachusetts on October 26, 1898, according to the Springfield Republican, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge made the <pb facs="5418474_5_0535.jpg" n="3"/>following statement: "Regarding the peace terms I will say this: One man has the chief responsibility...and this man is the President of the United States. I trust him. I believe in his Americanism and, just as the Constitution entrusted him with this great responsibility, I, as an American citizen, am willing to stand behind him and leave it up to the constitutional representatives to solve the peace problem in the face of Europe and the rest of the world. It is my wish, and I believe it should also be the desire of every patriot, to stand by the President, lend him a helping hand, and not to work against him."</p>
   <p>On November 31, 1898, Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania declared in a speech in behalf of the Republican candidates for Congress:</p>
   <p>"It is extremely important, during the present crisis when our relations with countries abroad are strained, to espouse and back the policy of the President of the United States, and it is hard to exaggerate on this score. For reasonable and patriotic citizens there can be no doubt that it is their absolute duty to support the administration of President McKinley in the <pb facs="5418474_5_0536.jpg" n="4"/>coming election."</p>
   <p>Can a good American today have any doubts about his duty toward President Wilson? Isn't what Harrison and Roosevelt and Senators Lodge and Penrose said in 1898 true today, also? Isn't it even more important today, as we face a much more serious situation where the need for peace is paramount, that we show the world abroad an American people solidly behind the President and his war and peace program, even though--or rather just because--Messrs. Roosevelt, Lodge, Penrose, Smoot, and others condemn today what they preached twenty years ago?</p>
   <p>The expression "Yes, but this is a horse of another color" does not apply here.</p>
