   <p>General Snowden, that proud Fieldmarshal of the Army of Pennsylvania, can now revel in the satisfaction that his military sojourn in Homestead was not intended to be an exclusive serf-performance for the monopolists and our mighty capitalistic interests, but he can also point to a "genuinely military accomplishment".</p>
   <p>It was mentioned in our telegraphic column yesterday; however, the incident deserves more thorough scrutiny and publicity.</p>
   <p>Jams is a young and ordinary soldier of Company "K", 10th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Militia, or National Guard, a harmless knight of the road and peddler in private life. He lives in the town of Waynesburg, forty-five miles southwest from Pittsburgh. When the news of the attempted assassination of Frick (millionaire partner and manager for Carnegie) reached the military camp, Jams exclaimed in a thoughtless moment, just as a sort of silly joke: "Hurrah for Berkmann."</p>
   <p>When the Commander of the 10th Regiment, Col. Streeter heard about it, he promptly ordered the entire regiment to bear arms and in thunderous tones demanded that the perpetrator step out of the ranks. Trembling and barely able to hold his rifle <pb facs="5418474_5_1327.jpg" n="2"/>soldier Jams marched forward. "So you have uttered that 'Hi' for the murderer of (the still living) Mr. Frick," asked the Col. in a horrific voice. Jams, obsessed by fright and terror, shambled hopelessly; speech forsook him, he was only able to wag his swirling head and nod in the affirmative. "Take him to the Guard-hourse!" droned Col. Streeter and then he proceeded forthwith towards the Headquarters of Major General Snowden. Soon thereafter the Col. appeared again, surrounded by several military doctors, who walked with him to the guard house and here the following transpired:</p>
   <p>The unfortunate Jams was suspended by his thumbs and for more than a full half hour he was forced to endure excruciating pain in this torturous position; at intervals a doctor felt his pulse, another occasionally listened to his heartbeat. When Jams was finally released, he dropped to the ground, a senseless heap of flesh. The doctors remained with him, and an hour later he regained enough strength to drag himself to his quarters.</p>
   <p>Now Col. Streeter appears on the scene with a tonsorial artist soldier. The uniformed barber promptly shaves off one half of Jams' hirsute adornments, including half the beard and mustache. Then Jams had to exchange his military suit for civil clothing. During this interim a squad of twenty soldiers and <pb facs="5418474_5_1328.jpg" n="3"/>several drummers marched into position. The nearly lifeless Jams was informed by a corporal, that his citizenship had been revoked, and, in case he attempted to desert, the soldiers have been instructed to "shoot to kill". The twenty then gathered around Jams; and whilst the drum corps played the Hellion-march, the party ambled through the town and one and a half miles beyond the outskirts, where they left the poor devil to shift for himself.</p>
   <p>Generalissimo Snowden, who happens to be a lawyer, justified these procedures by taking recourse to the martial law paragraphs of Pennsylvania. The entire affair is a grewsome outrage; even the most fiendish soldier-tyrant of a European monarchy would never devise such a scheme under similar circumstances.</p>
   <p>Suppose a Prussian military detachment received orders to protect some big industrialist who mistreated his laborers and some fanatic injured the aforesaid Croesus, whereupon a soldier wantonly cheers the assassin, then, about the extreme punishment would be a moderate detention sentence.</p>
   <p>But the barbaric method of suspending soldiers by the thumbs is unknown over there; and in regard to the other degrading attrocities, including the cancellation of citizenship rights by the pronunciamento of any regimental petit-officer or commander <pb facs="5418474_5_1329.jpg" n="4"/>is simply out of the question.</p>
   <p>The Homestead incident in its entirety is a despicable ignominy for the republic and for the State of Pennsylvania in particular.</p>
