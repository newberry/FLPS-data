   <p>Senator Proctor of Vermont described the conditions in Cuba in simple words. He had visited the four Western provinces which still adhere to Spain, while the two Eastern ones, are already called "Cuba Libre." In the City of Havana he noticed but few indications of war, but the open country shows the trail of a fight of desolation. All settlements which are not within the Trochas, i. e. protected by fortifications, have been burnt and destroyed and their former owners are either dead or dying of starvation in the concentration camps where they are confined.</p>
   <p>The Spanish Government confiscated all their customary means of support, without providing other ways to obtain a living or supplying them with victuals. Therefore of the original 400,000 "Reconcentrados" (Prisoners in concentration camps, trans.),200,000 have died already, and those who are still alive present a horrible picture of misery. Senator Proctor, an aged and cautious gentleman, a special friend of the President, apparently does not believe, that a peaceful settlement of this inhumane strife can be accomplished. According to his view, all native Cubans side with the insurgents, all Spaniards who emigrated are loyal to their mother-country and while <pb facs="5418474_5_1314.jpg" n="2"/>the former intend to be entirely independent of Spain, the latter are deaf even to moderate concessions. Attempts at arbitration are impossible under these conditions. Admission of Cuba to the United States, as a state, is not to be recommended according to the senator, and whether the United States will intervene because of strictly humanitarian considerations, he does not even venture to predict. He believes however, that the Cubans are capable of self-government, since many of the more prosperous of its inhabitants, have been educated in England and the United States. Aside from this, he is of the opinion, that if -peace reigns again, there will be an extensive influx of Americans, that many American industries will be founded on the Island and so the revoluntionary tendencies will be eliminated, if it can be claimed to be as prevalent among the Cubans as it is with the Central and South Americans. His view may thus be construed, that it will be a blessing, for the Island if it can throw off the Spanish yoke and continue as an entirely independent State. The well-known Tomas Estrada Palma, speaking for the Insurgents, affirmed the assurances of Proctor, that they will not tolerate even a semblance of Spanish rule, and if necessary they will fight to the last drop of blood, for the absolute liberation of Cuba.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1315.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The United States therefore have only the choice between armed intervention and total indifference. Their good services and advise are not desired by either Spaniards or Cubans, and with benevolent contributions they cannot protect several hundred thousand people from death or starvation for any protracted period. The Insurgents assert, that they can cope with the Spaniards alone, if no one will provide obstacles and the Spaniards are equally convinced, that they can subdue the revolt, if the United States will not help the Rebels. Shall the United States start a war because of sympathy, which after all would require many lives? This is to be decidedly answered in the negative, because the rainy seasons now approaching in Cuba. Only the most ignorant Jingos believe that "We" can chase the Spaniards and be victorious before the beginning of the tropic summer. As a matter of fact, weeks will elapse, before the United States are somewhat prepared, and if they are finally mobilized, they will hardly expose their troops to the deadly Cuban summer climate, which already has taken such great toll among the Spanish soldiers. Spain is nearly exhausted and can hardly stand another summer campaign. Considering all these reasons, it is to be desired, that Congress does not drive the President to war.</p>
