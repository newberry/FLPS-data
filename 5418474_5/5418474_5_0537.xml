   <p>In his appeal to his countrymen, President Wilson said, among other things: "The minority leaders of the present Congress undoubtedly have been in favor of the war, but they are against the administration. At every opportunity since our entry into the war they have tried to take the formulation of a program and the conduct of the war away from me and to employ measures which would suit their own purposes better."</p>
   <p>Mr. Will H. Hays, chairman of the Republican National Committee, made the following reply on behalf of his party: "At no time, and in no way, have the Republicans attempted to take the control out of the President's hands. The President knows it, the country knows it, and you know it. A more infamous, irresponsible, and unjust accusation has never before been made by even the most desperate campaign speaker, to say nothing of a President of the United <pb facs="5418474_5_0538.jpg" n="2"/>States. Mr. Wilson unwillingly admits that the Republicans were for the war. Why does he demand their defeat? Because they are still for the war? Hardly so. No--it is because they are for a peace through victory, not without victory; because they do not believe that a permanent peace can be established by negotiations; because they think that the 'U.S.' stands for 'Unconditional Surrender' as well as for 'United States' and 'Uncle Sam'."</p>
   <p>The accusation which was made against the Republicans in Congress is thus denied by means of a bare assertion, a device to which the average person will always resort when he sees his motives discovered and feels himself unable to refute an accusation by discussing facts and furnishing proofs.</p>
   <p>Staunch Republican partisans may "Know" that the Republican minority in Congress attempted, "at no time and in no way," to take control away from the President. The great majority of the people in this country do not "Know" it! Anyone who had followed the debates and actions in Congress since April of last year with <pb facs="5418474_5_0539.jpg" n="3"/>a little attention would not "Know" anything of the sort or believe it; on the contrary, if he is honest and open-minded, he must admit that the Republicans in Congress did just what the President accused them of, and did it with a lot of enthusiasm and perseverance--and anybody who knows the machinery of party politics would add: "Can you blame them? Why, that's the most natural thing in the world and the Democrats would have done exactly the same thing if matters had been reversed."</p>
   <p>That much the average citizen, who is not so intimately connected with the party, will have to admit because he also knows that the Democratic party leadership in the past was by no means the incarnation of tenderest consideration and angelic virtue. He knows that the two parties are birds of a feather and generally employ the same tactics to promote their party interests, except that the Democratic party lags behind the Republican party as far as cleverness and wiliness is concerned. But the average citizen does not approve of these things and, in the present case, he may be inclined to ask the chairman of the Republican National Committee: "Don't you realize. <pb facs="5418474_5_0540.jpg" n="4"/>my friend, how rude you are?" And not clever at all! Mr. Hays calls the President's accusation an invention, which is far too strong a term. The gentleman "doth protest too much." His case would not stand up under a calm and dispassionate investigation.</p>
   <p>If President Wilson's appeal was not sufficient to secure the votes of all good citizens, and especially of those of German descent, for the Democratic candidates for Senate and House (and here in Illinois for James Hamilton Lewis, especially); and if the statements of the Republican leaders in Congress still had left some doubt, this attack by Mr. Will H. Hays has certainly removed it. For this attack was obviously caused by indignation and resentment at the probable failure of the Republican hopes; and it is now becoming just as obvious that a just, lasting, American, and democratic peace can only be secured if the November 5 elections result in a Democratic majority for House and Senate; a majority on which the President can depend, and which has pledged itself to an American peace program. If you do not want a peace dictated by the Lodges, the Roosevelts, and the European Allies, vote Democratic in the next Congressional elections on November 5.</p>
