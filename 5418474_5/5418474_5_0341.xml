   <p>With the entry of the United States into the World War the naturalization of Germans came to a stop, as everyone knows, but later on it was decreed that those who were in possession of their first papers at least two years prior to the declaration of war by the United States, that is, before April 6, 1915, could be naturalized. Since then hundreds of Germans have petitioned the local courts and have been told that within about three months they would be admitted to an examination; but all, without exception have waited in vain to be summoned. After some of them had lost their patience and had inquired at the Sonntagpost to find out the reason for the delay, a reporter of this paper had a talk with Mr. H. Bartels, manager of the Naturalization Bureau, at the Chancery of the Circuit Court, and the following facts were ascertained:</p>
   <p>As soon as a German applies for citizenship his name is reported to the immigration office in Washington, which then makes a thorough examination of his <pb facs="5418474_5_0342.jpg" n="2"/>case. Only after it has been found that there is nothing objectionable against the petitioner, and that very likely he will make a good American citizen, are the local courts informed that an examination can take place. Apparently, however, this research takes more time than is generally believed--or maybe the office is overloaded with work--at any rate, the fact remains that not a single petitioner has yet been admitted to citizenship.</p>
   <p>Inquiries at the offices of the court are, therefore, simply futile. As soon as a list has been received from Washington of candidates who can be examined and--if successful--naturalized, those eligible will be informed by postal card.</p>
