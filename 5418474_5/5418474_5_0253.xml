   <p>In a report which he published in New York yesterday Federal District Attorney Swann states that sixty-five per cent of the $2,500,000,000 collected for war charities in our country was wasted, and in New York $4,000,000 was stolen outright. The report was compiled by Assistant District Attorney Kilroe, and contains 3,454 closely typed pages. Thus it is evident that these startling and unpleasant revelations were not assembled in haste. Five hundred and thirty-four committees and organizations were examined under the official microscope; 1853 witnesses were questioned, 947 depositions were made, and the letters involved numbered 2,474. In the State of New York $250,000 has been recovered from fraudulent persons and "benevolent societies".</p>
   <p>The report not only condemns dishonest and poorly managed enterprises, but also sharply criticizes members of the "upper 400" and others who use charity as a stepladder to publicity. Among the practices which are especially <pb facs="5418474_5_0254.jpg" n="2"/>objectionable the following are listed: Payment of commissions to solicitors or collectors; collecting money or selling buttons, badges, or merchandise on the streets or in other public places; obtaining money by sending articles which were not ordered, and which are to be paid for or returned--the favorite practice of greedy manufacturers; payment of high salaries to officers and "promoters"; conducting public amusements and bazaars at great cost and little profit; failure to work out a budget and render an account of receipts and disbursements; lack of a competent board of directors to exercise supervision and control; lack of adequate equipment and efficient personnel.</p>
   <p>The District Attorney divides war charity into four classes:</p>
   <p>1. Profitable activity under able and honest management.</p>
   <p>2. Wasteful activity in a meritorious cause by respectable persons who obtain results that are entirely disproportionate to the effort expended, owing to a lack of ability, experience, and business methods.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0255.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>3. Hastily planned, absurd activity, often well-intentioned, but serving no worthy or urgent purpose.</p>
   <p>4. Activity which serves purely personal purposes, though it is carried on under the guise of philanthropy. The report calls those who withhold from charity every penny they collect and put into their own pocket "one-hundred-per-cent boys".</p>
   <p>The details which Mr. Kilroe has unearthed and published in his report are so disgraceful that no decent American citizen can read them without voicing his displeasure and resentment. Notorious creatures have enriched themselves by looting the coffers of charity. But people of position, also, and people who traveled about the country attempting to stir up patriotism by their despicable harassing, saw to it that they received their full share when the collections for charity were distributed. The Federal District Attorney hopes to prevent this type of theft by a threefold law which he will outline and propose to Congress, to the New York State Legislature, and to the <pb facs="5418474_5_0256.jpg" n="4"/>New York City Council. This law will contain regulations concerning the licensing and official supervision of all activities in the interest of public charity.</p>
   <p>Should not the same punishment which they threatened to inflict upon everyone who refused to accede to their arrogant demands be meted out to them, namely, the whipping post?</p>
