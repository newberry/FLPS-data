<title level="a">"I AM A PRUSSIAN...." by A. Paul Maerker-Branden (Formerly Assistant Editor of the German Herald)</title></bibl>

   <p>"Ich bin ein Preusse, kennt ihr meine Farben?" [Translator's note: "I am a Prussian, do you know my colors?" is the beginning of the Prussian (not German) national anthem.] Whoever remembers the first verse of this Prussian march will certainly think of the colors black and white. But no!!--I visualize the black, red, and gold, the colors of a revolutionary Prussia, topped by the date 1848, the year of an awakening, spiritual Germany!</p>
   <p>At that time the rulers of the German people, the potentates and little potentates, by fighting the hopes of the black, red, and gold for a united, spiritual, and thoroughly democratic Germany, laid the foundation for the World War of 1914: they suppressed the desire for spiritual resurrection and internal political settlement with a time-tested device, a fight with the world outside.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0337.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the reactionary days of 1849, when the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, refused to become German emperor because this dignity was offered him by a liberal-minded people and not by submissive servants, Prussia began to rise to predominance in the German federation of states and, subsequently, in the German Reich. The wars of 1864 and 1866 only served the purpose of bringing southern Germany, which always had been much more democratic than Prussia, under the sway of Wilhelmstrasse, the incarnation of Prussia's sabre-rattling world politics of Pan-Germanism. In Versailles, on January 18, 1871, the former prince regent and "case-shot prince" William, brother of Frederick William IV, succeeded in having himself proclaimed German emperor by the German princes--but not by the German people!</p>
   <p>Black, white, and red became the colors of the new German Reich, and not black, red, and gold! The principle of kingly rule had won a victory at Versailles, not the love of liberty, and the desire for human brotherhood of the German people of 1848. And this victory, on January 18, 1871, of the dynastic principle has had its revenge now--for more than four years! For <pb facs="5418474_5_0338.jpg" n="3"/>the preservation of this victory of royalism, millions in flesh and blood and in property have been sacrificed--but now let us call a halt to these sacrifices!</p>
   <p>The black, white, and red of 1871 shall give way to the black, red, and gold of 1848; the impudence of the rulers shall make room for the liberty of the people!</p>
   <p>Buy Liberty Bonds, shares of freedom!</p>
