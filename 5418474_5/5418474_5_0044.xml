   <p>Agitation for the declaration of an arms embargo, in case war breaks out between Italy and Abyssinia, is growing more intense. However, the arguments that are advanced in behalf of the embargo are very weak. It is demanded, among other things, that the United States should not prolong the war by furnishing weapons. It is claimed that we are duty bound by justice to observe an embargo, and it is emphasized that by so doing, we greatly serve the cause of world peace. Above all, it is pointed out, this war does not concern the United States in any way. America should therefore be neutral and remain thus, giving no support to the belligerent countries through the sale of war materials.</p>
   <p>All of these arguments are very weak. Whether or not the war would be prolonged or shortened if our Government proclaims an embargo on the export of <pb facs="5418474_5_0045.jpg" n="2"/>arms and other material, depends upon many unpredictable circumstances. And no one can prove that an embargo will be conducive to the preservation of world peace. Many industrially well developed countries will be ready to sell the two warring nations arms, munitions, and other war material. If our Government declares an embargo it will merely mean that our industries will loose the orders.</p>
   <p>It is perfectly absurd to say that an embargo would be in keeping with the demands of justice and neutrality. It would not be a strictly neutral policy to ban the sale of arms, but rather a very decided stand in favor of Italy. Italy has a very highly developed arms industry, while Abyssinia is entirely dependent upon other countries for guns, cannons, etc. If all countries would refuse to supply Abyssinia with the means to fight, they would merely be deciding the war in favor of Italy, and thus they would be guilty of a very serious violation of neutrality.</p>
   <p>Thus we again see how difficult it is to set general rules to solve international problems of this kind. Theoretically it would be an act of strictest <pb facs="5418474_5_0046.jpg" n="3"/>neutrality if all nations would ban the sale of war materials to Italy and Abyssinia. Actually, however, the embargo would result in an easy victory for Italy.</p>
   <p>As in many other instances, there is also a wide difference between theory and practice in this case, although determined pacifists and world reformers apparently are unable to understand it.</p>
   <p>In this connection Britain is cited as an example. Having been undecided for some time, Great Britain has finally announced that she will permit shipments of arms and munitions, consigned to Italy or Abyssinia, to leave British ports. The United States need not follow the example of Great Britain, since our situation is entirely different from that of England. She is making every effort to prevent the impending conflict because she sees grave danger for her African colonies in case Italy is victorious. However, she would also like to prevent Abyssinia from winning the war because a victory by Abyssinia would undoubtedly greatly strengthen the self-assurance of the black race, and that might cause <pb facs="5418474_5_0047.jpg" n="4"/>her considerable trouble with her colonies.</p>
   <p>In addition, a third point must be taken into account. Even if Abyssinia lost, hundreds of thousands of blacks would become familiar with the use of modern weapons and methods of warfare, and the results would not be favorable to English interests. The United States, on the other hand, need not be governed by such considerations. It can be pointed out that the sympathies of Americans, of the whites as well as of the negroes, are entirely with Abyssinia, and this fact also should be considered by our Government.</p>
