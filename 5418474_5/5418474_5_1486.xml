   <p>It appears to be settled that the bonus bill, in some form or other, will be accepted by Congress within the next few days. There will be an overpowering majority in both houses because this is an election year and there will be few members of Congress who can resist the pressure of the veterans among their voters. Similar bills have been passed repeatedly by the Senate or the separate houses but have always suffered shipwreck when they struck the iron will of the presidents. The last similar bill was vetoed by President Roosevelt during the past year, after he had asserted, in 1932, that he would not consent to immediate payment of the bonus--which is due in 1945--unless the budget is balanced and shows a surplus instead of a constant deficit. At present the budget is not balanced, and there is no way of telling when that time will come. If the <pb facs="5418474_5_1487.jpg" n="2"/>President sticks to his guns then he must also veto the present bonus bill.</p>
   <p>If he does veto the bill, he will undoubtedly lose many votes in the November elections, and, in view of the undeniable fact that the opponents of his economic policy of last year are increasing considerably in numbers, he may possibly make a different decision if Congress presents a bill which offers a compromise between his position and that of the veterans, and provides means to defray the subsequent costs.</p>
   <p>The President has always objected to cash payments on the veterans' certificates prior to maturity. But now he may consent if, in satisfying the demands, the bill substitutes bonds for cash. The fear prevails that cash payments produce inflation; after all, more than two billion dollars are involved. If the amount of money in circulation is suddenly increased by this influx, then it may create an inflation. An additional <pb facs="5418474_5_1488.jpg" n="3"/>two billion dollars will probably not bring about this inflation which they fear, however. But Congress probably will adopt other solutions for the certificate question, in order to insure the President's approval. Should he, however, persist in his veto, then it is obvious that Congress will pass the bill regardless of his opposition.</p>
   <p>This definite prospect does not alter the fact that the demands of the veterans are justified by present conditions. The time is ripe for the extraction of money from the Government; of funds which, according to contractual stipulations, are not due until nine more years have elapsed. But the veterans are stubbornly insistent on obtaining this reward now, not caring whether this admission of their influence upon elections conjures up dangers of an inflation. As extenuating circumstances they [the veterans] can refer only to the fact that the Administration has, within the last years, spent billions and billions for every conceivable purpose and that, in its opinion, an additional two billions would not matter.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1489.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If one judges from all precedents and experience involving the veterans of every war, one may deduce with considerable accuracy that payment of the bonus nine years before it is supposed to mature will not in any way prevent further demands from the veterans.</p>
   <p>It has developed almost into a hereditary right that veterans should ask for more--whenever Congress acceded to their previous requests. It will not be different now. After the bonus is paid, it will have to be paid again and again in various ways. No country has found wars more expensive than the United States. Even the death of the veterans does not liberate the State from their demands. Then young widows make their appearance who often married the hoary warriors for this purpose alone, and ask--who knows for how long--pensions for themselves and possibly for their children. After each war the demands of the veterans were akin to a wringer with perpetual motion. It goes round and round until the last widow of the youngest World War veteran has gone to her eternal rest in the next century.</p>
