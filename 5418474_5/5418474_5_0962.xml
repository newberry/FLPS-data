   <p>The British Prime Minister, Lord Asquith, has discussed the "situation" in the House of Commons. It is too early to say what impression his speech has made on "the outside world". All England is dark; no lights are permitted, no even in the railroad trains. It is therefore impossible to see the long faces. The press is begging for news from the war front. Asquith cannot afford to lift the censorship or even to relax it, because the French Chief of Staff, Joffre, won't have it, so--"We have to make the best of it, since France has to carry the main load of the struggle".</p>
   <p>The spy scare of these stolid Englishmen can be compared with the witch hunts of the Middle Ages. More than fourteen thousand persons are interned, twenty nine thousand [suspicious characters] are "at large," so Asquith tells us. The <pb facs="5418474_5_0963.jpg" n="2"/>conscientious Asquith has probably taken a census. The spies are carefully counted. There are twenty-nine thousand of them, not more and not less. Why they have not yet been apprehended, since they are so well known--they were counted, you remember--is a mystery indeed. Probably the heroic British people must not be kept from having their thrills and chills. Or perhaps the liberal government would like to have an ace in the hole, and will attempt to justify unforeseen defeats by holding these twenty-nine thousand spies responsible. And this is why they have to remain at large.</p>
   <p>According to Asquith, "everything is fine" and that was probably the reason why he asked for a credit of $1,250,000,000, a war loan as large as Germany's. That would increase the English national debt fifty per cent. But England has to "loan" her colonies; she has to make loans to Belgium and Serbia, and perhaps to France and Russia too. The "loans" to the Australian colonies and to Canada are practically refunds of armament expenditures incurred by these dominions. It seems that the "Mother Country" has to finance that "voluntary" <pb facs="5418474_5_0964.jpg" n="3"/>war effort of her self-governing colonies. That is as it should be. It is probable that even Portugal and Japan have to be paid for their assistance, because both countries are laboring under a huge deficit. But since England "has the money" and always "wins the last million," as Lloyd George so nicely expressed it, "everything is alright" and final victory "cannot be doubted".</p>
   <p>The uprising in Africa has not yet been noticed officially by the Prime Minister neither did he comment on the declaration of war by the old archenemy of England, the Emir of Afghanistan. The insurrection in Egypt and the rebellion in India are of such "little significance" that the Prime Minister did not bother to mention them. But Kitchener, the Minister of War, was careful enough to send those Canadian rookie soldiers, who had been in England for quite a while, to the Egyptian front. Fearing political reverberations, he did not dare send them to France, because if none of these Canadian "elite" troops had returned, their widows and orphans would have derived the wrong idea about the invincibility of the "Mother Country". If these fellows are killed while fighting <pb facs="5418474_5_0965.jpg" n="4"/>the Mohammedans in Egypt, "Christian" England could console the Canadian people by telling them that their heroes had died in defense of Christianity.</p>
   <p>The world feels relieved to hear that things are "alright" in England and for the Britons. If need be, they can get along without lights and conduct their shady business in the dark. Not that they are scared! It may be due to nothing more than plain economy.</p>
   <p>If we can believe the reports and utterances made by members of the House of Commons, the entire people stand behind their government. We do not care to dispute that, because we cannot prove anything to the contrary. According to Asquith's estimation, there are about seven hundred thousand man under arms, i. e., troops capable of front line duty, plus three hundred thousand territorials, who can only be used for home defense. Another million recruits have been approved by the House of Commons. Unless we are entirely devoid of logical reasoning, it can safely be said that these latter will never see the <pb facs="5418474_5_0966.jpg" n="5"/>battleground of France. As soon as they are capable of carrying a musket they will have to be shipped to Asia for duty. The war in India, Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Afghanistan, against the Turks and other natives, will probably last a while longer than the war in Europe. But "everything is alright in England".</p>
   <p>A British "Laborite" found nothing wrong with the idea of England making "loans" to her satellites. But his comment revealed that he did not believe the fairy tale that England would ever see a penny of it again. For the time being, this representative of labor consoles himself with the wishful day dream that "later on we will collect this money from the German Kaiser, anyway". This confidence is worth as much as Asquith's claim that "everything is alright in Great Britain!"</p>
   <p>So nothing has changed in England, except that there are blackouts. And for that there may be a thousand and one reasons. The Britons don't need light to nurse their fear along! Maybe it is more consoling not to see those flying monsters overhead at night. Since the Britons are so sure that the Germans are going to be defeated, they may as well close their eyes and wait. The liberal <pb facs="5418474_5_0967.jpg" n="6"/>government could even go a step farther and decree that the "free" Britons go to bed from sunup to sundown, so they won't even be frightened by an airship during the daytime. Close your eyes and you won't see the bogey man!</p>
