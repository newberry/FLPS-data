   <p>"The German people are turning to Woodrow Wilson, believing him to be the great political leader whom they can trust to conclude a lasting peace which will guarantee a just economic development for all."</p>
   <p>This interpretation of the change that has taken place within the German people was made for a representative of the New York World by Henry C. Emery, who had just arrived in Copenhagen after spending seven months in Germany as a prisoner. Dr. Emery, the former head of the United States Tariff Commission, was taken prisoner by the Germans on the Aaland Islands on his way to Finland at the beginning of March. He was given his freedom the same day an awakened Germany liberated Karl Liebknecht. [Translator's note: Karl L. was a noted Socialist deputy in the German parliament. In one of the early postwar years he was assassinated by a group of reactionaries.] Since Dr. Emery <pb facs="5418474_5_0508.jpg" n="2"/>was not in a prison camp, he was allowed to look around in Berlin; to make contact with the people and to observe things. And nobody was better fitted to do this than this trained, experienced, and analytical thinker who has customarily associated with the leaders of the liberal school of thought and who in no way allowed his cool and sober judgment to be influenced by the adversities through which he had been.</p>
   <p>"A change came about in July--a change," says Emery, "towards democracy and peace. But it must not be assumed that the reason for this more liberal attitude in Germany was merely a trick designed to induce the Allies to make peace. Naturally military setbacks were necessary to give the liberal elements the upper hand over the Junkers. If Germany had continued to be victorious on the battlefield, a democratic movement would probably not have been in evidence, and even though a strong opposition to the military regime was always present, it had,up to that time, always been silenced very quickly.</p>
   <p>"President Wilson's influence on the German way of thinking came quite suddenly <pb facs="5418474_5_0509.jpg" n="3"/>when the German people began to realize how utterly false the information had been regarding America's might and America's war motives. The latest revelations about the attempts of the American Government, a year and a half ago, to mediate for peace, showed the German people that America was motivated by unselfish reasons. But until recently the German people had been left in the dark about this. Now they realize that America had been dealt with unfairly, when their own government decided for the unrestricted submarine warfare. The German people are now turning to Woodrow Wilson."</p>
   <p>What a change! What an awakening for those who had been languishing in the fetters of ignorance for four years! Now they begin to see. Today they are asking in amazement: Why does the whole world hate us? Not only the Allies, but also the Austrians, the Hungarians, the Bulgarians and the Turks? And in their deep distress they are turning to Woodrow Wilson and are looking with complete confidence to the man whom the Junker press and the hirelings of the military clique have slandered as they have no other leader of the Entente.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0510.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Now they realize that sincere interest in the German people dictated Wilson's notes, that our fight is indeed one of principle, a fight of democratic ideals versus autocracy.</p>
   <p>Just as in our country a great number of German-Americans are now convinced that they can regard Woodrow Wilson as their sincere friend, as the man who stood between them and the fanatical superpatriots and demagogues, so are the German people convinced now that this great American, when everybody else has failed, will bring them peace and that liberty which alone can make this peace permanent.</p>
   <p>The New York Sun wrote on October 25:</p>
   <p>"The President has declared in no uncertain terms that he is determined to impose such terms on Germany as will not only guarantee the military sovereignty of the Allies, but will make a resumption of this war or a new war <pb facs="5418474_5_0511.jpg" n="5"/>impossible. Furthermore, he has pledged that he will work for a peace which will be as just to Germany as it must be to the nations with which Germany is engaged in war, and also to those who are oppressed by Prussian militarism.</p>
   <p>"This standpoint will probably bring him into conflict with the so-called 'bitter-enders' in America and in the Entente nations. Those who desire to be inexorable do not care to have a distinction made between the German people and the German Government. According to their opinion government and people are equally guilty."</p>
   <p>In our own country as well as in the Allied countries, and in Germany, Austria, and Hungary, the people are turning to Woodrow Wilson; they see in him a just and unselfish leader who will liberate them from oppression and autocracy and give them permanent peace, which has its foundation in true democracy. That is the great task which lies before us.</p>
