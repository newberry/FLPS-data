   <p>The German-Americans do not live here as foreigners, No matter how genuinely German they may be, they are no more German citizens but citizens of the United States, being loyal and true to the country, which is their home and the home of their children.</p>
   <p>We can not understand, why the attitude of the German-Americans to the American cause needs an explanation. It would be necessary to explain why the majority of Germany's population sympathize with Spain in this war, according to a newspaper report from Germany. We do not believe that this includes the majority of Germans; but it is regrettable that there are, no doubt, many who favor Spain.</p>
   <p>The Americans are no angels, and often manifest in their affairs with other nations disagreeable and insulting peculiarities. But this does not change the fact that their war with Spain is a war for liberty, progress, humanism, and moral principles. It is a war against medieval tyranny, atrocious misrule, and barbarousness.</p>
