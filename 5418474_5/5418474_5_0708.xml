   <p>Isn't it about time that the German element [Deutschtum] in America assume a sterner attitude? To keep a "fist in your pocket" won't do any good. It makes my blood boil when I see the shameless behavior of the Allies, under the guidance of England. They know that Germany cannot be defeated by arms, even though they have pressed all kinds of colonial rabble into their service. Now they propose to starve Germany out. Never in the history of mankind has such an infamous plan been adopted. It is entirely irrelevant right now whether such a plan would succeed or not. It is a shame and a disgrace that a country like England, pretending to be a Christian nation, could think of anything like that at all. It is plain mass murder. Is our country again going to yield to the "mistress of the seas", are we again going to send a protest which Albion will throw into the waste basket?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0709.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>English newspapers have already intimated that a protest would be made, but we know our customers. Our protest has to have some teeth in it. We have to defend our rights on the seas. How? I am not going to discuss that. That's up to our government. Our problem is, what can we Germans do to let our country know what our demands are? Our Anglophile fellow Americans wouldn't mind at all if we'd accept England's invitation to participate in the blockade of German ports or declare right from the start that no goods destined for Germany deserve the protection of the Stars and Stripes. This time the hyphenate Americans must speak up. We must not allow even an attempt to be made to starve out Germany and her Allies, because it is against all international law. I was born here, but England's criminal policy gets my goat. Our entire country would be an accomplice in this abominable breach of international law if we keep quiet now. If President Wilson, who is at the helm now, does not take drastic action, the German-American ballots in 1916 will snow him under so completely that he'll be dead politically.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0710.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Wilson means well, and he wants peace. But he should realize that England could not menace us right now, if we would decide to defend our trade routes with battleships. England is only bluffing. She'd wilt pretty quickly if we would mean business. Where would England get her war supplies? Who would save Albion from starving to death? Therefore, England could not threaten us with war! Then why are you so afraid, Uncle Sam? Just grab that "terrifying lion" by the tail and tie a knot in it! He might roar, but he won't bite!</p>
   <p>How about it if we German-Americans would come out of our hiding places? The German simpleton was always good enough to put fat politicians into fat jobs, but once they were in, the "German friends" become "Dutchmen" again. Since the founding of our Republic, no American of German descent ever sat in the presidential chair. If all the German voters would stick together, they might not succeed the first time, but at least they would demonstrate their power, and that is the only thing that counts with the <pb facs="5418474_5_0711.jpg" n="4"/>politicians. All this is my own idea. The Abendpost is doing its best to start the ball rolling and will find ways and means to keep our compatriots on the alert. But our German folks here in America should come out of their trance. I know that there are thousands of them who get very angry when they have to swallow those untrue stories of the Allies for breakfast, lunch, and supper. Open up your mouths, you Germans! It won't do you any good to keep your fist in your pocket.</p>
