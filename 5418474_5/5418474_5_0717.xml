   <p>Peace! All nations desire it, whether they care to admit it or not. No country, whether neutral or belligerent, likes to see the war continued. The only question is whether the leading statesmen and diplomats will heed the desire of their peoples. Every country wants an honorable peace, and it might not be impossible to conclude such a peace between Germany, France, and Russia. England is the great question mark! The British Government insists that the German people discontinue to have [so many] children and to expand their commerce. Under these circumstances it is hard to make an honorable peace. The German Government cannot tell the German people to stop having children. But as long as the [German] population increases by more than a million annually, Germany must make attempts to expand and to conquer additional economic space in order to feed herself. But England aims to put the German Reich with her sixty-seven million population into a space sufficient <pb facs="5418474_5_0718.jpg" n="2"/>for forty millions, where it must suffocate; England wants to retain her control of the seas and let the German people have the leftovers. And this is the point in question.</p>
   <p>The German social-democrats, the English labor unions, the French socialists and labor syndicates, the Italian workers, and the Dutch and Scandinavian socialists are busy to create an international atmosphere favorable to peace. They find a fertile soil, even among nonsocialists. Because who would not be willing to have an end put to all this misery which the war has already brought and which continues day after day? We could help the movement along a good deal if our morals and ethics were more than just a pretty camouflage. All we had to do would be to cut the Allies off from all supplies of munitions, arms, and other war materials. But that is out of consideration, of course. That morals do not play any part in this matter can be seen from the fact that Mr. Schwab, of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, has contracted for many millions of dollars' worth of war materials for England. Schwab is an <pb facs="5418474_5_0719.jpg" n="3"/>Austrian. But he did not forget his "Ally." He has given a sub-contract for 350,000 shrapnels to the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, whose president is Mr. Otto H. Falk of Milwaukee. It makes us sick at heart if we see that even Germans and those of German descent fail to realize the consequences of their actions! What, then, can we expect of elements hostile to us? And here we try to persuade the government to prohibit arms and munitions exports! It is said that those Germans are also in the neutrality movement! We are amazed that industrialists think of their profit only, and so little of the moral aspects of this movement.</p>
   <p>As long as rank egotism is governing this world, all peace efforts will be for naught. Egotism stifles all morals and ethics, tramples them underfoot, and makes a hell out of this beautiful world and a devil out of man. By and large, the struggle of the nations centers around economic power. The strong one tries to cut off his weaker neighbor from his means of existence. Germany was not the only one to have to defend herself against that possibility. All <pb facs="5418474_5_0720.jpg" n="4"/>economically less favored nations have been up against that same problem at one time or other. A comparatively small Great Britain, at a time when her population was only twenty-five million, could impose her economic laws on the world. Today she has forty million and Germany sixty-seven million people; Austria-Hungary has fifty million. In spite of the discrepancy in numbers, this little England wants to regulate the living conditions of 117 million people. Her dominant position seems to make this possible; she is, or at least claims to be, the mistress of the seas. She has imposed this prerogative on the world as a law.</p>
   <p>An honorable peace for Germany is out of the question for the time being. Desirable as it would be, it is impossible at present. When the war was three months old, it would have been possible. And the terms probably would have been mild. Germany would not have asked for more than unimpeded access to the world market. She desired nothing else. She wanted the "open door" and free competition. But England had divided the world into spheres of interest; <pb facs="5418474_5_0721.jpg" n="5"/>the largest and best part of it, about one-fifth, including the seven seas, she claimed for herself. Last November peace could have been concluded on the basis of the nationality principle. If Finland and Poland had demanded their independence, that could have been granted. If the Baltic provinces had wanted to paddle their own canoe, that would have been fair. In a similar manner, Egypt and Persia could have regained their independence. Belgium would have gotten by with just a black eye. If reason would have prevailed, Germany could have made her peace with France within two months. The rapid advance of the German armies prepared the ground. But that was just what England was afraid of, so she held France to a promise to make peace only with England and Russia together. Consequently, Germany had to adopt a different policy.</p>
   <p>Once before we have discussed here why the Germans withdrew, standing almost at the gates of Paris. The possibility of this withdrawal was taken into account, and became a necessity, once the Allies prohibited France from <pb facs="5418474_5_0722.jpg" n="6"/>making a separate peace. It was too hazardous to leave the German armies where they stood. They were too far advanced from their base. They had to entrench themselves in more tenable positions. But the most vital part of France, the industrial region around the Brieg basin in French Lorraine, with its soft coal and iron ore mines, steel mills, and foundries is held in a vise-like grip. This district has to be kept; by comparison, Paris is only a worthless pebble. Today France, England, and Russia know that the "retreat" of the Germans only established Germany's iron ore domain more firmly than ever. Germany in possession of Belgium and French Lorraine; and with Luxembourg in a "customs union," making her equal in rank as far as iron and steel production is concerned! England will just be ground to pieces! Today Germany cannot give up Belgium or French Lorraine because England is determined to destroy Germany; consequently, Germany must go after the destruction of England. All this would have been different if France would have made peace a few months ago. But England had promised her ally golden mountains. Too, they both might have underestimated Germany's resistance and counted on an early victory.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0723.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>England's last hope is the starvation of Germany and her ally. But here, too, the underestimation of her opponents' strength may fool her. The measures adopted by the German authorities resulted in twenty-five per cent less consumption of foodstuffs in February than in the month previous. All swamps were drained, flower gardens were converted into vegetable gardens, potatoes were planted along the railroad tracks. School children were taught not to waste foodstuffs, mothers were lectured on nutrition and economics. Labor organizations vie with the authorities to preserve and organize the national substance. There is a courageous determination not to be starved to death, and this determination will be the downfall of perfidious Albion.</p>
   <p>Can the ardent efforts of all well-meaning people to bring about a peace meet with success, considering the circumstances? Not as yet! The diplomats are out for the present. They will not negotiate peace. It is the people who will force the decision, and we can be sure that the German people will hold on to what they have gained by fighting, and will not give up their <pb facs="5418474_5_0724.jpg" n="8"/>determination to humiliate England. They were driven into this war and will make a permanent peace only after they have won. It will be honorable, to be sure.</p>
