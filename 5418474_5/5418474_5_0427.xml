   <p>Assistant U. S. State's Attorney Borrelli continued questioning members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra regarding their loyalty. Those examined were Alfred Quensel, flute; Otto Hasselbach, viola; Kurt Baumbach, flute; Henry Woelfel, violin; Bruno Steindel, cello; and Albert Ulrich, trumpeter and manager of the orchestra. After the questioning Mr. Borrelli indicated that the statements, if true, seemed to be of sufficient importance to justify cancellation of citizenship, and, in the case of Steindel, imprisonment.</p>
   <p>The flutist, Julius Furman, testified that Steindel had boasted to a pupil that he had "bawled out" Furman because the latter stood up as the "Marseillaise" was being played. Steindel denied this. According to Furman Baumbach had said, "How can America send a million men to France? Are they supposed to swim across?" Quensel is said to have called the remark of a four-minute orator a "bluff," and Woelfel is charged with saying that if Germany should <pb facs="5418474_5_0428.jpg" n="2"/>lose the war he would commit suicide.</p>
   <p>Ulrich stated that he had been an American citizen since 1878, had one son in the navy, and he himself was thoroughly loyal. Of the ninety-one orchestra members, eighty-eight were American citizens, and two of the remaining three would soon have been if the war had not interfered. He stated that he had never heard disloyal remarks expressed within the orchestra.</p>
