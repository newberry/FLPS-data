   <p>Strange as it may seem to German-Americans, the President stands accused of being radically pro-German! London, especially, was painfully shocked to learn that the President had intimated to Charles Schwab, an Austrian millionaire by the grace of Carnegie, that it did not quite fit within the framework of neutrality for him [Schwab] to build submarines for England. It is alleged that Schwab himself cancelled the contract, and added that he "had to comply with the President's request." If that is correct, all we can say is that the President deserves real credit for going to bat for the principle of neutrality, and that a similar friendly recommendation to the manufacturers of arms and ammunition and an equally willing compliance with the President's wishes on the part of the munition makers would only substantiate the American claim that in all matters, including international involvements, America was solely <pb facs="5418474_5_0811.jpg" n="2"/>and exclusively guided by "ethical motives."</p>
   <p>Put the President is accused of even more "unfriendly acts" against England. He is charged with attempting to suppress the prevailing "favorable opinion" toward the Allies. If favorable opinion "toward the Allies, means a receptive mind for the false reports about "German atrocities," and the never-ending accusations against the "Barbarians," we are obliged to state that a change in public opinion has definitely taken place. But that was not the President's doings. It is the exclusive merit of the lying propaganda syndicate, London-Paris-Petrograd. They have peppered the American public with lies of such brazenness that even the most gullible could not stomach them any longer. They lied in an idiotic fashion and with criminal intent. Even the pro-British portion of the press finally protested. The English have probably paid a pretty penny for the kind co-operation [of the American press] in molding public opinion. But even in the Anglo-American press there are still editors who haven't lost all sense of shame. It was they who protested against this <pb facs="5418474_5_0812.jpg" n="3"/>systematically falsified news reporting. A change took place. It is a regrettable but an irremediable fact that American editors are very poorly informed about Germany and Austria and their institutions and culture. At best they could only rely on their instincts to distinguish the true from the false. Since America is culturally related to England and not to Germany, all accounts favoring the British but defaming the Germans were gladly believed. In either direction the London lie-propaganda office exaggerated shamefully. Only the English are capable of desiring a continuation of this kind of public opinion [in America], and of complaining and accusing the President of being instrumental in changing it; for they employ similar means at home to bamboozle the people.</p>
   <p>Another proof of the President's pro-German attitude is supposed to be his attempt to take advantage of a splendid opportunity to create an American merchant marine. The British don't actually say so in so many words, but they would like to prevent any such project. They would not lack the support <pb facs="5418474_5_0813.jpg" n="4"/>of certain elements within this country. The British consider it a pro-German attitude on the part of the President, that he intends to purchase German ships which had to remain in American ports at the outbreak of the war, to augment an American merchant marine which is to be created. What business is it of Great Britain where and from whom the United States is purchasing ships? The argument in the British "protest" is truly sophisticated, as in all cases where phrases are used to conceal intentions. But "we" are gradually waking up to the fact that the affection of the "Mother Country" consists of nothing more than to keep a daughter with renegade intentions in continous spiritual and economic dependency. London hopes to put the President under suspicion with the high finance of both countries, which are practically one and the same, by denouncing him as a Germanophile. That is supposed to make him appear un-American, if we get the idea. American high finance is intertwined with British capital in such fashion that it will suffer equally if British commercial interests are aversely affected. "The purchase of [German] ships lying idle in American ports would constitute a profit for Germany"! Maybe for the German owners of those ships, but not for <pb facs="5418474_5_0814.jpg" n="5"/>"Prussian Militarism," at least not directly; and it is solely and primarily the latter, which England feels called upon to destroy, in a fit of moral indignation.</p>
   <p>We can almost feel sorry for those Britishers in their plight; they are asking all and sundry to help them knock down "Prussian Militarism". What other nations think of this fake issue becomes more obvious every day. The London Morning Post says: "Wilson's proposal to purchase the German ships, is the policy of an ally of Germany, but not that of a neutral. He has no sense of reality. We feel sorry for him! He does not understand that it is the purpose and intention of any navy to attain mastery of the seas." John Bull talking. Alright we say! Then why cannot the American navy pursue this policy? Just because England does not like it? What arrogance!</p>
   <p>There is another of the President's acts which has aroused the wrath of London, namely, the ban on the publication of clearance papers of ships which sail from New York for neutral ports with cargo for Germany. Through these publications the British were informed on the movements of ships, and they used to detail <pb facs="5418474_5_0815.jpg" n="6"/>warships to intercept those boats in the Atlantic. Undoubtedly the President was only guided by the idea that it was not in conformity with the spirit of neutrality to announce outgoing ships to the British warships lurking beyond the three-mile limit. That is neither evidence of pro-Germanism nor Anglophobia. But it is an act of fairness on the part of the President of the United States, whom British politicians would like to reduce to the willing tool of the British Empire. It affords us a measure of satisfaction that the British, by their own admission, did not succeed in that.</p>
