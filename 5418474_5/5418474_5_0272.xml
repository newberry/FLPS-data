   <p>President Wilson's peace program, when it was first promulgated, was received "over there" partly with enthusiasm, partly in silence. (Silence is an answer, too. An affirmative one.) It was accepted as a whole. It contained fourteen paragraphs, one of which called for disarmament on land and at sea. No protest was raised against any of these fourteen points. It had to be assumed, then, that our European Allies were willing and ready to yield to the demands for disarmament on land and at sea.</p>
   <p>But all of that happened during critical days, when victory seemed far off. "Times change and people with them." At least, people change their attitude; very often, if not always, they turn out to be different at different times.</p>
   <p>Ever since victory was gained, British statesmen and publicists have assumed <pb facs="5418474_5_0273.jpg" n="2"/>quite a different attitude toward the President's demands for disarmament. They are completely in accord with disarmament on land. They even go a step further than the President proposed, and agree to the abolition of conscription for army service. But the previous silent consent to the demand for naval disarmament has been replaced by a curt rejection. The safety of the British Empire demands, so they say, the maintenance of British rule over the seas and, therefore, a navy second to none. A reduction of British naval power would be unthinkable, and to do England justice she could not be expected to weaken herself in such a manner. During times of peace England had never abused her rule over the seas in order to injure other nations or to deprive them of peaceful commerce and shipping, but England had to insist on the power to maintain communications between the various parts of her empire during times of war and--as the occasion called for and her interests demanded--to declare blockades and put them into effect, because otherwise she would be helpless and would disintegrate.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0274.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From the British point of view this argument is very logical and natural; but it is not wise and far-sighted. It is quite possible that England will flatly refuse to reduce her naval armaments and that the President will be unable to assure the acceptance of this point in his peace program. England may win out in this question, for it is hardly possible to force her to reduce her naval power, and President Wilson would problably not dream of exerting any pressure in this matter. But in the near future England will have to say to herself: "Too bad that we have won!"</p>
   <p>For if the British Empire cannot be made to reduce her power at sea and to rely, for the safeguarding of her trade routes with other parts of the Empire, on the protection that an international fleet of a general league of nations would provide, England, on the other hand, could not stop other nations from increasing and strengthening their naval power as much as they think necessary, and as much as possible. For it is as natural for other nations to make themselves strong enough to resist any encroachment on their freedom as it is for <pb facs="5418474_5_0275.jpg" n="4"/>England to want to remain powerful enough on the seas to rule them during times of war, and to be able to tell other nations where to get off. That means that a refusal by England to disarm at sea, or to permit the transfer of her rule over the oceans to the naval power of a planned league of nations, would give rise to an armament race which would result in the transfer of unrestricted naval power to whatever nation is strongest economically, and most efficient. And the answer to the question whether England is acting wisely in resisting the peace program of President Wilson, with its disarmament proposal, will naturally depend on whether England is the greatest and economically strongest and most efficient of all nations. If England is not, then the question remains whether another, stronger nation would want to rid itself of British domination of the seas and whether it would enter an armament race. If so, we must conclude that England is very foolish to resist President Wilson's program, for it will only be a question of time until her sea power is surpassed by that of another nation; and the disaster which she wanted to forestall will be hastened and augmented.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0276.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Those questions are already answered: England is not the strongest and most efficient nation--America is much more powerful. And America has determination! By 1925 America will be stronger at sea than England, and it has the power to become strong enough, within another five years, to command where today it is merely pleading.</p>
