<title level="a">CONFERENCE OF PARDON BOARDS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>The conference of delegates from pardon boards of the Middle Western States which meets in Chicago would have commanded more attention if the large majority of the population would agree that the system of pardons which includes paroles and pardons, is a complete failure. It has by no means lived up to expectations of helping convicts and bringing them back to the right path. On the contrary, it has actually made conditions worse, as far as habitual criminals are concerned. It is a fact that today a veritable army of habitual criminals is permitted to roam freely Instead of being kept behind the bars; they manage to escape, and use their ill-won liberty to plan and execute new crimes. An authority who is well familiar with conditions, Hinton G. Clabaugh, who for many years was president of the Illinois board of pardons, stated in a speech before the conference that the system of pardons is the most important abettor that crime has.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1584.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now, since the system of pardon and parole has been, for the present, established legally, it is opportune to have an understanding with other states regarding supervision of conditionally discharged convicts. To bring about a strict supervision, a widely spread organization is needed which is, in the first place, very costly and, besides, it could do good only if the officers are intelligent men and are endowed with the proper concept of their duties. But since one is justified in assuming that, in making appointments to positions, political influence will prevail, one may have his doubts. At any rate, there is always the danger that an unwise deal on the part of the supervising officer will obstruct the intentions of the discharged convict who is willing to become a useful member of society and who is in search of work. In such cases it may easily happen that the discharged person is discouraged in his efforts, and turns back to his former career. On the other hand, habitual criminals pay little attention to supervision and manage to find means (by the aid of political influence) to avoid it entirely, so as to continue, undisturbed, their careers of crime.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1585.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>To do away, once and forever, with these evil conditions of the system of pardons, there is only one method that can be used. A decision should be made to make an end to senseless sentences for uncertain terms. It is, at any rate, in the interest of those who have fallen afoul of the law, and also in that of society. There is no doubt that the court of justice which conducts the trial is more qualified to pass a just sentence. The sentenced man then knows definitely the term of sentence he has to face, and does not delude himself with hopes of an early parole. If he then sees, through his good behavior, the possibility to have the customary part of his sentence reduced, it will be an incentive to deport himself accordingly and, in most instances, this will have a bearing upon his future life. But after he has served his sentence he is a free man and may begin a new life, unimpeded. But if we are dealing with habitual criminals, there are means and ways aplenty to keep them under police supervision, even after their term in the penitentiary, in case there is need for so doing.</p>
   <p>The thing is easier of execution than is generally realized. All we have to do is to rescind Ordinance #802 of the criminal code dealing with indeterminate <pb facs="5418474_5_1586.jpg" n="4"/>sentences. The population should devote more attention to this problem in an effort to bring about a change for the good.</p>
