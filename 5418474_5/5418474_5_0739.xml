   <p>That is the official title under which the newly organized pro-German and anti-British elements within our population will pursue their policies.</p>
   <p>The name alone is a program in itself, because, since the Declaration of Independence, on July Fourth, 1776, the efforts of our best American elements to get rid of the British yoke and of British influence can be traced like a red thread through the history of our nation.</p>
   <p>This influence was always pregnant with disaster, and has led repeatedly to bloody conflicts. Even as recently as the Civil War, England has lent moral and financial support to the rebellious South, while the Germans gave their sympathies to the Northern States which fought for the preservation of the Union and for free labor. Only during the last decades has <pb facs="5418474_5_0740.jpg" n="2"/>England managed, by yielding to American demands and, above all, by influencing the American press and American public opinion, to create a pro-English sentiment in this country. These efforts by the British ran parallel with their policy of encirclement against Germany, because England wanted to be prepared in case French thirst for revenge and Russian expansionism would precipitate a bloody conflict with Germany and Austria. This would provide England with a welcome opportunity to join the party, under some moral pretext, and attack Germany, whose rising sea power and industrial superiority had been a thorn in England's side for some time.</p>
   <p>England always hides her power politics under a moral cloak; this time it happened to be the protection of Belgium and liberty for "all nations menaced by German militarism".</p>
   <p>We German-Americans know the causes that led to the present world conflict, and because we know them, our sympathies are wholly devoted to our <pb facs="5418474_5_0741.jpg" n="3"/>hard-pressed fatherland, and we hate England above all, whose perfidious actions have convinced us anew that we, as Americans, and true to the principles of the fathers of our Republic, and mindful of the history of our country, are duty bound to heed the slogan "Away from England!" and to throw all our moral power into the scales against England.</p>
   <p>Our country is emotionally upset right now; the minds of our citizens of German and Austro-Hungarian descent are greatly disturbed, not only because of sympathy for their old country, but even more so by the Britishinfluenced American press, which has excelled itself in publishing lies, calumnies, falsehoods, and cartoons, which simply stink to high heaven.</p>
   <p>To give expression to this anxiety, a number of prominent citizens convened on Jan. 30, 1915 in Washington D. C. and started an organization designed to give articulate and definite form to this common [unanimous, mutual] feeling. It was inspiring to witness the spirit which prevailed at that conference. Never before were divers elements like Catholics <pb facs="5418474_5_0742.jpg" n="4"/>Protestants, Jews, Germans, and Austro-Hungarians, as well as representatives of the various clerical and secular organizations, so unanimous in their desire to stand and act together like one man.</p>
   <p>The German Kaiser declared at the outbreak of the war, "I don't know parties any more, I only know Germans." Likewise, the sentiment of the conference was: "We do not recognize party lines any more, neither differences of opinion during these great times, when our lot is the same; we want to stand together as one man and fight for what is uppermost in our minds right now, namely, the support of our hard-pressed fatherland. We want to present a united front against America's ancient enemy, the real archenemy in this colossal struggle, which is England."</p>
   <p>This spirit spontaneously created the plan for the establishment of an organization. The American Independence Union is not another German Verein [association]; neither is any existing Verein to be incorporated in it. All the associations of the German-American National Bund <pb facs="5418474_5_0743.jpg" n="5"/>[alliance], the American Turner [gymnastics] Bund, the great Catholic and Protestant alliances, the war veterans' societies, etc., will continue to work as independently as before, entirely divorced from the American Independence Union. The already organized neutrality leagues will continue too. Any other organizations that might want to support our cause are highly welcome.</p>
   <p>The American Independence Union aims to keep this mighty mass movement from falling apart and becoming ineffectual, or getting out of bounds. The American Independence Union is to be the general staff, as it were, directing the movement and pointing out the desired objective to the masses and the best ways and means to obtain practical results.</p>
   <p>The American Independence Union has no connections with the existing political parties. Republicans and Democrats alike are represented in its ranks. The program of the Union is a moral one, not a political one. <pb facs="5418474_5_0744.jpg" n="6"/>Neither does the Union aim to split up the various elements within our population, but proposes to co-operate with each and everyone who is imbued with a true American spirit, putting the interests of this Republic first. No party limits are broad enough for the Union, whose objectives go beyond the confines of existing clerical and secular associations. The Union is of greater and more general scope than the German-American National Bund or similar large associations, which were created for a specific purpose.</p>
   <p>The American Independence Union will, therefore, not come in conflict with any existing associations, but will encourage them instead to continue their work as usual, because the spirit of the organization which was established in Washington calls for determined and concerted action, not for disturbance and separation.</p>
   <p>The American Independence Union can therefore not be considered a new <pb facs="5418474_5_0745.jpg" n="7"/>Verein or a consolidation of already existing Vereine into a new organization. The Union does not want to interfere with the internal affairs of other Vereine and associations. No financial contributions are asked by the Union; on the contrary, it is the intention of the Union to take care that the existing national alliances will get reimbursed for their co-operation. The expenditures of the American Independence Union are to be covered by voluntary, individual contributions, and there cannot be any doubt that, with the prevailing sentiment, the organization will collect ample funds.</p>
   <p>More details about the organization and the work program of the American Independence Union will be published shortly.</p>
