  <body>
   <p>In consequence of the charges of disloyalty made against members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a conference was held between Federal Attorney Clyne and Clyde M. Carr, president, and members of the board of directors of the orchestra. Mr. Carr and his associates assured the district attorney that the orchestra as a whole was loyal, and that they would not stand for any disloyal organization. Mr. Clyne was said to have insisted that any orchestra members whose disloyalty had been proved must be removed from the orchestra. In regard to the conductor, Mr. Ernst [sic] Stock, Mr. Clyne was said to have told his visitors that Stock knew of the disloyal remarks of his musicians and had tolerated them.</p>
