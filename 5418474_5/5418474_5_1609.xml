<title level="a">RETURN OF THE SALES TAX</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>The Illinois sales tax is returning. But this time it is set at only two per cent--the first tax, which was set at three per cent, was declared unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court. Enforcement of the law will be deferred, since there is still a small matter which must be ironed out between the Senate and the House in Springfield. Governor Horner will sign the bill as soon as it is presented to him. Therefore, beginning Saturday, every consumer in the state of Illinois will be offended when the amount of the sales tax is added to the cost of his purchases.</p>
   <p>This is not mere talk. The collection of this tax does provoke both the seller and the buyer. During the few weeks when the three-per-cent tax was in effect, eleven cents was charged for a ten-cent cigar in many stores, although legally a one-cent tax was due only on purchases amounting to more than thirty-three and one-third cents. Thus all small purchases were unduly taxed. One can see that in the course of a year a sum much in excess of the <pb facs="5418474_5_1610.jpg" n="2"/>lawful amount would be collected; such cases should be, and very probably will be, taken to court.</p>
   <p>Retail business is fighting the sales tax just as much as consumers; for retailers are burdened with additional bookkeeping, since they must account to the state concerning the amount of sales tax remitted. Since they will not wish to suffer losses, they will be tempted to overcharge, and although one can hardly blame them, such an overcharge would be an injustice to the consumer, who would very likely seek redress in court. By their decree that the tax be collected at the time of the sale, our legislators have shown that they are mere amateurs in tax matters, and that they do not know how to deal with this type of tax which has been in force in many European states. The many petty annoyances could be avoided by computing the tax on the basis of the merchant's monthly turnover. The merchant will look out for his financial interests, and the customer will trade at stores where he finds the best bargains. Therefore, if a merchant boosts his prices too much because of the sales tax, his customers will patronize the businessmen who keep their <pb facs="5418474_5_1611.jpg" n="3"/>price increase within reasonable limits. Accordingly, if a company tries to make additional profits by means of the sales tax, it will soon find that such methods are not conducive to the welfare of its business. The former method of collecting the sales tax results in anger, unnecessary work, and unnecessary inconvenience. At all events, an attempt to collect the tax on the basis of monthly gross income is to be recommended for more than one reason.</p>
   <p>In its present form the sales tax contains two provisions: The sales tax revenue for the first six months of the year is to be used for unemployment relief. Apparently Springfield is certain that the state will not have to deal with the relief of the jobless after January 1. That savors of strong optimism, and one can only hope that it is justified. Beginning January 1, 1934, the proceeds of the sales tax are to be used to reduce real estate and personal taxes.</p>
   <p>The sales tax is to be in force for two years. The chief argument advanced <pb facs="5418474_5_1612.jpg" n="4"/>by the sponsors of the tax was that it is absolutely necessary for the state to continue unemployment relief. This argument is not altogether in agreement with fact, since the bill specifically provides that the relief fund is to be supplemented by the sales tax only until the and of this year. State unemployment relief is only an excuse for levying this tax, which, if it is not abolished by the courts, can easily be renewed indefinitely, and can serve as a pretext to continue the slovenly financial methods of the state authorities, which are carried out according to the infamous principle: The money is there, so it must be spent. Thus it would be much letter if the courts would again do away with the Illinois sales tax.</p>
