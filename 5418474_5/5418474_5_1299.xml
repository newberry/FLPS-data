   <p>The German-American Review publishes an article by the late War-Governor of Missouri, Thomas C. Fletcher, which he wrote shortly before his death. The treatise bears the caption: "Laurels to the Faithful," and it contains a voluminous chapter on the German-American population during the Civil War.</p>
   <p>The Westliche Post, writes: the atatements which the deceased relates are of especial importance, since his writings are based on facts which he gathered as an actual eye-witness and also others wherein he played an important part, figuratively, the star-role.</p>
   <p>Ex-Governor Fletcher gives a glowing account of how the German-Americans saved Missouri for the Union and so achieved an epochal triumph which proved very detrimental to the Southern confederated states. He continues: At the beginning of the Civil War, everyone of those Germen-Americans gave his full strength and unfaltering support to the Union cause, all private gain and special interests were subordinated to the stars and stripes, which prevented Missouri from becoming a pawn of the South. Among the English-speaking population of St, Louis, the Rebel-elements never predominant.</p>

   <p>Captain Lyon came to us with his small company; the patriotic, heroic, splendid Lyon, with Frank Blair his companion. It was on April 20th, 1861 when the First Regiment was fully armed and prepared to support the Union. Blair was nominated as Colonel. Then came the Germans: Franz Siegel and his regiment; R. Schuttner's regiment; Eberhard Solomon and regiment. Then came regiments led by Henry Almsteadt, Hermann Kallmann, J. Mc Niel, V. Gratz-Brown, Charles G. Stiefel, Julius Hundhausen, Fred Schaefer, J. F. Shephard, P. Joseph Osterhaus, F. Hassendeubel and others. Altogether 15 regiments; all, or at least, almost all, German.</p>
   <p>The Rebel-Governor, Claib Jackson tried to capture the St. Louis arsenal, following instructions given by Jefferson Davis. In order to execute this plan, he created Camp Jackson in the vicinity of St. Louis, under the pretext, that he needed training grounds for the state militia. Lyon resolved to frustrate his venture. "Well do I remember that nocturnal skirmish," Lyon had confided to me. "The quiteness at that late hour was interrupted only by the marching men of the German regiment, who sought their various posts. To me it appeared as the step of doom which rustled through the dismal darkness."</p>
   <p>May 9th, at 12 P.M. For one month the Germans had exercised and trained during the obscure night. They were born soldiers. Many of their officers had seen <pb facs="5418474_5_1301.jpg" n="3"/>army service in their former Fatherland. Later I marched and camped with them and I was surprised indeed, how readily they became accustomed and inured to the rigorous field-life. "Every one whose physiognomy showed German characteristics, was regarded as a Union man by us, and we had confidence in him. The Rebels shared the same belief which resulted in street fights at all hours.</p>
   <p>"Lyon drove Jackson, his pro-southern legislature and Rebel army out of the state. They returned, entering South-west Missouri, reenforced with Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana troops. Lyon met them at Wilson Creek on the 10th of August, 1861 and fell in that bloody battle. Fremont took command. The Germans gathered about his banner. They fortified St. Louis and made the city impregnable. Thus St. Louis was saved. Thereafter it functioned as a basis to maintain the loyalty of Missouri for the Union. It preserved the Union! No one, who was familiar with the situation at that time, entertains any doubt, that, if Missouri had been acquired by the Rebels and they had obtained possession of the immense war supplies at St. Louis and the transportation facilities centered there, it would have been simply impossible to suppress the rebellion. The great river would now be a part of the boundary line between the Union and the Confederate States.</p>

   <p>Honor to the Germans of Missouri for their valiant support during that dire crisis of 1861.</p>
   <p>"Many have been given recognition, but none more than they deserved. The German newspapers printed a glowing article every day, to further the imterests of the Union cause and created intense patriotism among the German population. Honor and esteem to Emil Pretorius, who weilded his pen during his editorial career,-in the service of the Union as also Wm. Mc Kee, who made his Democrat the mouthpiece of the National Government. Similar commendation is due Franz Siegel and P. J. Osterhaus, who were brilliant examples in their ranks of Major-generals. The same esteem is owing Arnold Krakel of St. Charles and Col. Thilenius of Cape Girardeau, who called upon the German contingent of that community, to rally to the ideals of the Union. St. Louis stands to day as a proud monument to the valiant and patriotic soldiers of the union. Its 160,000 inhabitants of 1860 have increased to more than half a million. They made the city important, as a commercial and industrial metropolis. The palaces of their merchant princes, its great boulevards, the high, arched cupolas and its incomparable progress makes this city the queen of the Mississippi valley. We write of it today, with a retrospection to the days of 1861: "In memory of the d....d Dutch",esto perpetual"</p>
