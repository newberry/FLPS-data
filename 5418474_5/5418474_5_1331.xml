   <p>Our local Citizens' Association appeals to the people for small contributions for--for what? For a monument to be erected in memory of a great man who died of starvation? That would be a German procedure. To place a Statue of Liberty with a burning torch at some harbor entrance, let us say, Marseilles, Havre, or Brest? That would be a French idea. To aid the victims of a fire, flood, or epidemic? That would be the American way; but such usual purposes are not involved in this instance. The money is to be used for our militia--not the military forces of the Union, but the "good and true" state troops, the Illinois militia.</p>
   <p>"The problem is simply this," Mr. Pinneberg, retired capitalist, says. "We have several regiments here in Chicago, each consisting of at least twenty (sic) men--altogether about fifteen hundred soldiers. During spare time--that <pb facs="5418474_5_1332.jpg" n="2"/>is, after working hours in private industry--these men exercise, parade, and camp (if the weather is fair), they exert themselves moderately, may even imbibe a little; in short, they are soldiers of a sort. To do such soldiering, or, if you wish to say, 'perform defence work'--well, such efforts cost money, and this reminds us of the German proverb, 'Death alone is free'. Not that the soldiers seek compensation. Indeed not, they are sufficiently patriotic to serve gratuitously. But the gaudy uniforms cost something, the shooting irons can be had only for cash, the officers' swords--that means more dough, the tents to be used during maneuvers (we almost said picnics), this item also requires funds. The problem is, how to get hold of a few ducats. The stingy state gives nothing, or, at least, not enough. The soldiers are already contributing their lives to the cause, and you really can't expect them also to donate their worldly goods. There is only one solution, and that is to go to the good citizens and do a little panhandling! A measly $30,000 would suffice to maintain our imposing army. If the sum cannot be raised, then, for better or worse, our militia must disband. And what then? Then we would be in the same predicament as the hired girl at the tavern near the Lahn [German river] <pb facs="5418474_5_1333.jpg" n="3"/>who lamented, 'I ain't got a boy friend any more'".</p>
   <p>Well, all jokes aside! Can you draw a stronger comparison between American and European conditions than the fact that here the collection plate must be passed to obtain a few bucks for an army of some 1500 men, while abroad people stagger under the tax load which becomes well-nigh unbearable because of excessive military expenditures? In European countries the largest part of the budget provides for the army's needs; education and transportation receive mere fractions. But here the army must call attention to its existence and approach the citizens, hat in hand. We need an occasional reminder that conditions may show the imperative necessity of maintaining an army--the riots of July, 1877, for instance. But these incidents were not very impressive as far as the people in general were concerned. To the masses, these riots meant no more than some railroad accident. Who, for instance, hesitates to take a trip to Cleveland or New York, over the Cleveland route, which includes Ashtabula, scene of a fearful wreck? How many passengers riding over the new bridge will think about the catastrophe, when the former structure collapsed? Perhaps as <pb facs="5418474_5_1334.jpg" n="4"/>many people as think of the upheaval in July, 1877. If one admonishes, "What happened may happen again," then the answer will be: "What of it--what next? Riots do not last forever; when the incident is passed we have peace again!"</p>
   <p>The Socialists and their Lehr-Und Wehrverein [Education and Defence Association] can be well satisfied with the dilemma of our great military force. But, if the Socialists have intelligence, they must be aware how the "despicable capitalists" bask in security since they permit the militia to sink to such a low level that the soldiery must take recourse to panhandling. Why continue the silly, childish efforts to frighten each other? Since July 4, everybody admits that neither the Lehr-Und Wehrverein nor Mr. Cullom's "splendid army" is viciously inclined.</p>
   <p>Both fear each other and try to avoid clashes. Is it not about time to stop the silly game?</p>
