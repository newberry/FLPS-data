<title level="a">THE INHERITANCE TAX</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Many reports have been published recently about rich inheritances and about how in some cases the frivolous heirs squander their substance. This gives us another opportunity to bring up the much disputed question of a larger inheritance tax. Abuses arising from rich inheritances, or examples of senseless prodigality, easily give rise to radical proposals which vary from a sharp increase in the present inheritance taxes to downright confiscation. Though such proposals seem justified by occurrences of this sort, the people making them do not take into consideration the fact that there are two sides to every question. This generalization also holds true with respect to the accumulation of large fortunes.</p>
   <p>It would not be very difficult to enumerate many cases in which only great <pb facs="5418474_5_1530.jpg" n="2"/>fortunes made it possible to carry out on a large scale undertakings which were for the welfare of the general public. Especially in the fields of charity, of research, and of hygiene, which is closely connected with the latter, very significant advances have been made with the help of wealthy foundations.</p>
   <p>Though the question of how much right children have to the fortunes left by their parents is always coming up, we must exercise great caution in attempting to answer it. The fact that frivolous heirs waste the property they have inherited, are harmed by the possession of great wealth, and become incompetent and worthless members of society does not, in itself, provide an answer to the question.</p>
   <p>We must remember, first of all, that the right of inheritance is implied in the existing system of private ownership. Naturally, the struggle for a <pb facs="5418474_5_1531.jpg" n="3"/>planned economy and the increasing influence of socialism have, as one of their consequences, the attack on the right to inherit. We may also conclude that the inheritance tax in its present form has not reached its limit. Yet it is to be hoped that people will not be diverted by radical propaganda from a middle course that is economically sound.</p>
   <p>Even today there are certain harsh features in the inheritance tax which could be avoided or at least made less severe. When it is a matter of millions of dollars which, according to the law, must be paid in a relatively short time, it often happens that the cash on hand is insufficient to cover the amount of the tax, and that large pieces of property have to be disposed of at a great loss; in a period of depression, especially, such sales can be made only at a great sacrifice. Here it might be asked whether it would not be more just if the taxes were divided into installments payable over a period of several years. The Government would suffer no loss from this arrangement, since it could charge interest on the amount outstanding.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1532.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>When the inheritance tax laws are revised a special attempt should be made to render evasion of the tax impossible or at least very difficult. For this purpose a gift tax should be instituted along with the increase in the inheritance tax. Furthermore, special attention should be directed toward all bequests for special purposes, since this device is often used to avoid payment of the complete inheritance tax required by law. None of these questions can be answered without a thorough investigation of the whole problem.</p>
