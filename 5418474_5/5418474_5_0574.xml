   <p>An expose of our well-nigh almighty iron and steel magnates' patriotism came to the fore recently through an assertion of one of these gentlemen. It occurred during arguments about Governmental control and operation of the arms and munition factories. During the proceedings, this great industrialist made a very significant announcement with cool deliberation. "If the Administration carries out its threat, then the steel mills would simply raise the price of steel plates by $200 so as to reimburse themselves for the loss." In these words, the shameful, scandalous greed of our superpatriots divested itself of its protective covering. The man whose inadvertent slip of the tongue converted thought into speech, belongs to that class of citizens who toiled incessantly and spent stupendous sums for a year and a half to embroil the United States in <pb facs="5418474_5_0575.jpg" n="2"/>the European war. He is a representative of the neutral apostles of decency who openly pray for peace, but surreptitiously send ardent invocations to heaven that the murderous conflict may be prolonged indefinitely to help bulge their already bursting money bags. Behind such honorable men stand Grey and associates, when they drive the American merchant marine from the high seas, and cripple our industry and commerce whenever it does not benefit them; or besmirch our national honor, if expedient. Except for the existence of these unscrupulous trust-magnates, our Government would have been in a position to make peace overtures long ago and terminate the war. The blood spilled across the sea shrieks for vengeance and the gore bespattered money which England pays to our shekel-craving industrialists will not bring blessings.</p>
   <p>It is a cosmic law which provides that the trees shall not reach heaven, and this law applies likewise to our trusts, regardless of their present sense of growth and continued stretching.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0576.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The unabashed admonition of an impending price increase of steel products, if the Government henceforth refuses to continue in its function of being a milch cow for war-equipment factories, should be an eye-opener to all, as it aptly exposes the motivating force of those who incessantly demand a revocation of our administration's tolerance toward Germany and insist upon a precipitate action against the central powers. The incendiary speeches which these men ram into the thrasonical throats and throttles of their knowing or unwitting tools are not definitely an expression of love for the fatherland; basically it is the outgrowth of pernicious, avaricious profiteering, because all the demagogues who incite us to a war against the Central-European nations are directly or indirectly affiliated with an industry that draws its sustenance from war. That it is permissible for men of such caliber to become politically powerful in this land, must imbue the genuine patriot with profound regret.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0577.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If the steel kings and their mercenaries materialize these warnings, then, after all,it would not be exceptional. These gentlemen, who enjoy an entirely unwarranted influence as immune wire-pullers, have never considered it dishonorable to cheat the state, hence, the entire people.</p>
   <p>Persistent practice made them proficient in the art of skinning us alive and they will continue to swear allegiance to these long established principles in the future and gorge themselves at public expense, if the citizens are sufficiently comatose to permit it. The impending elections this year should offer a suitable opportunity, in so far as the public intends to maintain its mastery, to proclaim to the vested interests: "So far and not further" and thence to hang their bread-basket a little higher, for the sake of the commonweal.</p>
