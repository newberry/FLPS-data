<title level="a">PRAYER FOR PEACE</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>America was praying yesterday for peace--in Europe! Living at peace with all the world themselves and, as their trustful appeal indicated, with their God as well, the American people implored the heavenly powers to put an early stop to this horrible mass slaughter in Europe which threatens to spread to Asia and Africa. Everywhere in this great and vast country, in churches and synagogues, the faithful prayed and sang psalms of peace. Other countless thousands probably prayed for early peace in the solitude of their homes, but no less devotedly or sincerely.</p>
   <p>It is not permissable to doubt the sincerity of this American prayer for peace. Neither would it be proper to investigate the motives or to insinuate that particularly selfish reasons motivated this peace longing. America is a pacific and <pb facs="5418474_5_1047.jpg" n="2"/>good-hearted nation and although she has not succeeded yet in protecting human life in her own territory to the extent that homicide is a thing of the past, nevertheless the horrible bloodshed of this war, subjecting women and children to abject privation and bitter destitution is an abomination in the eyes of this nation. There is certainly no doubt that the millions united under the Stars and Stripes were utterly sincere in their prayer yesterday for an early termination of the war and the return of peace, and that the rest of the people, though not actually participating in the prayer, were equally desirous of an early conclusion of this war.</p>
   <p>But if we would ask how and on what conditions these many millions would have peace come, one would find that even in this neutral America opinions would vary greatly; and if we could, like the Lord of Hosts, look into the hearts of the people who prayed last night, we would discover that almost all of them had attached their own individual conditio sine qua non to their peace prayer. Peace, yes. Peace we all want, but only a peace that suits our taste--a peace that seems right to us. Well, what could be expected of these naive children, <pb facs="5418474_5_1048.jpg" n="3"/>little and big? At best it would be a confession of their own lack of judgment or their weakness, or an admission of their doubt in the justice of that great cause which they espouse and which they like to be successful [allies' cause]. Anyone who does not see it that way has to admit that this peace prayer was only meant by many to serve as a beautiful front, a kind of hypocrisy in other words, and that would be worse yet.</p>
   <p>The war is now nine weeks old, and during this time we have had ample opportunity to get to know each other's attitude. It has been demonstrated that a portion of the Anglo-Americans--a large portion if we care to believe the English language press--are entirely pro-British in sentiment and judgment. Now who wants to believe that these people would welcome any other peace than one which could be had at the price of humiliation of the German Reich, or that the Englishmen, Frenchmen,Belgians and Russians living in this country would hear of any other? We also know that the Slavic tribes which are so strongly represented here, the Poles, Czechs, Croats, etc., are even more pan-Slav than their brethren across the sea, that they remain firm in their hatred for Austria-Hungary and we can safely <pb facs="5418474_5_1049.jpg" n="4"/>assume that one condition for the peace which they desire so much would be nothing less than the annihilation of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. We have good reason to believe that the Swedes would only desire a peace that would remove the potential Russian danger from their homeland, and that the vast majority of the Irish-Americans hope for complete independence [home rule] of the Emerald Isle through a victory of the German arms; and a peace which would not accomplish that would certainly look worthless to them.</p>
   <p>But as for us German-Americans, well, it would seem to us a betrayal of the old country, a betrayal of the German people, a betrayal of the justice which we hope is still ruling this world, if we would even consider a peace that had not come about by a decisive victory of the German arms. We love peace, sincerely and ardently, and just because we love it so much, just because the entire German people love it so much, we cannot think of any other peace than one which would have as its prime condition the complete victory of the German cause. We do not care for any other kind of peace, because it would be of no value and would lead <pb facs="5418474_5_1050.jpg" n="5"/>very soon to new and worse struggles, which might even involve our adopted country.</p>
   <p>We do know that the dishonesty and hypocrisy, the revengefulness and envy, the ambition to dominate, and the lying propaganda of the Allies have tricked the German people into this war, that German arms are fighting against pretense and for the truth! And we German-Americans in this country should disown the truth and keep up a cheap pretense and say: Yes, we too want peace, at any price? Never! We do not pray and are not praying for such a peace. Instead, we are praying for a complete and decisive victory of the German arms, knowing that such a victory is the only guarantee for an honorable and lasting peace.</p>
   <p>With this prayer, and trusting in the might of the German armed forces and the justice of our German cause, we confidently enter into the tenth week of the war. May this week bring us news of glorious German victories!</p>
