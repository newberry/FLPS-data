   <p>Tomorrow the American people will celebrate their fleet day. Thanks to the efforts of the fleet league, this day has been made a festive occasion, on a small scale, even in previous years. But this time the day has quite a special significance, for in this year a century and a half has gone by since the American war fleet was started on its glorious history.</p>
   <p>It is justly said that October 27 has a double meaning in the history of our people. On this day one hundred and fifty years ago the Continental Congress, at that time the legislative body of the young nation, decided to grant the means for the requisition of a war fleet. And on October 27, 1858, Theodore Roosevelt was born; he was not only a president of the United States but also served the fleet, whose undersecretary he was, faithfully and successfully during his entire life and gave it his sympathy and his enthusiastic interest.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0082.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the present time, the American people hear much that is unfavorable about their war fleet. Once again research committees are in session in Washington, and once again accusations and suspicions are hurled against the leading men of our war fleet. But this is not going to spoil the faith which the American people have in their fleet. It will suspend its judgment over the technical controversial questions and leave the decision to experts, because it can be decided by experts only.</p>
   <p>It (the American people) will not permit itself to be confused in its sane judgment by sensational and unproved statements made by officers eager for publicity. Of course, the war fleet should take into account the technical developments which take place along with time and progress. It has been doing just that until now, and there are no grounds to assume that it suddenly has ceased being true to its glorious past. But it is the duty of the people to show sympathy, interest, and understanding for its fleet.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0083.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Toward this end, the celebration of the fleet day should be of service. By means of these celebrations, the value and meaning of the fleet should be made clear to the people. The geographical position of our country requires that the fleet constitute the first line of defense in the case of an armed conflict. As long as we have our fleet, we are protected against invasion. Our fleet naturally provides the most important means of defense during an assault by any adversary.</p>
   <p>Our war fleet affords protection and assistance to our foreign trade everywhere on the face of the globe. Our foreign trade, the value of which amounts to about five billion, turns its profits over to our national industry, thus securing our prosperity. After all, our war fleet is, in distant lands, the symbol of our might and of the greatness of our Republic. It carries the message of the "Star-Spangled Banner" to all latitudes of our planet; everywhere it commands respect for the people living beneath the "Star-Spangled Banner".</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0084.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Therefore our war fleet is a vital and substantial factor in our entire national life. And that this fact may emphatically be brought to the consciousness of the American people is the aim and purpose of the fleet day.</p>
