   <p>The old fairy tale that the Allies, and first among them "democratic" and "liberty-loving" Britain, were concerned only with fighting German or Prussian "militarism," and with liberating the beloved and respected German people from its hands, makes even the ordinarily gullible Americans smile. Neither does the alibi any longer work that only the Kaiser and the "military clique" surrounding him wanted this war and should be held responsible for it. Eventually, people come to realize that the entire German people stand behind the Kaiser and his government as one man, and that, if they are inclined to find fault with the Kaiser, it is rather because he has hesitated so long, and not because he has acted too quickly. And developments compel us to admit that the German people must have had very good reasons, in fact did have plenty, to abandon that peace which had made them great and strong, and to stake all the splendid achievements of the past twenty-four years-- <pb facs="5418474_5_1037.jpg" n="2"/>their hard-gained prosperity, their liberty, and their very existence--on the chances of war. The stories of alleged German atrocities have long since ceased to be taken seriously by serious-minded people; these tales have no audience and will die a natural death.</p>
   <p>All the assertions made by Germany's enemies, in order to secure for the Allies the sympathy and good will of neutral nations, all the efforts made to discredit the German cause, have vanished into thin air, and have come to naught. Nothing remained, with the exception of one item: Germany violated Belgian neutrality, infamously tore up that sacrosanct neutrality guarantee, and forced a peaceable, innocent and peace-loving people into this horrible war, which turned their country into a battlefield, destroyed their cities, took the lives of thousands of their sons, and made hundreds of thousands homeless and destitute. This accusation, the gravest of them all, remained and seemed justified, because authoritative German sources had admitted that Germany had committed an injustice in the case of Belgium. Germany did not make any attempt to deny the violation of Belgian neutrality, <pb facs="5418474_5_1038.jpg" n="3"/>but only justified this act by pointing to the difficult position in which the Reich found herself; military strategy called for it, and "all is fair in love and war". That was admitted [by the Allies], but it was denied that Germany's position was of such extreme difficulty and precariousness, and the [German] announcement that a "scrap of paper" must not stand in the way of a nation's vital interests was regarded as "cynical," "brutal," and "barbaric". The violation of Belgian neutrality still remained as the gravest accusation which could be made against Germany.</p>
   <p>According to radio reports received yesterday, it was claimed that German military authorities had discovered documents in the archives at the Belgian general staff headquarters in Brussels, which proved that England and France not only had the intention not to respect Belgian neutrality in case of war with Germany, but that, as a matter of fact, they had broken this neutrality long since, and with Belgian co-operation; that Belgian not only had ceased to be a true neutral years ago, but had even made an alliance with England and France against Germany. That means that the German military <pb facs="5418474_5_1039.jpg" n="4"/>authorities are supposed to have found the proofs for a suspicion which they have had for a long time.</p>
   <p>Reports from Washington indicate that the publication of this news item by the German embassy had aggravated, to a great extent, the "diplomatic tension" prevailing in that city. The British and the French embassies had declared the overseas report a fabrication designed by the Germans to counteract the prejudice which Germany had incurred by violating Belgium's neutrality. This reaction is only natural on the part of the Allies. Their denial of truth and the cry, "Hold that thief!" have become as natural to them as lying and robbing. It must be expected that their [the Allies'] version will find much credence, and the Germans will have to prove their latest claims by furnishing documentary evidence if they want to be believed, because, in this country, and in almost every place outside of Germany, people are not as conscientious in these matters as the Germans have demonstrated themselves to be. Supposing, in this country, one had been as convinced of Belgium's underhanded methods as the German authorities <pb facs="5418474_5_1040.jpg" n="5"/>had been for so long. In that case, Americans, without any scruples, would have claimed it to be a fact, and "as for the proof, well, we'll furnish that when the time comes, and meanwhile we'll do a little invading, just to be on the safe side". Americans would not have dreamed of apologizing to anybody, or of accepting the stigma of a violation of neutrality. And if Germany had been a little less scrupulous in this case, she would have looked a little smarter in American eyes.</p>
   <p>But perhaps it is better the way matters stand now. The truth will out sometime, and Germany, thanks to her incorruptibility and conscientiousness, will be regarded as a greater nation than ever, because of it.</p>
