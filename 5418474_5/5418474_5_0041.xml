   <p>Latest reports from the Capitol indicate that there is little prospect that Congress will pass the neutrality bills which were drafted for the purpose of keeping the United States out of future wars which do not concern us. Although some members of both legislative branches of the Government attempted to have the one or the other of these bills discussed, all their efforts have been in vain. They did not even succeed in arousing the committee that was to report these bills, although it is generally conceded that the great majority of Americans are opposed to war, unless we are attacked. The people of this country refuse to fight the wars of other nations.</p>
   <p>Apparently there are two principal reasons why the representatives of the people have deferred action on the neutrality bills. In the first place, it is said that it is the object of the President to have only those bills that are included in his must program passed during the present session of the Congress; <pb facs="5418474_5_0042.jpg" n="2"/>but none of the neutrality bills are on the must program. The other reason is that the State Department is opposed to the wording of the bills, alleging that it is not definite enough to be of any practical value.</p>
   <p>We cannot understand why there should be so much opposition to the bills on the part of the Government. The Department of State could easily recommend alterations that it deems necessary, if it honestly desires to assist in passing a neutrality law which will protect the United States against the bitter experiences that we encountered by entering the World war.</p>
   <p>Nor can we understand why anybody should object to the principal provision of all the bills, namely, that in the future Congress may not authorize a declaration of war unless it has been empowered to do so by a vote of the people.</p>
   <p>Only munitions manufacturers who favor war because they derive a profit from it, will object to the other provisions, which place a ban on furnishing guns and ammunition to nations at war.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0043.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>So why hesitate? Conditions in Europe are so critical that war may break out at any moment, and then everything possible will be done to draw America into that war. As long as we have no neutrality laws as outlined above, there is the possibility that there will be a reoccurrence of events that resulted in our entry into the World War. Who among our national senators or representatives wants to be responsible for such an eventuality?</p>
