<title level="a">MANKIND, AWAKE! by Paul Haas, Member of Friends of German Democracy</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The fourth year of the bloody war was concluded a few weeks ago and not even the slightest ray of hope for an early peace, which mankind desires, penetrates the dark night of this horrible man-killing war:</p>
   <p>Blood, blood, and still more blood, that is the gruesome password of war.</p>
   <p>Hesitatingly and with horror, thinking people are asking this fateful question: Does it have to be? Does it have to be that more and more noble human lives are sacrificed to the merciless god of war? Must it be that millions sigh away their last breath on Europe's blood-drenched battlefields, thus bringing untold grief, distress, and worry into thousands of happy homes?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0397.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Truly, this war proved one thing: It did not even spare the little baby in the cradle. Grief and horror fills the hearts of mothers who take their babies into their loving arms. Fear and apprehension grip those who think of the unborn child. The children, the blessing of a happy union, the pride of their parents, the hope of the latter's old age--what do we rear and educate them for? Do we rear them so that they, too, can be put into uniforms and can fight for either autocracy or democracy at the command of irresponsible demagogues? No, and three times no! Never again will the free sons of America or Europe's millions, fettered by the chains of militarism, have to take up arms to destroy God's beautiful world.</p>
   <p>The high ideal which caused America to enter the war must and will now be attained. The result of the war will be the political self-determination of all civilized peoples. And the intelligent German nation will also throw off the chains that were an obstacle to her development: princes and potentates, militarism and an arrogant feudal autocracy. They will unfurl the banner of democracy--a free people among other free peoples.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0398.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Unfortunately, we have to confess that the highly intelligent German nation has, up to now, been politically the most enslaved of all civilized nations of the world. Germany's largest federal state, Prussia, having the worst of all electoral systems, is a black spot on the map. The Constitution of the German Reich is a travesty of true democracy.</p>
   <p>During the last year so much has been written by competent persons about Germany's political deficiencies, about the unlimited absolutism of her princes, about the strangle hold of her militarism and the impudent arrogance of her feudal lords, that only the most narrow-minded in this country could espouse Germany's cause.</p>
   <p>I am always glad, therefore, to see Americans of German descent given the opportunity to prove that they truly love the country of their own free choice; the country for which we live, work, and die.</p>
   <p>It is with pride that I look upon America's President, who--a fact which <pb facs="5418474_5_0399.jpg" n="4"/>is unique in world history--did not lead America into the war for material gains, but for the wonderful ideal of a free world democracy.</p>
   <p>To help reach this goal is the honorable duty of every human being who claims to be a free individual. And not until we meet with success can we go back to tilling the soil with a clear conscience, knowing that we have finished a job which centuries could not accomplish. Our children and grandchildren will reap and enjoy the harvest of peace.</p>
   <p>Therefore, awake, mankind! Let us not rest or shirk any sacrifice, no matter how great, in our effort to bring glory to our proud America as the savior of that world peace for which mankind is longing. Europe will thank us--Germany will thank us.</p>
   <p>The peace of the world cannot be secured without the complete and permanent overthrow of the present German system of government, at the helm of which stands the Hohenzollern dynasty. This royal house, in times <pb facs="5418474_5_0400.jpg" n="5"/>of danger, promised the people much but, after the danger was past, never kept its word. This royal house used whips to suppress any desire for political freedom.</p>
   <p>What crime did Reuter do, that he had to languish behind the prison bars for years? [Translator's note: Reuter was a poet and author.] What did Carl Schurz do that he had to flee Germany?</p>
   <p>A long list of men with honorable names could be mentioned here, who, by order of the Prussian kings, were thrown into fortresses and penitentiaries because they loved their country and their people, and wanted to lead them out of the darkness of the Prussian-German political system.</p>
   <p>If those brave men of 1848 did not succeed in throwing off the yoke of political slavery, let us hope that it will be done now with America's help.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_0401.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is the particular duty of the German element in America to help mold world history and to assist our wise President in breaking the chains of the German people, which are an obstacle to peace and democracy.</p>
