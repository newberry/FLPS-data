   <p>Times change and with it the customs and our understanding. Recently the world press expressed itself with sympathetic sighs and rolling eyes whenever an opportunity presented itself to speak of the stupendous army expenditures of the European nations and, especially, "military trodden" Germany. Comparisons were then resorted to and with pride and smug satisfaction we were told how infinitely better we Americans conduct ourselves in this respect, how much better we are off. Today it is different. The military ruled Europeans are still in a sad plight, but through another cause and to this sympathetic regret we have added disdain; especially where Germany is concerned. Our lot is, of course, infinitely better than that of the Eastern continent, not because we have no military burdens, but because we can carry them more easily. We despise the Europeans today, because they make so much fuss on account of a little military tax. The hypocritical dirge about the oppressive load which militarism placed upon the poor European shoulders has been silenced. It had to be, since our taxation today is just as heavy or more so, if everything is enumerated. The expenditures of the United States, during the last fiscal year have been $180,075,000 for the army and navy or, $2.25 per head for the population, Great Britain's $748 per capita; France's, $4.93 per person; and Germany, that ferocious military wolf, $2.76 per head. England's high rate is explained by the Boer war, <pb facs="5418474_5_1292.jpg" n="2"/>otherwise it would have about the same level as the other nations. This shows that, of the four above mentioned powers, German's militarism requires the least. O, what compassion we whould have for those Germans! At present, the per capita expense is still somewhat lower here, than amongst the Teutons, but it may be predicted that in a few years the picture will change. Although our appropriations for the army will not be particularly increased, nevertheless, the money provided for the navy constitutes a relatively larger sum and, within the next years when the enlarged program materializes, considerable capital will be needed. Then Germany will be beaten as far as this item is concerned and, if we include the pension payments, they total $140,000,000 alone for this year, then it (Germany) must sneak away ignominiously whenever "Land - Protection (Insurance)" is mentioned.</p>
   <p>When we reach that period, then the explanation will be forthcoming: What has been an atrocious crime perpetrated against an unfortunate people, has in truth been a profound blessing, the greatest in fact, that may be bestowed upon a population. After all, great expenditures for an army and navy are indications of serene intelligence; we can deduce therefrom patriotism, a progressive spirit and sublime cultural ambitions. Of course the World press must still postpone <pb facs="5418474_5_1293.jpg" n="3"/>the publication of the noble song of American superiority, but it has been composed, is being practiced now.</p>
   <p>We will not experience much difficulty in exceeding the combined military expenses of the European nations when that goal has been reached. When reached, then the grand song of "National Self Protection" with its mighty accords will reverberate throughout the land. The expression "Military tax" will be omitted from our dictionary, at least, whenever America is concerned. No one can doubt thereafter that we are able to lick the world, and, if perchance, some friendly nation hesitates to accept that dictum, then we'll declare a war, since nowadays, war is considered the true indication and proof of a nation's ability. Formerly it was the "terror of the people", "a crime towards humanity", the "scourge of God". The preparations were simply termed "insanity" and "outrage". Today we say, eloquently: "Land-protection, insurance."</p>
