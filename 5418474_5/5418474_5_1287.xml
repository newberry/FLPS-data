   <p>Even in the midst of the election campaign, John Bull is greatly agitated with a coming war with Germany and the average British is more than ever convinced, that a war with the hated rival is inevitable. The British public is constantly informed, that Germany is preparing for the next war and waits for the decisive moment till its Navy is big enough. It is therefore proposed, not to wait till Germany is ready and whilst the British Navy is still superior to attack the German Navy at their home, destroy it and come home again. This would make it impossible for many years for Germany to compete with other countries in International Affairs. On the other hand, the consequences of a German victory are too great to be imagined. They would not only demand an enormous war indemnity, but would also occupy the British Colonies of South Africa, Gibraltar, Malta, and so forth, to command the Mediterranean Sea. They might also interfere in the East, Hongkong and India. Some prophets even go so far, as to predict the annexation of Holland, Belgium and Denmark by the Germans.</p>
