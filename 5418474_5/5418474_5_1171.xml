   <p>What did the speaker say at that memorable meeting, Wednesday night in the Auditorium? "....because the German people is the superior race. It is interesting to note what my old friend Dr. [John A.] Enander, the greatest Swedish-American newspaper editor this country has ever known, had to say about it. His plan called for an indissoluble defense alliance among all the Germanic nations. That was his dream and often he spoke to me about it. "My son," he said, "if that raving, manical Pan-Slavism ever gets ready to devour Pan-Germanism, all the Germanic tribes will have to stand together in defiance of this powerful enemy, if they want to survive.' And he was right. Once before the Norsemen were the saviors of their countrymen when they sailed forth in their dragon ships under Jarl Harald and went southward to save the last remainder of the Goths, whom the terrible Narses had <pb facs="5418474_5_1172.jpg" n="2"/>tried to annihilate by having them squashed under the heel of a mad Byzantinism. And that can happen again."</p>
   <p>That can happen again, but it won't. The German ramparts are firm and strong. The German people's strength and fighting power are indomitable. And it will remain so, God willing. Strong and righteous is our faith in a final German victory.</p>
   <p>We are hoping and waiting for the news which the next few days must bring. And as we listen, paying little attention to the ravens that croak their lies all around us [Translator's note: probably reference to English press and its false war-propaganda], we hear a strong voice, whose words are music in our ears. Hemlandet, the well-known Swedish daily newspaper in Chicago, published an article on Thursday entitled: "Together with Germany, if Sweden must choose":</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1173.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"We sincerely hope and trust that our homeland will be able to preserve its neutrality in this World War. But if that should be impossible, we hope that it will unite its strength with Germany in a final attempt to smash Russia, the archenemy that has threatened Sweden's integrity for centuries.</p>
   <p>"It is unfortunate that England, a civilized, enlightened, and liberty-loving nation, has sided with Russia. This may be partly because of certain agreements with Russia, which England could not very well abrogate without losing face, and partly because of commercial rivalry, caused by Germany's persistent and, during recent years, very successful competition in commerce and industry. Just the same, it is sad to see England draw the sword in defense of Russia at a time when there is a chance to smash that ancient enemy of liberty, enlightenment, and progress.</p>
   <p>"May a higher power guide and help the German nation. In this war she is <pb facs="5418474_5_1174.jpg" n="4"/>fighting for all the things that are sacred to a civilized people."</p>
   <p>This is indeed a true and friendly voice in a chorus of malice and slander. Perhaps we have one friend in need. We hope so because Sweden could make a strong friend and ally. The Swedish sword has always been keen-edged, and the arm that wields it is strong. It is accustomed to dealing heavy blows. And Germany is fighting Sweden's war as well as her own. If Germany is defeated, the Russian Bear, Sweden's archenemy, will be able to tear out Sweden's heart.</p>
   <p>Sweden may not decide to join the fight. She may want to stay neutral and leave the German people to fight singlehanded the monster of the knout and [fiendish] mass slaughter, and his accomplices, republican France and enlightened and liberty-loving England. The friendly word in the Hemlandet <pb facs="5418474_5_1175.jpg" n="5"/>will be appreciated just the same. It is the only one we have received during these grave days; this has been the single [friendly] voice in the chorus of nations that can't yell loud enough: Down with the German people; hit 'em again, they're still moving! Germans appreciate every word of encouragement; if they didn't in the past, they had better learn to.</p>
   <p>That friendly Swedish voice speaking from the center of America will not help the German people in their titanic struggle. The question whether to join the fight or merely to watch it will be decided in Stockholm. But we over here have something to look forward to: friendly relations between the Swedes and Germans, a closer co-operation of the Germanic elements, which is necessary for the welfare of this republic.</p>
