   <p>A few years ago, on a festive occasion, the German Kaiser compared the publishers of the great American newspapers to "commanding generals". He wanted to point out their great power and influence and to flatter them at the same time, probably hoping to gain their good will toward Germany. The Kaiser was fooling himself if he entertained any such hope, and he badly misjudged the American newspaper publishers.</p>
   <p>These publishers naturally seemed to the Kaiser to be American commanding generals, because their newspapers were published in America, and he thought that they were serving American interests exclusively. This assumption seemed natural enough, but it proved to be wrong. If the publishers of the great American dailies can be likened to commanding generals, they are most certainly British commanding generals, for there is no such thing as a great American press.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1106.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Whatever goes under that name is in fact British. Our great English-language dailies express British--and not American--sentiment, feeling, and thought. They pursue British aims and promote British interests in contradiction to and to the disadvantage of American interests. This statement may sound crazy, absurd, and impossible, but it is true nevertheless! The great Chicago news-papers--and they are practically an echo of the Eastern press--are themselves proof of this. Anyone who has been reading them carefully in recent days must come to that conclusion. They are more British than even the great English papers.</p>
   <p>The London Times, in yesterday's edition, carried a report of a retreat of the German armies. In the Chicago Tribune, this retreat turned out to be a wild and disorderly flight. The British and French cablegrams, which do not pay too much attention to the feelings of the Germans, express the hope that Russians may compel the German and Austrian forces in Galicia to surrender; but according to the "British" newspapers in Chicago, this surrender is almost a certainty, if not an accomplished fact. And the more unfavorable the English <pb facs="5418474_5_1107.jpg" n="3"/>cable reports are for the Germans, the louder is the triumphant rejoicing in the English [i. e., pro-British, not English-language] newspapers of our city. How glad they are when those hated Germans have met with defeat; how openly and wholeheartedly they rejoice over it!</p>
   <p>And with what gusto they discuss the alleged tremendous losses of the Germans! How they praise and elaborate on that peerless British and, incidentally of course, French and Belgian courage! How they exert themselves to depict the Germans more and more as contemptible and ridiculous boobs! The situation is just like that at the beginning of the war, when the Germans, they wrote, were being killed by the thousands, like so many sheep, or were being captured, like so many innocent lambs or frightened rabbits. When the Germans were marching victoriously through Belgium and France, they piped down a little, because success always makes an impression. But now that the Germans seem to be retreating, they drop the mask again and give free rein to their feelings.</p>
   <p>The anti-German news reports, jubilantly announcing German defeats and battles <pb facs="5418474_5_1108.jpg" n="4"/>and troop movements, are the least of our worries: these we could forgive our British press of America. They merely harm the Germans, and, after all, we have to make concessions to English blood and English financial influence in this country. But that isn't all: the anti-German attitude finds still another, and much more malicious expression, which does great harm to American interests, in the dissemination of Belgian, French, and English propaganda lies about atrocities committed by German soldiers!</p>
   <p>A week ago today, the Chicago Tribune published the statements of five American foreign correspondents who had traveled in the wake of the German armies and who also had been at the scene of war on the Belgian side: they did not see and could not find any evidence of German atrocities; nor could one single story about German atrocities be substantiated.</p>
   <p>We believe that fully ninety per cent of the readers of the Tribune were sincerely happy over this triumph of truth and justice. But since then, the fortunes of war seem to have left the Germans; or maybe it was thought that too much <pb facs="5418474_5_1109.jpg" n="5"/>justice had been done the Germans; or perhaps the Allies had registered a protest about reports so favorable to the Huns. In any case, Wile and Powell [probably editors on the Tribune staff] are discharging their venom once more, and today the Tribune publishes without comment a special cable dispatch from London in which a British officer reports that he had seen a German officer "in a little village" cut the breasts off a nineteen-year-old girl and that he had shot down the monster from a distance of three hundred yards.</p>
   <p>The publishers and editors of the Tribune know this story to be a ridiculous and abominable lie, that it could not be true. But they publish it just the same! And why? To make the Germans an object of contempt; to arouse the gullible readers against anything that is German; to sow the most bitter hatred against a people whose whole history for thousands of years shows no evidence of bloodthirst or cruelty--a people that has done more to alleviate human suffering than any other, and that, up to the outbreak of this war, was praised as the most peaceful nation on earth; and, finally, to sow hatred against the millions of people of German blood who make their home here in America and <pb facs="5418474_5_1110.jpg" n="6"/>who did their full share for the preservation of the Union and for the greater glory of this Republic.</p>
   <p>The American people themselves are still free from the hatred for Germany expressed in the English-language daily press, and they shall be kept free from it if possible. They have no press of their own. What they do have is a British press which is serving the enemy of American greatness and independence. But the American people have a right to a press of their own and they demand a press of their own. And whenever a demand is strong enough, it will eventually be taken care of.</p>
