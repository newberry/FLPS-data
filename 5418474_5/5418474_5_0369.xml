   <p>Since it is necessary in this campaign to raise the largest amount ever asked, the campaign managers naturally will do their utmost. Especially is this true of the foreign-speaking committee, which includes thirty-five different language groups. Every evening three or four meetings are held and soon all will be organized. According to Felix J. Streyckmans, chairman of the committee, there never was such enthusiasm as is shown now by Americans of foreign birth. Thousands upon thousands of them have sent their husbands, sons, or brothers to fight with gun in hand for their new country, and the victories won naturally caused great enthusiasm among them. There is no question that, while in this mood, they will gladly reach into their pockets to loan Uncle Sam the necessary money to continue the fight.</p>
   <p>Some of these language groups have already chosen their officials. The Danes <pb facs="5418474_5_0370.jpg" n="2"/>elected John C. Christensen, chairman, A. M. Petersen, secretary, and Christian Botker, publicity director; the Hungarians have elected John P. Hovland, chairman, Andreas Hummelend, secretary, and Geo. M. Kramer, vice-chairman.</p>
   <p>The organization activities are conducted by Mr. Hans Rieg, director of the foreign-speaking department of the United States Treasury, who is in Chicago at the present time. He has the greatest faith in the Americans of foreign birth of Chicago, since they did their patriotic duty in the most satisfactory manner during the last Liberty Loan drive. At that time seventeen million persons or firms in the United States bought Liberty Bonds. Of these seventeen million, 7,061,303, or forty-one and one-half per cent, were of foreign birth or origin. The sum paid by them amounted to $741,437,000, which was seventeen and three-fourths per cent of the total amount.</p>
   <p>In the State of Illinois four hundred and fifty million dollars were subscribed altogether for the Third Liberty Loan, of which $92,670,050 was contributed by <pb facs="5418474_5_0371.jpg" n="3"/>citizens of foreign birth or origin. In the State of New York, on the other hand, of a total of nine hundred million dollars, only $109,129,050 were subscribed by the foreign element.</p>
