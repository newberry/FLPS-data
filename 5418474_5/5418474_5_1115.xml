   <p>The people of the United States can hardly remain neutral in view of the events taking place in Europe. The majority of the population of this country is kin to or descendants of the nations now engaged in this bloody strife.</p>
   <p>It would mean a suppression of all noble and sympathetic sentiments should the suggestion of the President be followed, namely, that all parties directly affected, should accept the news from the seat of war with calmness. It seems impossible to show indifference, when hearts are in a state of revolt. Yet, the Germans of Chicago have made possible what seemed to be an impossibility. In spite of their love for their old fatherland they have abandoned the gathering which was to take place at Riverview Park, <pb facs="5418474_5_1116.jpg" n="2"/>planned for the purpose of aiding their wounded and destitute kinsmen, so that their intentions will not be misconstrued. This may be considered as excessive precaution; however, it is gratifying evidence of the loyalty of the Germans to the country of their choice. This fact should be especially appreciated by those Americans, who adhere to strict neutrality. The Germans have all the more reasons to demand neutrality in accordance with the President's request.</p>
   <p>It is only reasonable to expect that the wise exhortations of the President were taken to heart, but it is indeed deplorable, and revolting when such persons as Charles H. Parkhurst, a prominent preacher in New York, permits himself to be entirely controlled by his hates.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_5_1117.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This man Parkhurst published an article in one of the local papers, that was not written with pen and ink, but with the knout of a drunken Cossack....... We take no pleasure in going into the details of this article, hurled as a firebrand by the New York minister. There are no adequate words in the German language to make a fitting reply possible. But it arouses one question: "Should the naturalized Germans, Austrians, Belgians, English and others be blamed for manifestations of sympathy, for their respective mother-countries, when this American minister considers himself justified to act in the way he did?</p>
