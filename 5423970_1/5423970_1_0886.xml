   <p>On the 14th day of this month the remaining members of the Lithuanian Socialist Society expressed themselves as not wishing to end the existence of the society, so they have decided to increase their activities among the brother workers. At the meeting they discussed their past mistakes, caused by their own inexperienced activity. They have decided to increase their activities, to enlighten their fellow workers and to go forward under the banner of liberty.</p>
   <p>They have decided to name their organization "The Lithuanian Cooperative Enlightenment Society of the Lithuanians of America," and establish a newspaper at once for the explanation and working out of the society's problems, one of which is the exploitation of many by the few. Those who agree with these principles and want to improve their living conditions, may call for further information Joseph Laukis, 3238 S. Halsted St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>We make this announcement through the newspapers because there are many <pb facs="5423970_1_0887.jpg" n="2"/>people who are willing to take action but who do not know with whom to join in the activity, don't know where to go. Now you have an opportunity to show what you can do.</p>
   <p>One of Them.</p>
