   <p>May 2, 1896, the Lithuanian Republicans of the 7th Ward Algirdas Club, held its monthly meeting, 584 S. Jefferson street.</p>
   <p>It was decided:</p>
   <p>I. To make official demand of the Lithuanian Republican Alliance of the State of Illinois that the said club would give us the following information: (1) Who are the members of the executive committee and where do they live? (2) Who were the delegates to the Republican convention in Springfield, Ill., and who represented our nation there? If the delegates were not send there, then why not? (3) Why the decisions of the Alliance is not published in our organ "Lietuva", and how many delegates from each ward were send to the convention? (4) Why some members of the clubs were reprehended by the officials of the Alliance and we were threatened with expulsion from the alliance? (5) Send to our club the constitution of the alliance or copy of it. This decision of our will be sent to the president of the Alliance and to the delegates.</p>

   <p>II. The meetings of the club must be held according to the constitution that is on the first Saturday of each month. The member who will not attend the meeting and will not pay his monthly dues, will be dismissed from the club and will not get relief or any protection from the club. On this meeting ten new members joined our club.</p>
