   <p>p.3....Mr. A. Jundilis, 1441 Clinton St., became lost in the neighborhood of 33rd and Morgan Sts. After asking for directions he proceeded east on 33rd St. towards Halsted St., where he intended to get a street car for his home.</p>
   <p>As he approached Halsted St. he was accosted by two policemen who inquired as to where he had been. After explaining himself the police insisted that he was lying, and accused him of intending to set fire to St. George's church. The police began to beat him. One struck him repeatedly with his fist while the other employed his club. Later he was taken to the 35th St. police station where he was questioned and detained for twenty-four hours.</p>
   <p>Although the police accused him of attempted incendiarism, no matches were found on his person, neither was he drunk, because he never indulges in drinking.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1038.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This incident shows how easily an innocent man can fall into the hands of the police and receive a beating and imprisonment without cause. The Chicago police, especially the Irish, are famous for their partiality towards Catholic priets. It is now becoming increasingly evident that there are many grafters and exploiters of the people among the Chicago police.</p>
