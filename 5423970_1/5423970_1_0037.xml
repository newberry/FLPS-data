   <p>For our young boys and girls of today, I think that knowing more about the domestic side of life will eventually mean more than reading poetry and dreaming of tomorrow. Education should be more practical; we should learn by doing.</p>
   <p>What is the use of a rich fund of specialized knowledge if you cannot use it? Strange it is, too, when educated youths are confronted with daily problems, bewildering and confusing, they are likely to find they cannot put up with the tribulations of life.</p>
   <p>Most of them end up in a state of emotional hysteria, and finally in defeat.</p>
   <p>I say, education should include practical knowledge and experience for the everyday problems of life. Heartbreaking it is when one <pb facs="5423970_1_0038.jpg" n="2"/>looks upon a well educated man who can work effectively at one thing only. Usually the most common needs of this life are not taught in schools, and that is why so many young boys and girls just out of school, find themselves at a loss as to what to do. The real world is different from what they were taught within school walls.</p>
   <p>We need young Lithuanians who can do many things so as to prepare for the emergencies of later life, and this is not possible with the present high degree of specialization in education which is now in vogue. Practical education by actual participation and common sense is most essential today. Scientific knowledge alone is not sufficient.</p>
