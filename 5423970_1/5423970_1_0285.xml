   <p>The first fact is that A. Olszewskis is not a Catholic. This letter which was written by A. Olszewski has attracted the attention of all Lithuanian Catholics in America. It is almost impossible to believe that Olszewski wrote this letter, in which he abused and insulted a Catholic priest and the Holy Church; especially when he considers himself a good Catholic. It is a disgraceful thing for a man who calls himself intelligent and educated to call Catholic priests "crazy" and "unintelligent." He broke the laws of our Holy Church by stating in his letter that man can divorce his wife in court and marry another wife in church, which is against the doctrine of the Holy Roman Church. We would like to know if there is any Catholic priest who would say that marrying a divorcee in a Catholic church is not a sin. We don't think that there is such a priest that would not call such an act a sin, especially a good Catholic who understands the laws of our Holy Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Olszewski thinks that it is not a sin when a divorced man marries again in the Catholic <pb facs="5423970_1_0286.jpg" n="2"/>church, and God will never punish this man after his death. This is the opinion or understanding of our friend Olszewski, who called himself a good Catholic.</p>
