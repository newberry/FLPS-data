   <p>The King Mindaugis of Lithuania Club, whose membership is composed of parishioners of St. George's Lithuanian Roman Catholic parish, 33rd Street and Auburn Avenue, will celebrate the opening of the Parochial school of the parish with an interesting program of orations, music, and a theatrical presentation. The celebration will be held on Sunday evening, June 13th, at the St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn Avenue.</p>
   <p>An interesting feature of the program will be a theatrical play, which will be presented by pupils of the parochial school who have been taught by nuns. The musical part of the program will be furnished by the choirs of the four Lithuanian Roman Catholic parishes in Chicago: St. George's parish, 33rd Street and Auburn Avenue; Providence of God parish, 18th Street and Union Avenue; Holy Cross parish, 46th Street and Hermitage Avenue; and Our Lady of Vilna parish, 23rd Place and Oakley Avenue. There will be four admission prices, ranging from twenty-five cents to one dollar. All Lithuanian men and women are cordially invited to attend this celebration.</p>
