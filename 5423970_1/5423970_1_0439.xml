   <p>The first murder in the present strike was committed Friday, December 2. The victim was from the strikers' side. A Lithuanian striker, K. Lazinskas, was shot on State Street, near Polk Street. He was shot by Tony Yacullo, a special policeman employed by the Royal Tailors Company, 419 Fifth Avenue.</p>
   <p>It happened after 5 o'clock in the evening. T. Yacullo, stationed at the Royal Tailors Company, was leading home two strikebreakers, Rosie and Tony Napatino, 17 and 16 years old. You see, Rosie and Tony Napatino feared that the strikers might attack them for breaking the strike. While accompanying these two strikebreakers, Yacullo noticed that three men were following him. Yacullo then instructed his two companions to go ahead of him and he remained alone. Looking around, he no longer saw the three men. As he proceeded to catch up with the strikebreakers he was suddenly hit from behind and was grabbed by the neck. The three men had attacked Yacullo and had thrown him to the ground. In defending <pb facs="5423970_1_0440.jpg" n="2"/>himself, Yacullo pulled out his revolver and fired twice. One of the three men, K. Lazinskas, was kneeling on Yacullo's chest as the second shot was fired and the shot, fired at close range, went straight to Lazinskas' heart. Lazinskas fell, dead. The other two men had fled after the first shot.</p>
   <p>The victim, K. Lazinskas, was a Lithuanian, a young man of 27 years. He lived at 2860 W. 22nd Street. He worked as a tailor for Hart, Schaffner, and Marx for three years.....</p>
