   <p>On May 13 I had a strange experience when my friend and I were riding on a Halsted street car. In the street car I saw three policemen and one detective who was standing close to my friend. I actually saw with my own eyes this detective pull out the money from my friend's pocket. As soon as the detective had pulled out the money, he and the three policemen immediately got off the street car. It was fortunate that I knew this detective very well and I knew where he lived. In the street car, I believe, he did not see me at the time he was robbing my friend. We went to the detective's house immediately and requested him to return my friend's money. We threatened to report him to the proper authorities if he failed to return the money to my friend. The detective returned the money. He begged us not to tell anybody of this incident and, furthermore, he promised to do us a favor if we did not turn him in. I want to inform the people of the incident and caution them to be careful and not to trust policemen. It is bad enough to have common thieves robbing the people, but in this case we have a detective thief who is being paid by the people to protect them. Instead of catching pickpockets, he is one of them himself.</p>

   <p>This is not only one incident in Chicago. There are hundreds of such cases of which we know nothing and we shall never know. The foreign people, as a rule, are always good prey for policemen and detectives. They take advantage of them because they are foreigners and cannot speak English well. Most of the foreigners, as they think, are ignorant and cannot make any complaint against policemen. They dare not complain and they cannot speak good English to make any complaint, and that is why they are such good prey for those who want to rob and exploit them. Even if the foreigner does make a complaint, it does not mean a thing - they only laugh at him. Some of the policemen rob them indirectly by threatening them with imprisonment, and that is how they get the money from those foreign people.</p>
