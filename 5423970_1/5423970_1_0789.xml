   <p>In another part of this issue of the Lietuva there is published a letter written by Upton Sinclair, well-known American Socialist writer and author. The letter deserves to be read and digested. Our Socialists frequently complain that the American Government desires to place a censorship over newspapers; that the Government has banned a large number of Socialist newspapers; that the Government desires to close the mouths of the people and suppress freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the same manner as the Czar did in Russia.</p>
   <p>It would appear from those complaints that the Socialists are the greatest apostles of liberty. However, such is not the case. For example, their newspaper, The Appeal To Reason, refused space to Upton Sinclair to publish even one word, although he is their friend and has been an active Socialist <pb facs="5423970_1_0790.jpg" n="2"/>for sixteen years. The bosses of the Socialist party have closed the mouths of their own friends who do not think as they do. The bosses are afraid to permit the members of the party to hear opinions that are different from their own.</p>
   <p>They recently conducted a referendum on the war question, and, of course, the members of the party voted as the bosses desired. What does it all mean? Is it liberty or demagogism? Is it not a parody on the institution of the referendum? Does it differ in any way from the methods of the political bosses?</p>
   <p>One individual recently spoke the truth when he stated that Christianity is a good thing, but that its greatest destroyers are the priests; and that Socialism is a good thing, but that its greatest destroyers are the demagogic Socialist leaders who, in their actions, do not differ in any way from the greatest despots. When we study our own [Lithuanian] little Socialist bosses, we must admit that the foregoing statement is true.</p>
