   <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick, president of the union workers of Chicago, gave a good lesson to several Socialist delegates last Sunday at a mass meeting of the Chicago Federation of Labor, which represents two hundred thousand organized workers. The Socialist delegates declared at the meeting that the present war is a war, not of the people, but of American capitalists. Nevertheless, a resolution was passed at the meeting denouncing the People's Council which is a Socialistic anti-war organization.</p>
   <p>Among other things, President Fitzpatrick said: "Those who are now attempting to hurt the Government want us to grab each other by the throats and permit Prussian autocracy to march to victory. They talk about freedom of speech and freedom of the press. I believe in both, but I also believe in law and order. We are now engaged in a war. What would you say about a union man who would step aside when his union declared a strike and refused to assist in winning the strike? You <pb facs="5423970_1_1160.jpg" n="2"/>would call him a 'scab'. Well, every American citizen who does not support his government at a time like this is a 'scab'."</p>
   <p>There is much truth in these words. They were spoken, not by some bourgeois, but by a union leader.</p>
