   <p>The Lithuanian farmers are well and healthy. At present there are nine Lithuanian families, all together, grown-ups and young there are thirty-four Lithuanians. Many more Lithuanians bought farms here, but they do not live on their farms. At the beginning, in 1894, there were twenty-two Lithuanian families here. At present there are fewer of them.</p>
   <p>Through the effort of the priest Balcewiozius, from the Lithuanian donations, a Lithuanian church was built here, but by the mismanagement of the priest, the Lithuanian donations have gone with the winds. Now from the Lithuanian church the protestants made a hall for themselves. They even wanted to tear down the steeple, because as they said, the steeple was unnecessary for the hall. It is very bad that we are harmed by our leaders.</p>
