<title level="a">TANANEVICIUS EXPLAINS CLOSING OF HIS BANK</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>John M. Tananevicius, proprietor of the J. M. Tananevicz Bank now in the hands of the receiver, made a detailed statement in the newspaper Katalikas (The Catholic) explaining the various reasons why his bank was closed. He states that his enemies are mainly responsible for its closing. They succeeded in causing depositors to make a run on the bank. He further stated that the immediate cause was a petition against his bank, submitted to the court by "people of ill will". As a direct result of this petition, the court closed the bank and appointed a receiver.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tananevicius emphatically states that "every cent" of the depositors' money will be returned to them because "the total deposits of the bank are about $600,000, and the total assets are over $700,000."</p>
   <p>In complaining about his enemies, Mr. Tananevicius makes the following statement:</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1638.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Those who are principally to blame for the fact that the bank is now in the bands of the court are the ones who spread leaflets among the people containing false statements about the bank's status. Part of the blame rests with the Socialist newspaper [Naujienos (The News)], which unceasingly employed all kinds of foul methods to antagonize the people against my institution. Those who are finally to blame are the individuals who petitioned the court. Their act was the immediate cause of the bank's closing and stopped me in my efforts to satisfy the demands of the depositors."</p>
   <p>He closes his statement with the words, "I will do everything within my power to see that the depositors get back all their money."</p>
   <p>Last Monday the depositors of the J. M. Tananevicz Bank held a meeting in St. George's Parish Hall. It was decided at the meeting to remove all the affairs of the bank from the receiver's control and to place them under the management of the depositors. By doing this, it was argued, the depositors would gain more than they would if the receiver handled the bank's affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1639.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A committee of twelve was elected by the depositors to look after all the interests of the depositors. The committee is composed of J. P. Evaldas, A. Rutkovski, A. Butling, K. J. Jokubaitis, J. Budrikas, K. K. Kodis, A. Martinkus, John Kulis, V. Stankus, J. M. Medelis, F. Saltysiak, A. Pawlicki, and A. Sultz.</p>
   <p>The committee asks all depositors of the J. M. Tananevicz Bank not to give their bank books to anyone except the dapositors' committee, and not to sell their bank books to anyone. Depositors seeking information pertaining to their deposits are asked to apply to the depositors' committee, located at 3249 South Morgan Street.</p>
   <p>The little bank of Mikas Tananevicius (brother of John), on 18th Street, also fell into the hands of the receiver. The depositors of this bank are organizing in the same manner to remove the affairs of the bank from the control of the receiver and to place them under their own management.</p>
