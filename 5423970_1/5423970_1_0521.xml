   <p>Our Lithuanian newspapers, especially Lietuva, are urging the Lithuanian people to organize cooperative societies. As it was announced in Lietuva, last week a Lithuanian cooperative society was organized. A meeting was held, and at this meeting 50 shares were sold. The priest and businessmen are against this cooperative society. They are telling us that the money will be lost in this society, etc. Our little priest, last Sunday during a sermon, dennounced our cooperative society, which proves the ignorance of the priest. He cannot distinguish between religion and public work. To such denunciations by the priest the people are giving no heed.</p>
   <p>Our parishioners made arrangements so that the committee could collect money in the church, the money collected to be given to the parish treasurer instead of to the priest. The priest announced that during mass there should be no collections any more. The committee did not make collections. Everybody was surprised in the church when the priest him self, during mass, started a collection. Some of the parishioners kicked the priest's scoop, and the money was spilled on the floor. The priest <pb facs="5423970_1_0522.jpg" n="2"/>sued the man, but the poor little priest lost his case in court.</p>
