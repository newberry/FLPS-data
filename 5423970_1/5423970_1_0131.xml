   <p>It was announced in Lietuva before that in Chicago there was organized a society to help poor students who are attending schools. Now the society Auszra (Aurora) has obtained its charter.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this newly organized society is this: to help the young students who are seeking higher education, to prepare for the Lithuanian nation educated workers. The greatest attention must be paid to the students of art, music, song, painting, sculpture, architecture, natural science, etc. The above mentioned students will have first consideration over doctors, lawyers, etc., who after graduation can make a living, while the art students cannot after their graduation. The female students will be taken first into consideration.</p>
   <p>The society will help women, not only those who are seeking higher education, but those that are willing to learn common Lithuanian art, so that such women can teach others the common, ordinary, daily, house-hold arts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The society will help not only students in America but also in Europe, so that such students in the future can benefit Lithuanianism.</p>
   <p>The student candidates appealing for aid will be investigated through confidential people before we decide to help them. The society's membership is divided into two parts: The first pays 5 initiation and 50 c per month, the second pays $1 initiation and 25 c per month. The rights of the members of both are equal; the officials of the society can be of Part I or of Part II.</p>
   <p>At present the society has in its treasury $23.75. As soon as we have 40 members in the society, we will present the stipend to a student attending school.</p>
   <p>The meetings are held on the first Sunday of the month. The next meeting will be held on March 2, at the drugstore of Mr. Graicziunas, 167 W. 18th St., at 7 P. M. We ask our brothers to come and join this society of high ideals. The members of this society can be women or men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0133.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the issue of last week the Tevyne stated approval of our society. At present we will not thank the newspaper Tevyne, because we have no confidence in that newspaper. This newspaper has no stable sympathy with any progressive cause. At one time that newspaper will uphold and support a certain cause, while the nest time, the same purpose which was highly praised, this newspaper denounces with great vituperation. Therefore, before giving thanks we will wait for a while. Really we should not envy each other.</p>
   <p>If there was no envy among us, we could accomplish twice as much, and there would be less disputes among us.</p>
   <p>The Auszra Society</p>
