<title level="a">REMARKS FROM THE LITHUANIAN COMMITTEE OF "ZINYCIA"</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>1. "Zinycia" (temple tabernacle) is the central committee of the Lithuanian Cooperative Association of America. The authoritative administration consists of five members, and the directory of seven.</p>
   <p>2. "Zinycia," as the Lithuanian Cooperative Association of America, takes in all of the American-Lithuanian affairs.</p>
   <p>3. The corporation, Lithuanian Cooperative Association of America, will be incorporated when the Central Committee have not less than one thousand members. When this number has joined "Zinycia," then a convention will be called at which the delegates shall make the by-laws, incorporate the society, elect reliable officials, print the shares and start selling them. Then the organization will be completely organized.</p>
   <p>The committee of "Zinycia" shall not sell the shares nor collect any money to cover expenses for propaganda in favor of the organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0507.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All members shall pay in proportion to cover the current expense.</p>
   <p>4. Zinycia, until this association is completely organized, shall propagate its purpose, advertise its ideas and, as this is a public association, ask the public to give its views on the project with criticisms and suggestions.</p>
   <p>5. Whereas the Lithuanians are spread in small groups in various cities of the United States, they cannot attend the meetings of the central committee of "Zinycia." Hence, every Lithuanian colony should organize a branch of "Zinycia." The members of these branches shall have full right to come at the meetings of the central committee.</p>
   <p>The administration will mail upon request all the necessary literature with instructions on how to organize branches of Zinycia in any Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>6. All compatriots wanting to ask a question or wanting to have any information from the central committee, call or write the president, <pb facs="5423970_1_0508.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. J. J. Hertmanovicz, 173 Augusta St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>7. The meetings of the central committee of "Zinycia" are held on the second Thursday of the month, 8 P. M., at Northwestern University Settlement, Augusta and Noble Streets.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanovicz</p>
   <p>President Central Committee of Zinycia.</p>
