<title level="a">THE FUTURE OF LITHUANIANS IN AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>It is common to investigate the nation in the past and to lay the future road on the basis of historical events. Even though the past our our nation is not examined clearly, although the enlightened Lithuanian knows more or less of the past, we have some foundation on which we can stand and look at the future.</p>
   <p>Even though the examination of the nation's past is good, it is more important to look to the future plans for the existence of the nation. Without a plan no nation can live a sovereign life of development and growth.</p>
   <p>By looking to the future and by investigating the past, we must understand many similarities; we ought to know the circumstances in which the nation has lived. The circumstances we can divide <pb facs="5423970_1_0613.jpg" n="2"/>into two parts: spiritual and material. The spiritual comes from within the nation, while the material from circumstances in which the nation lives. By getting acquainted with circumstances, then we can lay plans for the future existence of the nation. I will speak about the future Lithuanian life in America. At first we must know the circumstances in which we are living, what place we occupy among the people of this country.</p>
   <p>United States statistics show that there are over 80,000,000 inhabitants here. How many Lithuanians (there are) nobody knows. Some say three hundred thousand, others that there are five hundred thousand. I will take the middle figure, four hundred thousand Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Now then if there are 80,000,000 inhabitants, for every two hundred people there is one Lithuanian.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0614.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is very easy to compare the standard of Lithuanians with Americans. The Lithuanians in every way are far behind.</p>
   <p>The three most essential factors in the life of the nation, those on which the nation stands, are morality, enlightenment and wealth.</p>
   <p>Morality. To compare the morality of Lithuanians with Americans', we must look into the court records, where we can make a comparison as to whether the Lithuanians stand higher or lower in morality.</p>
   <p>The American writer, Upton Sinclair, in his book, The Jungle, about the stock yards, describes Lithuanian life on a low plane of morality.</p>
   <p>From the point of view of enlightenment, on this question we do not need to make a search, the enlightenment of Lithuanians is far behind that of the Americans. I have previously stated that for every Lithuanian there are two hundred Americans. Then for every two hundred <pb facs="5423970_1_0615.jpg" n="4"/>American students there must be one Lithuanian; to every two hundred American professionals there ought to be one Lithuanian, etc. The country of America is free, we Lithuanians are great lovers of liberty, therefore, let us make an effort to fulfill this above mentioned gap (?). Then we can prove to the American public that we are just as good and know how to use opportunity like the Americans do.</p>
   <p>From the material point of view. This also we can compare with the proportion above stated. If the Lithuanians were more advanced, business and industry among Lithuanians would be the same as the professional proportion.</p>
   <p>There are more problems which we need to discuss, but I will omit them. The other problem which is very important, let us say the fourth one, is politics. We Lithuanians are very honest people, so we look on politics as a dirty occupation. We must not neglect <pb facs="5423970_1_0616.jpg" n="5"/>politics. In a free country we must mingle in political affairs, we must participate in political activity, take the leadership, and then we can be elected to some minor or higher office, by being some kind of official we can do something for the benefit not only of the Lithuanians but of the general public as well.</p>
   <p>The above mentioned problems the Lithuanians ought to take under consideration. If we want to have a brighter future, let us take action to do away with our bad habits, let us begin to read scientific literature, books and newspapers, they will show us the road to progress, civilization and fortune.</p>
