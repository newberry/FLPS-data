   <p>In Washington, D. C., Representative Roddenberry of Georgia presented to Congress a resolution which demand that a person having even a drop of Negro blood be prohibited from marrying a white woman, and vice versa. He cursed and heaped contempt on those having any amount of Negro blood. But the Georgia Representative does not demand that the whites be prohibited from having Negro mistresses. Nobody has yet raised humanity either intellectually or morally by the curbing of truths, or with contempt. Neither has anybody raised any nationality culturally with such weapons. However, it must be true that the Americans had never really attempted to raise the Negro. There is no Negro problem in Europe because, it is apparent, things are done differently there. The Negro problem in America has been created by the Americans themselves, especially in the southern states, to which Georgia also belongs. After the European countries had abolished Negro slavery even in their colonies, it continued in the southern States of North America for <pb facs="5423970_1_1364.jpg" n="2"/>twenty more years, because plantation owners required cheap laborers with whom they could do as they pleased. They transported purchased slaves here in great bands and they propagated so that today there are more than 11,000,000 Negroes. They do now present a Negro problem, but that is only the consequence of trampling moral principles. Sooner or later one has to pay for trampling moral principles and the truth of that must now be felt especially by the whites in the Southern States. Eleven million Negroes will not be exterminated by pro-lynching governors or by representatives in Congress. Their followers have been demoralizing the Negroes for many years and are now surprised that they assume different morals! Whoever sows seeds must also harvest the fruits of the same seeds. Anger and contempt are the worst advisers. A pen or tongue dipped in gall never bears good fruits.</p>
