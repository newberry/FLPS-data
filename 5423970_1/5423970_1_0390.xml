   <p>The anthracite coal miners strike is now over. More than 158,000 coal miners waged a brave but futile battle with their employers. They showed rare courage and patience and suffered greatly from hunger and cold. However, with only one stroke of the pen they were sold out by their own leader--John L. Lewis, national president of the coal miners union.</p>
   <p>John Lewis renounced the demand of the coal miners for higher <pb facs="5423970_1_0391.jpg" n="2"/>wages and agreed to sign a "five-year" contract. All future grievances of the coal miners will be placed into the hands of a committee of two officials, who are mere tools of the capitalist mine owners. Furthermore, at the Scranton conference, the aids of John Lewis laughed shamelessly at those delegates who attempted to defend the rights of the coal miners. Thus, the "black Friday" agreement was ratified.</p>
   <p>The coal miners received a painful lesson. After striking for six months they were in a very strong position to win the strike. However, they were forced to return to their jobs <pb facs="5423970_1_0392.jpg" n="3"/>without winning a single demand. They returned to work because that was the wish of their leader, who receives thousands of dollars as a yearly salary. All this money comes from the pockets of the coal miners themselves.</p>
   <p>In spite of this temporary defeat, the coal miners must not become discouraged. The strike proved that the coal miners union is very strong and effective. The only thing it still lacks is class consciousness. When class consciousness increases, the hypocritical leaders of the union will automatically disappear. Once the coal miners learn that John Lewis and his aids are in <pb facs="5423970_1_0393.jpg" n="4"/>
the service of the capitalists his reign will come to an end.</p>
   <p>Therefore, as the coal miners return to work they must never forget the great lesson of the strike. They should not fold their arms and wait for another strike. They should organize immediately into a strong, left wing and then sweep out the servants of mine owners from their union.</p>
   <p>In this work the Communists will continue to assist their friends in the coal mines. We were with you during the strike and we shall continue to be with you during the time of "industrial peace".</p>
