   <p>With a sad heart I am asking you to print in your newspaper Lietuva what is going on with a leader of our Lithuanian church of Saint George in Chicago. Our church leader not only holds power in the church, but he controls the churchyard too!</p>
   <p>On the seventh day of this month, 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, we parishioners were walking along by our church. We saw a horse pasturing in our churchyard! We never thought that the horse in the churchyard was pasturing with the consent of the priest Kolesinski. We came to the gates to chase out the horse and lo! we found the gates locked. Imagine such a priest allowing the horse to pasture in our churchyard. So we went into the priest Kolesinski's house, got the key, and took the horse to the police station at 35th and Halsted St. And the worst of it, the horse belonged to a Pole, Piechocki, the carpenter.</p>
   <p>Imagine, dear parishioners, a horse rubbing his back against the holy walls and doors of the church!</p>
   <p>We parishioners must stop this horrible nuisance, keeping the horse in the chuchyard with the consent of our spiritual leader. We must stop such a practice of keeping the horse of some Pole in our holy churchyard.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Jos. F. Szymkiewicz.</p>
