   <p>We have often heard the statement that "anyone with a good throat and good eyes can make an easy living among Lithuanian-Americans". This assertion is rather harsh, but its accuracy can hardly be questioned. Many of our people are so gullible that a clever but irreverent person who takes advantage of this situation-can make an easy living, and may even become wealthy.</p>
   <p>No doubt, we all have heard of the Chicago Lithuanian who sold "magic carpets" to people of his own nationality, with which they could cross the ocean on foot; who made a good profit selling "magic caps" that were supposed to make the wearer invisible; and who defrauded many Lithuanians by selling "money-making machines" to them. Such a fraud could not even get started among people of other nationalities. However, he is making a good living among our people by taking hard-earned dollars from gullible Lithuanians.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0551.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among what other national groups can a person who cannot write be an editor? Where else can a person who only intends to study medicine issue a medical journal? Where else can such a publication as the Sake (The Prong) exist? We have been unable to learn whether or not such things are possible among people of other nationalities, but they are not only possible but are actually happening among Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
   <p>Lately, a new evil "star" has begun to shine upon our people in the person of a certain "Reverend" M. X. Mockus. He is traveling among the Chicago Lithuanian colonies, and is delivering "sermons" based on the Bible. All he lacks is a "St. Peter's Cathedral". [Translator's note: That is, he has no church or parish.] He seems to have won some favor among the Socialists, because his activities are often reported in their press.</p>
   <p>Who is this person who has only recently come before the public? In the twentieth number of the Amerikos Lietuvis (The Lithuanian-American), a certain Juzes Vaikas <pb facs="5423970_1_0552.jpg" n="3"/>[a pen name meaning "son of Josie"] gives some very interesting information about the life of Mockus.</p>
   <p>He was born in Ramanava county, state of Suvalkai, Lithuania, and emigrated to America in his youth. He first settled in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, where he found employment, and for a time was a medicine salesman for a "pain expeller" company. Later he moved to Detroit, where he engaged in the sale of all kinds of "magic tricks"; he advertised and sold all kinds of nonexistent "world secrets", and even engaged in the sale of "devils."</p>
   <p>Juzes Vaikas relates the following interesting incidents: "One time a stylishly dressed Lithuanian came from Buffalo, New York to see Mockus in Detroit. Mockus asked him, 'What do you wish?' The immigrant answered: 'I heard that you are selling devils, and I would like to buy one.' After a short silence, Mockus said: 'You are too late, brother. I have already sold out all the American devils I had. However, I have ordered a trainload of devils from Germany; it will take at least two months before they arrive in the United States. But if you wish <pb facs="5423970_1_0553.jpg" n="4"/>to wait that long, you can leave a deposit, go home, and when the devils arrive I will send you one.' The fool left twenty-five dollars as a deposit, and went back home to wait for the devil.</p>
   <p>"Another time, a man stole nine dollars from his wife, and came from Pittsburgh on a freight train to purchase some devils."</p>
   <p>When the business of selling devils suffered a relapse,Mr. Mockus began to conduct various lectures and discussions. In that manner he eventually developed into the "free-thinking," Reverend M. X. Mockus. If the story about Mockus in the Amerikos Lietuvis is true, it is certainly not surprising. The existence of all kinds of "priests" among Lithuanian-Americans is nothing new. But how can one explain the conduct of the Socialist newspapers which are publicizing Mockus' activities?</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Reverend Mockus died in the Oak Forest Home for the Aged, Chicago, in the latter part of 1939; his death received wide publicity in the Lithuanian-American press.]</p>
