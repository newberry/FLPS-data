   <p>It appears from all indications that the government of this country has no intention of withdrawing the American troops from Mexico. After it found an opportunity to place a foot in Mexico, the government does not wish to get out, although such action might cause a war between these two countries. Furthermore, the United States is not very anxious to avoid that war. She expects to subdue easily a small country like Mexico. Now that the European countries are engaged in war, there is no one to interfere with the United States and she can act with Mexico as she pleases.</p>
   <p>Almost all of the capitalistic newspapers are agitating for a war with Mexico. The workers, unfortunately, have submitted too much to the influence of that press and are unable to understand the Mexican situation from their own class viewpoint. They do not know that a war would be a harmful thing to them, and <pb facs="5423970_1_1230.jpg" n="2"/>that the annexation of Mexico would probably be a still more harmful thing to them. For that reason they are keeping silent. When the workers remain silent while the capitalists demand a war with Mexico, it is not at all surprising that the government is advancing and pursuing a policy of war.</p>
