   <p>Several items have been written about the Aurora Society's lectures which were given last winter. To all these lectures the admission was ten cents. The net profit was $29.70 for the Aurora students' fund. The first lecture was given by Dr. J. Kulis. To make the lecture clearer, Dr. Kulis illustrated it with pictures. These pictures cost eight dollars, but Dr. Kulis paid for them out of his own pocket. The financial condition of the Aurora Society is still weak; it will be a great loss to the Lithuanian students if the Society does not get help from the Lithuanian public.</p>
   <p>American Lithuanians! Do we have enough educated men? We see that we do not. It is known that where more educated men are found, workers have better living conditions. We have neglected to help our poor students because our attention has been turned to the revolution in Russia. At present the revolution has slowed down; therefore our attention again must be turned to the poor Lithuanian students' cause. We must help them in order to make the Lithuanian <pb facs="5423970_1_0089.jpg" n="2"/>intelligensia strong. These students after their graduation will deliver lectures to us and write articles and books for our benefit.</p>
