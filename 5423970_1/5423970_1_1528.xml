   <p>Mr. M. Zaldokas completed a course in architecture at the Armour Institute last week. He is probably the first Lithuanian architect in America. He was born in Smilgiu parish, Panevezys county, Lithuania, and emigrated to the United States fifteen years ago. He has been living in Chicago during all those fifteen years.</p>
   <p>Thanks to his thrift, and his industry as an ordinary carpenter, he was able to save enough money to finance his education. He attended Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana, for three years, and studied in the Armour Institute, Chicago, Illinois, for four years. He financed almost all of his education with his own funds.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zaldokas was among the leading students of his class. He was personally praised by the director of the Institute, and he Japanese student were honored as the two most brilliant students of the graduating class.</p>

   <p>While Mr. Zaldokas was attending the Institute, he drew quite a few plans for homes which were built by Chicago Lithuanians. He is now thirty-five years old.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Mr. Zaldokas was later the architect of the St. Casimir Academy building and the Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago, and the Liberty Hall building in Cicero, Illinois.]</p>
