   <p>That Lithuanians are in need of greater enlightenment is obvious. On the other hand very few realize the value of self improvement and advancement and helping others to do so. However, there are some people who understand and appreciate the nation's cultural advancement and are willing to help our young people who are interested in education.</p>
   <p>Recently during a birthday party celebration at I. Brusevicius a group of Lithuanians discussed the educational aspects of the Russian-Japanese war. They pointed out how the midget Japanese Empire, through the medium of civilization and patriotism, whipped the less civilized giant, the Russian Empire. In his discussion Mr. A. Buvainis made mention of the fact, that there are, however, some of our young people who are studying; and that some of our people are martyrs in Russia by virtue of the fact that they have attempted to revive the slumbering spirit for enlightenment. This is certainly evident for there are <pb facs="5423970_1_0095.jpg" n="2"/>Lithuanian students who become victims of the Ferocious Russian wolf, for trying to revive Lithuanian culture and demanding better conditions for Lithuanian people. Mr. Buvainis urged the members, who were present to contribute a few cents to the fund towards helping the Lithuanian students who are suffering from starvation and persecution in Russia. He also urged the people to help our students who are attending universities in the United States. He emphasized the statement by saying, that education must have first place in life. He asked the people not to forget our younger generation who are going to schools and colleges now; for they will be our future leaders, and we will be proud to have such leaders in our community. Their number may be very small, but at the present time we must encourage and help them as much as possible.</p>
   <p>The people at the celebration party were very much impressed and well pleased with Mr. Buvainis' short talk on education and its importance in life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0096.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All members present agreed to contribute to the Aurora Society Fund for Lithuanian students and the Lithuanian exiles in Russia.</p>
   <p>The money collected at the celebration amounted to $16.50. The sum was divided so that $10.00 was given to the Aurora Society Fund for poor students, and $6.50 for Lithuanian exiles in Russia.</p>
   <p>It is a great joy to see our people so interested and concerned about these matters. Even when they are at a friend's party, they do not forget to support their national needs.</p>
   <p>We regret to say that Lithuanians in other colonies do not take greater interest in education. Of course, we cannot blame them too much, because they were enslaved by Poland and Russia for many generations. Their cultural spirit has been destroyed because of the long years of oppressive rule under Poland and later under Russia. In fact, their cultural spirit was almost destroyed under the cruel political yoke which these countries imposed upon them.</p>
