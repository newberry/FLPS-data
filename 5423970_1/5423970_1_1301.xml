   <p>The most important question now before the American Labor (Communist) Party is the defense of the rights of aliens in America. The party has printed a large number of leaflets on that question for popular distribution throughout the United States. The Lithuanian section of the party has printed 20,000 of these leaflets in the Lithuanian language. A copy of this leaflet appears in this issue of the Vilnis. All Lithuanian organizations should order some of these leaflets and spread them among the Lithuanian workers. It is <pb facs="5423970_1_1302.jpg" n="2"/>very important to acquaint all workers with this great impending danger.</p>
   <p>Commissioner Curren has made the absurd announcement that in America there are 1,300,000 "undesirable aliens", who should be deported at once. It appears that the Congress is fully in favor of such deportations. A bill has been introduced in Congress to appropriate $1,000,000 to cover the expenses of deporting "undesirable aliens".</p>
   <p>The Johnson bill and other anti-alien bills are now being considered by our Congress in Washington, D. C. These bills aim to limit the rights of all aliens living in America. It is planned to register, photograph and take the finger-prints of all aliens, and keep them under constant surveillance as if they were criminals <pb facs="5423970_1_1303.jpg" n="3"/>out of jail on parole. Provision is also made, in the bills, for the black listing of aliens.</p>
   <p>The famous Aswell bill, introduced by Congressman Aswell of Louisiana, is unusually harsh and cruel. It empowers the police to hunt for alien workers anywhere and at any time; any worker, citizen or non-citizen, could be taken into custody and questioned to determine if he has registered or is required to register. The bill would empower the United States President to move alien workers from one part of the country to another, especially during labor strikes.</p>
   <p>For the slightest infraction of any provision of the infamous <pb facs="5423970_1_1304.jpg" n="4"/>Aswell bill, the government would have the power to imprison the accused alien and hold him for possible deportation. In this manner many aliens would be persecuted so severely that they would be forced to leave this country to seek peace and justice elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Now is the time for all of us to get busy. We must call mass meetings and adopt resolutions of protest. Now is also a good time to start forming defense organizations.</p>
   <p>In nearly every city in the United States mass meetings are being called to defend the rights of alien workers, These <pb facs="5423970_1_1305.jpg" n="5"/>mass meetings can accomplish great things if all workers and their organizations will give them their full support.</p>
