   <p>According to telegrams received yesterday, four cavalry units of the National Guards were hurriedly sent into the Pittsburgh area. The reason is that many big strikes are now in progress in that area and clashes have already taken place between strikers and strikebreakers. The police and state militia have already killed several workers and injured many others. But it appears that they are still unable to "establish order". For that reason the help of the National Guard was called.</p>
   <p>Now it is clear why the capitalists thirst so much for an increase of the United States Army. A larger army will increase the business of munition manufacturers; a large army can conquer foreign lands for the capitalists; but most important of all, a large army protects the capitalists against the "internal enemy".</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0409.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, as hard as the capitalists agitate for a larger army, the workers must fight just as hard against a larger army. The workers would be fools to allow their exploiters to prepare a bigger club over their heads.</p>
