   <p>Several times in Lietuva the appeal of our society Enlightenment was published, although the appeal to the Lithuanian women brought no results, being lost like an echo in the woods.</p>
   <p>Dear women friends! Do we not know the value of science? Is enlightenment not gracious to us? Why do we not make any effort to obtain education, why do we continue to embrace darkness? Let us take in our hands a book or newspaper, all good literature there is written for education, to enlighten our ignorant sisters, and this valuable work is done by men.</p>
   <p>It is time for the Lithuanian women to wake up, to take education, to show to the men that we women are just as good as any man.</p>
   <p>To uplift our ignorant sisters we have organized the women's society <pb facs="5423970_1_1445.jpg" n="2"/>Enlightenment. The aim of this society is to spread enlightenment, education, culture, etc., by reading scientific books and newspapers; to give lectures on various scientific and social problems. The Enlightenment Society's meeting will be held on Dec. 1, at 2 P. M., 869 33rd Place. All the Lithuanian women are invited to this meeting.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Seskiene.</p>
