   <p>Last week we advertised in American papers for a tract of land. Fourteen companies sent us maps from Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota and California.</p>
   <p>We think that Kansas, Nebraska or South Dakota, would be best for our colony because the land in those states is very fertile, close to railroads, large and small rivers, the fields are plain not hilly, and the prices are low.</p>
   <p>The prices in some states are from five to fifteen dollars per acre. In Kansas and South Dakota from seven to eight dollars per acre. Down payment is one dollar per acre, balance on ten year installment plan.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1498.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On October the 10th there will be a railroad excursion, the fare will be paid one half. If you buy land the company will refund your railroad expenses.</p>
   <p>We have twenty families who are willing to join the Lithuanian colony. One, or three, men cannot spend their own money for such a trip. We must raise money for traveling expenses. We have twenty families, let each family donate three dollars for that purpose. Those families must pick up a guide who knows the quality of farm land. Let those men go ahead to investigate and find the best place suitable for the Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>We must not delay as the price of farm land will go up.</p>
