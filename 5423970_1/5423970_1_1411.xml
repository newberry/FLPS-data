   <p>(Editorial): p. 2... The congress in Washington rejected a bill which was to encourage the legislatures of the individual states to confer the electoral franchise upon women. It was an attempt to amend the United States constitution. But in order to make an amendment to the constitution it must be approved at least by a two thirds vote of congress; whereas, this bill failed to receive even half the votes. There were 204 negative votes and only 174 affirmative votes. Universal Suffrage advocates thereby suffered a big set back, although they are unwilling to admit defeat. They state that the results of the congressional vote were much better than they had anticipated. But that is an old story: The vanquished always make an attempt to cover up their defeat.</p>
   <p>The woman's suffrage bill was rejected for a number of reasons, which can be grouped into two divisions. First, it was opposed as a matter of principle by those who do not wish to see women participate politically in the affairs of the nation. Second, the bill was opposed by a large group of representatives who, while not opposed to woman suffrage, do not want the national government <pb facs="5423970_1_1412.jpg" n="2"/>to meddle with the subject; in their minds, the question must be left to the individual states for solution.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the decision of congress is bad. The Democrats, who vigorously defend state rights and desire to abridge the powers of congress, do not understand this modern age. The individual states have long ceased to exist as self-governing units. As time marches on, the states increasingly become mere administrative units of our single nation, corresponding to counties in the states. Of course, states must retain the right to regulate certain matters pertaining to their own needs - but not such matters as Woman Suffrage. If it is unfair to keep women in political slavery in one state then it also must be unfair in all other states. Such an important matter should be uniformly regulated throughout the entire nation.</p>
   <p>But is there any sound foundation for the belief that suffrage to women is unnecessary? In our opinion, such a belief contradicts the spirit of modern times. Is it not a fact that the woman of today participates expensively in <pb facs="5423970_1_1413.jpg" n="3"/>industry and commerce? Many women own and control various industrial and business enterprises; and many more are employed in such establishments. Therefore, if women are allowed to control wealth, hire workers and be hired as workers, then they should also be allowed to have a voice in the enactment of laws that regulate such matters. They should be permitted to occupy governmental offices and assist in the enforcement of those laws. Otherwise how can women defend their interests?</p>
   <p>It is true that women everywhere are inhumanly exploited. However, it is enough to say that in factories and department stores women and girls earn only about three or four dollars per week. Is not that frightful? Can anyone be surprised at the fact that thousands of your women and girls, becoming tired of hard work at starvation wages,go astray and disappear into the dark depths of white slavery.</p>
   <p>It is significant that laws made by men, government run by men, and a public ruled by men, are not interested in improving the frightful economic conditions of the working girl or woman. If women were given an opportunity to participate in the <pb facs="5423970_1_1414.jpg" n="4"/>regulation of the affairs of the nation, they would not look upon these matters so lightly.</p>
   <p>Women must be given the advantage of the vote to select law makers, court judges, and other public officials. They need an opportunity to defend themselves against their exploiters. They cannot depend upon their exploiters to improve their economic conditions, because employers profit by exploiters them.</p>
   <p>In order to reach that goal, however, it will be necessary for women to find more supporters for their cause. They will not always find them among their own sex. A capitalist woman is no better than a capitalist man, for both are equally interested in hiring women at lower wages; and both are equally opposed to granting women the advantage of the vote with which to improve heir standard of living.</p>
   <p>Real, faithful supporters of woman's rights are the working people, but, of course, only the class conscious workers - not those who kiss the hands of the capitalists.</p>
