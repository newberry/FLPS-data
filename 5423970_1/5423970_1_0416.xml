<title level="a">THE CHICAGO TAILORS' STRIKE</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Adam Norkus</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>There is a lot of discussion today about the strike of the Chicago tailors and its results. Some of the tailors say that they will never go out on strike again in any manner because they could never again endure such hardship, poverty, and privation as they have been forced to suffer during past strikes. "We would rather be scabs!" they say. Others are doubtful, but the great majority are of the opinion that a strike is unavoidable in the near future because, as everyone knows, the working conditions of the tailors at this time are much worse than they were immediately after the last strike.</p>
   <p>Glancing at the lives of the Chicago tailors today, we see that they are having difficulties in supporting themselves and their families. And conditions are continually growing worse.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0417.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Today, the strike is the weapon by which the workers free themselves of slavery and poverty. The workers are against strikes because they are aware of the attendant hardships. But when it is apparent that the fathers of those families must be slaves, and for that slavery receive a wage insufficient to purchase food, clothing, and other necessities of life, then the workers and their families want to strike.</p>
   <p>The bosses and the foremen of their shops tell us that the workers, and especially their families, oppose strikes. Yes, but who does approve of strikes? If nobody wanted them, they could not take place. The reason for the bosses' claims is that it is important for the capitalists to have the sympathy of the public. In order to gain this sympathy they and their servants tell the public through their newspapers that the living conditions of the employees are so good that they would never strike if there were no agitators. "Don't you see how good it is for the workers?" the capitalists ask.</p>
   <p>However, the people of Chicago are aware that the demands of the workers are <pb facs="5423970_1_0418.jpg" n="3"/>just. They sympathize with the workers and blame the companies which have failed to keep their promises in regard to the losses and the hardships which must be suffered during a strike. That is fine. Let the strikes force the public to think a little, so that it will come to realize that the present arrangement has outlived its usefulness, and that its continuance forces new hardships on the public. This will benefit the workers.</p>
   <p>The workers cannot refrain from striking for still another reason. The trusts, growing more powerful with time, take over a branch of some industry and immediately raise the prices of its manufactured products. But, from time to time, they lower the wages of the workers. Such conditions cause strikes--such gigantic strikes that they are felt by people who stand remote from the workers. Now, if the workers refrained from striking, what would be left for them to do? The capitalists would exploit them even more ruthlessly.</p>
   <p>The Chicago garment workers are no different from other workers. Strikes <pb facs="5423970_1_0419.jpg" n="4"/>mitigate the difficulties of the battle of the future for the tailors as well as for other workers. Employers, seeing their employees' determination to defend their rights, remembering strikes won by the employees in the past, and, above all, estimating their own losses during a strike, often grant their employees' demands without a strike. The more often and the longer the employees had been on strike, and the more organized they are, the better are the chances of their demands being granted without a strike. In places where the workers had not often been out on strike, the employers fight harder, in order to destroy the urge to strike in the future. But, having struck once or twice before, even though unsuccessfully, the workers have a far better chance of winning the third strike in a much shorter period of time.</p>
   <p>We are told that we must not strike. But today, as I have said before, the worker can get along without a strike no more than he can get along without bread or clothing. Because of this, every intelligent and conscientious person should use his knowledge and talent in persuading the scabbing strikebreakers to cease their destructive practice.</p>
