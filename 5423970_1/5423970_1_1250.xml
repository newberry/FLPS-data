   <p>The United States Senate has suggested that a day be established for the purpose of making a collection for Jewish war sufferers. The President has given his approval and January 23 has been set aside for that purpose. All over the United States, collections will be made for the benefit of the Jews.</p>
   <p>This circumstance unwillingly reminds us of the fate of Lithuania. Almost every nation has found a response in the generous heart of Uncle Sam. America has helped Belgium, Poland, Serbia and Armenia, and now is ready to help the Jews. Up to the present time Lithuania--a nation no less a victim of the ravages of war than the other countries--remains unknown to Americans. We cannot blame them for that. They know nothing about Lithuania. There is no one in the United States Senate, Congress, or on the President's staff to defend Lithuania. There is no one who might call attention to this unfortunate nation, Lithuania. This proves once more how beneficial it would be for us if we were <pb facs="5423970_1_1251.jpg" n="2"/>a political force in this country. Up to the present time we have paid very little attention to the politics of this country; we have wasted too much time [in thinking about] how conditions should be in Lithuania. By so doing, we have passed up the opportunity of participating in the political activity of this country which would benefit us, both in America and in Lithuania.</p>
