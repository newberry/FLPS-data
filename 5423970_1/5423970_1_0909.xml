<title level="a">THE ELECTION OF JUDGES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>This year, on the 1st day of June, will be the election day of judges. There will be fourteen judges elected to the Circuit and to the Superior courts. The judges are elected by the vote of the people, as are the other officials, the mayor and the aldermen. The election day will be on Monday, June 1, 1903. The election booths will be open from 6 A. M. to 4 P. M.</p>
   <p>All Lithuanians who have citizenship papers must vote on that day in order to elect honest judges. The rich or poor, willingly or unwillingly, sometimes are forced to go to the courts. Therefore, it is our duty to see that good and honest judges are elected. Such a man could fulfill his duty as an honest and impartial judge.</p>
   <p>On the Republican ticket, besides all others, are two very good candidates <pb facs="5423970_1_0910.jpg" n="2"/>for whom the Lithuanians should vote. If they are elected we will have practical and honest judges who will decide our cases in an honest way.</p>
   <p>One of the candidates for judge is W. S. Elliot, Jr., the same lawyer who defended the publisher and the editor of Lietuva when Rev. Krawczunas sued them. Whoever read the book, The History of Chicago Lithuanians, knows who lawyer Elliot is and understands his education and ability. Such judges we need, so trials always will be honestly decided.</p>
   <p>The second candidate is Andrew J. Hirschl of the well known firm of lawyers, Rosenthal, Kurtz and Hirschl.</p>
