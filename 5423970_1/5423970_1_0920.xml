   <p>Present day Lithuanians seem to forget that in unity there is strength. An example of this is observed every week by the writer of this column. It seems that every time some active Lithuanian political worker gets a well-deserved job, foreign sources voice their opposition by protesting against the appointment.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Democratic League of Cook County is today the only organization that can rightfully boast of being able to <pb facs="5423970_1_0921.jpg" n="2"/>attract the Lithuanians to its political and social functions. This fact is shown by the large attendance last year at an Easter dance, a picnic, and several rallies. Much of this success is due to the splendid cooperation of a few individuals. Think what could be done if ward organizations would work together instead of individually.</p>
   <p>On Easter Sunday, March 28, the League will sponsor a Victory Dance, at the Lithuanian Auditorium, in honor of Hon. John Zuris, Judge of the Municipal Court. Ward organizations have pledged full cooperation and this is all what is needed to make this affair a huge success. Let us all do our bit, and we will have much more in common.</p>
   <p>Judge Zuris is not only making history on the bench for the Lithuanians <pb facs="5423970_1_0922.jpg" n="3"/>but has also started with flying colors to make a splendid judicial record.</p>
   <p>Paul Saltimieras, of the 13th ward, second vice-president of the Lithuanian Democratic League, is enjoying a well-earned new appointment as Golf and Beach Director for the Chicago Park District.</p>
   <p>Theodore S. Thurston, Vincent Stulpinas, Joseph Pentis, and <pb facs="5423970_1_0923.jpg" n="4"/>Victor Balanda seem to have the situation well in hand in the 11th ward. It is a pleasure to see this quartette doing their stuff for the benefit of all concerned in the 11th ward's Lithuanian Democratic Organization.</p>
   <p>Stankus, of the 21st ward, and Petreika, of the 9th ward, expect to have their respective organizations join the League at the next meeting. This means devotion, sacrifice, and hard work on the part of these four people for the sake of organizing the Lithuanians in the above mentioned communities. They are to be congratulated on their fine work.</p>
