   <p>Industrial unionists (or syndicalists, as they are called in France) are calling for "direct action". What does this term "direct action" mean? It is action which is direct or immediate in two ways: first, with respect to place or scene; and second, with respect to method or means.</p>
   <p>The industrial unionists (the syndicalists, a word derived from the French syndicat, meaning a union or alliance) point out that capitalists exploit workers at their place of employment--in the factories, shops, mines, etc. Therefore, they say that the workers should fight this exploitation right on the scene, in their places of employment, in order to win shorter hours, higher pay, better working conditions, and, finally, complete freedom from exploitation.</p>
   <p>To achieve all this, the syndicalists advise the workers to organize into unions, to go out on strike, to commit sabotage, etc. They say that the workers <pb facs="5423970_1_0811.jpg" n="2"/>themselves must conduct this fight; the masses of the workers must oppose the capitalists. Not the representatives of the workers' political parties, but the exploited workers themselves must lead the fight--the exploited against the exploiters.</p>
   <p>Political action, according to the syndicalists, is not direct, and therefore should be ignored. They believe that the participation of the workers in a political fight is not only unproductive, but is even harmful. The most important center of political action is the parliament, where a small group of elected people represent the interests of the masses. But, the syndicalists claim, the masses cannot depend on these people. It is not difficult for the capitalists to bribe a representative of the workers (as though union officials could not be bribed), and, according to the syndicalists, the workers' representative can then use his membership in a legislative body to harm the workers.</p>
   <p>In addition, the syndicalists look with distrust upon parliaments, courts, administrative and other governmental agencies. They conclude that such agencies have been established only to harm the working people. The syndicalists want <pb facs="5423970_1_0812.jpg" n="3"/>the whole power of the state and its agencies to disappear; they believe that the people should be organized only for economic purposes (the production and distribution of wealth).</p>
   <p>While engaged in the attempt to abolish the state (political organization), the syndicalists think that they must belittle everything that has any connection at all with the state. If the parliament is unnecessary, if the officials, courts, police, and other such institutions are unnecessary, then, according to the syndicalists, we should have nothing to do with them; we should not elect people to Congress, we should not vote for presidents, judges, etc. Whoever participates in such things presumably acknowledges their necessity, lends them his support, and thus postpones the day when they will have to disappear from the scene. A political leader, according to the syndicalists, is a deceiver of the people, and a supporter of a system which exploits the workers.</p>
   <p>As we can see from this brief summary of the theories of the syndicalists, they are similar in many respects to the socialist theories. People who are not very <pb facs="5423970_1_0813.jpg" n="4"/>enlightened (for example, our clerical leaders), are not able to find any difference between socialist and syndicalist theory and, therefore, often heap the sins of the syndicalists on the heads of the socialists.</p>
   <p>The similarity between syndicalism and socialism derives from the fact that the syndicalists borrowed many ideas from socialist theory. The syndicalists took from the socialists the theory of class differences and the class struggle; they took from the socialists the truth pointed out by Marx: that the worker is exploited in his place of employment (whereas he creates more wealth for the capitalists than he receives in wages); they took, finally, the truth proved by Marx and Engels that the capitalists are using the organs of the state to enslave the workers.</p>
   <p>But to these few socialist theories, the syndicalists added a few anarchist ideas. From two theories, which are opposed to each other, they attempted to make one. From the anarchists, the syndicalists borrowed their ideas on the nonnecessity of the state and of political organization. The anarchists do not understand the relation between economics and politics. They think that <pb facs="5423970_1_0814.jpg" n="5"/>Therefore, when exploitation is destroyed, government and enslavement will lose their meaning and will disappear. In other words, the state will disappear as an instrument of government and enslavement, and a new organization of the people will replace it in an entirely different form.</p>
   <p>But as long as exploitation exists in the economic relations of the people (in the system of production and distribution), the state cannot disappear. As long as exploitation flourishes, the state will grow. The power of the state is gigantic, and it is increasing constantly. The actions of the state and its influence can be felt in all phases of the lives of the people. It can give the people a greater or less degree of freedom; it can promote or hamper education; it can confer great material benefits upon the people (as it does upon the capitalists by helping them to exploit the workers); or it can impose economic hardships (by tariffs, taxes, etc.) It has the very lives of the people in its hands, and can send them to their death in war, etc.</p>
   <p>As we can see, the state, even though it is a product of the economic life, exerts the greatest influence upon the economic structure. It is so closely <pb facs="5423970_1_0815.jpg" n="6"/>related to the economy [of the state] that every major change in that economy is felt by the state, and every major change in the state calls for certain changes in the economic life of the people. The intimate relation between the state and the economic life of the state becomes even more apparent during the struggle of the working class against the capitalist class. That struggle cannot be purely political, neither can it be purely economic. A purely economic class struggle is nonsense--an apparition which haunts the minds of the syndicalists. Every class struggle is a political struggle, i. e., it is a fight for or against exploitation, and, at the same time, for or against enslavement imposed with the assistance of the agencies of the state.</p>
   <p>To this we must also add that not only does the state exert its influence on the economic life of the people, but that it is at the same time a strong economic organization in itself. The state controls considerable wealth (land, forests, water, etc.), and a portion of the means of production. It owns factories, post offices, and other establishments where workers are employed; in many countries the state controls the telegraph and transportation facilities, mines, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0816.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The state is a permanent and constantly growing "employer". Therefore, to abstain from political action means not only to give up the control of all those facilities regulated or controlled by the state, but also to sacrifice thousands of workers who work for the state to the will of the capitalists.</p>
   <p>"Direct action" is not bad in itself. Strikes, unions, and other methods of waging an economic war are recommended by the socialists also. But that action must not ignore the workers' political struggle, and must not be opposed to it. It should go hand in hand with that struggle.</p>
   <p>Not only should the workers carry on their fight in the places where they are being exploited; they should also wage the fight in the state and its various agencies, where the capitalists are forging the chains of slavery. In this instance, political action is direct action aimed at the capitalist class, just as strikes are direct action against the exploitation of the workers in the factories.</p>
