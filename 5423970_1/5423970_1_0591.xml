   <p>The needs of Chicago Lithuanians are manifold: We need more education, greater ability to understand and distinguish bad from good, and a Lithuanian educational institution. However, it is of little value to enumerate all our needs when we have neither enough desire nor the necessary means to fulfill them. Above everything else we Lithuanians of Chicago should strive to build a hall or auditorium for our conventions, meetings orations, concerts, theatrical presentations, etc. The fact that our population and public activities in Chicago are rapidly increasing should convince every Lithuanian that we are badly in need of a hall of our own. Therefore, all Lithuanians should join in a movement to realize this need.</p>
   <p>A hall is necessary for all public affairs, such as theatrical presentations, conventions, commemorations, lectures, or public speaking programs. It is true that we have a number of church halls, and there is a small hall attached to almost every Lithuanian saloon. However, these halls are not suitable for all our affairs; they are suitable <pb facs="5423970_1_0592.jpg" n="2"/>for ordinary society meetings, but not for concerts, theatrical presentations, or other large public gatherings.</p>
   <p>There are about sixty various Lithuanian societies in Chicago at the present time; every society holds regular meetings, and every society needs a hall in which to hold its meetings. We have become so accustomed to holding meetings in saloon halls that we hardly notice the deplorable consequences that follow from our association with such demoralizing places; a suitable hall of our own would abolish this disgraceful situation. Furthermore, our young people do not have suitable quarters for recreational or other activities; they are forced to go to other nationalities and expose themselves to the dangers of denationalization. A hall of our own would correct this deplorable situation.</p>
   <p>Just think of it: There are 50,000 Lithuanians in Chicago, and we do not have even one public (common) institution about which we could brag to other Lithuanian colonies in America! The Lithuanian colonies of Baltimore, Brooklyn, <pb facs="5423970_1_0593.jpg" n="3"/>Philadelphia, Waterbury (Conn.), and other smaller colonies have their own community halls; then why can't we have one? All we have to do is to make up our minds and we shall have one. If we invest only one dollar for every Lithuanian in Chicago, then we would have a sum of $50,000, which is enough to pay for the cost of a large, well-equipped and beautiful hall.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us not wait for some mysterious benefactor, let us not rely upon foreigners to supply our needs, because they are concerned only about themselves. It is about time we ceased enriching foreigners by renting their halls. Chicago Lithuanians, especially our young people, are presenting theatricals almost every week. These activities of our people are very praiseworthy; we must help them and encourage them. They are forced to carry on these activities under very difficult and unfavorable conditions, especially when theatricals are presented in the small halls attached to Lithuanian saloons. It is not at all surprising that many of our theatrical performances are failures; our actors and actresses are forced to suffer so many inconveniences <pb facs="5423970_1_0594.jpg" n="4"/>that they are thoroughly exhausted and nervous long before they appear on the stage. These deplorable conditions would not exist if we had a hall of our own.</p>
   <p>Many more reasons can be pointed out to show why we need a hall of our own. However, the above reasons ought to suffice for the time being. I believe that many will ask the question: How, and how soon, can we acquire a national community hall of our own in Chicago? That question is easy to answer. However, I will postpone the answer to this question until a later time. At present it would be very interesting to hear the opinions of our people on this matter. If a sufficient number of supporters of this proposal are found then it will be possible to call a public meeting and make plans for its realization.</p>
