   <p>Nowhere in the world can one obtain education so easily as in America; if one is uneducated in this country, the fault is his own. The schools are open to everyone.</p>
   <p>The elementary schools, the high schools, the universities, are supported by the government. There is no tuition to pay. And in addition to the schools maintained by the government, there are many other private schools - colleges, institutions, academies, manual training schools, universities, trade schools, etc. Furthermore, there are evening schools, from the elementary grades to university, and a variety of trade schools.</p>
   <p>Those, who can not for various reasons attend the above mentioned schools, can take courses from correspondence schools, benefitting greatly thereby. For those who can not make use of the above named sources of education, there are libraries with books on various scientific subjects and literature, and all this is free to everybody. One can read newspapers and magazines at the library, or subscribe for same. The subscription price for magazines is low. Therefore, a man can obtain education free or at small expense in this country.</p>

   <p>Most of the Lithuanians who came to this country are without education. You have a great opportunity to get education anyway or anywhere you want it. If you can not get education through the above mentioned sources, there are various organizations and societies giving lectures on various subjects.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians should not think that they are too old to attend schools, or study in libraries, or at home; it is never too late to get an education. Spend only one hour a day on studies; it will make 365 hours per year devoted to education. Two hours per day would make 730 hours per year. You do not realize what progress could be made by devoting those hours to your education.</p>
   <p>By having more enlightened and educated Lithuanians, we could organize societies, clubs, libraries; arrange lectures on various scientific subjects and political problems; and hold various discussions on current events and world problems. And we, Lithuanians, could establish our own schools to educate ourselves and our children. In this country we have opportunity, but we do not make use of it. In our fatherland we were persecuted and oppressed, in this country we are free.</p>
