   <p>p. 3... The Lithuanian Business Association of Kensington held its annual meeting Jan. 2 at the Shedwell Hall, Kensington, Ill. This association owns and operates a general food market in Kensington. It was opened for business five years ago. Shares in the market have been popularly subscribed by a large number of Lithuanians living in Kensington, Ill.</p>
   <p>The annual business statement showed that the market did about $30,000 worth of business during the past year. In spite of the marked decrease in business turnover, due to hard times, many debts that were incurred in 1913 were paid off. When times were better this market had a yearly business turnover of $100,000.</p>
   <p>Credit for the success of the business goes to P. Almbrazinnas, financial secretary, and to the manager of the market.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, a collection was made for relief of war refugees in Lithuania. The collection netted $4.55.</p>
