   <p>Miss Ona (Anna) Endrikeviciute came from Lithuania last winter and made her home in Chicago with her brother-in-law, Mr. Ignatius Stankeviciu, who lives at 921 W. 33rd St. While she lived there she met John Pocius, with whom she fell in love within a short time. Cupid pierced with his arrow the hearts of the young couple, inflamed their love and they decided to get married as soon as possible. Her aunt and brother at the time lived at Geneva, Illinois. They were very ardent Catholics and hated all freethinkers and progressives who didn't go to the Catholic church on Sundays. Her brother, knowing that his brother-in-law, with whom his sister was living, is a freethinker and that the sister's boy friend held the same views, decided to break up his sister's marriage with a man who is not a Catholic. Her brother and aunt made every effort to prevent her marriage with a man who does not believe in God. They thought that by acting thus they were saving her soul. Her brother came to Chicago from Geneva to visit his brother-in-law and sister and persuaded the latter to go with him to Geneva, where the aunt lives. After a few months the brother-in-law came to Geneva to visit her. On his return trip from Geneva he brought Anna back to Chicago to live with his family. Her brother <pb facs="5423970_1_0276.jpg" n="2"/>in-law is well off and, moreover, his wife is a real sister to that girl. Nevertheless, her brother did not want her to live with her sister who was married to a man who is not Catholic. It was a disgraceful thing for his sister to live with Godless people who never go to church to pray for the salvation of their souls. Anna's brother told people that his brother-in-law had taken his sister back to Chicago, where she may be ruined morally. He hired a detective to bring his sister back to Geneva. The detective went to the brother-in-law's with local police to take Anna back to Geneva. The police and detective searched the brother-in-law's house, but she was not at home at that time. After they left the house, her girl friend, Miss Ona Prenkaite, came to visit her. At the same time the police came back and found her in the house. They grabbed her without asking any questions and broght her to Geneva. The police, instead of taking the right Anna, took her girl friend. Brother and aunt both were amazed as they looked at the girl who was brought by the detective. They were in a daze and did not know what to do when they saw Miss Ona Prenkaite, the sister's girl friend.</p>
   <p>They sent a telegram immediately to the brother-in-law and demanded him <pb facs="5423970_1_0277.jpg" n="3"/>to return Ona (Anna) Endrikeviciute. They threatened to get a warrant for his arrest if she was not returned in a few days. It was a little too late to do anything because the girl was married in the meantime and her troubles were over.</p>
