   <p>During the Easter holiday on April 19, in Chicago, in memory of our great writer and editor of Lietuva, Mr. Sernas, there was organized under his name a musical fund. The purpose is to give help to those, who are seeking higher education in music. It is left to Mr. Sernas'own consideration to decide to whom help should be given. The treasurer of this musical fund is Dr. A. Rutkauskas. The trustees are B. Balevicia and J. Laukis. The donations to this musical fund will be announced in Leituva.</p>
   <p>The task of this musical fund is not as insignificant as some one may imagine. Without a nation, one way or the other, we could not live. If we were not Lithuanians, we would be members of some other nation. To be Lithuanians is more honorable than to belong to others, and we do not need to ask for proof. But the nation without the workers is dead. If the workers disappear, then we can say to our nation, "Rest eternally".</p>
   <p>Now then, he,who loves his nation as he loves himself, must see that the nation <pb facs="5423970_1_0127.jpg" n="2"/>should not lack good workers.</p>
   <p>At this time the Lithuanian nation feels that it lacks musical talents. We do not lack musical talents, but we do lack the power to support our musical talents. Therefore, the purpose of the Sernas Musical Fund is to help our musical talents. He, who donates, will do good to his nation.</p>
   <p>Send the money to the following address:</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Rutkauskas,</p>
   <p>Box 62,</p>
   <p>Grasselli, Ind.</p>
