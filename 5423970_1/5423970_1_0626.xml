   <p>The Polish clergy Resurrectionist newspaper Dziennik Chicagoski, (The Daily Chicagoan), in No. 28 published an article, "Unity in the Civilized World," where it gives a review of the prohibition of the Lithuanian press in Russia, the history and the results of the prohibition of the press; speaks of the exhibit of the Lithuanian publications at the Paris exhibition. There is nothing of importance in that article. We should not forget that the Dziennik Chicagoski and all the Polish clergy, whom they represent, are not in favor of separating Lithuanians from the Poles, because by separating the Lithuanians from the Poles, the Polish priest would have no chance to exploit the Lithuanians. The Polish priests' newspaper, in ending the article, says: "Perhaps on account of the prohibition of Lithuanian press, many Lithuanians are leaning towards the Socialists, and some of the Poles are learning the Lithuanian language and using it as their native language."</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0627.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>About such Poles we have never heard that they would become users of the Lithuanian language, and we are sure that even the Dziennik Chicagoski never heard (of them). This newspaper very rarely replies to the Lithuanians, but when it replies then it cannot state anything without lies.</p>
   <p>The Russian newspaper Svoboda (Freedom), published at Olyphant, Pa., in No. 5 published an article under the headline, "Litovci a Rusini," (The Lithuanians and Russians), by Mr. Levkov. The writer states the truth about the oppression of the Lithuanians in Russia, about the Lithuanian activity in the United States and in Prussia. He finds that the Lithuanian activity in the United States is more important than that of the Russians; mentions the prohibition of the Lithuanian press and the exhibit of the Lithuanian press at the Paris world exhibition, <pb facs="5423970_1_0628.jpg" n="3"/>and about the number of books published abroad and in this country. Mr. Levkov ends his writing with the following words: "The Lithuanian nation consisted of farmers from its earlier period and its history is related to the Russian. The Lithuanians and the Russians in olden times have had one Lithuanian-Russian kingdom, which later came under the rule of Poland, the Lithuanians and the Russians were then enslaved. After the collapse of Poland, the Lithuanians were divided by Russia and Germany, and the Ruthenian by Russia and Austria. The Russian government persecuted and oppressed both the Lithuanians and the Ruthenians, and their people exiled to Siberia. Under the rule of the foreign government, the Lithuanians and the Ruthenians forgot their mutuality and lost their friendship. But the evil fate brought us to America and we have met each other again. With us and the Lithuanians there is the same suffering. On many problems we could work together. The activity of the Lithuanian patriots in America can be as an example to the Ruthenes. The Lithuanians have no Hungarian <pb facs="5423970_1_0629.jpg" n="4"/>Prussian, nor tsarist Slavonian-Russian Lithuanians, as there are among the Ruthenes. With them be a Lithuanian, or go away."</p>
   <p>In every word in this Rusinian article, there is more love and favor toward the Lithuanians than in all the lies of the Polish clerical newspapers.</p>
