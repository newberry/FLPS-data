   <p>We are now about to push the old year aside and greet a new but unknown year. We are not sorry to see the old year of 1915 go by, because from nearly all angles that year was not good to the Lithuanian people. Across the ocean, Lithuania, our fatherland, is beset with the greatest misfortune in his history; the land of our fathers is being used as a battlefield of the European war.</p>
   <p>Here, in America, the old year has placed upon Lithuanian-Americans a stigma that will be very hard to remove. The former unity of the Lithuanian-Americans has been seriously impaired; endless quarrels and disputes now prevail among our people. It is true, however, that during the past year Lithuanian-Americans have accomplished some good: We raised a fairly large sum of money for the relief of our war-stricken brothers and sisters in Lithuania; we have <pb facs="5423970_1_0546.jpg" n="2"/>taken steps to aid our fatherland in regaining his political freedom; and we made several attempts to improve our status here in America. However, all these lofty deeds were swamped by a sea of disunity and partisan hatreds that flooded our people in America.</p>
   <p>We hope that all quarrels and disputes among our people will vanish with the old year and never return again! We are not a bit sorry for the old year. We are pleased with the opportunity to accompany the old year to the graveyard. We hope that the new year will be a better and happier year for Lithuanians in Europe and America, and for all mankind.</p>
