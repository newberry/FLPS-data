   <p>Last Saturday evening the funeral of John Barleycorn took place very peacefully. On that day the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibiting the sale and manufacture of intoxicating drinks, came into effect. At the last hour the last drop of whiskey was poured, and it will not be poured any more.</p>
   <p>"A muzhik will not make the sign of the cross unless it thunders," says a Russian proverb. In other words one does not learn how to fight a danger until he comes face to face with it. For several thousands of years mankind has been tortured by whiskey. A great calamity, the present world war, was necessary to bring the people to their senses and make them recognize the harm of whiskey.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0212.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Russia was the first to enact a prohibition law; France prohibited the use of intoxicating liquors for the duration of the war; England also restricted the use of intoxicating liquors; and Uncle Sam dug a grave last Saturday and buried Mr. John Barleycorn. No one shed any tears at the funeral. Oceans of tears had previously been shed on account of it. "Requiescat In Pace!" Rest in peace and do not return!</p>
