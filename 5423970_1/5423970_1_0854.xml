   <p>Our people in Chicago and other parts of the United States have supported many worthy causes, such as the Paris Exposition, the relief for political prisoners, and the uprising in Russia. Now we are supporting the plan to publish the literary works of Kudirka; we are supporting a number of newspapers and periodicals; and we are building and maintaining many churches. During the past twenty-five years we have contributed large sums of money for the above causes, and these contributions were made almost entirely by members of the working class.</p>
   <p>This year we are making preparations to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Dr. Vincas Kudirka, world-famous Lithuanian writer and patriot, who was born December 31, 1858 and died November 16, 1899. However, this year marks a still greater event - the twenty-fifty anniversary of the founding of the first Lithuanian newspaper, the Ausra (The Dawn), <pb facs="5423970_1_0855.jpg" n="2"/>which was established in Tilsit, Prussian Lithuania, by Dr. John Pasanias and Dr. John Sliupas. We must not forget these Lithuanian patriots, especially Dr. Sliupas, who is also credited with many important achievements among the Lithuanians in America. He was the first to segregate the Lithuanians from the Poles in America: he was the first to organize and found the Lithuanians Alliance of America; and he was the first to start the working class movement among Lithuanian-Americans. Dr. Sliupas also played an important role in the lawsuit between the Lietuva and Rev. Kraucuanas, pastor of St. George's Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Therefore, while honoring Kudirka and other departed Lithuanian heroes, let us also honor our living heroes.</p>
