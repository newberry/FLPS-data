   <p>As time passes on humanity progresses and the women, too, do not want to fall behind. They are also asserting their rights and seeking justice in all essential matters concerning themselves.</p>
   <p>I shall not dwell on women of the so-called higher class, for they are too much pampered and accustomed to luxury. I shall speak about the women of the working class, who are almost slaves in this country. Husband, son and wife are unmercifully oppressed by the capitalists. The worker's wife is more oppressed than the worker, her husband. The women are so degraded that when one of them asks for a better remuneration, the answer she gets is, "Your place is in the kitchen at the stove". She works from early in the morning until late at night. She has no time to take proper care of herself, or of her children. The women are prevented from taking part in political activity. The capitalists know that they can not bribe women voters with cigars and glasses of beer, as they bribe the men. For this reason, the capitalistic politicians keep the women down and away from politics.</p>
   <p>Many progressive women are fighting for equal rights with men; so we, Lithuanian <pb facs="5423970_1_1437.jpg" n="2"/>women, must not fall behind. We must belong to organizations where we can get benefits for ourselves.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we, Lithuanian women, have organized a society under the name of "Enlightenment". At every meeting we have lectures on women's problems. At the last meeting, Miss S. A. Rutkauskas, a student of medicine, delivered a very good lecture. At the coming meeting, Miss M. Horodeckas will lecture on "The Culture of Women in Ancient Times". This lecture will be held May 3rd at 1 P.M., at 869 - 33rd Place.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Damijonaitiene.</p>
