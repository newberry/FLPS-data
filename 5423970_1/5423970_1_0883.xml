   <p>The Society of St. Izidor held a celebration on May 1st, the third year of its existence. There were speeches, songs and declamations. Such an event the South Chicago Lithuanians never had seen or heard before.</p>
   <p>The Americans have considered the Lithuanians as the lowest class of people, similar to the Poles, but now when they saw the orderly Lithuanian parade on the streets, they were convinced that the Lithuanians are different from the Poles.</p>
   <p>After the parade speeches were made. The first speaker was the president of the society, Mr. J. Baukus. He opened the meeting and explained the purpose of the celebration. Then Mr. Petrosius spoke, praising the St. Izidor Society for celebrating such an important day as the first day of May. He condemned the St. Joseph Society because it called the <pb facs="5423970_1_0884.jpg" n="2"/>St. Izidor Society as nationalist, not holy. Even though our society has the holy name of St. Izidor, the speaker condemned the Lithuanian degenerates and asked for unity. "Lithuanians must unite," he said, "they must buy from our Lithuanian business establishments in order to increase and uplift Lithuanian business." Then the Providence of God choir, under the direction of the organist A. Limontas, sang the following songs: "The Healthy and Fortunate Day has Cleared Up," "On the Edge of the Sea," "Farewell, Lithuania," "Long Live Lithuania," "The Longest Years." They sang well. Declamations were recited by two small girls, sisters. Little Sophy Laukiute recited the poem, "Forward, Brother Friend," and Anna Laukiute recited, "Not He That is so Great." These two little girls made the greatest impression because such declamations had not been heard before in this place, and the little girls spoke so beautifully from their hearts with such perfect expression.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Laukis delivered a speech on the importance of the 1st of May. This day is celebrated by workers all over the world. The <pb facs="5423970_1_0885.jpg" n="3"/>speaker said that it is not enough to have the Lithuanian Alliance of America, the workers should have their own political organization, the Socialist Party organization which is the only workers' party that fights against the oppressors. The workers must organize local branches of the Socialist Party, etc. There had been organized a Lithuanian Socialist branch, but the Lithuanians did not understand its benefits. The Lithuanian Socialist branch was finally dissolved.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Medelis spoke of the exile of our brothers to Siberia for Lithuanianism. He said that we must help these martyrs. Later he mentioned the poor Lithuanian students. The nation cannot make progress without its own scientists and educators. We must help the students, too. The sum collected was $2.20, which was divided as follows: $1 for the martyrs; $1 for the Aurora's students' fund; and 20 cents for the writer Vistalius. Between the speeches were songs and declamations. The Lithuanian musicians played beautiful melodies.</p>
