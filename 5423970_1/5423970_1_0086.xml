   <p>When I have seen the advertisement that the Lithuanian students from Valparaiso University will present a play on May 19, I have decided to say a few words to the Chicago Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Every nation that wants to live must go forward on the progressive and cultural road. Progress among nations is forced by the struggle for existence. For example, take Japan when she forsaw the inevitable struggle with Russia, Japan at once took the task to bring up the intelligensia and in a few years the Japanese left the Russian government behind in civilization and education. Before the Russo-Japanese war, American universities were packed with Japanese students. Thousands of Japanese students were studying the American culture, and after graduation, went back to Japan in order to give the fruit of culture to their country-men. And as soon as the Russo-Japanese war started the Japanese students, like one man, left the American Universities and went back to their fatherland Japan to help their government to win the war against Russia. Japan won the war, because she was more cultured and had more educated people than Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0087.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Lithuanians, in order to make our nation known among other nations, must take care of our students. We ought to be proud that the Lithuanian students are presenting the theatrical spectacle, our duty is to help them by attending en mass. Our students are poor, they are working and attending the schools, so our duty is to help them. We Lithuanians must have more educated, professional people, then we can show to the world that we are just as good as any other people or nation in the world.</p>
