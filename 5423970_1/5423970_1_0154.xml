  <body>
   <p>Our Lithuanian parish school has started its course. How many children were accepted by the school we do not know. Our reproof of the Polish nuns who do not know Lithuanian, whom the priest had brought to teach the Lithuanian children, did not go without results. Only one Polish nun is left as supervisor, and she, as we have learned, knows some Lithuanian. The other Sisters that were brought to the school are Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>How much Lithuanian they know we do not know, although they are better than the previous Polish nuns.</p>
   <p>We believe that our priest will understand that to teach the Lithuanian children in the school, it is not enough to speak Lithuanian, but one must know the language and the grammar well. The priest, then, may understand that when we demand the parish accounting, and that the control of the parish treasury should not be by the priest alone, that we <pb facs="5423970_1_0155.jpg" n="2"/>are doing this for the benefit of the priest. We desire to bring back the people's confidence in the priest. We want the priest to understand that the money donated for the benefit of the parish should not be lost somewhere. We hope the priest will understand now that the fight we have started against him is not for the benefit of the people alone, but for the good of the church as well.</p>
