   <p>Recently there was incorporated a Lithuanian organization under the name of "Bridgeport Clothing Company", with a capital of $10,000. The purpose of this organization is to buy a lot on which to erect a building, and to establish a department store, the main portion of which will be used for clothing. Of this company or society and Lithuanian, man, woman or child may become a member by buying one or several shares. The price per share is $50.00.</p>
   <p>This money will be deposited in the bank, and when all the shares are sold the company will begin business at once. There are only 200 shares. The company believes that these shares will be sold in a short time and that the business will begin soon. The office of the company is at the Lietuva office.</p>
   <p>If the people of other nationalities have organizations, have established large stores and are realizing gigantic profits, why then cannot the Lithuanians do the same? We hope this first Chicago Lithuanian Company will succeed in <pb facs="5423970_1_0520.jpg" n="2"/>its aims; will make the start and will induce the Lithuanians of other cities to go into business.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to buy the shares may come to the office of Lietuva.</p>
