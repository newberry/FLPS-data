    <p>A mass meeting of unemployed workers was held Thursday evening, January 27, to protest against the Chicago police, who split the heads of many unemployed workers when they attempted to start a parade at Hull House on January 17.</p>
    <p>Among the speakers was Lucy Parsons, who was one of those arrested as a result of the riot on January 17. Wm. Thurston Brown, an ex-priest and secretary of the Colorado State Socialist Party, also spoke.</p>
    <p>All those who had been arrested denounced the Chicago police as the lowest kind of human beings.</p>
    <p>Brown said: "I would rather see my son die than see him wear the uniform of a policeman." He also placed priests in the same category with the police.</p>
    <p>Rev. Irwin Tucker and Vincent St. John were also scheduled to speak, but they<pb facs="5423970_1_1036.jpg" n="2"/> failed to appear at the meeting.</p>
    <p>A resolution was adopted, denouncing the nefarious deeds of the police.</p>
    <p>A large crowd attended the protest meeting in spite of the severe cold weather.</p>
