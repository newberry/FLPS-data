   <p>We have been informed from several sources that young Lithuanians are receiving letters from Poles urging them to join the Polish legions.</p>
   <p>Discard such letters when you receive them, and if somebody tries to talk you into joining, tell him--that agent--to go where peppers grow.</p>
   <p>The Poles refuse to stop claiming the Lithuanians. They try, in various ways, to fool the governments and people of the allied nations, in an effort to convince them that the Lithuanians are the same as Poles, or at least almost the same. The attempt to recruit Lithuanians for the Polish legions is a new trick of theirs--an effort to show the world that the Lithuanians do not want to be separated from the Poles and even volunteer to join the Polish army.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians prefer to join Uncle Sam's army. Many of them have volunteered. The Lithuanians want nothing to do with the Poles, much less with their legions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1109.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The suggestion of creating Lithuanian legions has been discussed by Lithuanian-Americans. The majority of them are of the opinion that there is enough room under the starry flag of America for all those who want to fight for freedom and that it is an honor to be permitted to fight under that flag.</p>
