   <p>August 22, the Lithuanian Political Alliance held its meeting. It was decided to hold a Lithuanian mass meeting Sept. 13 and to invite reporters from all the American newspapers, American and Lithuanian speakers, and to have good music. And to invite also the representatives of the future president of the United States, in order to show to them that the Lithuanians, like other nationalities, have their political clubs, their organizations, and that the Lithuanians feel that they are just as good as any other people in this country. That the Lithuanians appreciate, know and understand how to elect a prudent man for the future president of the United States. It was decided to hold a mass meeting at Pulaski Hall, 800 S. Ashland avenue on the 13th day of September.</p>
   <p>Now all the Lithuanian clubs and organizations must have their meetings, announce and advertise widely as possible this Lithuanian mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The Alliance officials.</p>
