   <p>The United States Congress is making new plans to abridge the rights of aliens in this country. Additional plans are being formulated to give the Federal government czaristic rights. The real purpose of these plans is to make aliens and foreign-born Americans obedient slaves of the capitalists. Aliens and <pb facs="5423970_1_1310.jpg" n="2"/>foreign-born Americans are the most severely exploited workers in America. Because of that fact, the industrialists and financial barons want all aliens registered, photographed, and kept under constant surveillance.</p>
   <p>In connection with all these onslaughts of the capitalists against a large part of the American working class, it is interesting to note that the professional union bureaucracy (A. F. L. ) is not using its influence to thwart these brazen <pb facs="5423970_1_1311.jpg" n="3"/>attacks. The union bureaucrats are doing nothing to arouse the millions of American workers to protest against those reactionary measures of our Congress in Washington.</p>
   <p>All laws which narrow the rights of alien and foreign-born workers will also seriously affect native American workers. The truth of this statement has been seen many times in the past. For example, during and after the war we issued many warnings that all laws against "criminal syndicalism" and "undesirable aliens" will be applied equally against aliens, foreign-born Americans, and against <pb facs="5423970_1_1312.jpg" n="4"/>native Americans. And we were right. Many trials and convictions have confirmed our predictions.</p>
   <p>Laws which narrow the rights of aliens will bring about a chaotic condition in the labor movement. The steel industry, the meat packing industry, and all other industries in which a majority, or close to a majority, of workers are aliens and foreign-born Americans, will then be controlled by capitalist <pb facs="5423970_1_1313.jpg" n="5"/>barons. Then, organization of the workers would become almost impossible -- at least for a decade or two.</p>
   <p>However, is the professional union bureaucracy (A.F.L.) interested in the above facts? It is obvious that they are not interested. While "serving" the workers for many decades the union bureaucrats have succeeded in making large fortunes for themselves. Their wealth has caused them to forget entirely the needs and requirements of the workers. All they are interested in, is how to acquire still greater fortunes for themselves. But what will the workers--aliens, foreign-born, and native -- say about that? will they keep quiet?</p>
