   <p>The First Chapter of the Young Lithuanian Socialists' League held a social at the Aurora Hall on December 31.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the affair was to provide the League's members with an opportunity to greet the New Year joyously.</p>
   <p>Many guests were invited and most of them came. This shows that the Young Lithuanian Socialists' League is influential among the progressive youth. Among the prominent guests were Mr. and Mrs. Dundulis, J. Sirutis, and the dental student, A. Zymontas. Before the dinner, which took place about midnight, the members amused themselves with dancing and games. During the dinner various guests and members made speeches and offered various <pb facs="5423970_1_0792.jpg" n="2"/>greetings. Miss S. Vitarcius and Miss O. Kalvaitis recited poetry. P.F. Alekna played a violin solo, which was well rendered.</p>
   <p>After the dinner and program the dancing and games continued until four o'clock in the morning. I must say that the party was very successful and the youth will remember it for a long time.</p>
   <p>I should like to tell the young people that the Chapter will strive to present something even better in the future. The dramatic presentations committee of the Chapter is actively preparing for the presentation of the play "The Murderers" on March 11 at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>This is all the news from the Young Lithuanian Socialists' League.</p>
