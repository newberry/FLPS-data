<title level="a">SHOULD WE PUBLISH A BOOK ON LITHUANIANS IN ENGLISH?</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Sometime ago our newspapers discussed the advisability of publishing a booklet in the English language, to explain who the Lithuanians are, etc.</p>
   <p>While working in a factory, foreigners (non-Lithuanians) often inquire about my nationality. I answer that I am a Lithuanian, but on account of my inability to speak English I am unable to explain who that Lithuanians are. When I make an effort to explain, and mention the fact that Lithuania is situated next to Poland, I am immediately taken for a Pole and called a "Polak."</p>
   <p>Therefore, I appeal to the educated Lithuanians to write at least a small booklet of six or eight pages on the Lithuanians in the English language, <pb facs="5423970_1_0602.jpg" n="2"/>explaining where they came from, their number, when they had their own kingdom, their present status, and the difference between Lithuanians and Poles. That, in my opinion, should be sufficient. If copies of such a booklet are well distributed among Americans, then they will know how to distinguish Lithuanians from Poles.</p>
   <p>I believe that the cost of publishing such a small booklet would not be large.....</p>
   <p>By J. V. Vitautas</p>
   <p>Editorial Note: We are publishing this suggestion, but it does not appear to us to be so important. English speaking people can, if they so desire, find sufficient information about the Lithuanians in English literature.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0603.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>English speaking people, especially Americans, know nothing about Lithuanians not because there is no literature in the English language about Lithuanians, but because they are not interested in the Lithuanian people and for that reason make no effort to get acquainted with them. The Germans, especially those who attended school in Germany, are well acquainted with the Lithuanian people.</p>
