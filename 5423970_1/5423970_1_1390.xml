   <p>p.4........The new membership drive of the Association of Lithuanian Working Women of America is now in full swing and will continue during the month of January. This organization has branches in all the larger towns and cities of the United States. All branches will hold mass-meetings with speakers in order to attract a large number of new members.</p>
   <p>This society aims to organize all the Lithuanian working women in America, work for their educational uplift, and make them class conscious. Although the needs of working women are not any different from the needs of working men, nevertheless, it is still easier to organize women into separate organizations. For that reason the Association of Lithuanian Working Women is a very important part of the labor movement. Furthermore the work of this organization is not limited to activities among women alone. It supports the Communist movement as much as possible. At the last <pb facs="5423970_1_1391.jpg" n="2"/>meeting the association decided to assist in organizing working women into an international organization. One of its most important functions is the maintenance of several childrens' organizations such as the A.Z.V.D. (Childrens' Little Society of the Blossom of Hope), and other similar societies.</p>
   <p>Originally the Association of Lithuanian Women Workers was known as the Lithuanian Womens' Progressive Association of America. It was then a strictly feminine organization, more or less a suffragette society. Even at that time most members considered the affairs of the working class to be most important. Although a minority of the members possessed aristocratic attitudes, this group left the organization immediately after the split of the old Socialist party into two factions, the Socialist and Communist. The ranks and file members went Communistic and the "aristocrats" joined the rightist party. The latter composed only a small and insignificant group.</p>
   <p>This organization had issued a monthly magazine for over twelve years. The magazine was first known as the "Moteru Balsas" ( Womens' Voice), but later the <pb facs="5423970_1_1392.jpg" n="3"/>name was changed to "Darbininkiu Balsas" (Voice of Working Women). The name of the organization was changed at the same time.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that the membership of the Association of Lithuanian Women Workers of America contains a large number of American born women and girls. That is very significant in view of the fact that there are very few American born men and young men in our other organizations.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian section of the American Labor Party, and members of the Literary Society of American Lithuanian Workers, and all class conscious workers should support as much as possible the new membership drive of the Lithuanian working women. That matter is of interest not only to the women but also to the entire labor movement. Every Lithuanian working woman who is not yet a member should join the organization.</p>
