   <p>The first Lithuanian lawyer, not only in Chicago, but also in all America, was F. P. Braculis.....[Translator's note.--Also spelled Bradchulis, Brachulis.]</p>
   <p>F. P. Braculis, we learned, came to America when he was a boy of 14 years (he is 47 now) without any acquaintances and, like all of our immigrants, empty-handed.....</p>
   <p>....Working during the days, he attended school nights and thus finished first the Metropolitan Business College, then the Chicago High Manual Training School. However, he was not satisfied with this. He was determined to become a lawyer and, with that intention, entered the Lake Forest University .... in 1896. In 1900 he passed the State examinations and thus became <pb facs="5423970_1_1533.jpg" n="2"/>the first Lithuanian lawyer in America.</p>
   <p>Another lawyer, included among the Lithuanians, is John A. Brenza, who was born and raised in Nanticoke, Pa. Having been reared in a Polish and American spirit, he probably first became acquainted with Lithuanianism while attending the Valparaiso (Indiana) University, where he graduated from the Law school. From Valparaiso he went to Yule to attend jurisprudential classes for one year. He passed the State examinations in 1910 and settled in Chicago. He, it is apparent, is also interested in politics and is at present an assistant city attorney.....</p>
