  <body>
   <p>The workers of Armour and Company are now beginning to strike. On April 27, the butchers went out on a strike and immediately afterward the workers of the casing department struck. The strikers demanded a raise of five cents per hour. The company refused to grant their request on the ground that other companies are not paying higher wages. The strikers gave up and returned to work.</p>
   <p>However, the workers are preparing to strike again. They are planning to confer with other workers and then go out on strike together for higher wages. At present about two or three hundred workers of the Armour Company are now out on strike. All that is necessary is more agitation in order to empty the stockyards of workers. It must not be forgotten that at present a shortage of workers is developing. No more immigrants are coming into this country, while native Americans do not want to work in the stockyards. Therefore, the best time to win our fight is at hand.</p>
