   <p>Doctors of other nationalities have had societies for a long time. Up to now the number of Lithuanian doctors was so small that it was impossible to even think about a doctor's society. However, the present fight of the doctors [Translator's note.--This refers to the drive of the Chicago Medical Society and other groups against charlatans.] presented the opportunity, and it can be said, forced our doctors to band together and lay a foundation for a permanent Lithuanian doctors' society.</p>
   <p>A meeting of all the Chicago Lithuanian doctors was called for that purpose in the home of Dr. A. Zimont, on June 9. The following doctors were present: A. L. Graicunas, A. K. Rutkauckas, J. Kulis, A. Juska, S. Brendza and A. Zimont...</p>
   <p>Many things became clear through the general discussion and the following was <pb facs="5423970_1_1538.jpg" n="2"/>the opinion arrived at:</p>
   <p>1) That the Lithuanian doctors cannot in any way decline to give whatever aid they can to the Central Committee in its fight against humbug institutes, clinics and doctors.</p>
   <p>2) Since the laws at present cannot prevent unconscientious and unethical doctors from advertising their "miraculous" cures in the newspapers it is necessary, besides conducting a legal fight through the courts and legislature, to protect the advertisement reading public by enlightening it with warnings and fitting articles.</p>
   <p>3) It is necessary to protect the reputation of the Lithuanian doctors even more so because even among them an unfit and blameworthy practice of humbug advertising has begun to flourish.</p>
   <p>4) Finally, there is an urgent demand to protect the public from such <pb facs="5423970_1_1539.jpg" n="3"/>individuals, not being doctors, to advertise themselves as such and undertake doctoring people, thus, often unnecessarily sending more than one to the grave.</p>
   <p>For all of these reasons, the above mentioned doctors in Chicago decided to organize a Lithuanian doctors' society and all of them became members, electing Dr. K. Rutkauckas of South Chicago as president.</p>
   <p>Though at present this new society has only Chicago doctors as its members and will concern itself especially with local problems, the meeting was of the opinion that this newly organized group will not remain merely a local doctors' organization but, in time, will bring together all of the Lithuanian doctors throughout America. For that reason the society was named "The Lithuanian Doctors' Society of America."</p>
