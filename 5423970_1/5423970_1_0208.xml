   <p>Everyone of us knows that education is the most essential for every one of us. But where can a poor man get the education..?</p>
   <p>We think that we must have an evening school. Let us look at the Poles, everybody holds them as the most ignorant people, yet they have three evening schools in Chicago to study the English language. It is time for us to take into consideration the necessity of an evening school. Many Lithuanians are eager to learn the English language. Without the English language you cannot start business, you can go nowhere without the English language.</p>
   <p>Many of us say that we have no money, while others say that they would pay good money if somebody would teach them the English language.</p>
   <p>We can get education free. The Board of Education in Chicago will give us a room in a school, and will pay for the teacher, but we must have a <pb facs="5423970_1_0209.jpg" n="2"/>Lithuanian who can pass the exam nation in the English language. Please go to the Board of Education, you will do good not only for yourself, but also for all Lithuanians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We must have not less than thirty people who want to learn English, in order to get a teacher and a school room.</p>
