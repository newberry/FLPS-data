  <body>
   <p>The shareholders of the Lithuanian Auditorium Corporation held their annual meeting, Jan. 25, at the Lithuanian Auditorium, 3133 So. Halsted Street. It was the first meeting of the members of the corporation in their own building. The building was completed only a few months ago. Over two hundred shareholders of the corporation attended the meeting. A new board of directors was elected for the coming year.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Auditorium is a three-story modern business and office building. It also has a large convention and dance hall with a stage and several smaller halls for meeting purposes. In the basement there is a modern bowling alley and a billiards room. The building is being utilized as a center of Lithuanian activities in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0457.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This building was financed by the sale of stock, at $10 a share, to the Lithuanians of Chicago and vicinity. Lithuanian societies and individuals of all political faiths and religious denominations purchased shares.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Ewald, the financial secretary, reported that $58,210 worth of shares have been sold. He also reported that the total cost of the building was $207,522.33.</p>
   <p>During 1925, the directors sponsored three benefit entertainments to raise funds for the, corporations building fund. All three affairs met with moderate success.</p>
