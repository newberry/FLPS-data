   <p>July 22, Sunday, at Azukas' Hall, a meeting was held by five Lithuanian political clubs of Chicago. There were organized into the Alliance of the Lithuanian Republican of Illinois. The delegates were from wards 6, 15, 16, 18, and 22.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected: President A. Olszewskis; vice pres. Vincenta Vabalinskas; Sec. Peter Jonaitis, fin. sec. Wladislawas Zacharewiczius; treasurer Laurinas Azukas.</p>
   <p>Two weeks from now, there will be another meeting of this organization. All members should be present, and the delegates of other Lithuanian political clubs ought to come to this meeting. This organization has a charter and we can organize Lithuanians in the state of Illinois. Our aim is to have a strong Lithuanian political organization. Let us make this Alliance of the Lithuanian Republicans a giant organization, we can do it, if we work together.</p>
