<title level="a">GIGANTIC LITHUANIAN MASS MEETING AND PARADE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Chicago's Lithuanians are preparing for the largest mass meeting they have ever held. It will take place on Sunday, April 28. Practically all of the Lithuanian societies of Chicago are planning to be present at the Seventh Regiment Armory, 34th Place and Wentworth Avenue, where the mass meeting will take place at three o'clock, Sunday afternoon.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this gigantic mass meeting is to show the faithfulness of the Lithuanians to this country and to help in publicizing the Third Liberty Loan bonds. All Lithuanians who are alive are expected to be there. They will hear speeches, singing, etc., and admission will be free.</p>
   <p>The societies of various colonies will march to the Armory in a body.</p>
   <p>The Bridgeport division has promised to have twenty-three societies with two bands. They will meet at 33rd Street and Auburn Avenue, at one o'clock, and will parade to the Armory from there.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1125.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Town of Lake division has twenty-five Lithuanian societies and four bands. The members will meet at 46th and Wood Streets, at one o'clock.</p>
   <p>The 18th Street division has promised to have sixteen societies with two bands. They will meet at 18th Street and Union Avenue, at one o'clock.</p>
   <p>The North Side division has promised to have twelve societies and one band. They will meet in the Mark White Square Park, 30th and Halsted Streets, at one o'clock.</p>
   <p>The West Side division will have sixteen societies and two bands. They will parade on the West Side, then will take streetcars to 26th Street and Went-worth Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Brighton Park division will have fifteen societies and one band. They will meet at Archer and Western Avenues, at one o'clock.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1126.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The South Chicago division will have three societies. The societies of Roseland, Kensington, West Pullman and Burnside will join the South Chicago group at 46th Street and Princeton Avenue, in Fuller Park, at one o'clock.</p>
   <p>Each division will take a separate route as it parades, with music, to the Seventh Regiment Armory. The Armory can seat about ten thousand people, so there will be plenty of room for all. The public can enter the hall earlier. The speeches will be in Lithuanian and English.</p>
   <p>Up to the present, it has been announced, almost three hundred thousand dollars' worth of Liberty bonds have been purchased by Lithuanians in Chicago.</p>
