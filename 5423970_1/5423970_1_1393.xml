   <p>The Association of Lithuanian Women Workers of America, of the third district, held a conference on Dec. 20 at the Vilnis Hall, 3116 S. Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. Deikis, district organizer, opened the conference and invited Miss Katilius to deliver the oration of the day. The speaker appealed to the members to become more active, to study and learn more about the problems and aims of the working class, and to organize newspaper correspondence groups in the various units of the organization. In that way, she stated, the members will be of much greater value to the labor movement.</p>
   <p>A credentials committee was selected to verify the credentials of all delegates attending the meeting. The committee later reported that there were thirty-seven delegates representing all the units of the organization within the third district. All delegates took an active part in the various discussions of the conference.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1394.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Deikis also delivered an address before the conference. She talked about the propagation of working class literature--in what manner working class newspapers and books can be spread among the workers.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Z. Klibis gave a detailed report on the last convention of the organization, which she had attended as a district delegate. Miss Katilius, who also attended the convention, added a few points to the report.</p>
   <p>A committee of nine was selected to carry on a propaganda campaign during the month of February. For that purpose it was decided to invite Mrs. Karosas from the Eastern states as a speaker.</p>
   <p>Miss Katilius and Mrs. Gasiunas were elected as members of an international committee, which is being formed of all nationalities in Chicago for the purpose of <pb facs="5423970_1_1395.jpg" n="3"/>organizing women workers into an international organization.</p>
   <p>According to reports by the delegates at the conference, the Alliance of Lithuanian Working Women of America is in a prosperous state. It has a large number of members and is in good standing financially.</p>
   <p>Before the conference came to an end, a motion was introduced, seconded, and carried to make a collection at the conference for the benefit of political prisoners in the United States. The collection netted eighteen dollars, which was sent to the committee of a protest massmeeting held recently at the Northwestern Hall. It is very admirable that the women workers did not forget such an important cause.</p>
