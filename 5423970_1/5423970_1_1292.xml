   <p>Today, August 3, the Socialist Party is arranging a mass meeting to make a protest against the war. This meeting will be held in Pilsen Park, West 26 Street and Albany Avenue (not far from Kedzie Avenue). The speakers, who will speak at this meeting, are as follows: Ex-Socialist Congressman, Mr. Berger, the socialist editor of The Bohemian Newspaper, Mr. J. J. Jelinek, and other socialist leaders from Chicago.</p>
   <p>Not long ago a patriotic meeting was held in the same park by the Bohemian and Servian patriotic and military organizations from Chicago and vicinity. The main speaker at this patriotic meeting was Mr. J. Palandech, a Servian, whose speech was too emphatically patriotic, and many people from both sides, Bohemians and Servians, did not this speaker. The people, who were there at that meeting, were all against the war.</p>
   <p>Bohemian Socialists strongly oppose the war. They decided to meet again and make <pb facs="5423970_1_1293.jpg" n="2"/>a strong protest against the war. The Socialist Party distributed leaflets, on which were printed the words: "Down with War". The socialists circulated these leaflets at the meeting and also distributed them among the people outside.</p>
   <p>Those people, who gathered at Pilsen Park, were unanimous in their decision and manifested a strong hatred against this war and the wars of the future.</p>
