   <p>Many factories in Chicago are closed, the stock yards are moving very little. There are many rumors going on why the factories are closed. Some say on account of the new President in this country, others say it is only temporary, that after the first of July factories will open again. Of course, nobody knows why the factories are closed.</p>
   <p>In times of such economical crisis it is very hard for our Lithuanians who just came from the old country. They do not know English and without that language you cannot get a job. We are sorry to say that there are many such Lithuanians who have been living in Chicago for the last twenty years and cannot speak English. All such Lithuanians are out of jobs, and they can get no other job because they cannot speak English. Those who can speak English can get odd jobs even for a few days, this is a great help in such an industrial crisis.</p>
   <p>Now they must suffer for not knowing English, they cannot learn English because they can not read newspapers or books.</p>
   <p>The best and easiest way to learn English is to read at first the Lithuanian newspaper, learn to read, then when you know how to read in your own language you will learn the English language very easily.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0759.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We have all kinds of books to read. We have books with English and Lithuanian sentences that shows how to speak and pronounce.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians, you must remember that without English in this country you are lost.</p>
