   <p>p.2.... Today in the "Naujienos" the third article on the temperance question appears in the "Voice of the People" column. The authors of those articles seriously and vividly expressed their viewpoints. However, many errors are noticeable in these articles. The authors of these articles have failed to heed the following points:</p>
   <p>1. A person who drinks is not necessarily a drunkard. The moderate use of intoxicating liquor is not harmful to the extent that it will endanger the health, wealth and welfare of a nation. Many reliable medical specialists even maintain that the moderate use of liquor is conducive to the health of at least most individuals. Although some may not agree with this point, nevertheless, it at least shows that there are two sides to the question.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0230.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. Even specialists have not yet determined fully the effects of alcohol upon the human body; and those effects are much less known to the public, to common, uneducated people. There can be no doubt that the man who is continuously destroying his mind and body by excessively indulging in intoxicating liquors does not do so unknowingly. However, if he had known beforehand of the dire consequences of the drink habit, he probably would have refrained from forming the habit. It is a fact that most people are unaware of the ghastly future to which the drunk habit leads until after it is too late, and how many parents, because of ignorance form the beer and whiskey habit in their children almost immediately after they have learned to walk!</p>
   <p>3. It is not necessary for an educational campaign against intemperance to consist only in a pictorial display of a drunkard's kidneys. On the contrary it should be on a much more broader basis. Scientific knowledge, news items from a drunkard's life, and a general educational uplift of our people can and should be used as weapons against intemperance. After all,people drink only in order to have a good time. Unquestionably, a person who can find pleasure in books, <pb facs="5423970_1_0231.jpg" n="3"/>theatres and music will not be interested in that kind of pleasure which produces indisposition and headaches, which are the after effects of excessive drinking. But how many of our people are able to enjoy these more dignified pleasures of life? Some cannot afford them financially; others, because of the lack of education, have not developed a taste for them.</p>
   <p>4. The legal prohibition of intoxicating liquors is not equivalent to their eradication. A law can be enacted, but it also must be enforced. We all know the kind of law enforces we have at present. If our police dare to collaborate with thieves and bandits then we can reasonably expect that they will more readily go hand in hand with those who will be engaged in the illegal liquor traffic.</p>
   <p>Even now we all see the shameful conduct that goes on in those districts where the operation of saloons on Sundays is illegal: their front doors are closed, but the saloons are filled with people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0232.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The "Lietuvos Zinios" ( News of Lithuania) reported several times that after the legal prohibition of vodka in Russia secret saloons began to appear. That paper also reports that the war against intemperance in Lithuania is very far from being finished; much hard work lies ahead before intemperance can gain the upper hand.</p>
   <p>We are not trying, in such a short article, to make a definite solution of the intemperance problem. But we do point out that there are two sides to the matter, and not one, as many people believe.</p>
