   <p>p.1.....Yesterday an unemployment mass meeting of all nationalities, sponored by the International Unemployment League, was held at Hull House.</p>
   <p>Many speakers spoke in various languages and declared that unemployed workers cannot be satisfied merely with unemployment relief. They said the unemployed have only one demand: Give us jobs.</p>
   <p>There were two detectives in the audience, watching the procedure of the meeting. When the meeting came to a close and the workers were preparing to leave the hall for a parade, the two detectives left and called the police.</p>
   <p>At Halsted and Polk Sts. about 1,500 unemployed assembled and started to march in a parade. Banners were carried with the following inscriptions: We do not want alms, we want work;" "Give us this day our daily bread;" "Hunger".</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0749.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>of the Christian Socialist, and a Lithuanian, Issadore Simkus.</p>
   <p>All those who were arrested were charged with inciting to riot and parading without, a permit. It is true, the marchers did not have a permit; but they had asked the police for a permit and were refused.</p>
   <p>It is said that during the course of the parade I.W.W. proclamations were being, distributed.</p>
   <p>The hall for the unemployment meeting was obtained by J. Eads Howe, who is known as a "millionaire hobo."</p>
