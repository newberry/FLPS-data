   <p>Our priest denounces the Lithuanian societies that are independent, and not under his control. When the co-operative society was organized, the priest denounced it. When the Grand Duke Gedeminas of Lithuania Society was organized, the priest denounced it. He especially denounced the officials of the society. The priest hates such societies which are not under his control. The priest denounces the socialists with all his power. The socialists are enemies of the church--the socialists are immoral--but the priest failed to prove their immoralities, etc.</p>
   <p>There is a beautiful Lithuanian church, with a large auditorium; it was built by Lithuanian money. Yet, the priest does not permit us to have concerts, theaters etc., in the parish hall. For such programs, the Lithuanians are forced to rent halls from the people of different nationalities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0320.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Since last fall, the progressive Lithuanians have presented fifteen theatrical spectacles. They paid on the average, $30.00 rental per evening, a total of $465. This money has been paid to the hall owners of other nationalities, but not to the Lithuanian parish hall.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Singing Society, Aidas (The Echo), hires a hall from strangers, and pays one dollar a week, when they hold rehearsals. The Lithuanian Socialists Association, Local 137, paid $60 last year in rentals for meeting halls--not to Lithuanians, but to strangers.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians have built a church and a parish hall with their hard-earned money, with the sweat of their brow, yet the priest does not permit us to use the Lithuanian parish hall for cultural purposes.</p>
