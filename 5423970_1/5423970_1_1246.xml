   <p>The jingoists of America are burning with anxiety to capture and punish Mexico's bandit general, Villa. But, believe us, their anxiety is assumed. They say that it is extremely important for the United States to put an end to the evil acts of Villa, but they really have something else in mind.</p>
   <p>Seventeen American lives lost in the town of Columbus mean little to these jingoists. People's lives in this country are lost daily, not by the tens but by the hundreds. They are lost in the factories, in the mines, and on the railroads; they are lost at peaceful work and during strikes; they are destroyed by the criminal negligence of the capitalists and by the arms carried by hired sluggers. Do the jingoists demand the mobilization of troops and the dispatch of punitive expeditions against those guilty of these deaths? No, they never mention these murderers. They became concerned over the deaths in Columbus <pb facs="5423970_1_1247.jpg" n="2"/>only because the murderers are people of a foreign country. They see an opportunity in the incident to involve the United States in a war with Mexico. Even if they will not succeed in this, they at least hope to frighten the public and Congress with the specter of war, in order to force them to enlarge the army.</p>
   <p>Here is what one jingoist newspaper in Chicago writes:</p>
   <p>"It took the United States a week to prepare itself against a bandit leader who has a mob of three thousand beggars. How long would it take them to prepare to defend themselves against an attack by two hundred and fifty thousand disciplined veterans? There are at least three countries which, if they were not otherwise occupied, could disembark that many soldiers on our shores within seven weeks. If we were able to stand up against such might for at least seven months we would be very lucky."</p>
   <p>From this we are to conclude that the United States is in great danger, and that <pb facs="5423970_1_1248.jpg" n="3"/>we must increase our army and arm immediately if the United States is not to be lost. Such is the logic of the jingoist. The logic of the ordinary clear thinking person leads to an exactly opposite conclusion. If the United States had a powerful army at this moment, Villa's attack on Columbus would have been a signal for war against Mexico. The Government of this country would have paid no attention whatever to General Carranza's protest. It would have sent the army across the border immediately, and would have started a war with the Republic of Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of people would have died on both sides--all because of the loss of seventeen American lives--before an American governor-general would have been installed in Mexico's capital.</p>
   <p>America's unpreparedness for war was, in this case, the greatest good fortune for the United States and its neighbor on the south. It certainly was not a drawback.</p>
