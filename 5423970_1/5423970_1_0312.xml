   <p>When Lithuanians come to America they bring the customs of their fatherland along with them. However, since all countries have their own distinct customs, not all Lithuanian customs fit in with those in the United States. Some Lithuanian customs die very fast over here, while others persist for a longer period of time.</p>
   <p>Not all Lithuanian customs are important as far as the preservation of Lithuanian nationalism in America is concerned. However, some Lithuanian customs are so strange to American life that they should be abolished and replaced by American customs.</p>
   <p>Let us take a few Lithuanian customs as examples. In Lithuanian if a priest would be seen anywhere without a cassock there would be a great commotion; people would look upon that breach of custom as an insult to their religion. All priests <pb facs="5423970_1_0313.jpg" n="2"/>in Lithuania wear cassocks wherever they go. In America it is just the opposite; it would be very strange and even funny to see a priest walking on the street here with a cassock. In Lithuania when a person dies, a black flag is placed in front of the home until the body is buried; while in America death is signified by a more pleasant symbol of flowers and various colored ribbons.</p>
   <p>However, there is one Lithuanian custom in America that should be discontinued--the singing of psalms at funerals. This is not a bad custom in the hamlets and country districts of Lithuania, but in American cities the custom is, in our opinion, bad for several reasons.</p>
   <p>Let us glance at the effects of the custom here in America. When a person dies in a thickly populated city, the friends and acquaintances of the deceased attend the funeral to pay their last respects. Among those who attend the funeral, there are always several "specialists" who sing psalms for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. There is no one to do the singing in the daytime, so it begins in the evening, when people return from work, and continues either all <pb facs="5423970_1_0314.jpg" n="3"/>night or until a very late hour. We all know that Lithuanians have very powerful voices, and when a group gets together they sing so loud that it is enough "to chase all the saints away from the house"; their voices can be heard for a long distance, and hard-working people who live in the vicinity find it impossible to sleep and rest. These singers usually cannot sing long without occasionally "wetting" their dry throats. The more they wet their throats the stronger their voices become; and about midnight the singing turns into a very loud concert. It is not necessary to mention here what an unfavorable impression this creates in the minds of the non-Lithuanian residents of the community.</p>
   <p>From every aspect, this custom is undesirable here in America. Our priests would do very well if they would use their influence to stop this practice, and replace it with a more peaceful custom.</p>
