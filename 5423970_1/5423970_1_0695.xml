   <p>p.2...................The Federal Commerce Commission, in a recent investigation of economic conditions, asked three notable envoys of capitalism, Perkins, Guggenheim, and Berwind, to give the reasons for the present social unrest in the country. There is one thing in the testimony of these barons which creates a deep impression, namely their progession of complete ignorance of what goes on in their own business and industrial institutions. From their words it can been seen plainly that their only interest in the business and industrial institutions which they own is the amount of profit which they derive from them.</p>
   <p>The clearest explanation of the views of big capitalists was made by George W. Perkins, who, besides being the president of the steel trust (U. S. Steel Co.) is also president of the International Harvester Company, and of several railroad and steamship companies. He openly defended the necessity of trusts, but admitted that they should be regulated <pb facs="5423970_1_0696.jpg" n="2"/>by the government. Perkins and Edw. J. Berwind, who is the owner of several coal mines and railroad companies, were asked to describe the working conditions of their employees. Both said they knew nothing at all about that subject.</p>
   <p>Daniel Guggenheim, president of many founderies and iron mines, attempted to present himself as a liberal. Accordingly, he said that employees possess the right to organize into unions and to share in the profits of their employers. But when the chairman of the Commerce Commission asked him to give the number of workers in his employ, he said he does not have the slightest idea about that. He said he is not interested in such details of his business, and that such information can be supplied only by the directors of each company. In answer to the next question, does Mr. Guggenheim do any actual work in any capacity in his companies, he replied that a few years have already elapsed since he last visited any of his founderies or iron mines.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Commerce Commission, Walsh, reminded Mr. Guggenheim of the strike which took place in his founderies at Perth Amboy, N.J., in 1912. That capitalist <pb facs="5423970_1_0697.jpg" n="3"/>appeared to know nothing at all about the reasons for the strike nor how it was concluded. All he remembers is that one of the directors was sent into the strike area and reported back that everything was under control.</p>
   <p>Mr. Guggenheim was asked: "Are you, as a member of the Board of Directors, aware of the fact that in 1912 the daily wage of a worker in your founderies at Perth Amboy, N.J., was only $1.60?" He gave the following answer: "No, I don't know that."</p>
   <p>Then he was asked: "Is it true that in your foundries at Perth Amboy the majority of the workers work twelve hours per day?" He answered: "No, that is not true." He was then asked to state how many hours per day his employees work. Again he answered: "I don't know."</p>
   <p>In that manner the envoys of capitalism have demonstrated that their only interest in their business and industrial institutions is the amount of profit which they derive from them. But of what use are these capitalists to business and industry?</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0698.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They are of no use at all. They do no work, and do not even know what goes on in their own business and industrial institutions. Therefore, they are nothing else but mere parasites. Business and industry not only can get along very well without them, but also, if freed from them,would be much healthier.</p>
