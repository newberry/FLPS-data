   <p>[Translator's note: An illustration of a father holding up his little son for a better view of the Statue of Liberty appears under the headline.]</p>
   <p>They are your future heirs, and America is at war to make their future safe. They are too little to understand this now, but some day they will have to learn about the relations and traditions of America, the ideals of America, and the major cause for which the men of their father's time laid down their lives.</p>
   <p>Arrange, therefore, to place in their hands the bonds of their government. They will be an inspiring proof to them that their parents planned, sacrificed, and invested, for their sons' future. Liberty bonds will mean much more to them than money. They will make them proud of their parents, who, at the time of America's great need, proved themselves to be true American patriots.</p>

   <p>Invest in Liberty bonds for your children.</p>
