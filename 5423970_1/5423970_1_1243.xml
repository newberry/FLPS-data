   <p>It can hardly be doubted that the United States has already begun a war with Mexico. The "punitive expedition," the only purpose of which was supposed to be the capture of the bandit general Villa, is meeting with new obstacles every hour. The power of the expedition's enemy is increasing, and today, according to the capitalistic dailies, the expedition is facing the danger of a fight with all of Mexico. The possibility of such a danger was evident at the beginning. The Naujienos pointed this out as soon as the Washington administration had given the order that Villa be captured. This newspaper pointed out that the Mexicans do not trust the lords of this country; that therefore the invasion of Mexican territory by the United States would arouse the people of that country against us, and that the "punitive expedition" might be forced to fight not only the followers of <pb facs="5423970_1_1244.jpg" n="2"/>Villa, but also the followers of the Mexican government.</p>
   <p>No better proof of the soundness of our predictions is required than that provided by the latest developments. It has become evident that Villa has more followers than a mere handful of reckless bandits. When the United States Army prepared to go after him, he began to regain his popularity among his people, and they flocked to his banner. And we can judge from the dispatches that Villa has enough guns and ammunition (received from the United States!) to arm his new followers. It is difficult to verify just how fast the strength of the Villa followers is growing, but we must consider as significant the report that Villa is being joined by important Carranza generals with whole divisions. This report was first made the day before yesterday, and, although Carranza representatives denied the report at that time, it was verified yesterday through various channels. Now it is being said that all of northern Mexico is preparing to join Villa.</p>

   <p>Nothing more is needed for a beginning. The purpose for which the expedition was organized becomes more and more difficult to achieve. The task set for it has long outgrown the strength of the expeditionary force, and now the whole army of the United States is being mobilized "to capture Villa". At the same time the jingoist press is unceasingly urging the subjugation of all Mexico if it is not possible to capture Villa any other way.</p>
   <p>At a moment like this the only way a threatened war with Mexico could be avoided would be by the immediate appointment of a committee to investigate the incident in Columbus. There is considerable ground for assuming that the incident was organized by certain American capitalists who would profit from a war between the United States and Mexico. But who will appoint such a committee, when the same capitalistic cliques control Congress and the administration of this country?</p>
