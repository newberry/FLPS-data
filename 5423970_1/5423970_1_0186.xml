   <p>At the present time many Lithuanians are unemployed and have plenty of leisure time; also those who are working have free time at present, because this is the four week period of advent and all the theaters, dances and other amusements have been suspended. During this period it is advisable that you [seek to] obtain the knowledge which you are lacking. It can be found in newspapers, books, lectures and schools.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society, in order to help our Lithuanians to obtain knowledge, has established these institutions: the library at 3149 So. Halsted Street, open every evening from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., and on Sundays, from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. In the library there are various Lithuanian newspapers printed in America and Europe--you can read them without charge. We have decided to enlarge our library, we will have newspapers of other languages: two English, <pb facs="5423970_1_0187.jpg" n="2"/>two Russian, and two Polish.</p>
   <p>Every Sunday we are presenting popular science lectures on various subjects.</p>
   <p>We have an evening school, where we teach English and Lithuanian, arithmetic and a beginner's course. In order to help those who are unemployed, the Aurora Society's Educational Committee has decided that those who have lost their jobs may attend the Aurora School without charge provided they agree to pay when they are employed again.</p>
