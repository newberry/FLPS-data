   <p>It is time for us to awaken from slumber, to stand in the ranks of the progressive workers, to show that we are alive. We must understand that there is lacking education and mutual understanding among us. We see that the enlightened and cultured person is respected by all, while the ignorant person is abused and kicked around by everybody. Therefore, Lithuanian women and girls of Chicago, let us wake up, think about and look at ourselves, is it not necessary for us to take care of more important problems? Let us think how we can improve our miserable conditions in the time of distress. The American women have their organizations, and for this reason the women are respected by their men. We, the Lithuanian women, can have our charitable organizations and cultural societies, and united we can accomplish very much. Not long ago we organized a women's society to take care of present and future problems of the women. Only the enlightened and cultural women bring up strong and healthy men. In order to produce healthy children and society, the women must have education.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian women in Chicago have organized their society under the name,- <pb facs="5423970_1_1455.jpg" n="2"/>"Apsvieta",- ("Enlightenment"). It will have its third meeting, April 7, at 3:00 P.M., - 869- 33rd Place. The Lithuanian women and girls of Chicago are invited to come to this meeting and join our society.</p>
   <p>PRESIDENT,- Mrs. M. Damijonaitiene.</p>
