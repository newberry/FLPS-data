  <p>We are glad to announce to Lithuanians that more Lithuanians are coming here. They find everything here just as was told in the newspaper Lietuva.</p>
  <p>Three Lithuanian families bought farms before, now seven more families arrived and they bought the farms here. At present we have already ten Lithuanian families who bought farms here.</p>
  <p>We are thankful to our newspaper Vienybe, Plymouth Pa., and Lietuva, Chicago, Ill, because through them we learned about this great country in the state of Arkansas. We must say to all Lithuanians that the land here is very good, there is enough even for our childrens' children. The material - lumber is very cheap here, so that anybody with a small capital can build very good buildings at a very low cost.</p>
  <p>Here is the best place for a Lithuanian colony. Therefore we are inviting Lithuanians to come here because at present the land is cheap, later the prices will go up.</p>
  <p>Come and investigate the land here, and see for yourselves how prosperous the farmers are.</p>
  <p>The New Farmers.</p>
