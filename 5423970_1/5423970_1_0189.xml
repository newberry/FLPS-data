   <p>The Lithuanian Circle has transferred its library, located at 3149 So. Halsted Street, to the Aurora Society. The library will remain at the same address.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society is about to take on much broader activity than it has up to the present time. Up to now the Society's aim was to help Lithuanian students. Last year the Society loaned $1000 to students. It sponsored lectures on various educational topics once a week, or once every two weeks in the Lithuanian colony in Chicago. Now it will have its own library and reading room, open to the public. There will be various newspapers and books. And further, the society will have its own school for Lithuanians where arithmetic, draftsmanship, English and Lithuanian will be taught, and also there will be a class for those who cannot read or write.. There will be three classes a week, <pb facs="5423970_1_0190.jpg" n="2"/>one hour per class. The dues are fifty cents a month for a course.</p>
   <p>As there is 47.6% illiteracy among the Lithuanians, we ask those Lithuanians to come to this school to learn. Those who read this newspaper, tell your less fortunate friends who cannot read;advise them to come and learn to read and write, and to learn the English language.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians, don't be the dolts that you have been up to now, come to the school and learn. We are living in a country of culture; Lithuanian countrymen, cease to be the stupid members of a cultured people -- study, learn, that you may go foreward with the cultured people of America.</p>
