   <p>In the district of Kensington, since last fall when the young Lithuanians presented ten plays, they have been studying singing--they have been holding meetings to discuss various problems, both economic and political. They have been reading progressive and reactionary newspapers, books, etc. There has been no trouble among them. The freethinkers, socialists and religious people have lived in harmony. They used to discuss their ideas without hate or malice.</p>
   <p>On March 25, in the church hall, the St. Vincenta Paulo Society had arranged a lecture. The Rt. Rev. Serefinas permitted the use of the hall. The speakers were Mr. Semaska and Mr. Puskunigis from Chicago.</p>
   <p>In his first speech, Mr. Semaska spoke about the life of St. Vincent. The <pb facs="5423970_1_0322.jpg" n="2"/>next speaker was Mr. Puskunigis. Then Mr. Semaska delivered his second lecture on the life of Christ. The speaker told how the wealthy people and the priests had crucified Christ, because He defended the oppressed and the poor. Then the Rev. Serefinas jumped to his feet. The priest cried, "Stop the speech....". The audience arose and asked the priest to stop. They demanded that the speaker continue. When the priest saw that his own parishioners were against him, he shut off the lights and called the police. When the police arrived, they found that there was no trouble except that caused by the priest himself. Then the people left the hall denouncing the priest. The parishioners had convinced themselves that the priest was the enemy of the working people.</p>
