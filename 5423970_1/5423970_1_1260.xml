   <p>Signatures for a Lithuanian petition to the postwar peace congress are now being collected in Chicago and other Lithuanian-American colonies. The petition was suggested by the National Fund (a war relief fund set up by Lithuanian-American Catholics) and is being sponsored by the Lithuanian National Council of America, of which Dr. Anthony K. Rutkauskas is the president. Bundles containing copies of the petition were sent to various Lithuanian organizations and individuals throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>Among other things, it is stated in the petition that the Lithuanian people demand "the union of all parts of Lithuania into one political-administrative body, which must be endowed with autonomy". The full text of the petition was published in the April 25 issue of the Chicago Lithuanian <pb facs="5423970_1_1261.jpg" n="2"/>weekly, Draugas (The Friend). The text was critized, and the weak phraseology noted, in the April 30 issue of the Lietuva.</p>
   <p>The Keleivis (The Traveler), in an editorial, advised its readers to ignore the petition, because "so far not even one nation has won or ever will win its freedom by such means". The request in the petition for the "autonomy" of Lithuania is criticized in the following words: "Apparently, they (the sponsors of the petition) do not know that the granting of autonomy is purely an internal affair of a state, and that outside nations do not meddle in such affairs. Therefore, the coming peace conference, or congress of nations, cannot in any way grant autonomy to Lithuania. Such a conference can only create a separate and independent Lithuanian state."</p>
   <p>However, there are a number of historical facts which show that the reasoning of the Keleivis is wrong. An autonomous Bulgaria was created after the Russo-Turkish war at the San Stefano peace conference, in 1878. During that <pb facs="5423970_1_1262.jpg" n="3"/>same year, a conference of the large European states created the autonomous province of Eastern Roumelia. The European nations succeeded in setting up Crete as an autonomous state under Turkish rule, in 1898.</p>
   <p>Another, and perhaps the best, example that can be given to refute the statements of the Keleivis is the great Congress of Vienna, which took place in 1814-1815. This Congress remade the whole map of Europe by creating new states and reviving old ones. Some of these states were granted complete independence; others, only autonomy. This same Congress even endowed Poland with autonomy, as the "Kingdom of Poland" under the protectorate of Russia.</p>
