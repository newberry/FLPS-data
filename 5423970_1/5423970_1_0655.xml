   <p>The Lithuanians cannot forget that Americans have special days to remember, to respect and to give great honor to their friends, relatives and to their national heroes.</p>
   <p>Americans have a great national holiday, the Fourth of July, to remember their heroes who died and shed their blood for the independence of this country -to make this country free. Americans have another national holiday, February 22nd, the birthday of George Washington, the father of this country.</p>
   <p>Americans have a Decoration Day, to remember their friends, relatives, soldiers and other national heroes who died for their country. On Decoration Day, Americans are having meetings in schools and halls, where prominent speakers and professors are delivering orations and lectures on the good deeds of their patriots and national heroes.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians and Poles have their great men, Kosciuszko and Pulaski and others.</p>
   <p>We hope that in Chicago in the near future, there will be a monument built for Kosciuszko, then Lithuanians and Poles together can go on Decoration Day to remember and to pay tribute to our great national hero.</p>
