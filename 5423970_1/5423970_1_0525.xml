   <p>We are complaining about the hard times, but we do not try hard to improve our condition. We can improve our condition by establishing co-operative societies to be organized in every city where Lithuanians live. They can open their own stores and buy from their own establishments. Even Prof. R. T. Ely says that trusts and even monopolies cannot exist where the people have their cooperative stores.</p>
   <p>Brother Lithuanians, American workingmen! Why are you passing your youth in evanescent pleasure? Why are you wasting your time? Don't you know that time is money? Success and better times are under your feet if you knew how to use them. The gold and silver can be brought to us by our united strength from the established stores and factories. We must admit that up to the present time we were guilty ourselves, not only to our fellow-men but to our nation and our Fatherland. Let us work together for mutual and national benefit. By organizing and joining the cooperative societies, you will help not only yourself but all Lithuanians. There is no statute that would prohibit us from doing that. Let us get rid of our <pb facs="5423970_1_0526.jpg" n="2"/>greediness and organize materialistic and scientific locals. Such a cooperation could establish schools and get reliable teachers to spread the needed literature for the enlightenment of our people.</p>
   <p>In such a cooperative society the culture ought to go hand in hand with the materialistic uplifting of our people. When these pillars get strength, they will bring great benefit to our Fatherland. Then the Lithuanians will respect Lithuania as other nationalities are respecting their fatherland. Let us unite and work for the benefit of our own brothers.</p>
