   <p>Buy farm lands with woods on rivers and brooks, with small and large lakes, the picture of paradise, clear as spring water, where fish are abundant. This land is fertile for American and Lithuanian crops and vegetables, the land is very good for orchards of various kinds. The land looks like Lithuanian country, therefore from the older Lithuanian settlers it got the name of New Lithuania. Therefore, we are inviting all the Lithuanians to buy the farm land in New Lithuania, where we can establish cooperative farming. It will be no necessity to breathe the smoke in mines and factories and always be in terror of unemployment. There are 40,000 acres of land on sale, you can buy 40 or more acres. The price is from $5.00 to $12.00 per acre. You can buy on easy terms, with $10.00 down payment you can buy a farm. Through the land passes three railroads. The land is not far located from Chicago in the western part of the state of Michigan. Those who are interested in buying a farm in New Lithuania, write or call,</p>
