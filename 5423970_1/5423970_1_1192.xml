   <p>A new bill calling for a war-time selective draft is now under consideration before Congress in Washington, D. C. It is believed that the bill will be passed. Selective draft means compulsory military service for those men that are selected by the draft board. It means that not all men of military age will be drafted into the army, but only those that are selected. Those who are not married, and who have no dependents will be selected first. Those men who can be of greater service to the country as mechanics, etc., will not be drafted into the army.</p>
   <p>This new law, which was requested by the President, will undoubtedly be passed by Congress because the majority of Senators and Congressmen have already voiced their approval of the measure. The bill is being opposed by only a small group of Congressmen, who believe that Germany should be <pb facs="5423970_1_1193.jpg" n="2"/>permitted to trample on the rights of America, and that Uncle Sam should hide behind a tree.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the enactment of such a law is not only just, but also necessary.</p>
   <p>America is now at war and there can be only one of two possible results: Either America or Germany will win the war. If America procrastinates in taking an active part in the war, she will undoubtedly be harming herself and helping the enemy. England tried for two years to raise an army by the volunteer system; she spent millions of dollars, wasted two years of valuable time, and finally came to the conclusion that she could not get along without compulsory military service. We should learn a lesson from the mistakes that have been made in England. If we attempt to raise an army by a volunteer system then we will prolong, not shorten, the duration of the war. This war is not a picnic; America must strive to break the back of German militarism as soon as possible, before Germany succeeds in breaking the back of the <pb facs="5423970_1_1194.jpg" n="3"/>allied democracies.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, equal military service for all is a just and democratic principle. In a democratic country everybody enjoys equal rights and privileges, and for that reason everyone should shoulder an equal share of duties and responsibilities. In peacetime no one need fight, but in war time everyone must fight. A voluntary service system is all right in peacetime, but in war time it is not only unsuitable and impractical, but also unjust. Let us reason for a while. Under a voluntary service system only those will join the army who love their country and desire to defend it, who are good citizens, and who understand their duties and obligations. However, cowards, the lazy, the selfish, etc., will not join the army; some will be afraid, others will not wish to leave their businesses, and many others will find hundreds of other excuses for not enlisting. Therefore, the question arises: Why should you who love your country, shed your blood, endure sufferings, and probably lose your life for the sake of those who do not want to defend their own country and their own rights, and, on top of that, <pb facs="5423970_1_1195.jpg" n="4"/>even make fun of you? If everyone is equal in peacetime then everyone must also be equal in time of war.</p>
   <p>The republic of Switzerland is one of the most democratic nations in the world; her system of military service is just and practical. That kind of a system, or one similar to it, should be adopted by the United States, at least during wartime. It is true that about one hundred and thirty thousand men volunteered in response to an appeal made by Theodore Roosevelt, but to depend only on volunteers during wartime is unjust, not practical, and is not democratic. Those who understand their duties and obligations will volunteer, but those who do not understand them, or are accustomed to hiding behind skirts, will not volunteer.</p>
   <p>Here is one more little example: If a law was passed to the effect that taxes could be paid voluntarily, that is, only by those who wish to do so, there would be citizens who would voluntarily pay them because they realized that no country could get along without taxation. However, a large number of <pb facs="5423970_1_1196.jpg" n="5"/>citizens would choose not to pay any taxes. Compulsory military service during wartime is just as important and as necessary as the compulsory payment of taxes in times of peace; without the former no country can successfully defend its life and liberty durin wartime, and without the latter no country can function in times of peace.</p>
   <p>The selective draft is a necessary, just, and democratic medium.</p>
