   <p>It is probably not clear to many people whether or not there are any reasonable grounds for the United States to go to war with Germany. Some people are heard to say that the Germans cannot come over here, so why should we meddle in the European war? Many are saying that America is looking for a black eye, and for that reason is sticking its nose where it does not belong. "If Germany wants to sink all the ships on the ocean," they say, "then why in the devil are Americans traveling to Europe? Why can't they stay at homed Why should the whole country enter a ghastly war merely account of a few American travelers?"</p>
   <p>Many people are thinking along these lines, and they would be right if the question of whether or not the United States should declare war on Germany hinged <pb facs="5423970_1_1219.jpg" n="2"/>only on the small group of Americans who are traveling to Europe. However, the question takes in much more territory than that. The issue at stake involves primarily a great and very important principle, which is not so easy to explain.</p>
   <p>To understand this principle, let us consider the following analogy. Here is a town through which passes a wide street on both sides of which are many homes of citizens. The occupants of two of these homes become engaged in a bitter quarrel, in the course of which the residents of one dwelling become very desperate and shout to the occupants of the other: "Don't you dare leave your dare leave your house! Don't dare go out into the street, because if you do, we will split your heads with clubs."</p>
   <p>What would be the outcome of such a situation? What would you yourself do? Would you sit down in you home with your hands over your ears, and stay <pb facs="5423970_1_1220.jpg" n="3"/>inside day in and day out, as long as your desperate neighbor continues to threaten you, even though the street belongs equally to everybody, with everyone equally entitled to walk and travel on the street?</p>
   <p>Ask yourself what would you do in the foregoing situation? Your answer would be America's answer to Germany, because America is in exactly the same position as you would be in, in the situation we have just discussed.</p>
   <p>In the foregoing analogy, the tow represents the world; the street represents the oceans, which today are wide public highways by means of which nations make various contacts with one another. No nation today can get along without the use of these public highways, just as a farmer cannot travel to a city without roads.</p>
   <p>The citizens' homes in our analogy represent the various nations of the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1221.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Germany and her friends become involved in a bitter quarrel with a few other nations known as the Allies. Germany now proclaims to all neutral nations that they have no right to go out into the street, that they cannot go out upon the high seas and conduct their usual business with the rest of the world. Germany is now shouting to America, like the desperate townsmen in the above example: "Stay in the house and don't dare to come out, because if you do I will split your head."</p>
   <p>America's answer to Germany at this time is: "You can fight with whomever you wish, and you can fight as much as you wish, but the street belongs equally to everybody, and we don't intend to stay in our house, as in a jail, until you finish your fight with your neighbors. We possess the right to walk and travel in the street, and we will exercise this right. And if you really attempt to split our heads with a club, remember that even a club has two ends."</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1222.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>This is what President Wilson has told Germany. All that remains now is to wait and see if Germany will really dare to fulfill her threats.</p>
