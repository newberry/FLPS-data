   <p>The meeting was held on September 17 at 3:00 P. M., 3301 Auburn avenue. Mr. A. Olszewski was elected chairman of the meeting. There were at the meeting three agents of three different companies. The agents had maps of farm lands. They explained the quality of land, the condition of climate, communication, markets, etc.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians decided that the State of Minnesota is most suitable for Lithuanians, because the climate there is almost like that in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>They decided to establish a Lithuanian colony in the following counties: Jackson, Cottonwood, Lincoln, Lyon, Yellow, Medicine, Kandiyoki, Chippewa and Swift, Minnesota. The price is from $8 to $11 per acre. The down payment is one dollar per acre and the balance on a ten year installment plan. They can buy 40, 80, 120, 160 acres or more.</p>
   <p>There are now 33 Lithuanian families ready to join the Lithuanian colony. At this meeting a committee was elected of John Janksztas, Alexandra Bijanskas, and Casimir Kuncia, to investigate the land, and if the land is good and a suitable climate, markets, and railroad facilities exist, then we will start to buy land to establish a Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>At this meeting after a brief discussion, the name for Lithuanian colony was chosen. It will be known as the Lithuanian Farmers' Society of America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1495.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every Lithuanian family who wants to join this Lithuanian colony, please send two dollars to cover the expenses of those men who will go to investigate the land. If we buy the land the company will refund railroad expenses.</p>
   <p>In the name of the society,</p>
   <p>A. Olszewski.</p>
