   <p>Every doctor feels greatly the lack of an intelligent woman's assistance at a patient's bedside. A doctor called to a sick person's bed often does not know where to begin. The doctor knows well that in order to cure the patient he must remove the cause of the illness as soon as possible, but the doctor often does not have the time to get to the bottom of the cause. About all the doctor can do is give advice and instructions concerning the care of the patient.</p>
   <p>He has no greater trouble than when he has a woman patient. Her room is usually crowded with all kinds of women, young and old, some of them even with infants in their arms. They are attracted there not by any desire to <pb facs="5423970_1_1397.jpg" n="2"/>aid the patient, but by curiosity. So they chatter away at the bedside about somebody's mother who had the same illness,and died. Such conversations do the patients no good. Sometimes the visitors endanger their own families, for the patient may have a contagious disease which the visitors may bring home to their children. Matters would be entirely different if the patient's visitors were at least partially acquainted with the basic facts of hygiene.</p>
   <p>The lack of nurses has become so obvious to the doctor writing this article that, without waiting any longer, he intends to do something about it.</p>
   <p>Take a case of childbirth as an example. It certainly is not convenient for a doctor to make up the patient's bed, heat some water, and take care of many other common household tasks before he can turn his attention to the patient. If he were to do all those things, the charge for his time <pb facs="5423970_1_1398.jpg" n="3"/>would be too high for the head of the household.</p>
   <p>Therefore, prompted by the usual practice, the expectant mother often asks an untidy woman to her bedside instead of a doctor. Well, the unfortunate consequences are well known. The mother or the child are sacrificed to needless diseases and, not infrequently, to death.</p>
   <p>An effort is being made to remedy this condition by training and educating more women as midwives. Though in recent times many midwives have been trained, they fall far short of satisfying all the requirements of the patients. Other means were taken. Lithuanian girls were urged to study the nursing profession. It now seems that the ice has been broken. Today, we no longer have to beg Lithuanian girls to study the nursing profession; they are doing so voluntarily. Therefore, today we have about two dozen Lithuanian nurses in America, and they all are profitably occupied.</p>
   <p>Life is not stagnant. New questions and problems arise continually in our <pb facs="5423970_1_1399.jpg" n="4"/>public life. They must be solved. The better and more attentively we concern ourselves with these problems as they arise, the more we realize that to solve them we must train and prepare ourselves systematically.</p>
   <p>The requirements of life in America caused such schools as the School of Civics and Philanthropy to be founded long ago. But we Lithuanians living in America must solve the same problems which confront the Americans, we must study the conditions of life in America--perhaps even more than the Americans, for, as immigrants, we are more sensitive to these conditions.</p>
   <p>For this reason we approached the administration of the School of Civics and Philanthropy, inquiring whether this school could not agree to provide a special course in the duties of citizenship, free of charge. Today we have the reply. The school agrees to award scholarships to ten or fifteen persons and, after graduation, to place them in positions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1400.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Therefore, Lithuanian men and women who would like to take advantage of this generous offer should please communicate with Dr. A. L. Graicunas, 3310 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
