   <pb facs="5423970_1_0756.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We want to live and we have a right to live, but our rights and opportunity to live have been taken away from us!</p>
   <p>We are hungry and we want our daily bread! And we are not begging for it, but demanding it!</p>
   <p>We demand jobs and our daily bread, not almsgiving nor deceitful relief!</p>
   <p>We refuse to starve, and demand the necessities of life!</p>
   <p>We demand a real opportunity and right to live!</p>
   <p>We have produced all products, and demand their use, because they belong to us!</p>
