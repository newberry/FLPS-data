   <p>I consider it my duty to announce to all the creditors of the A. Olszewskis [sometimes A. Olszewski] trust who have paid me with their trust certificates, Trust number 6940, in order to regain the Milda Theater from the receiver, that since August 30, 1918, the Milda Theater Association has been the sole and complete owner of the Milda Theater. The Chicago Title and Trust Company has given our Association a deed which is recorded as number 683650. The charter of our Association was recorded on July 31, 1918, as Number <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Thus our Association, since August 30, 1913, not only has been a lawful corporation, but also has regained the property from the trustee. It was for this purpose that the Association was organized.</p>
   <p>All of the rents from the Milda Theater property, beginning September 1, 1918, will be put in the treasury of the Milda Theater Association and, at the end <pb facs="5423970_1_1614.jpg" n="2"/>of a year, will be distributed to stockholders as dividends. The creditors of the A. Olszewskis trust who have joined the Association, or who will join in the future, will receive a larger rate of interest on the money that was not paid out to them by A. Olszewskis Bank than on the money which they did withdraw and are now keeping in some other bank.</p>
   <p>That will prove that A. Olszewskis was not bankrupt and that the value of his property equals the value of the bills against it. To protect the creditors from losses which arise from operation by trustees and receivers, it was necessary to create a corporation which would take control of the property.</p>
   <p>That fact is as plain as the sun, but not all the creditors understand it. Those creditors who could not understand the truth and, instead of sending in their trust certificates, are holding them, waiting for the liquidation of the remaining property, will eventually realize that they have made a mistake. But it will be too late.</p>
   <p>The difference between organized and unorganized creditors is this: organized <pb facs="5423970_1_1615.jpg" n="3"/>creditors receive dividends annually from their Corporations and, when times get better, can sell their shares for the full price, while unorganized creditors will receive no dividends or interest on their trust certificates, not even after ten years, and, in case of liquidation, will receive only five or ten cents on the dollar and the matter will be closed.</p>
   <p>Also, I take this opportunity to announce to all creditors of the A. Clszewskis trust that I will not organize any more corporations. The Milda Theater Association is the last I shall help to create. There are a few hundred more shares of the Milda Theater Association which can be had for A. Olszewskis trust certificates. Those who trade their trust certificates for these shares will be fortunate. When all of these shares are gone there will be trust certificates of more than $136,000 and a first mortgage of more than $31,000 outstanding. Those who have some understanding and can figure will realize how much their trust certificates will be worth in case of liquidation. I shall explain no more about these things.</p>
   <p>In ending this announcement I must express my sincere gratitude to all of those <pb facs="5423970_1_1616.jpg" n="4"/>creditors who gave me possession of their trust certificates and signed papers authorizing me to do the work necessary for taking the property from the trustee. This work could not have been accomplished without such an act of confidence on the part of the creditors. To date, I have been intrusted with 99 certificates for the Mirgra Hall Association, and 1630 certificates for the Milda Theater Association, making a total of 1129. The number increases continually, for there is hardly a day that a few more certificates are not added. I am sorry that we shall not be able to take many more, for almost all of the shares of the Milda Theater Association are gone.</p>
   <p>The Mirga Hall Association will pay dividends during the month of January, 1919. The Milda Theater Association will pay dividends during the month of September, 1919.</p>
