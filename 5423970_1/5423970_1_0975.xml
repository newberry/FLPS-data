   <p>At last the Chicago Lithuanians began to take action in politics. In wards where there are Lithuanians they are organizing political clubs. In the last few years we have had in Chicago the Lithuanian Independent Political Club, but now in every Lithuanian ward they are organizing Republican clubs.</p>
   <p>In the 7th, 9th, 10th and 16th wards, they have organized Republican clubs, and now a Republican club in the sixth ward. Seventeen members joined this club at the first meeting.</p>
   <p>The 6th Ward is the stronghold of Lithuanians, there are more Lithuanians in this ward than in any other section of Chicago. If we Lithuanians work together we will accomplish something for ourselves and for our nation. Let us work together, show to other nations that we are just as good as the people of other nations.</p>
   <p>The president of this club is Mr. A. Olzewski, editor of Lietuva; vice-president, L. Azukas; secretary W. Zacharewiczia; reporter F. G. Masionis.</p>
   <p>The meetings will be held at Azukas's Hall, 3301 Laurel street. There are no initiation fees in this club, so join now; you will see what benefit there will be for you.</p>
