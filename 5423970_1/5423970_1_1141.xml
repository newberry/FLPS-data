   <p>[Translator's note: An illustration of a hand reaching down to help a soldier out of a trench appears under the headline.]</p>
   <p>There are five hundred thousand American soldiers in France. We do not dare to delay victory now. American lives, our safety and the safety of the whole world are being risked. If we do not wish to prolong the slaughter and suffering, if we do not wish to risk defeat or an unsuccessful peace, we must act at once; we must make every effort now.</p>
   <p>The army is performing its duty. Five hundred thousand American soldiers are in France today; there will be more tomorrow and more the next day. We will send a sufficiently large army so that, together with our allies, we <pb facs="5423970_1_1142.jpg" n="2"/>can deliver a blow which will push the German forces back across the Rhine--so that we can achieve victory, which will make America's liberty safe and establish a lasting peace.</p>
   <p>But the whole nation must co-operate. Our armies in France wait for us to supply them with food, ammunition, and other necessities which will make victory possible. We must not disappoint them.</p>
   <p>The Third Liberty Loan is our contribution to the winning of this war. The safety and success of five hundred thousand American soldiers in France depend on it. Give him a hand! Buy as many bonds as possible!</p>
