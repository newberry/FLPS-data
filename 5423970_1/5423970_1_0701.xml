   <p>Editorial: p.2... The United States Supreme Court unanimously upheld the decision of the lower courts against the Hatters Union of Danbury, Conn. This decision triples the judgment of $84,000 which the union must pay to Loewe &amp; Co, for damages which the union is supposed to have inflicted when it declared a boycott against the company.</p>
   <p>This decision of the Federal Supreme Court represents a very severe blow not only to the one hundred eighty-six members of the Hatters Union, who must pay that gigantic sum out of their own pockets, but also to the whole American working class.</p>
   <p>The Hatters Union was found guilty of violating the Sherman Anti Trust Law. This means that a labor union is classed as a trust; and since union activities are detrimental to the interests of the employers, they are held to be as much against the public welfare as a trust.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0702.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The highest court of the land made a decision, which now becomes a law. Whenever a decision is made by our highest court it automatically becomes a precedent for the future; that is, it will guide future decisions in the lower courts and governments, like the laws which are enacted by Congress and approved by the president.</p>
   <p>The court's decision places the entire labor movement in a perplexing predicament. Now that unions are classed as trusts they can legally be found guilty of almost anything. Even the very existence of a trust is held to be illegal. In order to legally dissolve a trust it is not even necessary to prove that it has committed an unlawful act; all that is necessary is to show that the capitalistic enterprise operates as a trust. Therefore each and every member of a labor union or organization is in constant danger of legal punishment, because any collective act that interferes with the interests of the employers may be construed as a violation of the law.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0703.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Recently, through the efforts of the Wilson administration, Congress passed the Clayton amendment to the Sherman anti-trust law.</p>
   <p>According to this amendment a labor union is not to be classed as a trust. But now this amendment is automatically invalidated by the decision of the Supreme Court. The court's decision creates a new law, which states that labor unions must be persecuted as trusts.</p>
   <p>However, in practice it appears that the Sherman law is being employed to combat labor unions more than it is to combate capitalistic trusts.</p>
