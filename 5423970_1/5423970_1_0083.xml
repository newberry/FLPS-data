   <p>On the 15th day of September, west side, 23rd Place and Oakley Avenue, there was the consecration of the Lithuanian church, "The Holy Mother of Aurora Gates". The consecration ceremonies were performed by archbishop Quigley and several priests. After the ceremonies, archbishop Quigley delivered a sermon in English, praised the Lithuanians as good workers for Catholicism. That this is the eighth church established by Lithuanian people.</p>
   <p>It is hard to understand, that the Chicago Lithuanians have eight churches and are able to support such a large number of priests, who do nothing, except pray, live nicely and have pockets full of money. There are a large number of nuns. They do nothing but fool the children in the parish schools. The nuns are the ignorant Poles, do not know one word of the Lithuanian language, and yet they are teaching the Lithuanian children! The aim of these nuns is to Polanize the Lithuanian children, to make them Polish dupes!</p>
   <p>Do the Chicago Lithuanians think of the future of their children? No! They have <pb facs="5423970_1_0084.jpg" n="2"/>eight churches and worthless parish schools, where the Lithuanian children are taught Polish prayers! We have no schools that even one day in a week teach our children something better than praying. We need good schools with good teachers, instead of ignorant nuns and fat priests. We Lithuanians must have at least one good school, to teach our children science instead of prayer.</p>
   <p>Some one will say that we have no money to establish even one school. But why we are able to establish as many as eight churches, to uphold such an army of priests who do nothing for the good of humanity, why then cannot we have one school, which would cost very little to keep up in comparison to the upkeep of eight churches, the fat priests and the army of ignorant nuns. Why do we have enough money to feed the church parasites, and no money for one school and good teachers, who would teach our children science instead of prayer? Let the Lithuanian societies begin to think on the school problem, they could accomplish wonders.</p>
   <p>In the same west side, we have the "Farmer of Lithuania society", - this society wants to establish such a school for Lithuanian children, to teach them the Lithuanian language and science, but not religious dogmas. It is very hard for this society <pb facs="5423970_1_0085.jpg" n="3"/>to accomplish such a task, when the brains of our brothers are poisoned by the priest. It is a duty of all the Lithuanians of Chicago to establish one good school for the uplift of the ignorant Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>M.M. Trimas.</p>
