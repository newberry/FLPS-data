   <p>p.4. William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, in an address before a capitalist institution, the American Chamber of Commerce, at Newark, Ohio, stated that "the working class organizations, of America were never opposed to, and never fought against, the capitalistic system........They agree with the present social order." He also stated that the workers reserve the right to organize, but they "willingly agree to allow the capitalists the right to possess and control the industries."</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to explain that such statements were very pleasing to the fat capitalistic exploiters who live off the labor of others. However, what Mr. Green said is true only of himself and other similar bureaucrats, who draw unspeakably large salaries from workers' organizations; but instead of serving the workers they serve their enemies. They are as afraid of class struggles as <pb facs="5423970_1_0333.jpg" n="2"/>are the exploiters. They fool and mislead the workers. However, the statement that workers "willingly" agree to allow capitalists the right to control the industries, and that they will not fight at all against capitalism is sheer nonsense. Furthermore, in spite of all the pacifying efforts of such fakers as Green, the workers do not get along without strikes. And if the workers are not yet fighting, as they should fight to defend their interests, then that is due to the fact that fake labor leaders still have influence over the workers.</p>
   <p>It is a highly significant fact that now the capitalists, instead of inviting all kinds of preachers to explain "the brotherhood of man on earth," invite bureaucrats from the unions to do that. Even during strikes they invite those bureaucrats. An official organ of the miners union relates how "active" are certain union heads in speaking before clubs of capitalists. The organ states that John Mates spoke before the "Kiwanis" millionaires' club in Schenectady, New York; John Hollister delivered an address before the "Rotary" millionaires' club in Burlington, Virginia; Thomas Kennedy, treasurer of the union, spoke to the "Lions <pb facs="5423970_1_0334.jpg" n="3"/>Club" of the capitalists in Fall River, Mass; Neal Terry, before the "Rotary Club" in Binghamton, New York. Here are mentioned only a few examples from many.</p>
   <p>The union heads say they speak before the clubs of millionaires in order to "acquaint" them with the"demands of striking miners." But of what benefit is it to the strikers if the millionaire clubs know their demands? Furthermore, those demands are publicly announced and known to everybody.</p>
