   <p>In our meeting of October 28 at the Columbia Hall, we, the Lithuanian garment workers, expressed our feeling of disgust to the Lietuva because of the misleading public announcement of the Hart, Schaffner and Marx firm published therein.</p>
   <p>We are not surprised that the Lietuva inserted such a lying announcement of that firm, but we are surprised that the Lietuva, in publishing it, did not even make an observation about that firm's deception, and did not mention in more detail the present tailors' strike in Chicago, which in recent months involved 40,000 workers.</p>
   <p>It is sad to us that such a progressive newspaper as the Lietuva can regard this battle so coldly. Besides that, it must be remembered that the Lietuva had been asked not to print such deceptive advertisements--how-ever, it did not pay heed to that! (The editorial offices and never <pb facs="5423970_1_0343.jpg" n="2"/>received such requests--Editor.)</p>
   <p>Therefore, we, assembled at this meeting expressing our disgust to the Lietuva, at the same time announced to the public that a general garment workers' strike is now in progress in Chicago, and asked that nobody go to take the places of the striking workers.</p>
   <p>It is hardly necessary to reply to the advertised lies of Hart, Schaffner and Marx. Whoever has worker there knows well about the relations with workers and the sanitary conditions and their high pay. The working conditions at Hart, Schaffner and Marx were, in many respects, worse than in Russia.</p>
   <p>Once more we warn the public and the Lithuanian garment workers to be careful and not to pay head to similar future advertisements of the Company.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0344.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the name of these assembled,</p>
   <p>J. Gaigalas,</p>
   <p>S. Strazdas,</p>
   <p>Jul. J. Mickevicius.</p>
   <p>The explanation of the Hart, Schaffner and Marx firm was published as an advertisement, for which the are not responsible. If it had been printed in the news columns, the editors would have probably made their observations. The strikers and the employers are two opposing sides; impartiality and the freedom of the press and speech demand that both the one and the other side be heard regardless of which tells the truth. The general, public can make its decision only from the explanations of both sides. The announcement of the Hart, Schaffner and Marx firm not only did not harm the strikers but brought the benefit of arousing the strikers to write the above words and, in that manner, to advise garment workers not to work in the above-mentioned firm during the strike. Otherwise, the strikers' committees would not have thought <pb facs="5423970_1_0345.jpg" n="4"/>of doing that until now. We gladly publish and will publish the announcements of the strikers' committees, but we cannot close the mouths of the employers also, since the character of the results of the strike depends also on them.</p>
   <p>Only those who would hamper the freedom of the press and speech can become angry at this behavior.</p>
