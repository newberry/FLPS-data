   <p>Lithuanian women are asleep. More honestly speaking, they are dancing and whiling away time in merriment, and only the gods know when they will get tired of dancing, When you meet a Lithuanian girl and invite her to come along to a meeting, or to a lecture, you invariably receive the reply: "I have no time." And why have they no time? They are on their way either to a dance, a banquet, or to a picnic. If we Lithuanian girls and women neglect to frequent those places where we can become educated, become acquainted with the social order under which we live, and learn how to raise our standard of living, then we have only ourselves to blame for our present low and miserable standard of living. We, ourselves, are to blame if our husbands do nor respect us. An intelligent and self-respecting woman would not sit on her husband's lap and drink beer or other intoxicating liquors, she would not listen to profane or immoral talk, and she would not permit her husband to look upon her as a mere toy. It is true that men are also responsible <pb facs="5423970_1_0194.jpg" n="2"/>for our miserable plight. But I am writing only about the women. It is the duty of a wife to assist her husband, and vice versa. As a rule our husbands attend more educational meetings and lectures. For that reason, they are more intelligent and feel superior to their wives.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Lithuanian women and girls, let is give this matter serious consideration, and work for a better and brighter future. Without an education, we cannot accomplish anything. We must read good literature, attend educational lectures and meetings where there is a large variety of opinions, and where important questions and problems are discussed. We must bear in mind that this is the age of knowledge, advancement, and competition. The more intelligent people are exploiting those who are less intelligent.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us wake up from our slumber, because we are far behind the women of other nationalities. We must not deceive ourselves with the thought that we already know everything, and that there is nothing <pb facs="5423970_1_0195.jpg" n="3"/>else for us to learn. Those who think so are very badly mistaken.</p>
   <p>The winter season is now approaching. We have had enough picnics. Let us get to work! It is the duty of our women and girls to belong to at least one educational society. In Chicago, we have the Lithuanian Women's Educational Society. During the coming winter season, this society will organize evening classes of instruction in various interesting subjects, if there will be enough Lithuanian women and girls who are willing to learn how to write, read, sew, cook, etc. The society will also conduct a series of lectures on various subjects in all the Lithuanian colonies in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Last year, the society conducted classes and lectures at the Fellowship House, 869 West 33 Place. The next meeting of the society will be held at the above address on Saturday, September 5, at 1 P. M. All members and prospective members are urged to attend this important meeting. Many important questions and problems will be discussed.</p>
