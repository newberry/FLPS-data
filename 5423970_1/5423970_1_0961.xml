   <p>Last Sunday the Lithuanian political meeting was a big success, but it could have been better and would have ennobled the Lithuanian name, if this meeting had been held in a Lithuanian hall. But, unfortunately, the Lithuanians are poor, and not having their own hall, they were forced to hold that meeting in a saloon hall, and for this reason, even though the meeting was great in the eyes of the Americans, all Lithuanians appeared as the poorest people because, even such a big meeting as this could not be held in their own hall.</p>
   <p>By the way, we have our church hall. It was built with our hard-earned money, but our beloved priest, for some reason unknown to us, perhaps from his stinginess or madness, would not rent the hall for this Lithuanian meeting. Before the meeting ten members of the committee went to the priest to get the hall. Our honorable priest hid himself. Others say that the priest did not give the hall to us because last year, after one of the Democratic meetings, the parish meeting decided not to rent the hall for any political meetings. While others say that the priest refused to rent the hall because <pb facs="5423970_1_0962.jpg" n="2"/>all Lithuanians were supporting the Republicans, instead of the Democrats.</p>
   <p>If this is the truth that the priest refused just because all the Lithuanians were Republicans, then the priest made a great mistake. It is known and understandable that the Republicans are standing higher than the Democrats. Even though all Lithuanians and all the Lithuanian and Polish priests would not vote for Republicans, just the same, the nex president of the United States will be elected Republican, because the people became so angry against the Democratic administration that they even don't want to hear about the Democrats.</p>
   <p>Why the Poles of today are so much despised by Americans? Because the Poles blindly believe the Democrats. What class of Poles belongs to the Democratic Party? Why, the most ignorant. Why did they want to deport all the Poles from America? Because they are the most ignorant people. Would it be nice if the Americans became convinced that we Lithuanians are just as ignorant as the Poles, they then would want to deport us as an ignorant people, together with the Poles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0963.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We must remember that one half of the Lithuanians in America are registered as Poles. Then how can we prove to Americans that we are not Poles, that we are Lithuanians, and that we are more intelligent than the Poles. Only to such important meetings can we invite prominent Americans, invite the reporters from the American newspapers to report about the meeting in the American press. Then we can show ourselves that we are not an ignorant people, and that we can exalt our name.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we believe that our honorable priest will see fit to become a leader to his parishioners who are working for the good of Lithuanianism, and that in the future, as like a father, he will give his hand to his children and will work together with us. If he will not work with us for some unknown reason to us, we hope that he will not obstruct us.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>The Parishioners.</p>
