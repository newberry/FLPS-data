   <p>The Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery held its graduation exercises on May 26, in the afternoon, at the Garrick Theater. A large number of students received their diplomas as doctors, and three of them were Lithuanians whose names are as follows: Dr. Charles Mikolaitis, Dr. Frank Puskunigis, and Dr. John Jonikis. Dr. Charles Mikolaitis graduated in 1905 from the Technical High School of St. Petersburg, Russia. He came to America in 1906 as a student and went to Valparaiso University in the fall of the same year, where he graduated in 1910 and received a B. S. degree. Then he came to the Chicago College of Medicine, where he graduated and received his M. D. degree. Dr. Frank Puskunigis graduated from high school in Russia, came to America in order to escape from being drafted into the Russian army. Dr. John Jonikis graduated from a teachers' college in Russia and was instructor in a Russian high school for three years. Dr. John Jonikis was drafted into the Russian Army during the Russo-Japanese war, but he managed to escape and came to America to study medicine. These three Lithuanian musketeers suffered great hardships, but nevertheless they accomplished their purpose, won their battles and at the end came out <pb facs="5423970_1_1531.jpg" n="2"/>victorious. Even here their life was a wretched one. They worked hard and attended college at the same time. Nobody helped them while they were students at the Chicago College of Medicine. They sacrificed a great deal before they achieved their aims.</p>
