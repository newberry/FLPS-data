   <p>President Taft is now busy traveling about his domain. Although he has been elected President by the people, nevertheless, the politicians along his journey are arranging receptions for him on a larger scale than what some monarchs receive in Europe. His governmental power is greater than that of the kings of Great Britain and Italy.</p>
   <p>The British and Italian kings do not possess any governmental powers; they are only representatives of their countries. But in America, the President determines the political policies of the government by means of recommendations to the upper and lower houses of Congress, and the politicians often support the President. In America, the President selects his own ministers (members of the cabinet) and retains them only as long as they please him; the ministers have no relations with, and never go before the Congress. In Great Britain, Italy, or France, any minister who is appointed by the king <pb facs="5423970_1_1054.jpg" n="2"/>or President, can be removed the following day by members of the parliament.</p>
   <p>As President Taft travels about in the United States, he delivers speeches in which he reveals his desires. And what are his desires? He wants still greater governmental power. If his wish is granted, then he will be able to declare himself emperor of the United States, and then, instead of a ruler who is elected by the people every four years, we will have a hereditary line of rulers as in all monarchic countries.</p>
   <p>In his political speeches, while Mr. Taft was minister of War in President Roosevelt's cabinet, he expressed the opinion that it is not necessary for the United States to remain perpetually a republic."The people of the country", he said, "can change the form of government at will; and the United States can even become a monarchy." There can be no doubt that the people of the country can do that. However, the people in the United States are thrust aside; the political machinery of the nation is being operated by a <pb facs="5423970_1_1055.jpg" n="3"/>small group of politicians. These politicians see to it that only those candidates are elected who will obey their orders; a candidate who is not willing to submit to the will of this political group will not be elected to a high office. The people of the country do not like this. However, the political machinery of the nation is not operated by the people, but by a group of politicians.</p>
   <p>According to the United States Constitution, the same citizen can be elected President for no more than two consecutive terms. During Roosevelt's administration, an effort was made to abolish this limitation, but Roosevelt declined to run for a third term, because the time for breaking this limitation was not ripe yet. Instead of running himself, he sponsored the candidacy of Taft, who is continuing the development of the field for a monarchy in the United States. If the above mentioned constitutional limitation is abrogated, and if the politicians are allowed to nominate presidential candidates without such a limitation, then the President can easily become an hereditary ruler. If this comes to pass, then the United States, although it will <pb facs="5423970_1_1056.jpg" n="4"/>continue to call itself a republic, will actually be a monarchy, and will not differ in any respects from other monarchic countries, because the President of the United States has more power than any European monarch.</p>
