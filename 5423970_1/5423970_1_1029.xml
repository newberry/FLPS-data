   <p>A month ago, the Chicago Council of Local Bar Associations elected a new president, the well-known Rudy Vasalle. This association with fifteen-hundred members is composed of the following groups: Decalogue Society of Lawyers (Jewish), Justinian Society of Advocates (Italian), Polish Lawyers Association, Lithuanian-American Lawyers Association, and the Nordic Law Club. The Chicago Council has as one of its aims, the maintaining of the high standards of the legal profession. One of the first activities of the Council was directed against ambulance chasing. Attorney Vasalle invited the Chicago Bar Association to join forces with his organization in the drive. But the C.B.A. replied that there was no need for a drive of this sort because no ambulance chasers existed in Chicago. Undaunted by this rebuke from the C.B.A., Vasalle and the Council took things into their own hands, and with the assistance of the Daily Tines, a huge and well-organized syndicate of ambulance chasers was uncovered. Arrests followed. Chicago was shocked when it was found that not only lawyers, but doctors and even hospitals, were cooperating with the chasers. Dr. Malcholm, T. Mac Eachlam, president of the American College of Surgeons, announced <pb facs="5423970_1_1030.jpg" n="2"/>that any hospitals found to be involved in the chasing syndicate would be removed from the approved list. At the same time Attorney R.A. Vasalle after confering with First Assistant State Attorney, Wilbur F. Crowley, urged passage of a statute which makes it a misdemeanor to solicit law business or to attempt to settle the claim of a victim within fifteen days after an accident.</p>
   <p>"If this legislation is passed," announced Attorney Vasalle,"Illinois will be the second state in the union to take this step, New York being the first."</p>
