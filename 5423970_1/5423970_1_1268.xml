   <p>The sky continues to grow darker. A fierce war is raging in France and Belgium. Thousands of young and energetic men are falling daily in the East, in Lithuania, Poland, and Galicia. In those countries more than one of our brothers, relatives, friends, and acquaintances have offered their lives on the sacrificial altar of the god of war. Many of us have lost those near and dear to us. We had nurtured the hope to see them again, but fate has ordained otherwise. Not a few of us here will mourn for our loved ones overseas. Thousands of the flower [of the manhood] of nations are also being lost daily in fierce battles between brave little Serbia and big powerful Austria. Last week blood began to flow in the distant countries of Africa. A bloody drama recently got under way on the borders of Russia and Turkey. Blood is flowing on the shores of distant Asia. Over the wires comes news of sea battles and of ships sunk in almost all the seas of the world. Wherever one looks there stands the awful spectre of war, <pb facs="5423970_1_1269.jpg" n="2"/>reaching out her greedy hands to seize our youth, the flower of humanity and the future.</p>
   <p>Two other spectres stand behind the spectre of war. Their names are starvation and sickness. They follow in the footsteps of their leader and take those who were not hit by bullets or who escaped death by fire. Without mercy or regard for anything, they lay out rows, one after another, in the manner of one who cuts hay. These three spectres, working together, have no mercy for the armed soldier, the unfortunate women, helpless children, and gray-haired old men.</p>
   <p>These three spectres have conquered the world. The entire earth has been drenched in blood, tears, woe, and misfortune. An unprecedented cloud of terror formed from the steam of blood has enveloped all of humanity. It seems that some awful, revengeful god has vowed to have his revenge against all of humanity. And the wave of blood and tears is growing larger and larger.</p>
   <p>This wave is encompassing the deluge of the entire world. Our mother country <pb facs="5423970_1_1270.jpg" n="3"/>was inundated by the very first surge of that wave. As much as we dislike the thought of the awfulness of the situation, we find that, in reality, it is even many times worse [than we had feared].</p>
   <p>But how many times during the last three months have we forgotten about this! Living in a country which has had the good fortune to avoid the awful whirlpool, how many times have we forgotten that the whole world, including our own motherland, is being overtaken by an awful calamity! How many times have we amused ourselves at dances and affairs, completely forgetting that in far-distant lands the air is vibrating with the firing of guns and the moans of our brothers! We have been doing this during the last three months and are continuing to do so.</p>
   <p>The time to stop [this frivolity] was long ago. Long ago we should have adorned ourselves with symbols of mourning instead of flowers. And even if we do not wear any outward marks [of gaiety], let us not act like a person who would have <pb facs="5423970_1_1271.jpg" n="4"/>a party while a corpse lies in the next room. Let us not forget that at the moment we are gaily dancing about the hall, our brother, relative, friend, or acquaintance may be falling mortally wounded, moaning in excruciating pain. While we are enjoying ourselves, our gray-haired parents, our brothers and sisters may be crying amidst awful starvation and sickness.</p>
   <p>They are sunk in misfortune while we enjoy ourselves. Can we be considered humane when we continue doing this? No, a hundred times no! We must reveal ourselves as human beings. Dances and all other entertainment must be forgotten by us.</p>
   <p>The hour for mourning has come. Gaiety must be dismissed. Our energies must be directed toward lessening the pain of those who suffer. We must provide them with as much relief as possible. Christianity and love for our neighbor have been preached for nineteen centuries. It should have become deeply rooted in our souls by now. Now we must show that we are human beings. The dances and entertainments must be forgotten during this period of mourning.</p>
