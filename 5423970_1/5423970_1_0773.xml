   <p>At one time Lenin, the father of Bolshevism in Russia, threatened the "bourgeois imperialism" of all Europe with destruction. At that time, few people paid attention to him.</p>
   <p>But behold! a revolution broke out even in Germany. Many believed that Germany's revolution would not take the same path as the Russian Revolution. "The Germans are a more enlightened people," we heard the prophets say.</p>
   <p>But Germany is following the same path as Russia. The more conservative socialists in Russia did not succeed in keeping the government under their control, nor are they succeeding in Germany, even though theirs was the largest party in Germany.</p>
   <p>Why? Because a revolution remains a revolution, no matter where it takes place.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0774.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Once it has started, a revolution must pass through all the stages with which we have become familiar. It must develop until the people lose their fever and the movement becomes inactive. The Russian revolution was no different from the French Revolution. The German Revolution, it can be prophesied, will be no different from the Russian Revolution. Regardless of its location, a mob is a mob. It must be allowed to "yell itself out" before it can return to normal</p>
   <p>Revolution is a contagious disease; it can be prophesied for any country.</p>
   <p>However, one can hardly believe that Bolshevism will conquer the world, or even that it will remain in existence forever. It is born of the misery and poverty of the people. Wearied by a long war, driven to desperation by starvation, people embrace anything that gives them promise of a better future.</p>
   <p>But to promise and to fulfill promises are two different things. The Bolshevism <pb facs="5423970_1_0775.jpg" n="3"/> of the French Revolution did not fulfill its promises, and led to the monarchy of Napoleon. Russian Bolshevism has not fulfilled its promises and appears unable to do so. German Bolshevism will also fail in this respect.</p>
   <p>It will fail because it is based on a destructive, rather than a constructive, foundation. In striving to create a new and better order, "an Eden on earth", it destroys everything--not only the bad, but the good as well. People who are waiting for such an "Eden" should remember the proverb: "Before they shall see the sun rise on the promised Eden, the dew will burn out their eyes". Everybody would rather have a sparrow in the hand than a nightingale on a branch.</p>
   <p>The people tired of the excesses of the war. They will tire even sooner of the horrors of Bolshevism. Their anger will subside and they will devote themselves to conservative, constructive work.</p>
