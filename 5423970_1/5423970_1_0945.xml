   <p>Chicago, August 21, the Lithuanian Republican Club of Ward 6 held a meeting. Collected $1.45 for the Lithuanian exhibit at the Paris exhibition. The club recommended for the Lithuanian exhibition at Paris the following committee:</p>
   <p>Joseph Gurinskas, for president, because he is a president in the St. George's parish, and that he is a very able man to take care of all the difficulties in the parish as the priest wants him to do; and even the criminal court brought up and recognized the graft of Rev. Krawczunas, therefore, we see no reason why the priest's assistant, Joseph Gurinskas, would not fit to be the exhibition president at Paris.</p>
   <p>Julian Dichauviczius for librarian, because in two years when he was the librarian of the Simonas Daukantas Library, he left not one book in the library, He would be just the man to take care of the Lithuanian library at the Paris exhibition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0946.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Stupnickas for committee physician, because if anyone of the committee got sick, the doctor could set the cup on the belly, for he is a specialist in the setting of the cups.</p>
   <p>The Katalikas editor, Rusikis, for Vilna council, because he knows even how to make account and to defend the Rev. Krawczunas treasury.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ezerskis as representative in Paris, because he defends and upholds the parish so well that even Rev. Krawczunas is satisfied.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Republican Club of Ward 6.</p>
