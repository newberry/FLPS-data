<title level="a">OLSEVSKIS AND TANANEVICIUS AGAINST PROHIBITION PROHIBITION WILL PARALYZE BUSINESS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The saloon keepers began to act and plan to defend their business when they heard that the United States would pass a law to close all saloons. The resolutions which were introduced into both Houses of Congress demand that prohibition shall become a law without delay. One of these resolutions demands that the prohibition law shall cover all the United States instead of a few states, and shall stop the manufacture of alcohol completely.</p>
   <p>Now in Chicago petitions are being signed and protests are being made against temperance societies which sponsor the prohibition bills and are putting the pressure on Congress. Among Lithuanian businessmen who were the first to sign one of the petitions are the following prominent men: Mr. Olsevskis, J. Tananevicius, Stanley Tananevicius, Masulis, Aleksandravicius, Sukevicius, and others. Mr. Olsevskis and Tananevicius both supported the temperance idea for political reasons only. Today both stand firmly as a stone wall against the temperance <pb facs="5423970_1_0271.jpg" n="2"/>movement which is sponsoring the prohibition bill in Congress. They both stressed the idea that if you stop people from drinking you will stop business in general. A great deal of business comes through the handling of alcohol and beer. They severely oppose prohibition.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact that they stand opposed to prohibition, for they have signed brewers' petitions, and advertise their business in brewers' papers. They also published the articles in their papers, stating that business flourishes well only when saloons are running wide open. In other words, they mean that when the people are soaked in alcohol and their minds are poisoned, only then business flourishes.</p>
