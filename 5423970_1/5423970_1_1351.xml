   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The United States Congress in Washington, D. C., passed a bill--two hundred twenty-eight votes against sixty--which prohibits mixed marriages between Negroes and whites in the District of Columbia.</p>
   <p>Although nearly half of the population of the District of Columbia is composed of Negroes, nevertheless, the above-mentioned bill was passed by a very large majority.</p>
   <p>The penalty for violation of the new law is a fine of one to five thousand dollars or imprisonment of one to five years. Any minister or priest who marries such a mixed couple will be punished by a fine of $250.00 to $1,000.00 or by imprisonment of six to twelve months.</p>
   <p>This is a clear case of interference by the government with the personal affairs of the people. The government should not interfere with such matters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1352.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Negroes as well as the whites are citizens of the United States; both are equally loyal and law-abiding citizens. People of both races fight for this country against her enemies in time of war. Therefore, the government should not degrade or discriminate against any racial group which it does not like.</p>
