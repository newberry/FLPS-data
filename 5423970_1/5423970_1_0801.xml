   <p>The long period of unemployment in the United States and the constantly growing disorder in the domestic and foreign policies of this country have undoubtedly exhausted the patience of the people. They are angry, and they are showing their anger against the "barons" who now have the government in their hands. Many people are saying, "Just wait until the next election! We will put an end to these Democratic times!"</p>
   <p>It is a good thing that citizens intend to use the elections to rid the country of "Democratic times". The Democratic administration has shown that it is unable to solve even one major problem, and that it is unable to banish a single one of the great evils of the day. The administration deserves to be "fired" by the people. It is regrettable, however, that most people do not know the best way to get rid of "Democratic times". Many of then are determind to punish the <pb facs="5423970_1_0802.jpg" n="2"/>Democrats by voting for Republicans, but to do so would be foolish--it would be as foolish as asking Beelzebub for help against the Devil.</p>
   <p>If the Democrats are unfit, then the Republicans are at least as bad, and probably worse. Have we forgotten that the Republican barons also have controlled and ruled this country for many years? Were there not unemployment, political scandals, exploitation of the workers and restriction of their rights, under Republican administrations?</p>
   <p>To the foregoing abuses, another major abuse is now being added--ferocious militarism and imperialism, which the Republicans (to an even greater extent than the Democrats) are trying to impose upon the American people. Place at the head of the government a Republican leader such as Theofore Roosevelt, give him the power to fill all major government posts with ferocious men like himself, and you will find that this "free" American Republic would with lightning speed become an armed military camp, and would look for trouble with the entire world.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0803.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>No, we must not vote for the Republicans to punish the Democrats: The workers have nothing to gain from the ferocious Republican gang. If the workers are clearly determined upon administering a licking to the Democrats, then neither must they spare the hides of the Republicans. Both are equally the enemies of the working class. The only political party that defends the interests of the working class is the Socialist party. It is the duty of all people to vote for the Socialists.</p>
