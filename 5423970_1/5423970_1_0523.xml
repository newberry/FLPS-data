   <p>As announced in the papers Vienybe and Lietuva, a Lithuanian company was organized. In the first part of May it obtained from the State of Illinois permission to sell stock, and we are pushing our work forward. The price per share is $10 so that every Lithuanian can afford to buy.</p>
   <p>The aim of this cooperative society is to buy a lot, build a building, and open a meat market and grocery, clothes, and other merchandise store.</p>
   <p>Therefore, brothers understanding the benefit of a cooperative society should support us by buying the shares. Everyone, men and women, can by shares and become stockholders in the company. We are inviting all the Lithuanians from this town and from surrounding ones to join this cooperative society. Why should the Lithuanians buy and spend their money at strangers' stores when they can buy at their own and reap the profit for themselves?</p>
