   <p>The Government at Washington has issued an order for the reregistration of all men of military age. This new registration must be completed within a period of two months. Elsewhere in this issue of the Lietuva, readers will find a detailed explanation of the new registration.</p>
   <p>In this connection, we would like to give our people several words of important advice. First of all, let every reader understand that this new step of the Government is being taken, not to annoy or oppress the people, but to classify properly every man and every family. The Government desires to find out in advance not only how many men are available for army service but also the number available for work in industry. In this war, industrial workers are no less important than soldiers.</p>
   <p>The Government is endeavoring, first of all, to take those men into the army <pb facs="5423970_1_1154.jpg" n="2"/>whose absence will cause the least possible suffering to their families. On this point, the Government of this country is showing much greater consideration than any other country in Europe, where men are often taken into the army without the slightest heed to their family status.</p>
   <p>Every Lithuanian who registered on June 5, 1917, or was supposed to have registered on that date, must register all over again. You must answer all questions with absolute accuracy if you wish to avoid trouble in the future.</p>
   <p>We have often advised our people not to pay any attention to agitators who in one way or another advocate opposition to the registration. Those who have listened to such agitators in the past are now having a vacation in jail, and are sorry they ever listened. Let no one listen to any more street-corner agitators; instead, let everyone perform honestly and willingly what the Government expects of every loyal citizen.</p>
   <p>During the last registration certain agitators attempted to mislead ignorant people with the statement that Socialists, as conscientious objectors, are also <pb facs="5423970_1_1155.jpg" n="3"/>exempt from army service. We wrote at that time and repeat again that membership in the Socialist party does not exempt anyone either from registration or from army service; anyone who listens to such stories will encounter a lot of grief. Only those people are exempt from army service who, prior to June 1 of this year, really belonged to a religious sect (but not to a political party) which expressly forbids its members to bear arms.</p>
   <p>Finally, we advise all our readers and, in general, all Lithuanians in America to be loyal to the Government of this country, and to assist this country in every possible way during the present difficult time, as is the duty of all real citizens. We know that, except for a very small percentage of misguided people, Lithuanian-Americans have admirably fulfilled and are still fulfilling their duties toward this country. However, we have heard that the name of the Lithuanian-Americans has been besmirched and placed in a bad light by the activities of foolish agitators, blind pro-German fools, and by those "great men" who often love to push ignorant people into trouble but who never take the risk of placing their own hides in danger. Keep your distance from such people. They are neither your friends nor the friends of the country. The German Kaiser has <pb facs="5423970_1_1156.jpg" n="4"/>the sole right to call them friends.</p>
