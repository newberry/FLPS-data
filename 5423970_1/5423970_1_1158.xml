  <body>
   <p>Last Monday, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution demanding that the Governor of Illinois, the Mayor of Chicago, and the head of the County ban in Chicago all meetings of the People's Council and of all other pacifist organizations, which, under the cloak of peace, oppose the American Government. The Lithuanian-American Workers Council, which was recently organized by the newspaper Naujienos, is a branch of the People's Council. Therefore, the ban against meetings of the People's Council will also affect the Lithuanian-American Workers Council.</p>
   <p>We have on several occasions warned our people not to have anything to do with the Lithuanian-American Workers Council. This organization can bring no good to the Lithuanians, to Lithuania, or to the workers. By belonging to such an organization, Lithuanians will only degrade their good name in the eyes of the Government of this country.</p>
