   <p>The Nationalists have deafened our ears with their shouts of love of nationality. They say that love for one's nationality is the greatest of all emotions and that it controls every act of the person who possesses it. A German, they tell us, always sticks up for a German, a Pole for a Pole, a Jew for a Jew. Therefore, they say, the Lithuanians should follow their example and strive to develop love of nationality among themselves.</p>
   <p>But what do the facts of life say?</p>
   <p>Let us take into consideration the strike of the International Harvester Company workers in Chicago. Thousands of workers ceased working and demanded shorter working hours and higher women. Among them there is a large number <pb facs="5423970_1_0411.jpg" n="2"/>of Poles. If love of nationality is such a lofty thing as the Nationalists paint it, then it should have forced all other Poles to support the strike of their fellow nationals. But what do we see? The bourgeois Polish newspapers, such as, the Dziennik Zwiazkowy, not only do not support the strikers, but they publish the company's long appeals in which the strikers are urged to become scabs. These papers, of course, receive very good compensation for publishing the appeals of the company. But such business is the act of a Judas against the striking workers. Therefore, can workers love their fellow nationals who behave in this manner? Are those business nationals guided by love for their fellow nationals when they act like this? It is evident, therefore, that facts do not agree with the words of our Nationalists.</p>
