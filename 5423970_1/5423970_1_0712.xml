   <p>Our newspapers are saying that our Lithuanian businessmen are no good, that they do not know how to conduct a business, that they do not care for national and cultural affairs.</p>
   <p>Why not take into consideration what business most of the Lithuanians are in and what education they have. Then we can say something about their business ability.</p>
   <p>Most of the Lithuanians are in the saloon business. When one makes a few hundred dollars, right away he opens a saloon, because such a business needs no education; all one needs is to know how to exploit his customers by shrewdness. Some saloonkeepers are successful, while many are failures.</p>
   <p>The best business are the clothing, dry goods, and shoe stores. Such a business needs (higher) qualifications. Little by little it would be <pb facs="5423970_1_0713.jpg" n="2"/>possible to develop such a business on a grand scale. Such a business is clean, high class, and would uplift the Lithuanian name.</p>
