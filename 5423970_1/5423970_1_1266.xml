   <p>p.2... Lately many advocates of "preparedness" have been proclaiming very loudly that the United States is not prepared to defend herself against an attack by an enemy. Judging from their statements it would appear that this country is entirely without weapons and forces of war.</p>
   <p>However, these gentlemen are wrong, because the opposite of what they say is true. By comparing American war expenditures with the expenditures of other large countries, we find that the United States is very far from the bottom of the list.</p>
   <p>In 1911 the greatest war expenditures were made by Russia; followed by Germany, France, the United States and the British empire. During that same year Britain made the greatest expenditures for naval war preparations; followed by the United States, Germany, France, and Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_1267.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, in money spent for land forces the United States surpassed all countries except four European states - in spite of the fact that the United States has no strong potential enemies on the American continents. In naval war expenditures the United States is second to that of the British empire. And yet, capitalist politicians strongly insist that it is absolutely imperative for the United States to increase her means for national defense at once. Their voice, of course, will be heeded by congress.</p>
