   <p>There is a drivers' strike but some of the wagons are being operated by strikebreakers under the protection of the hoodlum police. The strikebreakers are paid well and are protected by drunken policemen, while the strikers, their wives and children are starving . When the workers demanded better wages in order to have a decent living, the Democratic Mayor Dunne came with a force of hoodlums to break the strike.</p>
   <p>Mayor Dunne was elected on the Democratic ticket by the labor vote and he promised everything to the workers, but now, when the workers demand higher wages and better working conditions, Mayor Dunne sends drunken police hoodlums to break the strike by provocations.</p>
   <p>The workers must understand that the Socialist Party is the only party that protects the workers' rights. The workers must join the Socialist Party, vote for the Socialist ticket, join the party and vote for its candidates, who protect your rights, your family and your children. Let us work for the workers' organization, for humanity, for the rights of the oppressed and the exploited.</p>
