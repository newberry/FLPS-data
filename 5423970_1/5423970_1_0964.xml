   <p>In the eastern states of America Lithuanians have been living for the last few decades, while in Chicago only for the last few years, but in no other place in America have the Lithuanians risen so high in politics as in Chicago. Did you ever hear Lithuanians holding anywhere conventions and making decisions about the election of the United States President? Never! But here in Chicago, the Lithuanians, united into one strong political alliance, called a meeting, invited high American officials, and indorsed Governor William McKinley of Ohio for the presidency of the United States. At this great meeting there had been English and Lithuanian speeches about the candidate, and the following resolution was unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>We, the Illinois Lithuanian Republican Alliance, comprising six clubs of three thousand members, chiefly from the ranks of the skilled labor, mostly come here to escape oppression and pauperism in the old world and to work out a better future in this, our adopted country, recognize in William McKinley a statesman of justly earned world-wide renown and foremost champion of the protection of American industries,and therefore be it resolved by this <pb facs="5423970_1_0965.jpg" n="2"/>Alliance that we heartily indorse his candidacy for the presidency, and that we ask the Lithuanian clubs and leagues in Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Brooklyn, Boston and all other cities to join us and show their appreciation of the national champion of the American wage-earner, Honorable William McKinley, of Ohio.</p>
   <p>Mr. McKinley is the only man in America who is anxious to promote better livelihood of the American workers, he is endeavoring to open the factories, that the American workingmen should work. We have no doubt that Mr. McKinley will be elected president for the coming years, because, no matter to what newspaper you look, all are supporting him, all the workingmen supporting him, because everybody wants to see better times in America, not such hard times as we have now under the Democratic President Cleveland. When all the nationalities are supporting Mr. McKinley, we Lithuanians must support him, too. Then we will obtain recognition from the President of the United States, that we are the people who understand the laws of this country, and that he would not call us, the people of ignoramuses like Senator Lodge called the Poles as the most ignorant people, and even introduced a bill to deport all Poles from America, as the senator says, that on account of their ignorance, the <pb facs="5423970_1_0966.jpg" n="3"/>Poles are supporting the Democratic party, and that the Poles do not understand the laws of this country.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are inviting all Lithuanians of America, the Lithuanians clubs and the newspapers, to unite all and work as one unit, that every club and every political organization that read the above resolution on their meetings, and indorse for the presidency of the United States, the Governor William McKinley of the State of Ohio.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>The Illinois Lithuanian Republican</p>
   <p>Alliance</p>
