   <p>Our Lithuanians are very anxious to establish a Lithuanian farm colony as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>On December 19 a group of Lithuanians went to Arkansas to look over the land there. The following people went to Arkansas: A. Bijanskas, from Chicago; J. Butkus, St. Louis, Mo.; J. Wasiliuskas and Fr. Sinauokas, Philadelphia, Pa., and they did not come back from there.</p>
   <p>J. Butkus, J. Wasiliauskas and A. Bijanskas, each one of them bought eighty acres of land. They said that when they came there they saw that the farmers there were more prosperous than any other farmers of any place they had seen. So they decided that this is the best place for the Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>Now they are asking their families to come without delay. They wrote to their relatives and friends to come there, to buy land and live a prosperous life.Committee.</p>
