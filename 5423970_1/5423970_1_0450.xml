   <p>Sunday, September 19, the Chicago Lithuanians held their protest meeting against the massacre of the miners at Lattimere, Pa.</p>
   <p>A. Olazewskis opened the meeting and explained the purpose of this meeting. Mr. P. J. Jonaitis was elected chairman, and Mr. P. Chmielewski, secretary. The speakers were A. Olazewskis, Mr. Waranka, F. Masionis and A. Byanskis. Mr. Waranka read the resolution.</p>
   <p>Synopsis of the resolution</p>
   <p>That a few of our Lithuanians were killed and many mortally wounded when they were peacefully going on the highway to Lattimere, Pa. They were attacked by sheriff Martin and his deputies with guns. Several of the Lithuanian miners were killed and many wounded. The Lithuanians had been killed,and wounded in <pb facs="5423970_1_0451.jpg" n="2"/>in the back, that proves that they had no weapons and did not resist the attack of the sheriff. Seeing such terrible conduct of sheriff Martin, we Chicago Lithuanians are protesting against such a horrible massacre of innocent and peaceful miners. We are demanding of the State of Pennsylvania and Luzerne County, that this horrible massacre, committed by sheriff Martin be impartially investigated and properly punished.</p>
   <p>At this protest meeting were reporters of the American newspapers, and on the next day it was fully reported in the English papers about the meeting and the full text of the resolution was printed.</p>
   <p>Five men were elected to deliver the protest resolution to the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania and to the federal government, and to collect money for the families of the killed and for wounded persons. They are P. M. Jonaitis, A. Olszewskis, F. Masionis, M. Waranka and J. Chnielewskis.</p>
   <p>It was decided to appeal to the Lithuanian societies and our rector, that he announce in his church about the necessity of helping the suffering miners.</p>
   <pb facs="5423970_1_0452.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On the same day the society of the Sons of Lithuania held their meeting, donated ten dollars, and elected five persons to collect money for the widows and orphans of the killed miners. The committee will appeal through the Lithuanian newspapers and to the Lithuanians of Pennsylvania to investigate this brutal conduct of sheriff Martin.</p>
