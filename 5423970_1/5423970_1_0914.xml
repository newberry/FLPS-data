   <p>The above society was organized in the month of December, 1921. At that time the Lithuanians were not so widely scattered as they are at present; the majority of them were living in the vicinity at St. Michael parish. Therefore the club picked as the place for its meetings the parish hall. The club supports all the affairs of the parish. The first organizers of the club were: Atty. J. W. Grigal, V. Nauseda, M. Andwskeircun and V. Sinkevicius.</p>
   <p>The Most Important Purposes of the Club:</p>
   <p>1. To invite Lithuanians of both sexes into one political body.</p>
   <p>2. During the winter time the club arranges to read scientific essays, in which are explained not only the political problems, but others also, such as health, hygiene, natural science, etc.</p>
   <p>3. When the members demand it, the club organizes and supports an evening school. In such a school are explained citizenship problems, United States History, the constitution and other civil government's problem.</p>

   <p>4. The club is making an effort to help every member to become a citizen of this country.</p>
   <p>5. Upon seeing disorder and uncleanliness in the city the club demands that the city administration improve the vicinity.</p>
   <p>6. At election time the club supports, according to its views, one of the political parties. If the election is won, the club demands that its members should get government positions.</p>
   <p>7. When the club member marries or dies the club buys flowers or a wreath.</p>
   <p>In 1924 there arose a misunderstanding in the club. On account of the turmoil the club has suffered and has lost many of its members. But at the present it has recovered and has about sixty-five members.</p>
