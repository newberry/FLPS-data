  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held yesterday by the entertainment committee, of the National Sokol Unity, which is in charge of arrangements for the grand joint picnic and drill exhibition to be held on July 2, at Riverview Park. The meeting was called to order by the chairman of the committee Mr. Peter Churan. Delegates present were from Sokol Pilsen; Sokol Cechie; Sokol Slovanska Lipa; Sokol Chicago; Sokol Praha; Sokol Tabor; Sokol Vlast'; Sokol Oak Park; Cesko-Amerikansky Sokol.</p>
   <p>The first order of business was the selection of various committees after which the minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved, except for a few minor corrections. Mr. Joseph A. Paul announced for the publicity committee that through the mediation of Sokol Mr. Kolacek, chairman of the West Parks Commission, the committee was able to secure <pb facs="5418478_6_1526.jpg" n="2"/>the services of Governor Deneen as speaker for the occasion and permission was given to use the Governor's name in the advertizing matter. Mr. Paul has obtained a permit for the parade and its assembly on Humbolt Boulevard and Western Avenue.</p>
   <p>The program, which will contain eighty pages, will be ready next Sunday. The publicity committee took care of many other small matters. The publicity committee was authorized to procure postal cards to circularize the membership.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul announced that the management of the amusement park agreed to permit drilling for a period of four hours only. The drilling exhibition will take place in the motorcycle arena which can accommodate 60,000 persons. It was also decided that the sokols themselves should see to it that the field is in good shape and that the various refreshments be ordered as soon as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1527.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The publicity committee was charged with seeing to it that announcements are placed in all newspapers as soon as possible. In addition to Brousek's Band, the bugle and drum corps of various societies will participate. The committee will meet again next Sunday in Pilsen Hall.</p>
