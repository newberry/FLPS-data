   <p>As you remember there was a project for the foundation of a Bohemian state, or maybe a large exclusively Bohemian settlement in America. You would not be surprised to know that the Bohemians were not the first ones in considering the idea of continuing in this way their existence in this country for the future. Not only the Bohemian immigrants, but other nationalities, especially Germans, regretted that their national power here dwindled with time, being swallowed by the Anglo-American population. The pioneers started to figure how to build a powerproof barrier against forcible assimilation. It was possible to realize that in one way only, namely, to stop all relations with the Anglo-American population, to gather the dispersed immigrants and their families in one place, and create in the same state a strongly rooted settlement, or, to form an individual, independent, self-governing state. This idea was primarily originated not by Bohemian-American immigrants, but was adopted from Germans; they started to fulfill this idea much sooner but never reached the expected results in full.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0947.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is proved, that the mass colonization of certain parts of this country by Germans benefited the Bohemians, because they always followed the Germans and founded large settlements right beside the Germans at the same time or a little later.</p>
   <p>It is easy to explain why. In larger German settlements the life was better, gayer and more European than in pure American communities. The question of personal liberty, European Sundays, beer -- those were the main attractions; besides this the majority of our immigrants could understand the German language better than the American. From a practical viewpoint why should Bohemians not join the Germans so much as no political friction ever happened and both nations have the same reminiscences and sentiments of the old regime --not too sweet and not too sorrowful.</p>
   <p>At present the German-Americans represent a vital, important and numerous part of the citizens of this country and here collaborated in a large sense in the founding and extending of many countrysides, where now flourish larger Bohemian-American settlements.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0948.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The start was hard, but anyhow it was accomplished and we Bohemian settlers should continue our work of building large Bohemian centers but with the greatest caution, not being too credulous to promises of our countrymen. These may be honest but deluded and so cheating themselves and others.</p>
