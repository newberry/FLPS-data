  <body>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) has done a great deal of meritorious work during its comparatively short existence. Its accomplishments will convince every thinking person that this cultural association takes its goal seriously and that its national and cultural program does not figure only in the beautiful language of its bylaws, as is the case with many other such bodies. In local public schools, the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada has arranged a long series of lectures, as a result of which thousands and thousands of American children have become acquainted by oral and visual methods with the country of Bohemia, Bohemian customs and habits, Bohemian arts, and Bohemian cultural life in general. Even if this were all, it becomes an accomplishment of great merit when we realize what erroneous and frequently belittling opinions about Bohemians still prevail among the American public. This is a cold fact which cannot be disputed, and which is proved by the experiences of everyday life in our cosmopolitan city. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada initiated and successfully concluded the campaign for the inclusion of languages of highly <pb facs="5418478_6_1454.jpg" n="2"/>cultured nations--above all, of Bohemia--into the educational program of our institutions of higher learning. Now this is an accomplished fact. In Chicago's school system, foreign languages have been assured a definite place for at least as long a time as there is sufficient interest in keeping them there--and this, after all, is up to every nationality which desires to be considered as progressive and really intelligent. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada, in co-operation with the Immigration League, inaugurated a lively campaign to the end that the Federal Government establish in Chicago an immigration station--a project which would be of the greatest benefit, particularly to members of Slavonic nations. These efforts resulted in a grant large enough for the building of a shelter where poor and uninformed immigrants will remain under Federal supervision until taken care of by relatives or other competent agents. The establishment of such a station will be a deathblow to widespread white slavery, of whose actual scope only those who are in government service, or who are otherwise well informed, can have the proper conception. These few examples suffice to show the results of the Rada's activities. For such work, however, it is necessary to have above all, unselfish, self-sacrificing workers, and financial means, without which any endeavor of this kind must remain futile. It is surprising <pb facs="5418478_6_1455.jpg" n="3"/>indeed to learn with what meager resources the Rada has thus far had to work. We hear that Narodni Rada will shortly publish a complete membership and financial statement, which, in the light of the Rada's accomplishments, will furnish material for a most significant commentary. Last Friday night, the Narodni Rada held a social gathering for its friends, during which an explanation was made of the ways and means by which this body promotes among Americans a better understanding of the Bohemian element. The attendance of our educated classes at the gathering was enormous, the enthusiasm was general, and deafening applause reverberated through the hall frequently. This could be taken as an indication that among our well-to-do people the work of the Narodni Rada finds real appreciation and approval, and that the principal reason for the huge attendance was to show the Narodni Rada their sympathy and assurance of financial support when this will be needed for further undertakings. We refuse to give any other interpretation to this general enthusiasm, for to do so, it would be necessary to form a very queer opinion of the intellectuals who were present. Of course, there was a banquet, too, and a dignified presentation of Professor Veleminsky [of Prague University]. But we do not want to be so pessimistic as to believe that our elite assembled last Friday in the Pilsen Park <pb facs="5418478_6_1456.jpg" n="4"/>Auditorium only for these two reasons. At any rate, the future will tell.</p>
