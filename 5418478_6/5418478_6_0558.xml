   <p>The meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held last Friday evening in the office of the Pilsen Brewing Company, and was presided over by the chairman, Judge J. Z. Uhlir. All officers and a majority of the board of directors were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. The newly appointed manager, Mr. Joseph Jurka, presented his report for the past fourteen days, according to which several families were recommended for assistance.</p>
   <p>Disbursements during the past fourteen days were: Medicine, $2,25; coal, $7.50; rents, $42.25; groceries, $36.61; clothing and shoes, $14.50; office expenses, $42.85. Total disbursements, $145.96. The manager was instructed not to pay any rents in excess of $8, and in cases where the rental is more than that amount, he must secure the approval of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The manager was authorized to compile a list of all delinquent members and <pb facs="5418478_6_0559.jpg" n="2"/>to request them either personally or by letter to pay their dues for this year. The bond of one thousand dollars for Mr. Jurka was accepted. Alderman Anton J. Cermak's offer of free ice, from the city ice house at the Bridewell, for Bohemian poor people was accepted with thanks. An announcement will be made in the newspapers giving the days when ice can be obtained. The semiannual report of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is ready, and the secretary will notify the auditing committee to make an examination of the report.</p>
