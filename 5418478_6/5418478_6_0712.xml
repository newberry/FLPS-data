   <p>Joseph A. Cerny, former notary public in the Chicago Czech community, was brought to the probate court of Cook County by a deputy sheriff to answer charges of malfeasance in office in connection with a case of inheritance in which he handled the probate end and defrauded his client, the late Mrs.Josepha Savel, of $4179.85, spending the money for his own pleasure. His father, Joseph Cerny, and his father-in-law furnished a bond of $10,000, which had to be deposited in the case according to probate law. Both guarantors will have to take the burden of restitution upon their shoulders.</p>
   <p>Cerny, who is being held in the county jail under three other indictments, made use of his legal right and refused to testify. It is rumored that he will plead guilty in one of the indictments and serve a term in the Joliet penitentiary, after which, it is believed, attempts will be made to have him paroled.</p>
