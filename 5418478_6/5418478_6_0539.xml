   <p>Last Friday night, a meeting of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost [Bohemian Charitable Association] was held, with a majority of the directors in attendance. After the chairman, Judge J. Z. Uhlir, opened the meeting, the secretary, Reverend [Vaclav] Vanek, read the minutes of the last meeting, which were approved as read. Then, incoming correspondence was read, including a letter from John L. Lalla enclosing a check for ten dollars, and one from the Atlas Brewing Company with a check for twenty-five dollars, for Spolecnost.</p>
