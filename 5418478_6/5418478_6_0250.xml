   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) finds it necessary to direct this public appeal to all our countrymen. The Spolecnost is in dire need of help in these critical times. The last year was a very bad one. Expenses used up all income and cash on hand from previous years. Expenses amounted to $7,167.58. This year, at the present time, we have some $2,000 on hand, and with this small amount we are facing the winter season when our expenses are the greatest.</p>
   <p>Last winter our expenses were as follows:</p>

   <p>Having some $2,000 on hand, we need a little more than $2,500 in addition in order that we may be in a position to cover the necessary expenses. As things stand now, our funds will be exhausted some time in January and we shall have to stop payments to needy families that depend on our support.</p>
   <p>The many collections for various and most important purposes have caused a heavy decrease in our income, and we appeal herewith to our better situated countrymen and corporations to send in their donations and thus help us keep alive the Ceska Debrocinna Spolecnost which, during the five years of its existence, has spent close to $23,000 in support of our needy families. The membership fee is five dollars a year, but most of our members add to this a voluntary donation. At five dollars a year, we need five hundred new members.</p>

   <p>Contributions may be sent to our treasurer, Frank G. Hajicek, at 3337 West 26th Street, Chicago,Illinois. All contributions will be acknowledged in our daily papers.</p>
   <p>For the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost,</p>
   <p>J. Z. Uhlir, president,</p>
   <p>F. G. Hajicek, treasurer.</p>
