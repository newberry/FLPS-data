   <p>Mr. Frantisek Paroubek, with his wife, parents of the unfortunate Ella Paroubek, called upon Judge Sabath yesterday. They informed the Judge that all their means had been exhausted in the search for their daughter, and requested him to help them in some manner in arranging for the burial of their daughter. Judge Sabath gave them twenty-five dollars with which to defray the most urgent expenses, and recommended them to States Attorney, Mr. Smejkal, who is a member of the Board of Directors of the Bohemian National Cemetery, for the purpose of providing a lot for the burial of Ella. It will be difficult to do anything in this respect, because the by-laws of the Cemetery Association on this point forbid such contributions. Perhaps, however,the Association will be able to help in some other manner, unless the management of the Catholic Cemetery offers to provide a burial place free of cost.</p>
