   <p>p. 2, col. 3 - Last night a short meeting of Lodge No. 63, Robert H. Vickers C. S. P. S. "Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek"(Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Association) was held at the Bohemian American Hall on West 18th Street.</p>
   <p>Several communications were read and approved. One communication came from Mrs. Machacek, in which she asked the lodge members for temporary aid. After a brief discussion the members voted to allow Mrs. Machacek the sum of $2.00 weekly until the Bohemian Charitable Association would be able to take care of her and the family. This was a matter of sensible consideration pending the investigation by the Bohemian Charitable Association; besides this, her husband, who was a member of this lodge, is now deceased, and the amount of his insurance sufficed for the burial expenses, so that there was very little left for the family to live on.</p>
   <p>Two members were designated as delegates to inform Mrs. Machacek of the action taken and bring the weekly allowance to her. They are to make a full report at the next meeting.</p>
