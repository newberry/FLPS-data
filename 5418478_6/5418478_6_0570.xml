   <p>The meeting of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was called to order by the president, Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Complaints against the office manager, Mr. Turek, were referred to the grievance committee.</p>
   <p>A family who would be willing to take in a well-brought-up boy fourteen years of age, should apply to Mr. Turek.</p>
   <p>Disbursements for the organization were $148.59. There were 36 applications for assistance; 27 were approved, 2 denied. There were 18 requests for work. Work was found for 6. Medical care was provided in five cases. One person was sent to Oak Forest. Receipts of the evening amounted to $27.</p>
   <p>The next order of business was the discussion about the proposed erection of <pb facs="5418478_6_0571.jpg" n="2"/>the shelter on the lot donated by Mr. F. G. Hajicek. Judge Uhlir announced that our Bohemian contractors are responding and offering their help in the construction of the building and the preparation of the plans. The committee was instructed to refer to the undertaking in the next meeting.</p>
   <p>It was announced that Tag Day falls on April 30, and it was resolved that the proceeds be divided equally between three Bohemian institutions: Saint Joseph's Orphanage, the Utulna a Sirotcinec (The Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association).</p>
   <p>The committee is to present this resolution to the representatives of the other two institutions. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
