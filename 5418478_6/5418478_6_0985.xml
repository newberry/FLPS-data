   <p>The most important duty of every inhabitant of this country is that he obtain for himself citizenship papers and perform his duty as a citizen in regard to elections.</p>
   <p>In this respect there has been among us Bohemians, during the past six years, considerable activity; nevertheless there are still many among us who should have long ago been entitled to a voice in the elections, but who have failed through neglect to obtain the necessary citizenship papers which would give them the right as citizens to enjoy the various privileges of this land. The taking up of citizenship papers does not entail any difficulties because our countrymen citizens J. B. Belohradsky and Prokop Hudekm cheerfully and gladly assist anyone in this respect.</p>
   <p>In spite of the numerous Bohemians here, there are less than 2000 of us who <pb facs="5418478_6_0986.jpg" n="2"/>are citizens. Under these circumstances how can we expect to receive any respect from those in public life, when we dont care about it in the way that is absolutely necessary? Therefore it is the duty of every Bohemian to take out his first or second papers as the case may be, most favorable.</p>
