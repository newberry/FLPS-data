<title level="a">CZECH-AMERICAN GIFT FOR CZECH SCHOOLS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Prague newspapers report that the jubilee donation of one million cents by Czech-Americans to the Central School Association was received on Dec. 31, 1911. The check, amounting to 50,000 crowns, was transmitted by Mr. Korbel, the American Consul.</p>
   <p>"If all of the Czechs took an example from our brethren in America, tens of thousands of Czech children could be saved for the nation." This admonition was printed in the Venkov, a Czech paper of the Agrarian party in Bohemia. The check was not sent by cable but by mail, as it was considered by the Bohemian-American Press Bureau more dignified to accompany the donation with an appropriate letter, explaining the origin and purpose of the gift, and handed over by a committee or a representative man.</p>

   <p>able actor, an altruistic soul. No glittering phrases were heard in this assembly; indeed the words spoken came from the heart, and from the recognition of the values created by Petrtyl's activities.</p>
   <p>Almost all of the "old timers," among the Czech amateur actors who have been in contact with the Chicago Bohemian stage since the seventies, were present; but also many young amateurs who had heard about Petrtyl from their older colleagues did not fail to appear, so that there is no wonder the hall was filled to its capacity.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened with a welcome address by Mr. Pregler, who then read many letters of congratulation, among them one from Mr. Karel Prochazka, veteran amateur actor of Peoria, I11., who points to Petrtyl as "the man who built his own monument." Several other letters moved the gathering to patriotic outbursts which were climaxed by the song "Kde Domov Muj," at the beginning of which the gathering rose to their feet and continued standing throughout the song.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1603.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After Mr. Pregler's address the picture of the man honored was unveiled. It is the work of the Chicago Czech artist Mr. Rudolph Ingerle. Two floral offerings were placed beside it, one from the old settlers, the other from the Chicago amateurs.</p>
   <p>A chorus, fitting the occasion in form and spirit, was then rendered by the singing society, Lyra; it was Bendl's "Pomenka."</p>
   <p>Josef Jurka, the well-known pioneer amateur actor, then pictured the life of Petrtyl, singling out among his virtues, one as the most conspicuous -his unselfishness.</p>
   <p>Petrtyl never worked for gain when on the stage. He considered his services rendered, as a patriotic duty. He was modest, good hearted, friendly, and honest beyond the remotest doubt. With his every art he evoked not only patriotic feelings but also a sense for collaboration, e.g., during the <pb facs="5418478_6_1604.jpg" n="4"/>time of the construction of the Czech National Theatre in Prague, he conceived the idea of chartering a steamer for a trip across the ocean, and on June 1, 1885, that ship took 188 Czech amateur actors from this country to the European shores for a visit to Bohemia. It was on this occasion that he composed the song "Touha Po Vlasti" (Longing for the Land of Birth) mentioned before, and which has become a national song.</p>
   <p>After a rendition by the Lyra of Bendl's chorus "Ta Temnomodra Nebes Ban," Mrs. Karolina Smolar related some interesting stories of the times when she played the theatres with Petrtyl. She did not fail to mention the name of his brother Thomas, who also, as an amateur, deserves the gratitude of his fellow country men. "There are very few men who have consecrated their activities to our national life as these two" she proclaimed.</p>
   <p>A rendition of "Reverie," for the violin by Vieuxtemps, by Miss Mina Polak, pupil of Professor Machek, was followed by an address by Mrs. Ludmila <pb facs="5418478_6_1605.jpg" n="5"/>Veselska in which the distinguished services of Petrtyl were again praised and also his love for the land of his birth was given prominence by the words: "His return to the old country is proof of how he loved his country, how he longed for it. His love for the Czech theatre and the fatherland should be a shining example." Mrs. Antonie Cermak then recited "Slzy Vlastenec" (The Patriot with Tearful Eyes) by Kajetan Tyl.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Mr. Frantisek Zajicek, who called attention to the vigorous activity among societies of the late actor. He was a charter member of the singing society Lyra, and of the society, Lumir. Petrtyl took part in every activity and where he was, enthusiasm and hilarity were never lacking. Several couplets and light songs that have come from Petrtyl's pen give us an insight into his impish humor. His personality radiated sunshine for merry company.</p>
   <p>The late Antonin Petrtyl, who was born in 1830 as one of a large family, came to Chicago in 1871 to better his existence, and although upon his <pb facs="5418478_6_1606.jpg" n="6"/>arrival he was greatly disturbed at the sight of the city shortly after the great conflagration, he began to look for work and succeeded in finding it on Canal Street, in a factory.</p>
   <p>He immediately sought contact with Czech amateur actors and appeared in the title role of "Prazsky Flamender" in the Slovanska Lipa hall, on Taylor street. Soon he was well-known and opened up a tavern which attracted the patronage of all of his fellow countrymen. In 1865 the idea of fitting out a ship for visitors to Bohemia took root, and he left our shores to return in four years. After several years spent in America, he again visited the old country for the Ethnographic Exposition in Prague; he never returned. He died, mourned by his faithful wife, and all his fellow countrymen on both sides of the ocean. His resting place lies in the fold of his beloved Bohemia.</p>
