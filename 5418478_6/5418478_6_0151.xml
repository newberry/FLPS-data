   <p>Not only do those who are trying to dodge military service deserve to be called "slackers," but also those who do not want to become members of the Red Cross. The latter are really not a whit better than ordinary draft dodgers. We all have one and the same duty now when democracy throughout the entire world is at stake. That duty is to help achieve a decisive victory. "Sacrifice" is the slogan. He who is unable to serve in the army must contribute to the cause in some other manner. This is not the time to coddle the weak-kneed and stingy, who tremble at the thought of sacrificing one dollar. On the contrary, everyone should give until it hurts, even if he has to part with his last coin. The man who would not make a sacrifice for a work as sublime as that which is being accomplished by the Red Cross ought to be pitied.</p>
   <p>We think every child knows by this time that words are inadequate to give an appreciation of the noble work done by the Red Cross. Let us just picture <pb facs="5418478_6_0152.jpg" n="2"/>to ourselves one of the boys who are fighting the enemy of all free nations and of those people who long for the liberty which they are denied. He falls wounded. There comes a Red Cross nurse to give him first aid. She has him carried to the field hospital, where she takes care of him as if he were her brother. Can you tell whether he is your own son or husband, brother or friend?</p>
   <p>Christmas is at hand. Our great President expressed the wish of seeing every home adorned with the Red Cross Service Flag. He declared that the Christmas gift which he would really treasure most is this, the flag with the red cross on a white background! The nation will not disappoint its President. We also firmly believe that Czechs will be the first nationality of which every individual will show his patriotism and love for mankind by joining the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the Municipal Court, informs us that <pb facs="5418478_6_0153.jpg" n="3"/>the drive is intensive and is making rapid progress in the Twelfth Ward. He is chairman of the Red Cross organization of that ward. In his opinion every Czech in that district will be a member of the Red Cross by Christmas Day.</p>
   <p>There is one circumstance to which Mr. Cermak called our attention and which, we believe, has a bearing upon other wards also. That is, Red Cross workers frequently do not find their prospects at home. This explains why some windows are still without the Service Flag display. Those who have not been solicited on account of their being absent from home ought to apply at a branch office.</p>
   <p>Here is a list of branch offices: Ward 4--Arthur W. Sullivan, Mark White Square, 30th and Halsted Streets. Ward 10--County Judge T. F. Scully, Czech-American Hall, 1436 West 18th Street. Ward 11--Morris Sabath, 1808 South Ashland Avenue. Ward 12--Otto Kerner, 2349 South Kedzie Avenue. Ward 20--Arkins Hall, 811 Maxwell Street. Ward 27--Murray McLeod, 4261 Irving Park <pb facs="5418478_6_0154.jpg" n="4"/>Boulevard. Ward 29--J. M. Tobey, 1606 West Garfield Boulevard. Ward 30--Thomas J. Healy, Southwest Trust and Savings Bank. Ward 24--Alderman Jos. O. Kostner, Lawndale Club, 3322 Douglas Boulevard. Besides these there are other places in the Twelfth Ward where applications are filed: Cermak and Serhant, 3347 West 26th Street. The Lawndale National Bank, 3343 West 26th Street.</p>
   <p>Those who were not approached by a worker should immediately apply for membership, so as to make come true Mr. Cermak's prediction that "every Czech will have enrolled before Christmas Day."</p>
   <p>Hundreds of our boys have enlisted in the army and navy. For a long time some of them have been in the thick of the combat. Let us not forget our duty. Let us become members of the Red Cross!</p>
