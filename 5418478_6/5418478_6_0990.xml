   <p>The American recognition of the Czechoslovak National Council is a great victory for the Bohemian National Alliance. Four years ago this little body was organized by a small group of men in Chicago, who formed a little society to which they gave the name of the Bohemian National Alliance of America, with the idea of striking a blow for the freedom of Bohemia. For a long time their efforts met with little encouragement, even though the organization spread rapidly into every settlement of the Czech people in this country. But when Masaryk wrote from Switzerland early in 1915, the men of the Alliance saw their task clearly and went about it with a determined mind. Their task was, on the one hand, to back financially the movement organized by Masaryk, which was crystalized into the Czechoslovak National Council; and, on the other hand, to gain the public opinion of the United States and the Government of this country for Czechoslovak independence.</p>
   <p>The work has been long and tiresome. But of the two victories which the men of the Bohemian National Alliance looked forward to, one has already been attained, the Government of the United States has entered into relations with the Czecho-slovak <pb facs="5418478_6_0991.jpg" n="2"/>Government after the other Allied Powers had already given it recognition.</p>
