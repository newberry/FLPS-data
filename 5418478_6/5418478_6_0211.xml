   <p>The theatrical group, Ceske Narodni Dvadlo, (Czech National Theatre) played the three-act burlesque, "Modra Myska" (The Blue Little Mite) by Labich in the hall of the Sokol Chicago last night. It was for the benefit of Mrs. Slavka Svoboda. The play is a model show piece of modern French comedy, and has found its way to the footlights of even the greatest theatres. The piece excels in effective action and thorough theatrical technique. With virtues such as these, and a performance as splendid as given yesterday, it is no wonder the audience was perpetually sustained in a mood of mirth and merriment. The greatest merit has to be assigned to Mrs. Svoboda, who represented "Fanchon Ducloir" alias "Blue Little Mite." Her charming performance justified the high esteem in which her artistic qualities are held. There was joyful, enthusiastic applause, and flower offerings abounded. Probably, the best proof of the popularity <pb facs="5418478_6_0212.jpg" n="2"/>of the artiste was the large crowd which filled the house to its capacity. Those who shared honors with Mrs. Svoboda, or assisted effectively were: Mr. and Mrs. Suva, Mr. and Mrs. Krejoi, Mr. Weidner, Mr. Svoboda, Messrs. Sulc and Keclik. The orchestra, directed by Mr. Jurena, played between acts.</p>
