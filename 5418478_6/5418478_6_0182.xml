   <p>"Editor of the Denni Hlasatel: In looking over the lists in your paper of stores and business houses which give away coupons for the contest conducted by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), I found some stores from which I buy almost all of my supplies. Yet in none of them have I been offered the coupon which is supposed to be given away with every ten-cent purchase. Will you enlighten me about this?</p>
   <p>"(Signed): A Reader of Your Paper,</p>
   <p>"A. P. Chicago, Illinois."</p>
   <p>2611 South Lawndale Avenue,</p>
   <p>Answer by the editor: We intended, originally, to advise you to take the <pb facs="5418478_6_0183.jpg" n="2"/>matter up directly with the Bohemian Charitable Association. However, considering the issue a very important one, we decided to ask the Association for an explanation and obtained the following information:</p>
   <p>The businessmen who have consented to buy the charity coupons and give one away with every ten-cent purchase are listed in your newspaper. There are some among them who present the buyer with a coupon only when asked to do so. It is up to the purchaser to demand the coupons. If this is not neglected, the businessmen will gladly produce the coupons--we mean, of course, only those businessmen who wholeheartedly support our enterprise, the purpose of which is the alleviation of the sufferings of our poor.</p>
