   <p>p.1--On the premises of Mr. Haticek's bank last Friday evening the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association was held. Reports were made of matters connected with the recent dance held on October 26 at the Pilsen Brewery Park, West Twenty-sixth street and Albany avenue.</p>
   <p>The financial committee was not able to give a fiscal report because many tickets have not yet been turned in. The committee therefore urges all those who have tickets to return them, and it also desires that those who have sold tickets shall pay for them at once. All tickets and cash should be turned over to Mr. F. G. Hajicek, the treasurer of the Association.</p>
   <p>Friday's meeting was called to order by the chairman, Judge J. Z. Uhlir, and since the secretary, Mr. C. G. Foucek, sent word that he should be unable to attend the meeting, the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting was postponed to the next meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0639.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A communication from Alderman Anton J. Cermak was read in which he reported the admission of new members and their contributions as follows: Mr. Henry Dvorak, 3301 West Twenty-second street, $10; Mr. Salat, 2116 South St. Louis avenue $5; and Mr. Joseph Cristian, $10.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hajicek gave a financial report up to date. Receipts amounted to $2084.47, and disbursements were $178.50. Consequently the Association's resources are $1905.97, and out of this sum two small bills are still to be paid.</p>
   <p>The chairman further reported that he had been invited two weeks ago to send a Bohemian delegate to represent the Bohemian Charitable Association at the meetings of the Clothing Workers Union, now on strike. Mr. Frank J. Petro had been appointed delegate by the chairman, Mr. Petro then gave a detailed report which was accepted.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0640.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A motion was made and carried that Mr. Petro continue to act as delegate. Thereafter the investigating committee gave its reports, and it was decided that by the next meeting they should submit their reports in detail for October and November.</p>
   <p>A discussion followed concerning the steps to be taken to formulate a systematic plan of investigating the needs of applicants for charity.</p>
   <p>The board expressed its grief over the death of one of its members, Mr. J. Sima, and the secretary was instructed to send a letter of condolence to the family.</p>
   <p>In compliance with a motion made by Mr. Petro, Mr. Otto Fuerst was elected to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Sima's demise.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Mr. Petro suggested that our aldermen should be urged to propose an ordinance providing that instead of numerous tag-days one tag-day be appointed each year for all the charitable associations combined.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0641.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It would then be the duty of the city council to see that the proceeds of this tag-day were devided fairly among all charitable organizations. Besides this it was recommended that businessmen be urged to include the Bohemian Charitable Association among those to whom they make holiday donations.</p>
   <p>Receipts of $27 and disbursements of $5 were then reported and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
