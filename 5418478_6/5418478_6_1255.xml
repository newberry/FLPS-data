   <p>The Significance of Tyrs's Teachings is the name of a booklet published by the National Social Educational Circle J.V. Fric. The booklet contains excellent information about the principles guiding the Sokol gymnastic organizations, for the members themselves and for the public. There is a humanitarian purpose attached to the sale of the pamphlet, for the proceeds are to be turned over to the Czech soldiers. Besides this, the pages are destined to honor the memory of Professor Josef Felix, the valiant Czech politician. All Sokol organizations in the United States, and some branches of the C.N.S. (Czech National League), are to receive copies of the booklet within a few days, and these are expected to be sold in a short time.</p>

   <p>Professor Felix, the author of the booklet, was a candidate on the progressive ticket for the Austrian parliament and took a firm stand against the government. This campaign literature, couched in terms of unrestricted sincerity, was advanced as the reason for a merciless persecution of the author as soon as the war started. Professor Felix was imprisoned and not freed even when his wife, in despair, committed suicide. The brutal soldiery refused him permission to give his wife the last honors. But the brutality of the Austrian henchmen was not fully consummated until it found a means for the complete destruction and elimination of the hated young politician. The latter was recruited for a German-speaking regiment, sent to the Italian front, and there exposed to the most violent machine gun fire. He fell, and that closes the chapter of his sufferings.</p>

   <p>The Beseda Fric publishes the lectures on Tyrs by Professor Felix; the proceeds are to be used for the furthering of the ideal upheld by the martyred professor: The independence of Bohemia. It is incumbent upon the Sokols to help to give it concrete form.</p>
