   <p>"Dear friends, brothers and sisters! Calls for help are reaching us from Italy, Greece, and France. They come from our Czech and Slovak volunteers, from their widows and orphans. Many Czechoslovak volunteers are fighting in Russia and other foreign countries. Their hardships should be relieved by gifts of clothes, underwear, newspapers, and books.</p>
   <p>"We have been tending to the needs of those suffering people since the beginning of the war and have really accomplished more than we had expected. We have given special attention to our soldiers in prison camps; we have sent many thousands of francs to Serbia and large numbers of packages and boxes to Greece for Serbian prisoners and refugees. Last year we sent 30,000 rubles for our people in Russia, and 7,000 francs to France as a Christmas gift; besides this we sent fourteen large boxes of clothing.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0181.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The main medical expedition to Europe originated in our circles, chiefly among female members of our Sokol societies.</p>
   <p>"Today we are sending $1,100 to Paris as a Christmas gift to be distributed among Serbian and Czechoslovak volunteers.</p>
   <p>"We appeal to you to exert your influence, and plead with fellow members of your organizations to pledge themselves to contribute only one cent per month--we are not asking for more--for the support of our humanitarian movement. The amount of money thus realized would suffice for the present.</p>
   <p>"We thank you in advance in the name of our poor people who have been smitten by the war--they are people of our blood.</p>
   <p>"For the Czechoslovak Auxiliary Committee,</p>
   <p>"(Signed): J. F. Stepina, president, Jos. Vostal, secretary, 1735 West 18th Street, Chicago, and members of the Committee."</p>
