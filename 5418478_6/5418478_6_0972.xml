<title level="a">AN AMERICAN ABOUT THE BOHEMIANS IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Not long ago the Rev. E. A. Adams lectured here in the Palmer House, before the Missionary Society, on the subject "Our Bohemian Citizens."</p>
   <p>Before we will start to interpret this very interesting lecture we wish everybody to know that the Rev. Adams, an American lived ten years in Praha (Bohemia, Europe), that he speaks Bohemian and is very well acquainted with all peculiarities of our nation.</p>
   <p>Three to four hundred ladies and gentlemen listened to the lecture which he gave with intense interest.</p>
   <p>Rev. Adams said, "Until 1870 there was in the United States census not a single item regarding Bohemians. Although 4,289 people born in Bohemia <pb facs="5418478_6_0973.jpg" n="2"/>were living here. In 1880 this number grew to 85,361, which proves that every year 8,107 people born in Bohemia have emigrated to America.</p>
   <p>The census of 1880 showed that there were 11,887 Bohemian immigrants in Chicago. This number was a little less than one-seventh of the total Bohemian population in this country. If we should add the number of American born Bohemians to the number that had immigrated from the old country, we would find in Chicago not less than 31,000 Bohemians, and maybe 40,000. The last number is the correct one.</p>
   <p>The research of Mr. Blatchford, and our own experience, shows with very few exceptions not worth mentioning that the Bohemians are living within the city limits in four different districts, or colonies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0974.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>One of the two smaller colonies is concentrated on 25th Street and Portland Avenue, the other one around Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street. As a rule, the Bohemians are mixed among other nationalities and sometime it is a very hard problem to contact them. Their smallest Catholic church is situated on the corner of 25th Street and Portland Avenue. The other two districts, populated by about three fourths of all Bohemians here in Chicago, are more isolated. The smaller district of the two is situated in the region of Bunker and DeKoven streets, between 12th and Taylor streets, extending from Halsted Street to the river. A really large Catholic church of this district is located on DeKoven Street at Desplaines Street. The Bohemians are scattered on Canal Street as far as Canalport Avenue, which links this small colony with the largest one. This section looks like a real Bohemian <pb facs="5418478_6_0975.jpg" n="4"/>town. It is bordered on the east by Fisk and Morgan streets, on the north by 16th Street, on the south by the river. On the West Side the Bohemians are mixed with other nationalities as far as Western Avenue. Their main buildings are in this neighborhood. The largest Catholic church is on 18th and Allport streets, the large hall of the Secret Societies is on 18th Street, one block from Centre Avenue and right now they have started to build a large Bohemian theater at the corner of 18th Street and Center Avenue. A person who is acquainted with Bohemian in Europe, when walking around in this district, feels he is in a regular Bohemian town. It is really like a foreign city.</p>
   <p>In newspaper advertisements and in general they call this part of the city Plzen (Pilsen). It is so strange that it could be taken for a town on the <pb facs="5418478_6_0976.jpg" n="5"/>other side of the Atlantic Ocean. At least 20,000 Bohemians are dwelling in this district and about 10,000 in the district of DeKoven Street. Thus we have in this community of a mile radius 30,000 Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The three Catholic churches which we mentioned represent the faith of our 40,000 Bohemians. Six or eight years ago there were few Protestants among the Bohemians. The percentage of Protestants among the Bohemians is very insignificant.</p>
   <p>Although the three Catholic churches mentioned above are large enough to accommodate 2,500 people, I was informed from a very creditable source that half and maybe two thirds of the local Bohemians are not active members of those churches. I later met two persons who were speaking with entire respect of the Roman-Catholic church and stated that they came to this country as good and faithful Roman-Catholics.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0977.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>However, the more intelligent Bohemians start soon to be dissatisfied with the teachings of the Roman-Catholic Church and seem convinced that this doctrine is not right. They accuse the preachers of being hypocrites. The main cause of this apostasy is the belief that the idea of liberal thinking is a kind of style that one should adhere to regardless of its consequences. We do not suppose that these intellectual Bohemians, coming here, make as good Catholics as the Irish, and we don't think that the majority have mentally grown up to the point of being able to believe in God, or the immortality of the soul.</p>
   <p>The strangest society is the Bohemian-Slovenian Benevolent Society (Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky). I have seen their statutes and have found nothing indecent in them. It is a society whose aim is mutual help and assistance. Morals and obedience to the law are the main duties of the members. The members state themselves that they are not for or against the church, but they are against all forms of worship. They are familiar <pb facs="5418478_6_0978.jpg" n="7"/>with the Catholic religion only, and are against that because of different secret lodges sustained by the church.</p>
   <p>Another achievement of the Bohemians in Chicago is their national cemetery. This idea originated, I was told, as a result of some misunderstanding with the Catholic priest. Now they bury their deceased people entirely without a priest, neither calling him to the house nor to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>The main objection against the churches is their rapacity and the immoral life of the priests.</p>
   <p>Our city has two Bohemian newspapers. A third one appears irregularly, I presume, but I have not seen it. One of them has a circulation greater than the circulation of the other two put together. This paper is a daily publication with a Sunday supplement and its aim is instructive with some <pb facs="5418478_6_0979.jpg" n="8"/>entertaining and colorful articles. It stands firmly against dynamiters and anarchists. Its viewpoint on religion can be seen from the fact that its Sunday supplement has articles, for example, as "Vek Rozumu" (The age of wisdom), which prove that religion does not originate from God but is an invention of human beings, spread through the world through education.</p>
   <p>The other newspaper is spreading anarchistic ideas. It is a publication not only socialistic, but it proclaims further that all institutions of the government are bad and only such men can be called free who do what they please regardless of others. The watchword is "A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye." An extract from this newspaper will be sufficient to convince one of its aims.</p>
   <p>The Rev. E. A. Adams read one article translated in English from the <pb facs="5418478_6_0980.jpg" n="9"/>Bohemian anarchistic publication. He then continued:</p>
   <p>"I have good information that only a small percentage of Bohemians are supporting these ideas, but on the other hand, this newspaper has appeared before as a bi-monthly and now is printed weekly with satisfactory success. Whether the ideas of this paper are true or not, they are nevertheless spread and with no opposition on our part. Maybe the church has no influence on the intelligent classes. Our Protestants are inactive. The best proof of this is that nine different Bohemian Bibles are here in circulation. Their theories lead towards disorganization, anarchy and destruction, although we do not believe that would be really a desire of these Bohemians who are now spreading the ideas of unbelief and skepticism.</p>
   <p>I presume it was Voltaire who, during a discussion with his friend about atheism, said: "Wait until my servants will be far away from here. I do not want to have my throat cut during the night."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0981.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>My personal opinion is that the result of the atheism always must be anarchism. I was advised by my missionary authority in this city to call meetings for Bohemians and to give lectures to them. There were distributed one thousand pamphlets Friday, with the announcement that services would be held on Sundays. This also was advertised in the Bohemian paper, I had expected a dozen or at the most twenty Bohemians present, but there appeared about seventy-five, who listened very diligently to my lecture. The following Sunday 200 appeared. The fifth Sunday there were only seventy. Two evening meetings were arranged. The evening audience was first twelve in number, then twenty persons. I have sold nine Bibles and received orders for more. This will serve as proof how little influence a church has on its most faithful members.</p>
   <p>Atheism is spreading among the people who have retrogressed from the church, more than I thought. They are instructed and they believe that Thomas Paine was the main agent of the deliverance of this country, and <pb facs="5418478_6_0982.jpg" n="11"/>that his principles are the only ones which assure the freedom of humanity. The whole missionary work among these Bohemians was accomplished by the scholar, Robert Ingersoll, and we are still in possession of his documents and literature. If his works are read by the Bohemians, I do not know. The Bohemians are very economical, quiet, obedient and capable. They have their own building loan associations and they are building many beautiful houses around Western Avenue.</p>
   <p>Regarding their political attitude, I have very scanty information, but I think they adhere firmly to the country which guaranteed their liberty. They observe with caution each stranger who approaches them, for they do not trust him, but when they perceive sincerity, they cling to him.</p>
   <p>The experience gained by me in Praha convinces me that their work here will need plenty of patience, and if I am not mistaken in their enthusiasm <pb facs="5418478_6_0983.jpg" n="12"/>for any enterprise that they start. I am full of hope that in time they can be transformed into most reliable American citizens. They are here for their own and our benefit.</p>
   <p>Should they be let alone and exposed to the injurious influences of this country, they will bring harm to us and to themselves."</p>
   <p>The Rev. Adams mentioned, then, the conditions of different English churches and added finally: "We intended to construct a mission building in the district encircling Halsted, 16th, 12th streets and the river. For the proper enlightenment of the Bohemians a building worth $15,000 is needed."</p>
   <p>All statements of Rev. Adams seem to be true and show that he is very well <pb facs="5418478_6_0984.jpg" n="13"/>acquainted with our conditions. There is only one thing mentioned by Rev. Adams to which we must offer protest, namely, that we will not harm anyone even if we do not believe in religion, and that such a person should not perish either likewise.</p>
