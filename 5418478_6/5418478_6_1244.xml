   <p>In these momentous times, when the future of our old homeland is at stake, many an example of self-sacrifice and patriotic sentiment has been given by individuals and associations. Some persons contributed money up to the amount of $1,000, and clubs and societies have given thousands of dollars. There is one association, however, which surprised the entire Czech-American public by its patriotic generosity, namely; The "Sokol Slavoj" in Tabor (Merigold) in the thriving Sokol community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Sokol Slavoj has donated two lots valued at $3000 to the Czech National Association; the property was to be used for the building of a new gymnastic hall. It will be sold now in a raffle on the occasion of the next bazaar of the National Association.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1245.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Sokol Slavoj is one of the most active of its kind. It does not have many members, yet it has done, not only relatively, but absolutely, more than other associations of twice its membership. It has induced the Czech population in the vicinity of its home to work for the Czech cause during the War. The gift to the National Association represents one full half of the Sokol Slavoj's property now.</p>
