<title level="a">THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DRUZINA CESKOSLOVENSKYCH LEGIONARU V CHICAGU</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The year 1920 goes down in the history of the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu (Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago) as a period of successful organization. It is evidenced not only by the fact that our own membership has doubled, but also by the fact that two new legionnaire organizations were established--one in Racine, Wisconsin and one in Whiting, Indiana. It is also only proper to mention that the philanthropic activity of the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu led to the establishment of a new ladies' organization under the name "Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago". This organization will play an important part in future projects of the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu.</p>
   <p>The purpose which the Druzina outlined in its program--to provide aid for unfortunate brothers or their families--was fulfilled as successfully as <pb facs="5418478_6_1058.jpg" n="2"/>possible. Altogether, the sum of $1,116 was paid out for this purpose. The sum of $695 was paid out in loans to brothers. One hundred and eighty dollars and fifty cents was donated to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the Druzina mournfully recollects the loss of two brothers, Messrs. Nanysta and Marsalek, whom an unmerciful fate snatched away just when they reached the prime of life.</p>
   <p>Success attained by the Druzina in its philanthropic and national work fills us with pleasure. The zenith of this philanthropic activity was reached in the month of September when with the co-operation of Sokols and our foremost national Free Thought and charitable organizations, the Bazar Svobody (Liberty Bazaar), for the benefit of widows and orphans of our fallen legionnaires, was arranged. The proceeds of this noble project amounted to eighteen thousand dollars. The Druzina also participated in the fourth drive of the American Red Cross.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1059.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is also necessary to mention that the Druzina co-operated at President Thomas G. Masaryk's birthday celebration. Proof of the Druzina's loyalty to the United States was manifested by its participation in the Memorial Day parade down town.</p>
   <p>With the co-operation of the central district of the American Sokol Union and the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers, the anniversary day of Czechoslovak independence was celebrated in Pilsen Park on the twenty-eighth day of October.</p>
   <p>One of the most important steps, but, to our regret, one not generally comprehended, was the attempt to reorganize the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America). The legionnaires, noticing the evident decline in national activities, attempted to counteract the indifference which is noticeable at the present time. They thought that conditions might improve if the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe were reorganized.</p>
   <p>Although the Druzina did not feel competent to attempt the restoration <pb facs="5418478_6_1060.jpg" n="4"/>itself, it was forced by the public to make the attempt; and with the help of Sokols and other national organizations, the necessary steps were taken in this matter. That action of this sort is very difficult and required time is self-evident. No matter what results are achieved, the Druzina feels that it has performed its duty.</p>
   <p>We must also mention the change of officers during the month of May after Brother L. Kaderka, former president, and Brother Vosatko, former secretary, resigned. Brother Frana Klepal and Brother Vladimir Belehrad were elected president and secretary, respectively.</p>
   <p>At this opportunity the Druzina wishes to express its gratitude to the Czechoslovak people of Chicago for favors manifested at all of its projects. It also wishes to express the gratitude of those orphans and widows in Czechoslovakia who received aid which had been provided for them from the proceeds of the Bazar Svobody, through the efforts of the Czechoslovak people of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1061.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>For the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu,</p>
   <p>Frana Klepal, President,</p>
   <p>Vladimir Belehrad, Secretary.</p>
