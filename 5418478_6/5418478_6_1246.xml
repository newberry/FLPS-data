   <p>Saturday night proved to be a most successful ending for the Allied bazaar. Fifty-five thousand visitors entered the hall, and about ten thousand had to be turned back. Among these more than one half were of Slavic nationality. This could be gathered from conversations, and in no lesser degree from the peals of applause that followed the playing of the anthems of the diverse Slavic nations, and finally, after the performances of pieces in any of the Slavonic tongues.</p>
   <p>Among those who contributed to the entertainment was Mr. A. V. Cerny, music conductor, who deserves unreserved praise. It was around his stand that the largest crowds could be seen. But the cabaret also, where Slavonic songs were rendered, and Slavonic dances executed, was a center of attraction. Mr. Bubenicek with his violin, and Miss Martinek, furnished the music for the cabaret, while the Moravian <pb facs="5418478_6_1247.jpg" n="2"/>dances were performed by the Bohemian Educational Club, and the Workingmen's Czech-American Sokol, as were the dances from the "Bartered Bride." The Slovak dance, "Odzemek," was exhibited by Mr. Bagl.</p>
   <p>The financial yield of the bazaar is estimated to reach $500,000. In the Czech pavilion alone, over $5000 was collected.</p>
