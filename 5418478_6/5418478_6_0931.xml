   <p>Everyone believed that the idea, which was brought up several years ago, of uniting all Bohemian societies into one powerful whole, was forgotten and peacefully slumbering with the rest of our proposed national projects, which were called to life on various occasions. We hear from reliable sources, all of a sudden that the idea is again to be considered this time more forcefully. Perhaps it has awakened the more powerful interests of our people and should therefore be capable of realization.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt, that opponents to the idea of uniting the Bohemian socieites will again be found and that they will, as before, agitate against such a move. That however should not prevent discussion of the matter, and best methods sought to promote this project, which would greatly strengthen our national existence in this land. It can be accomplished. There are obstacles, certainly, but we must seek a way to remove them then everything will go forward smoothly. Perhaps more progress will be made with the plan for an old people's home and orphanage undertakings, which should not be forgotten.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0932.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If our societies unite, and we hope they will let them not forget to say: In the same manner in which we care for our brothers and sisters, our Bohemian schools and the preservation of our Bohemian language in this land; so also do we wish to care for our forsaken old people and our forlorn orphans. Therefore we take it upon ourselves as a duty, not only to build an old people's home as soon as possible,but to safeguard its existence.</p>
   <p>"This will be child's play for us if we unite in one whole, because tried and true is the saying: 'In union there is strength."</p>
