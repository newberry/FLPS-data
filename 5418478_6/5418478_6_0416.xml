   <p>A monthly meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held in its offices at 2603 South Kedzie Avenue last Friday night. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir.....</p>
   <p>Secretary Vaclav Vanek reported....that sixty-three men had applied for work, and employment was secured for twenty-three of them.....</p>
   <p>John A. Sokol, chairman of the Fifth Charitable Ball committee, reported that the income from the ball at the present time amounts to $1,723.47, and there are bills amounting to $219.56 to be paid. This makes a net of $1,503.81, but there are many tickets outstanding. Thus, most probably, the net will increase to about $1,800 when all tickets are returned or paid for.....</p>

The daily Spravedlnost never supports the Spolecnost in any way whatsoever, and by its street-Arab fashion of attack, is trying to harm the Spolecnost. If Spravedlnost wants some improvement, it has its representative in the Spolecnost. All he has to do is come to the meeting and present the desired proposals.....</p>
