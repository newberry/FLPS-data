   <p>Dear Compatriots:</p>
   <p>A wide, dangerous, and often destructive, ocean separates us from our brothers and sisters in the old country. Still we are close to each other.</p>
   <p>We are united by that which does not succumb to the laws of remoteness, space, or time.</p>
   <p>In the historic places, where the noble soul, our beloved Jan Hus, the master, preached zealously, stands the house of Vojta Naprstek, on which is inscribed: "What the heart unites, the ocean cannot divide!"</p>
   <p>Just as we are separated from our old country by unbounded seas, so here, we, who sought and found a new country, are separated by great distances, plains,</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1541.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>and mountains. But it is not only geographical distances which separate us, but the variety of occupations, surroundings, and personal interests.</p>
   <p>We are still one. We developed from one, one Bohemian heart unites us, the Bohemian spirit, the origin dating back thousands of years of our beloved Bohemian nation, our Bohemian blood wantonly shed and destroyed, and still ever being re-born and rejuvenated to a better life.</p>
   <p>To all of you, descendants of Bohemian blood, who are separated from us by distance, but never in the heart, we call: Come and be with us on the day which, through the display of the united strength of our people here in this strange land, will be a significant Slavonic holiday. Come to honor the modest parents of a modest son, a genuine democrat, the enlightened fighter, our Karel Havlicek Borovsky.</p>
   <p>Karel Havlicek has a monument in Bohemian history more durable than stone or <pb facs="5418478_6_1542.jpg" n="3"/>metal, because the people have inscribed him into their hearts, and the nation realized a great loss in the Brixen martyr.</p>
   <p>A group of enthusiastic Bohemian-American patriots of Chicago, who were joined by the general Bohemian public, erected a monument to this remarkable patriot. This, with the whole Bohemian-American branch, and American fellowcitizens participating, will be unveiled on July 30, in one of the beautiful parks near the heart of Bohemian life in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We glorify this remarkable patriot in the spirit of his work for the Bohemian people, and for that reason we want not only to remember his merits, but to draw closer with those who want to contribute and work with us, so that our people may continue to live, create, and excel in America. Thus, best will we honor the memory of this exemplary Bohemian patriot.</p>
   <p>All of you who come to celebrate with us will be our guests. Let the motto <pb facs="5418478_6_1543.jpg" n="4"/>in all places where the Bohemian tongue is heard be: "July 30 is Havlicek's festive day throughout Bohemian-America."</p>
   <p>With sincere best wishes, for the Karel Havlicek Borovsky Monument Association, and for the Bohemian-American National Council.</p>
   <p>E. St. Vraz.</p>
