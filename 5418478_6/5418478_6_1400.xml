   <p>A meeting of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) was held under the chairmanship of Dr. Ludwig Fisher in the building of the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola Vojta Naprstek (Bohemian Free Thought School Vojta Naprstek) two days ago. The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni in America is an organization whose purpose it is to establish a large enough fund with which to help in mitigating the misery, sorrows, and economic losses of those who are suffering because of the present war. This fund is to be built up by organizaing collections in the United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>In addition to this action, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni is planning a campaign of effective propaganda for the purpose of imforming the general public about the historic desires of the Bohemian-Slavonic nation in Bohemia, <pb facs="5418478_6_1401.jpg" n="2"/>Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia.</p>

The report was received with thanks and approval.....</p>
   <p>The chairman announced the formation of several auxiliary organizations and outlined the results that have been achieved so far in the negotiations toward the unification of all Bohemian organizations into one great body. After a protracted debate, a number of proposals were agreed upon which aim toward the unification of all such organizations so that they will not lose their individuality and independence of action.</p>
   <p>Professor Jaroslan J. Zmrhal outlined broadly the plan of the propaganda campaign and called the meeting's special attention to the English lecture about the Bohemians which will take place at the Chicago Press Club within the next few days. He also reported on the fact that he sent several</p>
