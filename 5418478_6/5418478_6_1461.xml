   <p>The Bohemian committee on arrangements for the welcome party for Dr. Pavel Blaho [a Slovak leader, active both in eastern Moravia and among the Slovak people in the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy] held a meeting in Mr. Ant. Korbel's offices on Twelfth Boulevard last night. The committee noted with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction that the event, in the arrangement for which the Bohemian committee is co-operating with the Slovak committee appointed for the same purpose as the Bohemian committee, is evoking much more interest than had been anticipated. This is manifested by the very lively sale of admission tickets both for the lecture and the banquet. Both Slovaks and Bohemians, mostly business and professional men, are making sure that they will be able to attend. The reserved seats for the lecture sell for twenty-five cents and can be purchased at the American State Bank, Blue Island Avenue and 18th Street, or from Mr. Emil Bachman, 1719 South Center Avenue. At both places reservations can be made for the banquet, which will be held immediately after the speech at the Pilsen Auditorium Tuesday night.</p>

   <p>....The evening will no doubt serve to create a better understanding between the members of these two branches of one people and to strengthen their ties of friendship. Both during the lecture part of the evening and during the banquet, there will be a rich musical program.....</p>
