<title level="a">MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held their meeting last Friday. When the vice-chairman called the meeting to order, most of the directors were present. Secretary Vaclav Vanek read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved. The management of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) sent a letter of thanks for the donation of $25.</p>
   <p>A letter was received from a Bohemian family of Charles Mix County, South Dakota, asking the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost for help because a crop failure and the loss of a horse has left them in want. Because the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is bound by its bylaws to help only the poor of Chicago, it was agreed to reply recommending that the Bohemian newspapers be asked for assistance. The report of our agent, Mr. Otto, was an extensive one, and an expenditure of $240.10 was noted, mostly for rents.</p>

   <p>At this meeting the donations were accepted and receipted, totaling $217.50. The next meeting, the annual one, will be called on February 6 at Pilsen Park, Albany Avenue and 26th Street. All members of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost will be invited, and vacancies on the board of directors will be filled.</p>
