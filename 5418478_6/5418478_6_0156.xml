   <p>Exceedingly feverish activity in behalf of the Red Cross has begun in every Czech district of Chicago, and we are convinced that the Czech community will be able to point to a very remarkable success in this Christmas drive for the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The district called Czech California, especially the Twelfth Ward, is outdoing all others in the intensity of its effort. Many of its houses have been visited by zealous workers who have explained very thoroughly why it is our duty to join the Red Cross, the value of whose work for suffering humanity words cannot describe.</p>
   <p>We have already mentioned the opening of a Red Cross branch in the Twelfth Ward. This branch is located in the hall of Mr. Joseph Placek's place, at 2347 South Kedzie Avenue. It owes its beginning to the efforts of <pb facs="5418478_6_0157.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the Municipal Court. Everybody is welcome in that office. Yesterday it was visited by a countless number of people who showed an eagerness to give their services in this Campaign, for the purpose of increasing the membership of such a humanitarian institution. Messrs. Otto Kerner and Joseph Novak, aldermen of the Twelfth Ward, officiated in the new branch. Both assured us that they have plenty of work to do and that they are glad to have it to do. Mrs. Paulina Prince is in charge of the women's division and is being kept as busy as the aldermen. Sometimes, when she is out approaching prospective members, a substitute is left at the office.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Prince has already visited every school in the Twelfth Ward and also Harrison High School. In Harrison High School she succeeded in organizing an additional branch, which consists of a group of one hundred Senior girls. This little army of young workers has already begun activities. It is divided into small squads, which work on the streets and from house to house. These squads do not omit a single house and do not miss a chance to recruit <pb facs="5418478_6_0158.jpg" n="3"/>members for the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Mr. Evans, principal of Farragut School, 28th Street and Sawyer Avenue, is mentioned by Mrs. Prince for his enthusiasm in co-operating with her in organizing the campaign. Farragut School, Mrs. Prince learned, has a club called the Civic Club, the assistance of which she immediately enlisted. Every one of its members has already reported to the branch office in Mr. Placek's hall and has sought to become a member, and to volunteer his or her services.</p>
   <p>We urge everyone to display the Red Cross Service Flag, in order that on Christmas Day every house in the Czech districts may be decorated with the red cross on a white background.</p>
   <p>The Thirty-fourth Ward also is very active. There is to be a meeting tonight in the Douglas Park Auditorium, at Kedzie and Ogden Avenues. The Tenth, the Eleventh, the Twenty-ninth, and the Thirtieth Wards, all with a <pb facs="5418478_6_0159.jpg" n="4"/>strong percentage of Czechs, are no less vigorously engaged in the drive. Therefore, the achievements of the Czechs will surely be conspicuous.</p>
