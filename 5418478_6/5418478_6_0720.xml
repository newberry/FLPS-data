   <p>The last months of Robert L. Pitte's life, former notary public and private banker, were marked by a violent slide down the inclined plane. After January 29, when he was no longer able to conceal the nefarious manipulations with his fellow-countrymen's funds, he declared voluntary bankruptcy ..... Mental anguish may have given the impulse to his first attempt at suicide. He was found unconscious, in Jackson Park, in the cold, February 20, but his life was saved. He succeeded, however, in his second effort. His body, head crushed and limbs broken, was discovered in a semi-dark narrow enclosure in the rear of the house 1722 South Wabash Avenue. The manner in which he departed from this world is surrounded by mystery. In any case, the Coroner's physician decided upon suicide by leaping from a platform of the Elevated Railroad .....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0721.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The delinquent banker lived in hiding at his relatives' until arrested on February 13. Judge Bernard Barasa, of the Municipal Court, adjourned his case until March 14. After this, Pitte was subjected to several severe grillings by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, of the Federal Court. On these occasions, his pernicious activities were duly exposed. He was finally turned over to the Grand Jury on March 14.</p>
   <p>The news of Pitte's death created much sensation in Chicago, and especially in the Czech community, but caused not much surprise. Many knew that R. L. Pitte had desperately hoped at the last moment for a rescue by the political influence of his son, Hugo Pitte, former Alderman of the 20th Ward, who is at present secretary of the Cook County Civil Service Commission. He, himself, was a member of the firm Robert L. Pitte &amp; Son.</p>
   <p>Pitte was born 1846 in Blatna, Bohemia. His parents were poor, but he being an unusually bright boy, had interested Count Hildebrandt, who <pb facs="5418478_6_0722.jpg" n="3"/>provided for the education that made him a school teacher. He came to America in 1868, then married his fiancee from the old country. He worked first as an engraver, also taught in Czech schools in our community, and finally opened an office as notary public on 20th Street, near Halsted Street. As a notary public, he was known to be very efficient, and in our community he was very active, having been one of the founders, and the first musical director of the Czech singing society, Lyra. He also was at one time secretary of the Cesko Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho- Slavonic Benevolent Society). At one time he was music director of the Senefelder Liederkranz, a large German singing society. In the latter, and in Czech societies, he frequently appeared as soloist. His beautiful tenor voice was widely admired. The German singers presented him with a ring as a token of appreciation. Of Pitte it can be said that he began splendidly, and ended miserably. This, after all, is the doom of most dishonest bankers.</p>
