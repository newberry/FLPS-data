  <body>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) is five years old. It was founded in February 1910, and, in the five years of its existence, it has done a great deal of unselfish, philanthropic work having paid out $20,000 for the support of poor Bohemians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the annual meeting held February 6 the following directors were elected for three years: Judge J. Z. Uhlir, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, Mr. F. J. Petru, Mr. Roman Sedlacek, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, Mr. Chas. Novak, Mr. J. Nedbal, Mr. Jos. C. Pisa, and Mr. Jan Chrastka.</p>
   <p>The following directors remain for one more year of service: Reverend Vaclav Vanek, Mr. Anton Schnabl, Mr. John A. Sokol, Mr. Jan Klekr, Mr. J. A. Hospodsky for the Denni Hlasatel, Mr. Karel J. Krasny for the Svornost, Mr. Jan W. Voller for the Narod, and Mr. Frank Gruener for the Spravedlnost.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0371.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Tag Day of the Spolecnost was held on Decoration Day and netted $1,310.36. The annual charity ball of September 28 brought $1,692.16.</p>
   <p>December 24 was the day on which Christmas presents were distributed to the poor. For this cause the Spolecnost had received donations from various sources. Groceries, clothing, toys and cash to the amount of $1,179.65 were received. The sum of $661.59 was spent for that occasion, which left $518.06 that was turned over to the general fund of the Spolecnost.</p>
   <p>This was a critical year, and the poorest the Spolecnost has had. Thousands of men with families had lost their jobs, there was widespread need, and hundreds of families were asking for support. The treasurer's report shows the following facts: Expenditures in 1914, $7,281.55; in 1913, $4,995.80....Income in 1914, $2,875.49. Without the balance left in the treasury from 1913, there would be a deficit of $4,406.06 this year.....</p>
   <p>During 1914, the Spolecnost paid out for the rents of its charges $507.50; cash <pb facs="5418478_6_0372.jpg" n="3"/>donations, $444.32; for groceries, $360.82; for loans $99.08; for medicines, coal, and clothing $42.09. The office expenditures, including salaries and the rent, were $1,324.54.....</p>
