   <p>The day before yesterday we talked with Mr. Jos. A. Holpuch, a member of the Chicago Board of Education and treasurer of the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor (Bohemian Relief Committee), who gave us some information which will be of interest to our public. In the first place, he showed us a complete list with the names of those who contributed any money whatever for the immediate relief of those who have suffered in any way by the "Eastland" disaster.</p>
   <p>The list shows that during the first day of the collection $1,295 was donated. This amount was deposited in the bank on July 27. The next day $1,043 was deposited. July 29 added $818 to the bank account and yielded an additional contribution of $1,709, which was deposited the following day, during which $422 was collected. The amount of $940.75 was deposited August 2, $1,150.95 August 3, <pb facs="5418478_6_0269.jpg" n="2"/>$337 August 4, $33 August 5, $677.05 August 6, and $65 August 7, so that the total amount in the bank is now $8,490.75.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holpuch hopes that more money will be forthcoming, particularly from pledges which have not yet been honored, and also from individuals who have not yet made a contribution. He advised us that he will publish a complete list of donors in the daily press. Those who wish to see their names on that list and have not yet done their purely humane duty may send their contributions either to the Denni Hlasatel, or direct to Mr. Jos. A. Holpuch at 3734 West 26th Street, so that the list may be completed at an early date. A great deal of help will be needed. Therefore, let every one of us open not only our hearts and lips, but also our pocketbooks, and give as much as is possible, in accordance with our individual means.</p>
   <p>We were also advised that the money collected has not been delivered to the general fund for which it was originally destined, but that it is being held for the present by Mr. Holpuch. It will be surrendered to the general fund <pb facs="5418478_6_0270.jpg" n="3"/>only in the event that the committee making the distribution will decide on an immediate division among those who are left in need, and that the whole amount collected will so be divided. If, however, the committee should abide by its intention to keep the money for a longer time (four years) and dole out only the interest on the capital, the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor will retain the money and make an immediate and complete distribution only among our countrymen who need help. It is Bohemian money and has been collected for Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>As we reported a few days ago, a delegation composed of Mr. Jos. A. Holpuch, City Clerk John Siman, and Alderman John Toman called on Mayor Thompson with a request that Bohemians should be included in the committee in charge of administering the fund which the Mayor himself had been responsible for initiating. This request was based on the fact that the Bohemians were relatively most affected by the catastrophe. The Mayor informed the delegation that the committee was no longer in existence because its work had been completed, and the money collected which amounted to over $300,000, exclusive of $100,000 <pb facs="5418478_6_0271.jpg" n="4"/>donated by the Western Electric Company, had been turned over to the American Red Cross.</p>
   <p>He advised our men to call on Mr. Simpson, who would be able to give them additional information. They did so and were advised to see Mr. Whicknell [sic; an earlier article has Bickwell] of Washington, D. C., who, they were informed, was in the city. He informed them that he would not give the Bohemians any stronger representation than one man on the committee. That is what Mr. Whicknell did, and our men selected Chief Bailiff Anton J. Cermak, of the municipal court, who has done most of the work in connection with the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor, which he organized.</p>
   <p>Now, if Mr. Cermak should find that the committee in charge of the distribution of the money does not propose to do the right thing for the Bohemian victims of the catastrophe, he would simply resign from that committee. The Cesky Vypomocny Vybor would then immediately distribute the money held by Mr. Holpuch among the Bohemians most urgently in need. The same procedure would be followed if the <pb facs="5418478_6_0272.jpg" n="5"/>Red Cross decided to hold the money and distribute the interest only, in the form of some kind of pension, a plan to which even Mayor Thompson is opposed.</p>
