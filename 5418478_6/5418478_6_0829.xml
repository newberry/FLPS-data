   <p>American citizens of foreign origin are quite often censured because they cannot forget the country where they were born, where they lived the happy days of their childhood, and where their friends and relatives are still living. Memories like that cannot be wiped out as easily as a chalk mark off a blackboard. Only those people who themselves do not feel the touch of childish gratitude and love could, in their patriotic enthusiasm, go that far and ask that much of their fellow citizens of foreign birth.</p>
   <p>If an American-born citizen who should happen to live for several years in a foreign country renounced his American fatherland and severed all connections with the United States, then he would be censured for it and would be justly blamed. But the same thing is asked of others, and they are told that it is their duty to do so.</p>
