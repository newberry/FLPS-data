   <p>Yesterday more baskets were distributed among the poor of the Czech community. The charitable enterprise was a success, although many more cases might have been covered. The Czech Charitable Society does not have unlimited resources, but is really swamped with requests for regular relief. Thanks to the generosity of the public it has brought joy to many destitute families.</p>
   <p>Over four hundred baskets of tasty food and delicacies were delivered. Their value ranged from four to eight dollars. The larger baskets were for families with several children. Every case was carefully investigated before it received a basket.</p>
   <p>By last Friday two hundred baskets had been distributed through the good offices of Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the Municipal Court, and <pb facs="5418478_6_0143.jpg" n="2"/>two hundred and twenty-five baskets were given away later. In former years the clients were required to call for the baskets at the Pilsen Park Brewery pavilion. This year that practice was discontinued and the gifts were delivered to the homes.</p>
   <p>This year Mr. Stanislav Loula, president of the Czech Charitable Society and a large corps of the Ladies' section were occupied with the distribution of the baskets. For their delivery six cars and two trucks were furnished by the Czech Masonic Lodge, Bohemia. Also, several cars owned by individuals were placed at the disposal of the Society. The fact that some of these cars were driven by their owners enabled the owners to pay particular attention to the needs of the poor.</p>
   <p>The distribution is not yet really finished. Some baskets are still coming in. No family should be wanting on Christmas Day. The number of baskets might still be increased.</p>
   <p>The officers and members of the Society, as well as the many individual <pb facs="5418478_6_0144.jpg" n="3"/>contributors, deserve the gratitude of the public.</p>
