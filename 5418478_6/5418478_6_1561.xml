   <p>The spacious Thalia hall was filled again to capacity last night. The occasion being the benefit performance for Frankish and Bee Lockney. "Mora Mays," (The Blue Mouse) , a French comedy in three acts was performed. Mrs Lockney gave a remarkable performance as the "Blue Mouse". Frankish Lockney, although his part in the play was somewhat thankless, did very well. Others taking part in the performance were: Jericho Weiner, as the crafty secretary; Frank Luke, as the father of the secretary's wife, and Frankish Hilary, as the secretary's friend. All of the other minor roles were well played so that the performance, as a whole was excellent as usual. The actors received many floral offerings, which, in addition to the hearty applause, were the reward and appreciation of their eighteen years of active work in the local Bohemian theater.</p>
