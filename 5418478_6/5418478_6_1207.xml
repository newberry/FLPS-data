   <p>The directorate of the Cyrillo-Methodejsky Pomocny Fond [Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund] is sending out an appeal to the Czechoslovak public asking for whole-hearted co-operation in the movement for the independence of Czechoslovak lands. It begins as follows:</p>
   <p>"Immediately after the outbreak of the World War, when the movement for the liberation of our old homeland from the yoke of German domination was still dormant within the national consciousness of the Czechoslovaks of America, Czech Catholics founded the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund, which took upon its shoulders the task of alleviating the sufferings of the Czechoslovak people of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. Ten thousand dollars was collected for this purpose the first <pb facs="5418478_6_1208.jpg" n="2"/>year. The sending of the money to Europe presented great difficulties. The collection was, therefore, deposited in Chicago, and the ardor for further contributions cooled off. Conditions have changed considerably within the last two years. We became aware of the fact that to support the destitute of the old homeland was not fulfilling all that was required of the patriotic Czechoslovaks of America. It became obvious that vigorous action should be taken to create and strengthen a movement for the liberation of Czechoslovak lands, which once were united under the crown of St. Venceslas (St. Vincent). A mass meeting of the Czech Catholics was called for January 14th, 1917, to be held in Chicago. On that memorable occasion, it was resolved to extend the activities and power of the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund so that it would be able to take part in the movement of liberation. A "Proclamation of Principles" was issued to give the movement body and soul. This granted the directorate the right to draw on the money accumulated in the Fund up to January 14th, and divert from it to the <pb facs="5418478_6_1209.jpg" n="3"/>action of liberation as much as might be deemed necessary.</p>
   <p>"Additional steps had to be taken in order to make the work of the directorate feasible. A conference was held in Chicago on February 6th of the same year; the Czech clergy and high officials of Czech Catholic organizations took part, as well as many prominent laymen. On that day, the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku [National Alliance of Czech Catholics] was formed. Its executive committee of seven was to give its entire care to the support of the action of liberation within the scope of the "Proclamation of Principles" issued January 14th. Statutes and rules for both the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics were laid down in the Chicago conference. In accordance with these statutes, the management of the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund was transferred into the hands of a directorate of nine members. The Fund and the Alliance started concerted action concerning the relief of the destitute in the old homeland, and also the propagation of the cause <pb facs="5418478_6_1210.jpg" n="4"/>of liberation.</p>
   <p>"It soon became evident, however, that the two different activities for relief and for politico-national propaganda were interfering with one another: The Alliance, with its widespread work, needed more financial support, whereas the Fund could not utilize the money contributed explicitely for relief; it could deposit it only, for there was not a ghost of a chance to divert it into the channels of its ultimate purpose before the War was ended. It was, therefore, the Alliance which suffered by the combined activities.</p>
   <p>"In consideration of these circumstances, the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund realized that further collections for its original purposes had to be stopped until after the War, when the relief work shall be resumed. We have, therefore, decided to let the National Alliance of Czech Catholics have a free hand completely in the employment of <pb facs="5418478_6_1211.jpg" n="5"/>money collected, and we implore the Czech Catholics to continue their support of the Alliance. All contributions for whatever purpose shall henceforth be turned over to the Alliance. When the War ends in victory for us, and of this we are sure, we shall start anew our action for the relief of our brethren in the old homeland.</p>
   <p>"We are requesting all branches of the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund until the end of the War to consider themselves members of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics only, and to work as best they can for the financial support of this organization by turning over collections to the Alliance's treasury exclusively.</p>
   <p>"The money which has been collected up to January 14th is deposited in the shape of mortgages bearing five per cent interest."</p>
   <p>For the directorate of the Cyril and Methodius Auxiliary Fund, Signed: Chicago, July 10, 1917.</p>
   <p>Reverend A. J. Novacek, president,</p>
   <p>John W. Voller, secretary.</p>
