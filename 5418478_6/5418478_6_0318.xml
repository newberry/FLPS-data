   <p>The political activity for the liberation of our old country is developing nicely in spite of the stabs in the back it is getting from petty people and the ill will of those who think they are great, but unrecognized. That our people feel the seriousness of these times is evident by the figures on hand showing that money is flowing into Chicago from various parts of the United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>The largest donation ever received by the Chicago headquarters of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) was delivered yesterday by an enthusiastic national worker in our Town of Lake, Mr. Rudolf Vacek, banker. The amount, $1,651.36, is the result of the diligence of many workers and the generosity of many contributors.....From a community outside of Chicago, Racine, Wisconsin, $500 was received. The donation was collected on the occasion of a celebration and proves the Jonas settlement, the settlement of <pb facs="5418478_6_0319.jpg" n="2"/>the greatest of all Bohemian-American welfare work, is following its leader with an enthusiasm worthy of the highest recognition. Especial recognition and an expression of deep appreciation is due the Ceske Sesteska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood). Its donation was $1,200.....</p>
   <p>Through the initiative of the Chicago Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, the first Narodni Sdruzeni in Canada has been organized at Michel, British Columbia.....</p>
