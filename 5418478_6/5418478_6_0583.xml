<title level="a">MEETING OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held a meeting Friday evening. Judge J. Z. Uhlir presided. The minutes of the two previous meetings were read and approved. The secretary, Mr. Otto R. Fuerst, tendered his resignation, which was accepted. The Reverend Doctor Vaclav Vanek was elected temporary secretary.</p>
   <p>During the period from December 29 to January 26, the following amounts were paid out: coal for sixteen families, $62; groceries for twenty-four families, $94.28; rent for nine families, $64.50; office expenses, $63.05; shoes and clothing for nine families, $15.65; cash assistance, $14.80; medicine, $3.00. In cases where a member of a society applies for assistance and such assistance is denied, the secretary was requested to notify said society of the reason for the denial. The Association received several applications for assistance from people who own "flats" and whose families <pb facs="5418478_6_0584.jpg" n="2"/>earn as much as thirty dollars weekly. It is the height of impudence for such people to dare to ask for assistance and thereby deprive families having nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and no place to live. The names of such unconscionable persons hereafter will be published in the daily newspapers. There were fifty-eight applications asking for work; twenty-three secured jobs and the rest did not report for work. Mr. Turek's report was accepted. The salary of the office clerk, Mr. Dvorak, was raised from six to nine dollars per week. [Translator's note: List of contributions follows.] Receipts were $115.20; disbursements, $327.18. Alderman Anton J. Cermak announced that his resolution in regard to the creation of a public icehouse at the Bridewell had been passed and that at present a temporary icehouse is being filled. He asked the Association to see to it that ice is furnished to poor people during the summer. This was noted and the Association will turn in a request to the City Council for permission to issue ice tickets to poor people, who will then be able to obtain ice at the Bridewell free of charge. Mr. John A. Cervenka, president of the Pilsen Brewery Company, announced that the company will provide the premises for the Association's annual meeting free of charge. Mr. Frank J. Petru is to <pb facs="5418478_6_0585.jpg" n="3"/>call a meeting of the Ladies Auxiliary so that this group can begin its activities. The annual meeting will be held on Friday, January 9.</p>
