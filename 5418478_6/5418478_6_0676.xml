   <p>p. 3, col. 1.. It is with pleasure we record every contribution for the orphanage and our poor. Especially we are pleased to say that at every opportunity extra amounts are paid on various affairs to raise funds for such worthy purposes; if this is continued, we will not have to worry to take care of the needy families and the orphanage. The needy will not suffer so much when donations of these kind are made.</p>
   <p>Libuse Lodge No. 8, Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Womens Unity) held a meeting Sunday afternoon, February 23rd, and at the same time christened the children of Mrs. Josephine Ruzicka; after this celebration all those present enjoyed a hearty luncheon. Truly this is a women's unity.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Caroline Svoboda, and Mrs. Marie Souhrada announced that such a splendid gathering of this kind should not be ended without crowning it by taking up a collection for the orphanage and our poor families. They collected the donations, amounting to $12, to be divided equally between the orphanage and the poor. This money is at the office of this newspaper to be turned over to the authorized officials.</p>
