   <p>The immigrant element, not only in Chicago, but in all other cities and states should use all its powers to triumph over the preponderant native element. If it awaits in tranquillity whatever the future may bring, they will soon find themselves playing the sad role of men graciously tolerated in this nation. The ordinary mortal has not the slightest idea how energetically the so-called "knownothings" work in order to force the immigrant element into the background and get all public offices into their power.</p>
   <p>According to their viewpoint, an immigrant is nothing more than a man, who is graciously suffered here, as one who came here to improve his material standing, and nothing more. According to them an immigrant has no right to any public office. That all belongs to full-blooded Americans, whose ancestors laid the foundation of Jamestown or arrived on the shores of America in the "Mayflower."</p>
   <p>When male America realizes that it is not strong enough to overpower the immigrant element, it calls upon the women for aid. It is for that reason wehave such a large number of women's political organizations, whose sole aim is to agitate whenever and wherever possible against the immigrant.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0954.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In public they try to give their activities a different cloak, in order not to arouse suspicion. However, they secretly work against everyone not born in this country and if they had the power to-day to drive every immigrant out of office, they would do so.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the public newspapers write that the women strive only to prevent the expansion of Catholicism, but under the name of Catholicism, they do not mean anything else but the immigrants element. Whenever some German, Irishman, or Bohemian appears as a candidate in the political field, this organization does not ask whether he is a Catholic or Protestant, but work against him solely because he is an immigrant. The influence and activity of the anti-immigrant element is now being felt in many departments of the city administration. As it is well known, there are a large number of immigrants employed in the public schools. They are a large number of immigrants employed in the public schools. They are mostly teachers of German, art, gymnastics, music and other extraordinary subjects.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0955.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There has been circulated among them recently a document for signature, upon which each was required to specify how long a resident in America and how long a citizen. If perchance one of these special teachers did not reside in America quite long enough or was not a citizen, what could he expect?</p>
   <p>Once before we mentioned in this column that societies as the "American Sons," or the "Sons and Daughters of the Revolution," or "Sons of Veterans" and the so-called "Deputies" have not other war aim then to work against the immigrant element and attempt to keep all offices whether city, county, or state in the hands of full-blooded Americans.</p>
   <p>In view of such agitation, what will the immigrants do? The duty of everyone, if he wants his stay in this land to be tolerated in years to come, should be to become a citizen. Furthermore, every one should take an active part in political movements. In that way, the immigrant element will be strengthened and the efforts of the opposition will be shattered by our strength.</p>
