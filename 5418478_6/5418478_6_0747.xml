   <p>Funeral services were held yesterday morning for little Ella Paroubek, who, prior to five weeks ago, was kidnapped, held prisoner, and finally murdered and thrown into the drainage canal. There were many floral offerings banked about the small coffin. Among the donors of floral pieces were: Mayor Carter H. Harrison, Municipal Judges Sabath and Uhlir, and Alderman Anton J. Cermak.</p>
   <p>By ten o'clock, there were so many people gathered before the home that the police guard had to be increased to keep order. Shortly after, the coffin was carried out of the house, followed by the family. Mrs. Paroubek was seated beside the coffin, while Mr. Jaromir R. Psenka gave a touching funeral oration. This was the only rite performed, and the coffin was then placed into the hearse and taken to the Bohemian National Cemetery.</p>

   <p>The police have now turned their efforts toward the discovery of the murderer with the same energy with which they previously sought to locate the missing girl.</p>
