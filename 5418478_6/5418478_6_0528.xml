<title level="a">ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The annual meeting of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), which was held last Friday night in the offices of the Pilsen Brewery on Albany Avenue at 26th Street, was well attended. The meeting was opened by the president, Judge J. Z. Uhlir. The secretary, Reverend Vaclav Vanek read the minutes of last year's annual meeting, the letters received--many of which carried remittances from members--and his own yearly report which follows:</p>
   <p>The Third Annual Report of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost for 1912</p>
   <p>This is the third annual report of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost to the American and Bohemian-American public. At the last Annual Meeting, February 9, 1912, elections were held to fill vacancies in the board of directors composed of twenty-four members. Elected for three years were: Mr. J. A. Hospodsky for the Denni Hlasatel [daily newspaper], Mr. Karel Krasny for the <pb facs="5418478_6_0529.jpg" n="2"/>Svornost [daily newspaper], Mr. Otto Dusek for the Spravedlnost [daily newspaper], Mr. Jan Voller for the Narod [daily newspaper], Reverend V. Vanek, Mr. Anton Schnabl, Mr. John A. Sokol, and Mr. Jos. F. Triska.</p>
   <p>Elected for two years were: Judge J. Z. Uhlir, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, Mr. J. S. Loula, Mr. F. J. Petru, Mr. J. F. Lalla, Mr. Roman Sedlacek, Mr. Karel Novak, and Mr. Josef Turek.</p>
   <p>Elected for one year were: Dr. G. Rezanka, Mr. Peter Drije, Mr. John A. Cervenka, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, Mr. J. Z. Klenha, Mr. J. C. Pisa, Mr. Vaclav Cihak, and Mr. Joseph Mendel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert Mikes was co-opted into the board at its May meeting, and Mr. Frank Venecek and Mr. Frank Nedbal at its meeting held in June. Director J. F. Lalla resigned at the meeting of October 18. Mr. Vaclav Lisy was appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
   <p>At the Annual Meeting were elected: Judge J. Z. Uhlir, president; Mr. F. J. Petru, <pb facs="5418478_6_0530.jpg" n="3"/>first vice-president; Mr. John A.

Hajicek, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The board held twenty meetings during the past year. All of them were well attended and showed a lively interest in all matters under discussion.</p>
   <p>In July there was a change in the office staff. Mr. Josef Jurka was appointed manager and Mrs. Dusek his clerk.</p>
   <p>Activities</p>
   <p>The Society received during the year 1912, 557 requests for relief, 385 of which were accorded. Of these, 44 families were given employment; 196 families received rent money, totaling $1,136.09; 122 families were given groceries, totaling $447.35; 57 families received cash, totaling $475.78; <pb facs="5418478_6_0531.jpg" n="4"/>10 were granted loans amounting to $228.85. Help to the amount of $114 for clothes, shoes, and similar necessities was given to 30 families, and 31 families received contributions totaling $113.93 for the purchase of medicaments, medical care, and undertaker's services.

   <p>Christmas baskets totaling $218.29 were given to 120 families. The expenditure of this amount was not approved until the January, 1913, meeting and is therefore not included in this report.</p>
   <p>This year the Association has become a member of the Chicago Association of Commerce and has received a membership charter. In joining the Association of Commerce, our Association has called itself to the attention of the general American public.</p>
   <p>In the March meeting the question came up of erecting a building to house the offices of the Association and provide space for a shelter for abandoned adolescent Bohemian youth. The building would be owned by the Association <pb facs="5418478_6_0533.jpg" n="6"/>and would serve as its headquarters. For this purpose, treasurer Frank G. Hajicek offered to donate a lot on 26th Street and California Avenue and sell us the adjoining lot for $500, provided that the Association is ready to start building within a year. Each lot is valued at $1,000. Mr. Hajicek promised to donate the lot even if the Association should decide to build in another, more suitable location, and his offer was accepted.</p>
   <p>On Decoration Day the Association, with the kind cooperation of a number of ladies, held its tag day which netted $1,918.53. On October 30, 1912, a charity ball was held in the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery, netting $1,987.84. Both the ladies' committees and men's committees have merited an expression of our sincere gratitude for their diligent work. The Association is also grateful to Dr. G. Rezanka for donating the use of the premises for its office; to the management of the Pilsen Brewery for the permission to hold meetings of the board of directors of the Association free of charge in the brewery offices; and to all those who gave their support in its various undertakings.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0534.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>In July the Association donated $100 each to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, and to the Catholic Orphanage at Lisle for the care of Bohemian orphans.</p>
   <p>There is one thing to which we should like to call your attention. Our membership is not as large as it should be. Approximately one thousand dollars was received in dues and donations during this year. This is very little for the size of the Bohemian public in Chicago. There are hundreds of private individuals, business and professional men, and corporations who should become members of our Association with dues ranging from five dollars upwards. This would increase our regular income. If it were not for the tag day and the charity ball, the Association could not exist. The regular membership dues would not cover even our office expenses. With a larger membership we could do great things. There are many urgent needs that call for our attention. In addition to the support of hundreds of indigent families whose number grows daily, it is imperative that we undertake the building of a home for our deserted, neglected youth, for our young girls who come both from Bohemia and from American rural <pb facs="5418478_6_0535.jpg" n="8"/>districts seeking work in our great metropolis. Without friends, they become exposed to all kinds of evil influences. Our employment bureau, after three years of effort, is still in its infancy. During this year, in forty-four cases only were we able to secure employment. Our members should enlarge their sphere of contacts with the Americans and in that way put themselves in a better position to place the hundreds of unemployed coming to us for help. Such help is infinitely preferred to occasional monetary contributions.</p>
   <p>With the steadily rising support and interest in the Association, greater and greater things could gradually be accomplished. Such achievements would immeasurably increase our prestige among the American public.</p>
   <p>We express our thanks here to the Chicago newspapers which have faithfully supported our Association ever since its foundation, to our many regular contributors, and to the few Bohemian corporations whose largess we have enjoyed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0536.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>The newly elected board of directors should make it its duty to reorganize the ladies committee, which should be made to meet weekly and develop into a kind of Auxiliary Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The Association would profit tremendously by such a body. Its organization would be a lasting benefit.</p>
   <p>May this new year of 1913 present to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost new opportunities for growth and a wider foundation for greater utility in the future.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Vaclav Vanek, secretary.</p>
   <p>After the report had been approved, the election of directors to fill vacancies took place. The president appointed a nominations committee composed of the following five members: Messrs. Vanek, Loula, Triska, Hajicek, and Schnabl. In a short session held in another room, the committees agreed upon the following nominees, all of whom were subsequently unanimously elected: For three <pb facs="5418478_6_0537.jpg" n="10"/>years: Dr. George W. Rezanka, Peter Drije, John a Cervenka, A. J. Cermak, Vaclav Cihak, F. J. Nedbal, Jos. C. Pisa, John Chrastka. For one year: Anton Laadt. The other members of the board, elected at last year's annual meeting, will serve until the end of their respective terms. The election of officers brought the following results:</p>
   <p>J. Z. Uhlir, president, Frank J. Petru, first vice-president (for the Pilsen district); John A. Cervenka, second vice-president (for the Bohemian "California" district); Stan. Loula, third vice-president (for the Merigold district); Josef Triska, fourth vice-president (for the Town of Lake district); Vaclav Vanek, secretary; Roman Sedlacek, assistant secretary; A. J. Cermak, financial secretary; F. J. Hajicek, treasurer. Auditing committee: Messrs. Laadt, Drije, Sokol; tag day committee: Messrs. Petru, Vanek, Triska, Mikes, Chrastka, Pecival, Pisa; charity ball committee: Messrs. Loula, Sokol, Sedlacek, Drije, Cervenka, Cermak, Hajicek.....</p>
   <p>Manager Jos. Jurka tendered his resignation, giving as the reason for doing so <pb facs="5418478_6_0538.jpg" n="11"/>his poor hearing which prevents him from properly discharging the duties of the office. Reverend Vanek praised Mr. Jurka's diligence and recommended that he be kept as superintendent of the office. The matter was referred to a committee for report to the next meeting.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: There follows a list of twenty-nine names of members who paid their dues at the meeting, which, together with accrued interest reported by Treasurer Hajicek, amounted to $283.17.]</p>
   <p>The meeting approved the expenditure of $173.75 for relief. Reported office expense was $68.65.</p>
