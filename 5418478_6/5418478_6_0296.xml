   <p>The Cesky Vypomocny Vybor (Bohemian Relief Committee) held two meetings yesterday, one in the office of the United Civic Societies of Chicago in the City Hall at noon, the other in the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
   <p>The first meeting was of special interest because the chairman of the Relief Committee, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, announced to President Anton J. Cermak and all those present, that the coroner will make available to the Bohemian committee a complete list of the victims of the "Eastland" catastrophe, so that the legal committee of our Bohemian organization will be in a position to start working immediately for the benefit of those whom the victims have left behind. Our countrymen needing legal assistance should contact the committee at their earliest opportunity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan Siman, City Clerk, who was present at the meeting, announced that the <pb facs="5418478_6_0297.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian undertakers had in their hands last Monday night, 192 burial permits for people of Bohemian nationality, and the number is still growing.....</p>
   <p>The meeting received a visit from the Polish relief committee, whose members came to secure information concerning the procedure used by the Bohemian committee. Also the general manager of the Western Electric Company came to the meeting and announced that his company has already given to the Chicago chapter of the American Red Cross the amount of $100,000 for the victims of the catastrophe. He also announced that the company has been doing everything in its power to help the families of its employees. In addition to whatever they may receive from the Red Cross or from the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor, the families of the victims of the catastrophe who were in the employ of the Western Electric Company for ten years or more will receive a full year's pay; for five and less than ten years, they will receive one half year's pay from the Company......</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0298.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The evening meeting dealt mostly with preparations for today's and tomorrow's funerals. Mr. Fr. Matousek and Mr. John A. Sokol intimated that the necessary number of automobiles for the Bohemian funerals had been secured and will be available. Mr. Cermak announced that he has two hundred men set aside to help in maintaining order during funerals and on other occasions in connection with them. Whoever may feel that he will be in need of help of this kind should call Mr. Cermak at Lawndale 3200.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak's men will be located at all Chicago cemeteries, and will be glad to offer any assistance they can. Today and tomorrow there will also be two members of the Spolek Ceskych Lekaru (Bohemian Physicians' Association) present at each cemetery for any emergency that may arise.</p>
   <p>The legal committee urged all members of the victims' families to refuse to <pb facs="5418478_6_0299.jpg" n="4"/>sign any document they are not fully familiar with. Finally attention was called to the fact that various individuals are calling on the Bohemian people soliciting donations without being authorized to do so. Therefore no one should make any contributions except directly to the hands of the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor or our newspapers.</p>
   <p>A total of $961 was reported in the meeting as the day's collection.</p>
