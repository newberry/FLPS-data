   <p>The board of directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association held a special meeting in Pilsen Park Friday evening. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Judge Joseph Uhlir, at 8:30 P. M. The secretary, Mr. Furst, made his excuses for being absent from the previous meeting and promised that he would attend regularly hereafter. He then read the minutes of the meeting of June 21 which had not been read at the last meeting, and the minutes of the meeting of August 25. These were accepted with two small corrections. Mr. Karl Kovak's letter, in which he sends his regrets for not being present at this meeting, was read. There was no further correspondence.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cervenka reports that together with Alderman Anton Cermak he had completed negotiations with Dr. Rezanka for the use of his waiting room, including heating and lighting free of charge. The Bohemian Charitable Association <pb facs="5418478_6_0609.jpg" n="2"/>can move its office immediately. Mr. Petru is for renting a store where articles received by the Association from donors could be stored. A motion to refer the matter to a committee and have the committee report at the next meeting was approved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loula, a member of the dance committee, reported that he made arrangements with the management of the Pilsen Brewery in regard to the giving of a dance. The management of the brewery is willing to rent its premises for the same consideration required of any other organization, and after the dance it will donate the payment toward the humane purposes of the Bohemian Charitable Association. The dance is to take place on November 1, 1911. The report was noted with an expression of gratitude. It was finally decided that admission should be one dollar and that tickets be ordered like those used last year.</p>
   <p>The Association of Commerce sent a formal questionnaire as to the activities of the Bohemian Charitable Association. It was decided that the Association's office should fill out and return the form to the Association of Commerce as <pb facs="5418478_6_0610.jpg" n="3"/>soon as possible. Mr. Docekal moved that the ladies be consulted in regard to the proposed dance in order that they may be active in time; the motion was approved. A further motion was made and approved that the present entertainment committee of three members be enlarged by two more members. Mr. Sedlacek and Mr. Novak were then elected to that committee. They were at the same time fully authorized to make all necessary arrangements for the dance. Mr. Docekal moved and recommended that aid be extended in the case of a certain woman who is totally incapacitated for work until such time as the county takes over the case. Mr. Cermak took the matter over for investigation. It was decided that if her claim is justified, the Association will lend her fifteen dollars which would have to be repaid after the county sends her an allowance.</p>
   <p>In another case, six dollars for rent was given to a poor family. Another case, where Mr. Loula had given aid to the amount of thirteen dollars in the course of three months, and where the husband, a carpenter, claimed he was unable to secure employment, was taken over by Mr. Turek for investigation, <pb facs="5418478_6_0611.jpg" n="4"/>with the further assertion that he would find a job for the husband. In one case, a woman asks for assistance, stating that her husband had deserted her, leaving her with two children. Her son does not want to work even though the Bohemian Charitable Association has secured jobs for him several times. It was decided to extend aid to the woman on condition that she force the son to work. Mr. Turek will investigate another case in which the client seeks aid because of sickness. The request for a contribution toward the defrayal of the expenses of the burial of the deceased teacher, Mr. Boh. Petzl, was denied because of a previous decision that contributions toward the burial of persons does not come within the sphere of the Association's activities. Requests for aid in securing jobs were referred to several people who have taken it upon themselves to find the needed jobs.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. Furst, asked for further explanation of the resolution of April 14 whereby he was appointed to collect funds. He also wanted to know from which funds he was to be paid a commission of ten per cent. A debate <pb facs="5418478_6_0612.jpg" n="5"/>on the matter ensued in which the entire board of directors took part. A motion that Mr. Furst be paid ten per cent only on funds collected by himself was referred to the executive committee. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
