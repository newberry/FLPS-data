   <p>Some time ago, an article appeared in the Bohemian press in which the writer asked our countrymen to send packages of cotton to Bohemia where,it is claimed, there is a need for bandaging materials. Immediately, a large number of Bohemians, both in Chicago and in the country, complied with this request, hoping that, in their small way, they would alleviate the suffering of their brothers.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that the article was written with the best of intentions. But after thorough deliberation and consideration of all the circumstances, the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Czecho-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) considers it its duty to add a few remarks on the article in question. This is being done in accordance with a decision reached in the meeting of the Vybor held January 15.</p>
   <p>Disregarding the immense stock of such supplies which Austria and Germany had accumulated before the war, there are in these countries, especially in Germany, <pb facs="5418478_6_0378.jpg" n="2"/>many, large factories manufacturing bandages. These are working now with increasing energy in order to comply with the requirements for the modern treatment of wounds, not only on the battlefields, but also in the territory of Germany's ally, Austria. We are therefore safe in believing the Austrian Ambassador in Washington; who, after the publication of the above-mentioned article, stated that there was no shortage whatever of material for bandages in Austria, and that cotton was particularly plentiful.</p>
   <p>Considering these facts, we have to admit that the sending of cotton to Bohemia is quite unnecessary, particularly so if we realize that such action amounts to supporting the Austrian government, that is, our enemy, whose duty it is to take proper care of her wounded.</p>
   <p>There is, however, dear countrymen, a country where there is the greatest possible need of materials for bandages, where thousands of lives are being <pb facs="5418478_6_0379.jpg" n="3"/>lost because means are lacking for the proper treatment of wounds. That country is Serbia.</p>
   <p>Even in times of peace, Serbia has been dependent on Austria, and even more so on Germany, for bandages and medical supplies. German firms supplied Serbia with eighty per cent of the medical supplies she needed during the Balkan wars, because Serbia had no factories capable of manufacturing enough medical supplies and bandaging materials to satisfy her abnormal war needs. Today, of course, all imports to Serbia from Austria and Germany have ceased, and Serbia is in a most desperate situation in regard to the treatment of her wounded. To read letters from Serbia is an extremely painful experience: "We do not need money, but we do need bandages. This shortage increases the suffering of those who were willing to give their young lives for the freedom of their country"--such is the tenor of letters from all our friends in Serbia, fully supported by word from Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky, leader of the Bohemian-American Medical Expedition to Serbia.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0380.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Well, friends, would it not be better, under such circumstances, to send bandages and cotton to Serbia, where such shipments would do such a great deal of good?</p>
   <p>The Pomocny Vybor, having considered all these circumstances most carefully, has agreed to request our people of good will to send the few cents they are willing to spend for cotton directly to the Pomocny Vybor, indicating the use to which the money is to be put. It is obvious that sending the cotton piecemeal is much more expensive than sending it through the agency of the Pomocny Vypor, which would purchase a large quantity of cotton and, through its facilities, would forward it to Serbia in the surest and least expensive way. What is more, it is not a question of cotton only, for which substitutes can be easily found, but rather a question of other materials needed in bandaging, without which the proper care of wounds is impossible.</p>
   <p>Finally, it is necessary to condemn from the medical point of view the practice <pb facs="5418478_6_0381.jpg" n="5"/>of opening packages of cotton and removing a part of their contents in order to prevent the package from exceeding a certain weight--as the writer of the article suggests. No conscientious physician will use a package that has been opened long before it reaches his hands, because such a package is always subject to suspicion as to its purity and aseptic condition, and is, therefore, unfit for medical use.</p>
   <p>All these shortcomings will be eliminated by sending the money to the Pomocny Vybor. We are in steady contact with the members of the Bohemian-American Medical Expedition to Serbia, as well as with other friends in that country, and, therefore, in the best position to know what they need most in their humanitarian work.</p>
   <p>The Pomocny Vybor knows that the Bohemians will again prove that their sympathies are with the Serbian nation in its martyrdom, and that they will do their duty as dictated to them by their own sense of human propriety--and by Slavdom!</p>
