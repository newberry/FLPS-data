  <body>
   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association has given up the plan of holding a Tag Day on Decoration Day at our cemeteries. It did so in behalf of the Bohemian societies, which will have a Tag Day for the benefit of the new school. There is no doubt that such a Tag Day would have contributed much money to the Bohemian Charitable Association. The Association gave up the idea, having in view the expansion of Bohemian education in America. For this, however, the Association should receive a suitable substitute fund. Our more well-to-do people should think of their duty toward our needy countrymen, reach down deep into their pockets and give them aid through the Bohemian Charitable Association.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association was formed for a great humanitarian purpose, and is fulfilling it in the fullest sense. If we <pb facs="5418478_6_1574.jpg" n="2"/>remember the number of Bohemian families saved from the worst want, if we recall the number of women and children given shelter, clothing, and medical aid by the Association, if we remember the many men and women who obtained employment through the Association, we must admit that there is not another institution, save our Old People's Home and Orphanage, which is more deserving of support. Remember the Bohemian Charitable Association, and with every gift to the Association you will be doing your duty. Your reward will be the blessings of those needy ones who are helped, and a clear conscience of a duty well performed.</p>
