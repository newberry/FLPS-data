   <p>The Czechoslovak celebration was our own. For this reason contributions to defray expenses should be accepted only from within our midst, i.e., from Czechs and Slovaks only. Our loyalty to the United States was attested by that event. Our people revealed their faith in the institutions and the freedom of this country. On that occasion our nation was represented in a dignified manner, and our pride was gratified. In the opinion of the public we were placed at the head of all other immigrant nationalities--in spilling our blood for the sublime principles of mankind; in our contributions for War Bonds, War Savings Stamps, the Red Cross; and in arranging celebrations like the one on Independence Day.</p>
   <p>For this reason we fully approve the decision of the arrangements committee to <pb facs="5418478_6_1784.jpg" n="2"/>decline donations toward the payment of the expenses of the celebration unless the contributions came from our own people.</p>
   <p>In this connection we commend Mr. Anton J. Cermak's attitude. He would not accept a contribution offered by County Judge Thomas F. Scully when the latter learned that we were asking for contributions to pay the expenses of the celebration. If we accepted the help extended by other nationalities, we could pay the debt of five hundred dollars--which still encumbers our patriotic enterprise--in a single day!.....</p>
   <p>Let us be true to ourselves! Fourteen days have passed since Independence Day, yet, in spite of all urgent appeals, not enough of our prosperous men have gotten together to pay even one half of the debt! We are ready to admit that demands made on our people today are extraordinary....</p>
   <p>We deem it to be our duty to speak frankly.....Some contributions arrived yesterday; e.g., from the Pilsen Brewing Company, $50; Alderman John Toman, <pb facs="5418478_6_1785.jpg" n="3"/>$25; Judge Sabath, $25; Anton Vanek, $5; and others..... The contributions should be addressed to Jos. S. Salat, 3342 West 26th Street.</p>
