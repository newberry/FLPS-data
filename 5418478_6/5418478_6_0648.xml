   <p>P.1, Col. 7--The regular meeting of the officers of the Bohemian Charitable Association was held Friday evening on Mr. Foucek's premises. The meeting was presided over by Judge Uhlir, and after the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting by the secretary, Mr. Foucek, there was a discussion on the requests for aid, which had been received. Probate officer Mr. Turek, reported the investigation of several cases, recommending some for assistance, while in several cases he announced that it would be better to withhold aid for some time, because the persons concerned are depending only upon this aid now and do not desire to go to work. This recommendation was approved and adopted. Communications received, were then read and of these one in which a youth recently arrived in America, thanks the Association for finding work for him, is interesting. This letter clearly indicates the value the Bohemian Charitable Association has for our public and for people who find themselves in distress. It would be well if our public displayed <pb facs="5418478_6_0649.jpg" n="2"/>interest in this Association. A further communication was read by the chairman Judge Uhlir. This letter was written by the Superintendent of the Boys' Reformatory and delivered to the Judge by Probate-officer Reed. The superintendent of the reformatory writes of a Bohemian boy in the reformatory, who through his excellent behavior has gained the unlimited confidence of everyone. He has been in the institution for twenty-four months and could be paroled if a good place were found for him. This boy has a brother living in Town of Lake, but the brother does not care to take him. Immediately following the reading of this letter, Mr. F. Petru, responded by announcing that he would attend to the matter himself and attempt to find a place for the boy, in the country. It was then pointed out that if Bohemian farmers applied to the Association, it would procure for them boys, who are either homeless or in institutions, who would welcome the opportunity to work on the farms.</p>
   <p>Chairman Uhlir announced to those present that during the time of the last meeting he was in St. Louis, where he had been sent as a Chicago delegate to the convention of all Charitable Associations of the United States. He briefly called attention to the work accomplished in the convention in the interest of education, length of working time for women and other matters.</p>

   <p>In addition the question also arose as to what should be done with habitual drunkards, who will not work and who tyrannize their wives. Perhaps Judge Uhlir's motion will be carried through and either the State, County or City will buy land somewhere, upon which a farm will be built and these offenders will be sent there; they would work for a regular wage with which the offender's families would be supported. The products of the farm would be delivered to various institutions, which now are forced to buy everything at high prices.</p>
   <p>Finally, came the subject of the convention, which had to be postponed, since the Jubilee Celebration is being held this week and insomuch as many members of the board are also members of the Committee of One Hundred, this was a trifle too much at one time. A special meeting has been called for next Friday at which it will be definitely decided where and when the convention will be held.</p>
   <p>Receipts in this meeting were $15, of which $10 was donated to the Association by Municipal Judge J. M. Newcomer and $5 by Mr. Joseph Houska.</p>
   <p>Disbursements were $13.90.</p>
   <p>The total assets of the Association now amount to $882.85.</p>
