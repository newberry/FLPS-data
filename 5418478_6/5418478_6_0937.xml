   <p>Today there is no need to doubt, that this section of our city is rapidly becoming one of the best. It serves only as an honor to us Bohemians that it is settled only by our countrymen. The lively building movement, which has been going on here, is a clear indication that very soon there will not be in Bohemian California a single street, where vacant building sites can be found.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen in California bring with them a lively social movement. We Bohemians found out long ago, that in union there is strength. In Bohemian California they do not remain behind, but on the contrary by established custom, they surpass the countrymen settled in other sections. Against the small number of social entertainment organizations, there are in California an unusually great number of those whose ranks boast a large number of intelligent members. The entertainments and meetings of these are usually held in the Sokol Chicago Building on Kedzie Avenue. The lodge rooms and likewise the main auditorium, which in addition to theatricals, balls, <pb facs="5418478_6_0938.jpg" n="2"/>etc., also serves as a gymnasium for the Sokols, are beautifully arranged, however it is possible to fear that in a short time it will be too small.</p>
   <p>To be sure those, who first conceived the idea of building a Bohemian hall, never had any idea that California would grow so large in such a short time. This matter should be given serious consideration. It would be an easy matter to enlarge this hall. It would even be possible to build an addition extending all the way to the sidewalk. In this manner the school premises of the "Vojta Naprstek" would in no way be injured, because the first grade rooms are already too small to accommodate the mass of pupils, and it will be necessary to seek larger quarters for it.</p>
