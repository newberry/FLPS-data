   <p>While strolling through the streets of our city, you will notice numerous work shops established by the American Red Cross. They are the "branches," and serve as meeting places for girls and married women who take courses in nursing, first aid, and other subjects with humanitarian aims, as dictated by wartime needs. Men, also, are taught how to perform work for the same purpose.</p>
   <p>In our community, such branches were first opened in the Pilsen Brewery Park and in the homes of Sokol Chicago and Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. These few are, however, insufficient if we want to meet our full measure of responsibility. Just take a look at the branches downtown and see the beehives of men and women working, as for example, in the Tower Building on Michigan Avenue! They prepare bandages, sort gauze, make compresses <pb facs="5418478_6_0127.jpg" n="2"/>and all kinds of articles and accessories for hospitals and first-aid stations "somewhere in France". They work on raw material, transforming it into pieces ready for use. Rich women stand alongside of the poor. They understand what this terrible war means; how much suffering and misery it causes. Those women work as hard as they can to help soothe the pain of others.</p>
   <p>It is true that many of our Czech girls and married women help in those downtown branches. This sort of work all over the city, as performed by some of our women, does not suffice. Therefore, we welcome the news that our people of both sexes are to be united into one body which will work toward a goal that is sure to produce results. The main branch will be in Dvorak Park. Everything produced there will be delivered in the name of Czech and Slovak workers. This will openly demonstrate that we do not lag behind.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0128.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mere membership in the Red Cross, a button and a tag showing that a person has paid one dollar--all that is not enough. What is needed is strenuous effort and work.</p>
   <p>These activities will be inaugurated on April 8 at 8 P. M., in Dvorak Park. Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal will speak on "One Year of Warfare," and Dr. J. Rudis-Jicinsky, instructor and supervisor of the branch, will speak on "The American Red Cross and Our Obligations to It". This humanitarian institution has bought 250,000,000 yards of bandage material, which must be made ready for use.</p>
   <p>More branches like the one in Dvorak Park are needed.</p>
