   <p>The conditions in Serbia which we have repeatedly tried to describe, and which in reality are no better than the conception which some people have about hell, seem to be getting somewhat better, thanks to the help that was sent to Serbia from England after that country had come to realize the true state of affairs in Serbia. A large number of physicians with a supply of materials needed in hospitals--medicine and serums of various kinds--went to Serbia from England, and immediately a noticeable improvement took place.</p>
   <p>This, however, does not mean that conditions in Serbia have become bearable. The help sent by England goes especially to those who are sick in hospitals. Those who are still able to keep on their feet have received nothing, and although they are in constant danger of getting infected by some of the diseases raging in the country, their conditions have remained as they have been, most <pb facs="5418478_6_0355.jpg" n="2"/>deplorable. There are still thousands of Austrian prisoners of war living in tent camps, little old shacks, and dilapidated sheds, from whom the last vestiges of clothing is falling, and who have not even substantial enough rags in which to wrap their bare feet. Whatever remnants of attire they may still have are infested with vermin, carriers of terrible, and usually deadly, diseases. Also the straw that serves the prisoners as beds is full of such vermin, and there is no clean, fresh straw available. It is easy to believe that the prisoners live under conditions more terrible than those they have spent in the trenches or on the battle front. There they had a chance of being shot, which would either put a quick end to all their suffering or send them to a hospital. But the best they can expect as prisoners of war is the contracting of a terrible disease, the germs of which lurk in every corner of the shack in which they must live, in every handful of straw that serves them for a bed, in every little bit of clothing that is falling apart on their bodies--a terrible disease which does not kill a man at once but only after long suffering.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0356.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And the majority of the Austrian prisoners of war who suffer these tortures are Bohemians. Some of them, really many of them, surrendered voluntarily, acting in accordance with the dictates of their Bohemian, Slavic-feeling hearts.</p>
   <p>Lo and behold! Englishmen, people of an entirely different race, distinct from us in speech and customs of life, have had mercy on these suffering men, and are sending them substantial help. Is it not our sacred duty, rather then theirs, to help those who are of our blood, those we love, those we call brothers? Why, many American Bohemians have relatives among the Bohemian prisoners in Serbia, and almost everyone of us has among them somebody born in the same village or town! Should not the whole of Bohemian America rise as a man, and quite apart from other collections which are also badly needed, make sure that these poor souls have at least a change of linen so that they may protect themselves to some extent against the deadly insects by keeping somewhat clean--a little good clothing and substantial shoes?</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0357.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>While something has been done in this respect already, it is very little compared to what is needed. Some clothing and linen have been delivered to places specified by us as receiving stations, but what has been received so far is a mere trifle in comparison to what rich Chicago could contribute. Not even a large enough number of countrymen have signified their willingness to receive such donations so that those of us who wish to contribute would not have too far to go.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. A. Husek, of 1810 Laflin Street, reports that one box at his premises has been filled with good clothes and linen. It contains, among other items donated by our good people six almost new overcoats, three suits of new underwear, and a pair of brand new shoes. Mrs. Antonie Horacek, of South Omaha, has sent to Mr. Husek's address a large bundle of good clothes she had collected from her friends, and she keeps on collecting. The firm of Oplatka &amp; Rainis of 1539 [names of street and town are missing] donated a good number of articles of brand new clothing. Mr. J. Tomek of Lankin, North Dakota, has sent a bundle of clothes for prisoners of war. Countryman Prokop Vesely of Tiniken, Kansas, has sent a <pb facs="5418478_6_0358.jpg" n="5"/>large box of linen, clothes and footwear. Mr. Viktor Cerny, of 1500 South Harding Avenue, Chicago, has collected a considerable number of items at his place, and so has Miss Barbora Scheffel, of 1436 West 18th Street, whose collection is steadily growing.</p>
   <p>However, these are mere examples of what every one of us should be doing--examples that should be followed by such a large number of countrymen that every prisoner of war could get what he needs, rather than one or another of them here and there a piece, the rest being left to shift for themselves as best they can. In order to help along in this matter, the members of the Delnicky Sokol (Workingmen's Sokol) and of the Beseda Narodnich Socialistu "Fric" (National-Socialists Club "Fric") will start a personal solicitation one of these days.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-American Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) will issue thousands of posters with an appeal to the Bohemian public. The poster will give the names and addresses of countrymen who have signified their willingness to collect the contributions. Therefore we request, again, that every <pb facs="5418478_6_0359.jpg" n="6"/>countryman who is ready to make a part of his office, store, or shop, available for receiving and storing the donations, send his name to the secretary of the Kancelar, R. J. Psenka, at 541 West Twelfth Street, Chicago, Illinois, telephone Canal 305, so that the name and address may be included in the poster. There should be at least one depository in each of our settlements, districts, and colonies, and our countrymen should show such generosity that our donations to the Bohemian prisoners of war in Serbia may be commensurate to the size and largess of Bohemian America.</p>
