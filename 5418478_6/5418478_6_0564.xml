<title level="a">MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last night a meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held at the office of the Pilsen Brewery. At this meeting the tag day committee's report was presented. It showed a clear profit of $1,878.80 for the Association's treasury. A week ago, seventy-six women taggers turned in the sum of $1,656.10, and yesterday this amount was increased by $490.63 when some of the women turned in supplementary collections and when others collected deposit boxes which had been placed in various Bohemian business houses, so that the total receipts amounted to $2146.73. Disbursements in connection with the tag day were $267.93, leaving a net balance of $1,878.80. There are still approximately one hundred boxes which have not been collected, and from all indications the total net proceeds will be over $2,000, which is a very large sum and serves to prove that the tag day committee and the ladies who did the actual tagging did everything that could possibly be done.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0565.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In accordance with the manager's report, which was approved, the following disbursements were made: Rent for poor families, $20; groceries, $39.19; medicine, $3.25; cash, fifty cents; office expenses, $30.45. Total, $93.39.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of Messrs. J. Z. Uhlir, A. J. Cermak, J. Sokol, and Drije is to endeavor to have a branch of the County Agent's office for poor people established in our "Bohemian California" district.</p>
