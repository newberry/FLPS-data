   <p>A woman's sympathy is usually weak, for she is the one who is more repressed. That seems to be in a woman's character. And the weaker ones, the more repressed ones in the old country, are now the widows and orphans of Bohemian soldiers who perished in the war, and those whom the war has deprived of a livelihood.</p>
   <p>The man is called into the battle. Certainly, he hates to go away from his loved ones; he may be going to his death. But, like the Spanish matador, he marches to the rhythm of snappy music played by a military band, to the shouts of "hurrah". He is being intoxicated; he must be intoxicated by the false military glory, by the lie that it is the highest honor to be a soldier, and that it is heroic to kill, upon someone's order, without knowing why. There are many who believe these falsehoods; many who, like decorated cattle, walk into the human slaughterhouse.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0453.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our countrymen are now in such a situation. After all, they kill so that they do not get killed themselves. Also, it is better to get killed than to be crippled and become a burden to one's wife, one's parents, or one's community, and, as if in mockery, receive a "munificence" of eight hellers for tobacco. No doubt, those in authority believe that he needs no food when he smokes.....At times, however, they are more generous: They permit him to buy--with his own money--a barrel organ.....</p>
   <p>And while the man is fighting, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters and old parents all stay at home. There, in the distant battlefields, he is tormented by anxiety for his loved ones. Will they have enough to eat? Will they be able to pay their rent?</p>
   <p>During the first three months, the government pays the family of a soldier a certain amount--sixty kreutzers, I think it is, per day--which keeps them from starvation. But it is not enough--by far not enough--to banish need and to buy necessities. But what when the three months are gone? Nobody <pb facs="5418478_6_0454.jpg" n="3"/>knows, and this cruel uncertainty about the future adds to all the cares and troubles.....</p>
   <p>Then there are thousands of families whose providers, even though they are not in the war, have lost their jobs, because shops and factories are now closed. Families are already going hungry.</p>
   <p>Should those innocent victims suffer, should they starve, should they freeze? "No--no--no" calls every drop of Bohemian blood. If we do not help them, even our bare skulls in the grave will blush for shame!</p>
   <p>The Germans aim to collect, and, judging by what they have already, will collect two million dollars--that is two million dollars for their countrymen. I have it on the best authority that prominent German ladies have joined the solicitation activities.</p>
   <p>Is it only German ladies who have national consciousness? Is it only German <pb facs="5418478_6_0455.jpg" n="4"/>women who should be creating an honorable memory for themselves in these historic times? I know, I feel in the very soul of my Bohemian self that it is not so. I know that we cannot collect two million dollars like the Germans, but I know that we can collect, with the help of Bohemian ladies, an amount of which we need not be ashamed.</p>
   <p>We must take our obligations toward our nation seriously, as seriously as the obligations toward our family, because the nation is our larger, greater family. If a well-to-do countryman donates a substantial amount, his duty is not yet completed. He has to contribute work; he has to join those who do the collecting. Knock, and knock again on the Bohemian hearts! Like a soldier with his opponent, attack the pocketbooks of your countrymen again and again. Do not be frightened away by calumny, by gossip, by a malicious word; kick over all obstacles and march straight toward your goal. For, every dollar added to the collection sheet means bread for the needy. I do not see how anybody can sit down to a well provided table, lie down in a soft bed, without having satisfied his conscience by offering a decent <pb facs="5418478_6_0456.jpg" n="5"/>donation for his suffering countrymen. A feeling of revolting hatefulness should seize us when we see a man who does not know anything but his own stomach, his own pocketbook, and his own very close relatives.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) is directing an appeal to all unselfish, wide-awake Bohemian ladies to report in the Vojta Naprstek school at Homan Avenue near 26th Street next Wednesday, October 7, when detailed plans for house-to-house solicitations will be discussed.</p>
   <p>I hope, in fact I fully trust, that I shall see many of the dear faces of my friends there.</p>
   <p>Do not forget: Vojta Naprstek school, next Wednesday, October 7, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>Signed: (Mrs.) F. Stanek-Bujarek.</p>
