   <p>The branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) for Novy Tabor (Marigold) started its activities only a few short months ago, and already it shows excellent results. In it already are eleven local associations and lodges represented by forty-two delegates.....</p>
   <p>The principal donations made by these bodies [seven amounts from five to fifty dollars, totaling $90] have been turned over to the treasurer of the Headquarters' branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
   <p>In addition to this, both of the Sokol organizations vie between themselves and the other represented bodies in large contributions.....</p>
   <p>Our organizations in Novy Tabor have, as these figures show, done a great deal for the Bohemian cause, and it is hoped that they will not slacken down now when <pb facs="5418478_6_1323.jpg" n="2"/>that whole community is getting ready for the Narodni Bazaz (National Bazaar), and that the date of that event will find everybody on his and her job. It will be the last Sunday in October, and the Bazaar will be held in the Hall of the Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy.</p>
   <p>Prior to this, however, let every man and woman of us attend the monthly meeting at Sokol Tabor to be held October 11, at which the secretary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, Mr. [J.] Tvrzicky-Kramer, will deliver a speech concerning the work that is being done for and on behalf of our old country's independence. For any additional information apply to the branch secretary, Mr. Jan Zachotina, at 4103 West 16th Street.</p>
