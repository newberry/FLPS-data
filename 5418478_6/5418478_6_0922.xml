   <p>P.1.--Whoever is entitled to citizenship papers, that is, whoever has had his first papers at least two years, and has lived in this country at least five years, should take advantage of the provisions of the present naturalization law and secure citizenship papers immediately. The present law offers many advantages, and makes it possible for an immigrant to become a citizen without any long delays, questioning, examinations, and without large expense.</p>
   <p>The new law, which becomes effective the day after tomorrow, decrees, that final citizenship papers will be issued ninety days after the filing of the application which will be sent to Washington, where it will be examined.</p>
   <p>This proceedure will cost much more money and will cause the applicants more running around and much discomfort. For that reason, let everyone, who can, take out his final papers immediately, according to the old law.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0923.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In order that no one need lose any time from work, the clerks in the circuit and superior courts are working in the evenings and many judges in these courts are naturalizing applicants late at night. Anyone who applies to-night to Mr. Sima, at 22nd and Kedzie; to Mr. Cyril Fiala, on Blue Island avenue; to Mr. Sindelar, at 13th street; and 42nd avenue; or to Mr. Mladka, at 1313 Central Park avenue will receive citizenship papers free of cost.</p>
