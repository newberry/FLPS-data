   <p>The women who were busy on Decoration Day selling tags for the benefit of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) gathered at a meeting held last Friday in the Pilsen Brewery pavilion. In the presence of the Tag-Day committee, consisting of Messrs. F. J. Petru, Vaclav Vanek, and Drije; of members of the Board of Directors of the Association; of J. Z. Uhlir and J. A. Cervenka, president and vice-president, respectively, of the Association, and of many others, seventy-seven collection boxes were opened and found to contain $1,657.69. [Translator's note: The names of individual tag-day workers, together with the amounts they collected, are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Judge J. Z Uhlir and the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, secretary of the Tag-Day committee, thanked the ladies for their charitable work. There was general satisfaction over the success of the collection.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0567.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The secretary of the Tag-Day committee announced that there are still about five hundred collection boxes in various business houses. The women's committee is to collect these boxes next week, and the Tag-Day committee expects that after the contents of these boxes are counted, the proceeds of Tag Day will exceed two thousand dollars. This must surely gladden the hearts of all those who are interested in giving aid to the Bohemian needy. Committees of women to collect the outstanding boxes were appointed. [Translator's note: Names of appointees omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>After the meeting, the directors of the Association treated the ladies to ice cream and cake....Everyone was highly enthused over the success of the Tag Day. Credit for this success belongs to the Tag-Day committee, the ladies who sold the tags, and the Bohemian People who gave their financial support.</p>
