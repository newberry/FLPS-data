   <p>The Bohemian sharpshooters have been remanded to their cells until today before being called up to plead, as the uncertainty of the fate of Donohoe, one of the wounded men, whose condition is most precarious, renders it impossible to settle upon the proper charge to prefer.</p>
   <p>If Donohoe dies as the result of his wounds, the charge of murder would be lodged against all the men under arrest, even though there should be no identification of the precise person who fired the shot causing the fatality. Each and all of the men who fired into a crowd at short range would be under the law held to be equally accountable for the homicide. So that in any event there is excellent material for such a prosecution and punishment of the criminals as shall serve as a warning to reckless and excitable men under arms. It is to be hoped that Mayor Harrison's gentle coquetting with the Socialist leaders will not be permitted to stand in the way of full justice and a wholesome example.</p>
