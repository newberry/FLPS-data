   <p>The extensive Czech community, which in the past few years has boomed west of Lawndale Avenue in the neighborhood of Twenty-sixth Street, and which seemed to be the seat of peace and satisfaction, was roused from its customary quiet by the report that in its midst, on Hamlin Avenue, a murder had been committed. Mr. Joseph Vacek, a retired carpenter contractor, was found shot to death in his room, at home, at 2629 South Hamlin Avenue. The killers fastened a note upon their victim's breast, which informed Mrs. Vacek that her husband had hired the murderers to kill her; this, however, failed and he refused to pay a promised reward of $500. For that reason they killed him. The police, however, did not <pb facs="5418478_6_0731.jpg" n="2"/>allow themselves to be misled, and began an energetic investigation. They turned their attention first of all to the Vaceks' seventeen year old son Joseph; the police were most suspicious of him and they were really on the right track. Late last night the youth confessed to Police Lieutenant Ptacek, of the Lawndale Police Station, that he was the murderer of his own father. However, even in his confession he showed hate for his father and has beclouded his memory by insisting that his father wanted to force him to shoot his mother.....</p>
