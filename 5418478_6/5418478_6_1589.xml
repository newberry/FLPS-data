   <p>A meeting was held on February 17, by the Bohemian-American Press Bureau, in the rooms of the Bohemian Club. The meeting was brought to order by the chairman of the executive committee, Mr. John Fucik, who requested the gathering to rise in silent tribute to the memory of the departed founder and first president, Mr. J. Rosicky. Then he requested Mr. Beranek to take over the conduct of the meeting.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian-American Press Bureau received a communication from Mr. E. St. Vraz, the organizer of the Bohemian-American National Council, in which the Bohemian-American Press Bureau is requested to join the Council, and to act as its press committee. It was decided to reply to Mr. Vraz in the sense that the Bohemian-American Press Bureau welcomes the Bohemian-American National Council, and places itself at its service. Whenever the executive committee of the National Council asks for the <pb facs="5418478_6_1590.jpg" n="2"/>cooperation of the Press Bureau, their request will be complied with to the fullest extent. On the motion of Mr. K. Vopicka, the executive committee was empowered to decide on cooperating with, and joining the National Council as its press committee.</p>
   <p>The reports of officers were begun by the chairman, Mr. Fucik, who warmly welcomed all those present, expressing the satisfaction of the committee over the work done during the past year, and the desire that the support thus far given to the undertaking should be continued.</p>
   <p>The secretary reported that the membership of the Bohemian-American Press Bureau is steadily increasing so that before the meeting it had thirty-three active and two contributing members. (The names of the active members and the amounts of their contributions are given.) Although it can be seen from the report that the Bureau in the past year has gained enough generous and enthusiastic friends to assure <pb facs="5418478_6_1591.jpg" n="3"/>its continued existence, it is nevertheless desirable that their number be increased. The right to become a member of the Bohemian-American Press Bureau is not limited to any certain number or group of countrymen. Any individual or society may become a member, and take part in the management of the Bureau upon the deposit of at least twenty-five dollars towards the support of the Bureau. The secretary also states in his report that the executive committee held a total of thirty-one regular and special meetings, ten of which were joint meetings with other workers for the purpose of arranging for the million cent collection, and two celebrations by the Educational Association, both of which turned out profitably.</p>
   <p>From the treasurer's report, we extract the following: Receipts for the first year's activity amounted to $1,500, while disbursements were $1,462.58.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1592.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Following this, the manager, Dr. J. E. Salaba Vojan, made his report of the activities of the Bureau during the first year of its existence. The activity of the Bureau can be separated into five departments:</p>
   <p>(1) Information to Anglo-American newspapers and publications. Already in its first year, the Bureau was successful in breaking through the ice of indifference of the large English dailies, which naturally are very inaccessible for reports and articles concerning the smaller groups of local inhabitants, especially. Despite this, twenty-four articles were published in various papers; some of these articles were informative, and some were corrections.</p>
   <p>(2) Information to Czech newspapers in the old country. The Bureau is continually sending detailed reports of all significant cultural, economic, and national events, which take place among Bohemian-Americans to the leading newspapers in Bohemia and Vienna, through <pb facs="5418478_6_1593.jpg" n="5"/>the intermediacy of the Bohemian National Council. This field, up to now, lay absolutely fallow. Once or twice a year, a report about Bohemian-Americans found its way into the Czech papers in Europe. During the past year, the Bureau sent twenty-three comprehensive collective reports to Praha (Prague).</p>
   <p>(3) Reports for the Bohemian-American Press. These are sent to all newspapers, which simply announced that they were willing to pay a pro rata share of the expenses involved. During the past year, twelve cablegrams, seventeen comprehensive articles from a Prague correspondent, and eighty-eight reports made up in the Bureau were distributed by that means.</p>
   <p>(4) Representation of Bohemian-America. The Bureau took upon itself instances where it was possible to speak for Bohemian-Americans without fear of contradiction. One of such was the sending of a cablegram of <pb facs="5418478_6_1594.jpg" n="6"/>condolence to the widow of the famous poet, Bjoernstjerne Bjoernson, to which an appreciative reply was received.</p>
   <p>(5) Actions of the Bohemian-American Press Bureau. The first year's activities of the Bureau show three very valuable and successfully accomplished acts. The first was to kindle interest in the census of the people, which was carried on for six weeks. The results of this action, its success in Congress, and the introduction of a column for our nationality on the census sheets are unquestionable, and will be known in the near future. The second action of the Bureau was the million cent collection for the Educational Association, which was sent to Prague in December, and which was crowned by a second million cents added by the financial sponsor of the Bureau, Mr. F. Korbel. The third action of the Bureau was the making of all preparations for the arrival of the traveler, Burton Holmes, in Bohemia, who had been inspired to visit there by Messrs. F. E. Novak <pb facs="5418478_6_1595.jpg" n="7"/>and E. Beranek. A written acknowledgement, in which Mr. Burton Holmes takes cognizance of the effect of the preparatory work of the Bureau is proof that the Bureau took care of all details necessary in that case.</p>
   <p>The summary gives 175 printed reports for the year. The agenda, furnished by the manager, the only person employed by the Bureau, shows 2733 pieces of correspondence sent off during the year.</p>
   <p>The report of the directors was accepted with enthusiasm. The chairman, Mr. John Fucik, then appointed Messrs. Karel Vopicka and Adolf Rys to canvass the votes in the election of officers, and announce the result. This committee returned with the report that the following named members received the majority vote, and were elected as members of the board of directors for 1911: Messrs. Jan Fucik, E. Beranek, Jaromir Psenka, Frank J. Skala, and J. F. Stepina. This executive <pb facs="5418478_6_1596.jpg" n="8"/>committee will elect officers at its first meeting, and will appoint a manager for the Bureau office.</p>
   <p>The by-laws of the organization were then examined and motions for their correction were made, the most important of which was the provision for a mass-meeting of the membership to be held annually in which every member has voice in proportion with the amount of his annual contributions; that is, one vote for every twenty-five dollar contribution. The order of election was some what altered, and it was decided that those elected to the executive committee will be those who received the largest number of votes without regard to whether they have a majority of those present.</p>
   <p>Motions for the change of the by-laws may be given to the secretary up to January 25 of any year.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1597.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Toward the close of the meeting, it was resolved to send a resolution of sympathy to the family of the deceased president, John Rosicky, and to express condolence to the treasurer, Mr. F. J. Skala, who lost his son. After several other matters of minor importance had been taken care of, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
