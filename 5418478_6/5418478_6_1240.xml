   <p>Twenty years ago yesterday, the two separate Solo organizations of Chicago, Solo California and Solo Fugner shook hands and united into one, Solo Chicago. It is not necessary to dwell upon the importance this organization has gained during this time; it has become the second largest Solo organization in the United States. It has a model school in the California district, it has built an impressive national house, through the efforts of which the school Vojta Naprstek was founded; and it has become one of the most outstanding factors in our social and national life. It can be said that the development of the most populous Czech settlement Chicago, is inseparably welded with the growth of the Solo organization.</p>
   <p>These important facts were recalled when the Solo Chicago celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its birth in the Solo Chicago Home last Saturday. The arrangements committee had prepared an exquisite program <pb facs="5418478_6_1241.jpg" n="2"/>and had done everything possible to make the affair worthy of the significance of the festival. Be it, alas, said with much regret that the public did not seem to grasp the importance of the moment and historical facts. The attendance was small, and, considering that the organization has almost five hundred members, extremely small indeed. Where the fault lies we shall not attempt to find out. But the fact remains that it was the members themselves who were not conspicuous at the festival. One reason for the small attendance may have been the opening of the bazaar of the C. N. S. (Bohemian National Association), which attracted the attention of the public.</p>
   <p>The academic program contained twelve numbers, of which three were of the gymnastic variety. Sixteen boys gave exhibitions and the Sokol girls performed excellently in groups, though not always in tempo with the music. The youngest pupils performed "A Welcome to Spring" which <pb facs="5418478_6_1242.jpg" n="3"/>drew the most hearty applause and brought much credit to Mr. Paskovsky, the teacher.</p>
   <p>The Singing Society Bendl sang several choruses and shared honors with Mr. B. Zitek, soprano, Miss Cecilia Turek, accompanist, and Mr. Charles Vaskovsky, violinist. Dr. J. E. S. Vojan delivered the oration, and several other speakers followed. Then the telegrams of congratulations were ready by Mr. J. Placek, president of the Sokol Chicago; they had come from all over the United States.</p>
   <p>One of the most moving performances of the evening was an allegory "Tyrsuv Sen" (Tyrs's Vision), a creation by the teacher of gymnastics Mr. Paskovsky, which he dedicated to the festival. It depicted: 1) The arrival of the Czechs; 2) Upon the crest of glory; 3) The Bila Hora (White Mountain) and the decline of the Czech nation; 4) Greek physical culture; 5) The Sokol ideals.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1243.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The scene had been worked out from sketches by the well-known artist Cestmir Svoboda.</p>
   <p>Diplomas were given to several members, those of over twenty-five years in good standing. The orchestra directed by Mr. J. Jurena played select pieces of high musical quality.</p>
