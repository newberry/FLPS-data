   <p>The delegates of the Bohemian National Cemetery held their monthly meeting in the home of the Pilsen Sokol last night; Mr. Jan Pecha presided..... After the routine business was disposed of, the question of donating ambulances as a gift of Chicago Czechs was answered by Mr. Smejkal, who informed the delegates that the United States Government does not accept gifts marked by the name of the donor. To clear up the first-hand information given to him, he wrote to Secretary of War Baker, from whose office he received the answer that the War Department does not handle contributions of this kind, and was referred to the headquarters of the American Red Cross in Washington, D. C. The Red Cross informed him that a gift in cash would be welcome.</p>
   <p>The American Red Cross, Mr. Smejkal was informed, is amply supplied with light ambulances. What is needed are vehicles of the heavy kind. These have to be <pb facs="5418478_6_0107.jpg" n="2"/>bought in France, because our shipping facilities are needed for transportation of war material other than light ambulances. The delegates then voted for a donation of $300 which is to be sent to the Chicago branch of the Red Cross.....</p>
