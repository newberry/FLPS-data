   <p>Yesterday was a festive day for Sokol Slavsky. This active society, with other sokol societies participating, and many of its friends attending, unveiled its new banner. The ceremonies took place upon the occasion of an exhibition drill, in which the stalwart sons and daughters of Fuegner and Tyrs, displayed their physical maturity, which merit the fullest recognition and admiration of all. It was a real pleasure to look upon the faultlessly spread out ranks of sprightly sokols, both young and old pupils. Faultlessly, they performed the intricate physical culture exercises, and drills with clubs, rings, and wands. Everything was performed as smoothly and harmoniously as clockwork. It is a pity that shortly after the commencement of the exercises, a storm set in, and the Sokols were forced to retire to the pavilion to finish the drill.</p>
   <p>The Sokols met shortly before 1 P.M. yesterday in their headquarters where a column was formed, and in a short time the journey to Pilsen Park was <pb facs="5418478_6_1547.jpg" n="2"/>undertaken. At the head of the parade was Mr. V. Husa's band, followed by the Sokol Slavsky color-guard, carrying the old and the new banner, the Sokol Tyrs and Sokol Slavoj color-guards. Then followed the women members of Sokol Tyrs, Slavoj and Slavsky. Following them, marched the Sokol Drum and Bugle Corps. At last, came the Sokol Tyrs, Sokol Slavoj, Sokol Cesko-Narodni Pokrok, Sokol Komensky and Sokol Slavsky. Sokols in civilian dress brought up the rear. The pupils had gone to the celebration grounds in advance.</p>
   <p>The unveiling of the colors took place immediately on arrival at the park. The new banner is a gift to the Sokol Slavoj, from its womens' branch. It is the second such banner donated by the women sokols, and is decorated on one side with the American colors, and on the opposite side with Bohemian colors. Immediately upon arrival at the pavilion, Mrs. Anna Raydlo, the sponsor of the flag, appeared on the stage, and with a suitable prologue, delivered the flag to president of Sokol Slavsky, Mr. Anton Dolezal. He expressed the thanks of the organization for the gift. The secretary, Mr. Josef Dittert, <pb facs="5418478_6_1548.jpg" n="3"/>then spoke on equality, freedom, and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Next, the band played the hymn, "Kde Domov Muj?" (Where is my Home?) after which, Mrs. Kostlan recited the poem, "Pod Novym Praporem," (Under the New Flag), written by Sokol Mr. Jaroslav Kosar. This poem was written especially for Sokol Slavsky, and appears in its motto: "V pred a Nikdy Zpet." (Ever forward and never retreat). Following the recitation, the band played the hymn, "Hej Slovane" (Hey Slovane), and when the president delivered the flag to Sokol Mr. Prevratil, who pledged himself to guard it, the ceremonies were ended with a medley of Bohemian songs played by the band.</p>
   <p>Following an intermission of about an hour, the exercises were then held under the direction of Sokols Messrs. Rayman and Pondelicek. These exercises were crowned with success as has been mentioned above, and the members are to be congratulated.</p>
   <p>The exercises having been completed, a heartfelt sokol jollification was indulged <pb facs="5418478_6_1549.jpg" n="4"/>in which lasted after 10 P. M</p>
   <p>The Gymnastic Society, Sokol Slavsky, which last year celebrated its twentieth anniversary, was organized in 1890, and now has two hundred eighty-six members, whereas the womens' branch of Sokol Slavsky has about one hundred fifty members.</p>
