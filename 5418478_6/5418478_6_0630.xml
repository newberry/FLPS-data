   <p>Saturday's Meeting of the Directors in the Office of the C.A.S. Hall</p>
   <p>In previous reports about the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) we mentioned that the directors were thinking of providing a regular office where meetings of the committees and directors could be held and business matters of the association transacted. Now we are able to inform the public that such an office is in existence, in the Bohemian-American Slavonic Hall and in the future all matters pertaining to the affairs of the association will be transacted there. The first meeting of the directors in the new office took place last Saturday afternoon. The meeting was called to order, in the absence of the chairman, Judge J. Z. Uhlir, by the vice-chairman, Mr. F. J. Petru. After the reading of the <pb facs="5418478_6_0631.jpg" n="2"/>minutes of the previous meeting, by the secretary, Mr. Foucek, the communications received were read. There were quite a number of them and they were disposed of either by answer or by being referred to one of the investigation committees. From the reports for the good of the society, Mr. Foucek, read the communication from the United Charities for the South West side. Under steps taken and according to the decision arrived at in Saturday's meeting, efforts will be made to have the United Charities turn Czech cases over to the care of the Bohemian Charitable Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Turek made a report on various cases investigated, and Mr. Petru called attention to the necessity of having a "tag day." Mr. St. Loula, who is taking care of the needy cases in Marygold (West Side), announced one case in which the family is in distress as a result of the neglect of <pb facs="5418478_6_0632.jpg" n="3"/>the husband, and in that case the necessary action will be taken to correct the matter. Mr. Loula also announced that Dr. Ocasek is willingly taking care of the cases assigned to him, by the Bohemian Charitable Association; this report was accepted with thanks because the association is especially in need of the aid of Czech doctors.</p>
   <p>Deficiency and want are followed by sickness. Receipts at this meeting were $146.80; disbursements for relief amounted to $252.80. After the disposal of several minor matters the meeting was adjourned.</p>
