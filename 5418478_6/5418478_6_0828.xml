   <p>Very interesting proof of how the population in some districts is changing is found in the list of pupils of some public schools. Until recently, the preponderant majority of pupils who attended the well-known John Spry Public School were of Bohemian origin, and it could have been taken for granted that pupils of Bohemian origin are still in the majority. But this is not so, because the conditions have changed.</p>
   <p>Although the school is attended mostly by children of immigrants, the Bohemian pupils are not in the majority anymore. The list, as prepared by the school management, shows that more than sixty-six per cent of the pupils are of Polish origin, twenty-three per cent of Bohemian origin, and ten per cent American-born children. None of the other nationalities has as much as one per cent of the pupils in this school.</p>
