   <p>The recent meeting of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society), held last Friday, had an excellent attendance. The directors remembered the little orphans in both of our orphanages, the one [which is a part of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage and is] near the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) and the one at Lisle, and donated twenty-five dollars to each of these institutions for a Christmas tree. In view of the fact that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost takes care of hundreds of poor families during the year, its consideration for the two orphanages is to be that much more appreciated and admired. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost contributed $175 to each of the orphanages last year to help pay for the upkeep.</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost decided to distribute its Christmas hampers on the Tuesday before Christmas Eve. Every family which the Society supported during the year will receive a substantial hamper of food; <pb facs="5418478_6_0507.jpg" n="2"/>the amount will depend on the number of people in the family.</p>
   <p>A beautiful Christmas tree will be prepared for the children of these families, and there will be a program of entertainment for them which will be worked out by Reverend Vaclav Vanek, secretary of the Society, in co-operation with a committee appointed for this purpose some time ago. The committee consists of Mr. [John A.] Sokol, Mr. Otto and Mr. Zeman. Each child will receive a nice gift at the end of the celebration. Mr. Schnabl reported that he had been promised two hundred boxes of candy for this purpose, and that additional presents will be solicited among the businessmen in the whole city.....</p>
   <p>The committee which is investigating the question of overnight shelters, Messrs. Vanek, [John A.] Cervenka, and Zeman....will present their report at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), in a letter read at the meeting, evaded a direct reply to the request of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost to give the name of the man who stated that <pb facs="5418478_6_0508.jpg" n="3"/>the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost was supporting persons who do not need or deserve charity. It was decided to drop the matter.....</p>
