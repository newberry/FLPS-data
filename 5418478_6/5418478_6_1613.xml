   <p>p.1--Members of the powerful C. S. P. S. (Liberal School Society), whose branches reach all over the United States will be interested in the news that the secretary of the organization, J. V. Lunak, has been deposed by the unanimous vote of the main branch.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lunak's office was in St. Louis, from where he conducted the business of the organization; the information about his dismissal came to us from Mr. J. Pecha, chairman of the main order's congress in Milwaukee. He immediately started an investigation in order to learn the cause of such important action as the one taken against Mr. Lunak.</p>
   <p>We are being informed that there seemed to be several causes, but none of them of sufficient import to warrant the steps taken.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1614.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Lunak was accused of negligence; he is said to have accepted dues from his branch and delivered the money to the main treasury not until several months later.</p>
   <p>In spite of repeated admonitions on the part of the heads of the organization he did not change his practices, and so his books were submitted to a thorough examination as a result of which it was established that he had held back $26.36 of the dues paid by Order Kolin, No. 171.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the main order then resolved to divest Mr. Lunak of his office as secretary, and to replace him by Mr. J. Bednor. Other versions of the affair point to the improbability of taking such decisive steps against the secretary for a mere loss of $26.36, or rather for an undue delay in payment.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1615.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>So other reasons for the disciplinary measures are being advanced. One of these was the quarrels between Mr. Lunak and the supreme head of the whole organization, Mr. A. J. Cejka.</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact Mr. Lunak restituted the small deficit the instant it had been detected and so smoothed the way for himself to get out of the trouble.</p>
   <p>Last night there was a meeting of the newly elected officers, in which Chicago was made the seat of the main headquarters. In this meeting steps were taken to give the case of Mr. Lunak a thorough study; the attitude of the new officers has not been revealed up to date.</p>
