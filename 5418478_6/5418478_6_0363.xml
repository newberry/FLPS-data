   <p>Mr. J.F. Stepina, president of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) has received a cablegram from Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky, the leader of the Bohemian-American medical expedition to Serbia, which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"We ask you urgently to collect and send us clothes, shirts, underwear, and footwear for our Bohemian prisoners of war on whom all they have is falling to pieces".</p>
   <p>This cablegram describes clearly the situation of our unfortunate countrymen who are prisoners of war in Serbia. The Serbians themselves have nothing with which to clothe their own needy brothers, and of course, cannot be expected to take care in this respect for the thousands of prisoners of war. Furthermore, <pb facs="5418478_6_0364.jpg" n="2"/>it is perfectly natural that everything should be falling to pieces on soldiers who have gone through the hardships of a war campaign. They have been using their clothes and shoes hard for a number of months; small wonder they are almost naked and barefooted.</p>
   <p>No doubt it will become an added link in the chain of noble deeds of Bohemian America, as well as an act of fulfillment of a sacred duty, if the Bohemians in America will come to rescue of their countrymen in Serbia and help them in this respect. There is perhaps no one among us who could not contribute a suit of clothes, some linen, or a pair of good shoes. It would be useless to send ragged apparel or worn-out shoes which would last only a short while, and soon lose all their usefulness. But there are very many among us who have such things that are almost new and can well spare them, and those who have none will find little difficulty in purchasing some clothes or a few shirts to enrich the the collection. Just at this time there are special sales on clothes in many department and other stores where real bargains can be found, articles which will greatly please and relieve a war prisoner.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0365.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Countrymen, especially storekeepers, who would like to do a good deed by permitting a part of their premises, flat, store, office, etc., to be used as depository of clothes where boxes and cases could be placed in which the clothes will be packed, please send your name to the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, Mr. J. R. Psenka, 541 West 12th Street, telephone Canal 835. The names of the depositories will be published in the daily press, so that the collecting may be started without delay. The shipping of the articles will be taken care of by the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar through the Red Cross Organization (sic).</p>
