   <p>"We Americans, on the whole, would like to teach the Bohemians, but instead we must admit that we need to learn from them." Thus spoke the Rev. John Timothy Stone, last night at the memorial celebration of the 319th anniversary of the birth of John Amos Komensky. The ceremonies were held in the Bohemian Settlement Home at 1827 South Centre (now Racine) Avenue. This distinguished speaker showed a great knowledge of Bohemian history and famous Bohemian men. We could hardly believe that a stranger was lecturing to us about our native land, from whom many Bohemians could learn much about the land of his birth. He told us of our great past, of our famous men; among whom he mentioned in first place, John Amos Komensky, whom he honored as a great Bohemian, as a famous teacher <pb facs="5418478_6_1576.jpg" n="2"/>of the masses, and as the spiritual leader of the Unity of Bohemian Brothers.</p>
   <p>The celebration was enjoyed by a very large attendance, and was arranged by the Reverend Vac. Vanek.</p>
