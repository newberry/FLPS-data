   <p>The ladies' auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) has done a beautiful piece of work. If it were not for them, four hundred poor Bohemian families would have had a sad Christmas Eve yesterday. Even before two o'clock in the afternoon, the hour announced for the beginning of the Christmas party of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost for poor Bohemian children and their parents, the great hall of the Pilsen Park pavilion, the use of which was donated by the Pilsen Brewing Company free of charge, was filled with four hundred adults who came to get their Christmas hampers, and some five hundred children.</p>
   <p>The party was opened by the secretary of the Christmas committee of the Spolecnost, Reverend Vaclav Vanek.....</p>
   <p>After his opening remarks and the introduction of the principal organizers of the party....the program proper of the afternoon started. There were musical <pb facs="5418478_6_0245.jpg" n="2"/>selections....both instrumental and vocal, dance numbers....and then came Santa Claus, who distributed toys and candy among the children....</p>
   <p>Members of the Bohemia Masonic lodge took the Christmas donations in their cars to more distant families. The lodge itself donated one hundred dollars to the party, and its chapter [sic] (ladies) twenty dollars.....</p>
   <p>Enough money for only 210 hampers was collected, but the Spolecnost had a hamper for every one of its 400 families.</p>
