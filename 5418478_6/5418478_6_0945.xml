   <p>Our Town of Lake already has a pleasant Spring-like appearance. Lawns are green, trees are budding, bushes are blooming, and close by, Western boulevard is especially agreeable to the eyes. It is about time that our South Park Commissioners did their duty and provided a nice park for our part of the city. Our countrymen are doing everything possible to improve the appearance of the streets. Wherever there is a garden it is being improved - the ground is being spaded and flowers and other useful greens are being planted.</p>
   <p>In Kutne Hore (the diggings) which lies in the neighborhood of 50th street and the Pan Handle tracks, the citizens are more satisfied. After several years, the city finally decided to provide for the cleaning of the ditches. The side-walks have been repaired and it is expected that this part of the Town of Lake will also improve and grow. Alderman T. Carey visited there recently and recognized the need for the city to make the most necessary improvements. Wouldn't it be timely for the alderman to visit elsewhere also?</p>
