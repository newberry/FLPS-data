   <p>Man rejoices in the knowledge that he has been able to do some good for his fellow-man. We also rejoice because we were able to locate a man in Chicago for whom we did not plead in vain to our readers. We have in mind Joseph Spika, one of the thousands of our good boys who fought in Siberia for the cause of Czechoslovakia's freedom. We found Joseph Spika in the County Hospital. He is an invalid legionnaire, who is being transported from Siberia to Czechoslovakia. He traveled in the company of Dr. Thomas F. Marland, of Chicago, who voluntarily took care of him on the trip and who, because of Spika's illness, placed him in the County Hospital. Just now Spika is waiting to be operated on and it will be a long time before he will be able to continue on his way home. Until that time, he will have to endure much suffering. In order to make this period of waiting as comfortable as possible for him, in order to prove to him that even at this distance there are people who, although strangers to him, are friendly, whose hearts are in the right place--people who know very well that they will never sufficiently repay the Czechoslovak Army for what it has accomplished in Siberia for our dear native land--we hit upon the idea of <pb facs="5418478_6_0044.jpg" n="2"/>undertaking a collection for him. The amount collected will be given to him as a gift honoring one of the thousands of our fine boys. We appealed to our people and readers, and we are glad that the appeal was not in vain. Up to yesterday we received many contributions representing the sum of $16.50. Further contributions should be sent to the office of Denni Hlasatel so that Joseph Spika, legionnaire, will be suprised by the love and generosity of our people in Chicago.</p>
