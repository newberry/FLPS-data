   <p>A quiet and solemn celebration, held at the monument of Karel Havlicek Borovsky in Douglas Park, marked the sixty-second anniversary of the death of the great Czech publicist and patriot. The celebration was held last Saturday. Every Czech knows what Havlicek meant to our nation. In him we had a man who remained true to his principles under all circumstances--a man who opposed the reactionary elements in politics throughout his lifetime, until he was forcibly removed. He stood by his ideals until he died.</p>
   <p>The celebration was held at a time when the decaying government of Austria is loosing all its beastly fury, using its police and its soldiers against the Czech people and their leaders. The relentless persecution as practiced in Havlicek's days has given way to downright cruelty. While it threw Havlicek and others into prison, today it threatens [our patriots] with the gallows.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Czech to meditate on the suffering Havlicek was forced <pb facs="5418478_6_1779.jpg" n="2"/>to endure, and especially on his heroism and unyielding faith in his nation. "Now or never!" was his slogan, and it is the war cry of the Czechs today as they fight for the liberty of their nation.</p>
   <p>Czech Chicago, having built the monument, is in duty bound to remember the great leader of our nation. In spite of urgent appeals, our people have not shown the right sentiment; they have not grasped the full significance of this anniversary, not even in this portentous time of war, or a great many more of them would have been present last Saturday.</p>
   <p>The parade reached the monument at 8 P.M. Sokol groups, members and leaders of the Czech National Alliance, and the Society to Aid the Czech Republic were well represented. A large crowd gathered at the monument. Sokols placed two beautiful wreaths at the foot of the statue. The official ceremony was opened by Dr. A. Mueller, who welcomed the gathering, and introduced little Marie Sramek, upon whom the honor of being "the first" had been conferred. She recited a poem, "My Colors--Red and White". When the applause that rewarded her had <pb facs="5418478_6_1780.jpg" n="3"/>subsided, Mr. Vojta Benes, secretary of the Czech National Alliance took the floor. If there is any man who knows how to speak to the hearts of our people, that man is Vojta Benes. He is frank, simple, and straightforward. We shall print his address in our issue next Wednesday, to give those who were not present an opportunity to read it. His subject was "Havlicek-Masaryk," and his splendid treatment of his subject aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among the audience.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee was particularly fortunate in its choice of speakers for last Saturday. Professor J. J. Zmrhal explained the significance of Havlicek's activity in relation to the Austrian government, and the relation of the latter to the Czech nation today. His speech, which was delivered in fluent English, was exact on every point.</p>
   <p>After another recitation by Marenka Sramek, the celebration was brought to an end by Dr. Mueller, who expressed the wish that at the next anniversary, our motherland would be free and independent.</p>
