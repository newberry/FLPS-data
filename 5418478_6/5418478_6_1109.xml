   <p>We Czechoslovak women, who have rendered our services to our nation since the beginning of the World War, and who, during the full five years, have conscientiously, honestly, and tirelessly worked for the liberty and happiness of our native land; we, who have sacrificed all of our energy, night and day, to lighten and to make more agreeable the heavy duties of our legionnaires, who sacrificed their lives upon the altar of our native land, consider it as urgent to proclaim the following: With regret and great disappointment we notice the undignified action of some of our Czechoslovak legionnaires, who, in the most trying times and at the most critical moment, when our enemies, with renewed strength, are getting ready to attack the liberty and the independence of our native land, harm the work which is being done so unselfishly and honestly by all the workers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) and this is done after the manifestations of several sincere, unselfish brother <pb facs="5418478_6_1110.jpg" n="2"/>legionnaires of their midst, who declared such action as unbecoming to a true soldier. In devious ways they strive to injure the organization and to destroy its work. We women and mothers will not permit this, because the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe is almost sacred to us and we will not permit it to be harmed in this manner. Therefore, after thorough consideration, because such attacks will not benefit our native land and are undertaken only in order to harm good work and to discourage all good workers from further effort, and because the question here is one of supremacy and personal revenge, we manifest our confidence in the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe and we promise that we will continue to work hand in hand with it, as long as our native land and our dear Father Thomas G. Masaryk need our help.</p>
   <p>For the Vcelky Ceska Kalifornie (Bees of Bohemian California):</p>
   <p>Anna J. Novak, president</p>
