   <p>The committee of Bohemian citizens, which made it its business to bring about better conditions in our Plzen (Pilsen District) as far as order and safety is concerned, announced that it has already received petitions signed by more than one thousand citizens. This proves that our citizens are really interested in this action. Regarding this action, several meetings have been held. At these meetings the existing conditions in our Plzen were discussed and complaints were made that all kinds of mischief is being permitted here. It was also complained that various crimes were committed which heretofore were absolutely unknown in this neighborhood. In order to put a stop to all this, a petition will be sent to the mayor, the state's attorney, and the chief of police, requesting them to provide better police protection for the residents of our Plzen. Those of our <pb facs="5418478_6_0741.jpg" n="2"/>countrymen who have not yet signed the petition, still have an opportunity of doing so, and it is to be wished that they do so at once. The petitions may be had at nearly all of the business places in our Plzen.</p>
