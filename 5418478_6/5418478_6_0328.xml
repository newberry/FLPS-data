<title level="a">THE LADIES' AUXILIARY OF THE CESKE NARODNI SDRUZENI HAS BEEN FOUNDED</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Our central national organization, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, was supplemented yesterday by a ladies' auxiliary in which unselfish Bohemian women have joined to work for the political liberation of Bohemian lands. Approximately seventy ladies, most of them prominent national workers known for their former activities, have become members.</p>
   <p>Their first meeting was opened by the chairman of the preparatory committee, Mrs. Stolfa. The secretary of the Narodni Sdruzeni of Chicago, Mr. Tvrzicky-Kramer, addressed the ladies with a fine speech in which he discussed the pitiful conditions now prevailing in the old country.....</p>
   <p>"A Bohemian woman," Mr. Tvrzicky said, "cannot engage in a more important work <pb facs="5418478_6_0329.jpg" n="2"/>than that of co-operating with the Narodni Sdruzeni in its campaign for the liberation of Bohemia. Political liberty is the foundation and first supposition of any other liberty; therefore, it is also the foundation of liberty and full equality of rights for women....." The speaker continued by telling about the progress of the work of the Narodni Sdruzeni which now goes forward under the slogan, "In John Huss' year, for John Huss' country".....</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzicky's speech achieved its purpose. When he finished, all ladies stood up and unanimously agreed to establish the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni. The assembled members elected Mrs. Stolfa as president, Mrs. Jesensky-Raeck as secretary, and Mrs. Jennie Sistka as treasurer. Thus the Auxiliary was founded. All those present were given collection sheets and promised to start solicitation right away.....</p>
