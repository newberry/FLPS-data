   <p>The Russian Consulate in Chicago has sent us a reply from the Russian of Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the request of the Narodne-Socialni Vzdelavaci Beseda V. J. Fric (J. V. Fric National-Socialist Educational Club) to the effect that the shipments of newspapers and magazines sent to Bohemian captives will, after the customary censorship, be immediately delivered to the addressees. The Beseda has received many letters from prisoners, of which we publish those of greater interest:</p>
   <p>Syra, Greece: A few days ago we, Bohemian prisoners of war, received your shipment, of which we were very glad. But our pleasure was of short duration. As soon as our platoon leader read an anti-Austrian article he confiscated the whole shipment with the remark that he, as "K. K. Zugsfuehrer" (German: Imperial and Royal platoon leader--a rank between corporal and sergeant), therefore a "ranking officer," could not tolerate the reading of newspapers <pb facs="5418478_6_1316.jpg" n="2"/>written in an anti-Austrian spirit. We have requested many times that newspapers from Bohemia be sent to us but so far in vain. Letters written us have told us that several shipments had been sent on their way, but since we have not receive anything I presume that they are being held back. You can imagine what the life of a Bohemian in a foreign country is like, particularly when he does not know any other language than Bohemian. I need not describe our feelings when your shipment arrived, much less, of course, our disappointment after the "confiscation". Our boys were almost furious when that heartless Austrian guy took the newspapers away. We have here about three such Bohemian who are so sold on the Austrian double-headed eagle that they cannot imagine Bohemia without it. These are noncommissioned officers.</p>
   <p>There are eighty-three captives here, of whom fifty-three are Bohemian.....</p>
   <p>The crew of a Turkish battleship is also interned here. Among them are two German officers and five marines. These officers influence our "commander"; <pb facs="5418478_6_1317.jpg" n="3"/>hence all the trouble. If you can, please do something to stop them from confiscating your shipments. (A complaint against nondelivery of mail has been filed with the Greek Consulate).</p>
   <p>Samarkand, Asia (Letter in French): Thanks for your shipments; the regular reading of Bohemian newspapers by Bohemian officers and men here gives us a great deal of pleasure and a good idea of what is going on at home. Please continue.....</p>
   <p>Ferizovac, Serbia:.....</p>
   <p>Orenburg, Russia (Letter in German): On behalf of Bohemian soldiers I have the pleasure of asking you to send us Bohemian newspapers. We are working here in the office and I am in charge of affairs in connection with Bohemians and Germans. Excuse my writing in German. I am from Duchcov (German: Tachau, Northwest Bohemia, Germanized section) and have not had any Bohemian schooling. I can talk and read quite well, but the writing is a different matter. My <pb facs="5418478_6_1318.jpg" n="4"/>parents are Bohemian, and I have always been a good Bohemian in my heart, and am proud of it.....</p>
   <p>Paracin, Serbia:....We had the pleasure of seeing Ambassador Vopicka [Charles J.] and talking with him here.....</p>
   <p>Tashkent, Asia: Our dear unknown benefactors, accept, please, our sincere thanks.....</p>
   <p>Please do not leave us now without these periodicals, and send more if you can; there are several hundred of us here.....</p>
   <p>Podgorica, Montenegro: Mr. Vladimir Skrivanek, a member of the Bohemian-American mission, writes: As far as I have had the opportunity to inquire at several places we have visited, your shipments are arriving regularly. I think the reading matter is more appreciated now than money or clothing. Those they are receiving now from everywhere, but spiritual food is lacking.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1319.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Barnaul, Asia:....Your shipments have interrupted a full year during which we have been without reading anything Bohemian. With Sokol greetings.....</p>
   <p>All this correspondence is available for inspection in the office of the secretary of Beseda J. V. Fric. Since, however, many evidently untrustworthy people have shown an overly keen interest in this correspondence, even wanting to copy it, it will be shown only to absolutely reliable and known persons and even these will not be permitted to copy the names and addresses contained in it. This measure is being taken in order to prevent activities of individuals who are doing their dirty work among us (also among Slovaks, Croations, and Slovenes) and are looking for just such documents in order to cause trouble to relatives of implicated men in the old country.</p>
   <p>To the eleven periodicals, copies of which are being so kindly sent to us for forwarding to the captives, the following have been added more recently: Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), New York City; Sokol Americky (American Sokol), <pb facs="5418478_6_1320.jpg" n="6"/>Chicago; Osveta Americka (American Enlightenment), Omaha. Requests for co-operation have been sent to additional periodicals.</p>
   <p>The publishers of Slavia have donated 135 copies of their calendar, and Mrs. Tvrzicky-Kramer, 50 copies of Kalendar Ceskoamerickych Zen (Calendar of Bohemian-American Women). Our depositories are receiving a huge quantity of perused periodicals and many books and calendars from people who have done with them. Many active volunteers are collecting such material from their neighbors and bringing us regularly considerable quantities of reading matter. Because our depositories are also receiving periodicals which are barred from forwarding to the prisoners and have to be returned, a procedure which complicates the work, we state here that the following periodicals are not welcome: Vesmir (Universe), Chicago; American (The American), Cleveland; and Vlastenec (Patriot), La Crosse [papers with strongly Catholic tendency]. They are barred because they have adopted an attitude against the liberating action. Catholic papers are also barred. While they are not so definitely <pb facs="5418478_6_1321.jpg" n="7"/>against the liberating action they frequently publish war news with a strong bias in favor of Germany and her allies, and would therefore not pass the censorship of countries to which they are being sent. Chicago depositories are at the following addresses: in Pilsen: Andel's coffeehouse on Blue Island Avenue near 18th Street; in California: in Mr. Seyka's place of business at 3550 West 26th Street, and also in the home of the secretary. Our Chicago countrymen, particularly our housewives, are requested to save all well-preserved periodicals and deliver them to the above-mentioned depositories. The address of the Beseda is, Beseda Fric, 2322 South Clifton Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Materials may also be brought to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, Southeast corner of Millard Avenue and 26th Street.</p>
