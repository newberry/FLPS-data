   <p>It is in the Council's interest to tell the truth about the "Liberty Glo" matter, if our people are to retain at least a bit of confidence in certain institutions and individuals. A report reached the local Czechoslovakian group sometime ago which stated that the shipment of gifts, sent by our American countrymen to their loved ones in our liberated homeland had been lost at sea. This shipment was aboard the steamer, "Liberty Glo" and had been sent through the Czechoslovak National Council. Many people had bought these gifts with their last few pennies. Another report stated that part of the shipment was salvaged; still another stated that the entire shipment was salvaged and sold at auction in Holland.</p>
   <p>It is only natural that reports of this kind would increase the suspicion [of the senders]. For some time, the individuals responsible for the safe shipment and <pb facs="5418478_6_0064.jpg" n="2"/>delivery [of the cargo] have been making fools of the senders, who, of course, are demanding compensation.</p>
   <p>We had a very sad experience with the first shipment we sent on the so-called "Lod Lasky" (the Ship of Love). This ship, also ladened with privately owned merchandise, was sold in Czechoslovakia, and the sale resulted in a very nice profit for someone. The shipment as a whole, however, was safely delivered, since it was taken care of by a man who was interested in the merchandise because it was not destined for relief--but for a business profit. Despite the fact that the manner in which the cargo aboard the "Ship of Love" was handled, created suspicion, and that because the people grew suspicious several missions were sent to New York to investigate the matter, the Czechoslovak people in the United States, who are interested in this project as a group have not yet learned the truth about the entire matter. Lies and more lies were spread, and the people had to be satisfied with them.</p>
   <p>Then the matter of the shipment on the "Liberty Glo" came up. The news that <pb facs="5418478_6_0065.jpg" n="3"/>the ship was lost at sea with the entire shipment was learned from Cleveland newspapers, who received their information from New York. Officially, Chicago learned about it later on, although the Czechoslovak National Alliance knew about it long before [it notified us]. We have proof that a person who is in contact with the Alliance headquarters, stated with great certainty about fourteen days before [we received official notification] that the ship which carried the gifts from the United States to Czechoslovakia was lost at sea. This statement was made at the theatrical rehearsal in the Havlicek-Tyrs Hall.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovakian people in the United States have allowed themselves to be made fools of long enough. The gentlemen who are concerned should at least see to it that the people are told the truth. The people are entitled to know the truth because they are willing to send generous gifts. They do not ask for anything else. They would rejoice very much if everything were explained by some responsible person who could tell them exactly why the truth is always concealed from them.</p>
