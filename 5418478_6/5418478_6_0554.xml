<title level="a">MEETING OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held its regular meeting Friday evening. The meeting was called to order by the president, Judge J. Uhlir. A majority of the directors were present. The secretary, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, read the minutes of the previous meeting, and these were approved as read. A communication was received from the registrar of the Social Service Registration Office requesting the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost to forward its last annual report. The secretary was authorized to comply with this request.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert Mikes, our representative at the Juvenile Court, announced that John and Alexander Poslusny were sent to St. Joseph's Orphanage [in Lisle]. He also took care of the case of Edward Raichknecht. The secretary brought up the case of the two-and-one-half-year-old Mary Kulhan, whose father, Ludwig Kessel, killed her mother, Francis Kulhan. This case was entrusted <pb facs="5418478_6_0555.jpg" n="2"/>to the care of Reverend Vanek and Mr. J. Jurka. They are to make arrangements for placing the child with some Bohemian family.</p>
   <p>As a result of the fact that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost has recently been receiving many requests to provide for burials, it was resolved that the agent of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost request the president of the Cesko-Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), Mr. John Pech, to give his attention to such cases and make provisions for them. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost has taken upon itself the burden of caring for the living poor people and does not have any funds for the burial of the dead. That should be the duty of the Cesko-Narodni Hrbitov.</p>
   <p>The report of Agent J. Jurka was extensive. Aid was given to many poor families in the form of payment of rents, medical aid, and the provision of groceries. Mr. Jurka was authorized to furnish transportation to Lankin, North Dakota, <pb facs="5418478_6_0556.jpg" n="3"/>for the Havlicek family so that they may join their provider.</p>
   <p>The case of Miss Boehm, ill at Oak Forest, who requested through the medium of the Denni Hlasatel that she be sent back to the old country to her parents, will soon be definitely taken care of. The county poor agent, Mr. Venecek, promised to furnish transportation to New York, and Congressman A. J. Sabath promised to secure deportation passage for her. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost will provide her with funds for other expenses.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jurka presented copies of the letters which are to be sent to members of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost who have neglected to pay their annual membership dues. It was resolved to have five hundred copies printed and to send them out as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved that the annual ball of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost be held on October 30 in the Pilsen Brewing Company's pavilion. A committee <pb facs="5418478_6_0557.jpg" n="4"/>on arrangements was elected. The organization of a women's department of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost was postponed until the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The semiannual financial report, having been examined by the auditing committee, was presented and was approved by the board of directors. According to the report, the balance on hand at the end of the previous year was $3,732.78, and receipts for the first half of the present year were $753.95, making a total of $4,486.73. Disbursements during this period amounted to $1,393.43, leaving a balance in the treasury of $3,093.30.</p>
