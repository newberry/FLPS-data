   <p>Celebrating the Posviceni is an ancient custom with us. Early in its history it came to mean the commemorating of the consecration of a Catholic church. The Czechs and Slovaks, however, observed these days long before they had embraced the Christian faith. With them it was a day at the end of harvest time which was set aside for gathering and rejoicing, before harsh winter came.</p>
   <p>The Posviceni celebration was usually started by feasting sumptuously. Baking Kolace [Half cake and pie, sold even today in Czech-American bakeries] was one of the main features. The devotional part of the <pb facs="5418478_6_1772.jpg" n="2"/>celebration, in which offerings were given, was observed in former times, and may be even today in some sections of the country. There was the "beheading of the rooster", and the Shazovani Kozla (throwing down the goat). Much merriment was attached to these ceremonies, which were performed almost exclusively in the country districts.</p>
   <p>Though the townspeople did not follow these customs very much, still there are many men and women who think, with a glow in their eyes, of these festivities when remembering the old motherland. Countless ditties were composed by rural poets. All of these glorify the good time the people had at the Posviceni. They were artistic in true peasant style, and gave the scene a poetic atmosphere.</p>
   <p>We Czechs and Slovaks in Chicago and vicinity have for years observed a <pb facs="5418478_6_1773.jpg" n="3"/>Posviceni of our own, and celebrate it in a style growing more elaborate and dignified from year to year. We selected for its observance that day which we thought most befitting--Labor Day, September 2, a Monday, so that the Sunday prohibition law shall not interfere. We also selected a very handy place, where we can get together comfortably and enjoy to the fullest extent the satisfaction we feel in the patriotic work done for the liberation of our motherland and our nation. That spot is the Pilsen )Plzen) Brewery Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. This is where, for the third consecutive year, crowds of our people will throng; our people, who are faithful to, and conscious of, their descent; the Czechs and Slovaks of Chicago and neighboring districts. They will spend a day of mirthful, pleasant hours. By contributing some small coin they can assist in the realization of our most sacred aims.</p>
   <p>Our old fashioned Posviceni will be held this year under arrangements made by the district committee of the Czech National Alliance, the National <pb facs="5418478_6_1774.jpg" n="4"/>Alliance of Czech Catholics, and the Slovak League. Representatives of these bodies, which take into their organizations all Czechs and Slovaks of Chicago and the nearby country town districts, will sit on the arrangements committee for the celebration of the Posviceni. This committee is doing its utmost to incorporate in the event everything colorful, interesting, and indigenous in our old-time Czechoslovak Posviceni, combining it with outstanding features of old-fashioned pilgrimages, processions, and various other rites in the life of our forebears. All these patterns will be followed as closely as practicable under new conditions in a new homeland.</p>
   <p>There will be plenty to feast on; good food, beer and wine. Kolace strewn with poppy-seed, Tvaroh (buttered and creamed cottage cheese), and jam and other confections. Three booths will have marchpane on sale, worked into manifold tidbits, such as hearts and tender souvenirs, for every Marenka <pb facs="5418478_6_1775.jpg" n="5"/>(dim. of Mary), Ruzenka (dim. of Rose), and, in fact, in as many varieties as there are girl's names in our language.</p>
   <p>Our Czech butchers and smoked meat dealers have promised to donate an abundance of products of their guild, which are famous all over the country, and there will also be plenty of ice cream. All sorts of toys will be on hand to satisfy the most fastidious fancies of little boys and girls, and even of grown-ups.</p>
   <p>Dashing tunes will be played by Mr. Cerny's band, and there will be nothing high - brow about them either. Instead of attending to the ritual of "beheading the rooster," our Czech and Slovak boys will have a ball-throwing contest, and indulge in licking William II, emperor of all the Huns. A puppet show, and many other attractions, will complete the array of entertainment.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1776.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>For an enterprise of such dimensions there will, of course, be many workers needed. No Czech or Slovak organization should, therefore, fail to send a representative to the arrangements committee to help supply the forces necessary for the execution of the project.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds of the celebration will be directed into the channels of political activities. The nearer the war approaches its end, the closer we move toward the realization of our hopes and longings, and the more money will be needed. The yield will be handed over to Professor Masaryk directly. Every one should help to make this amount of money large enough to correspond with the size of our Czech and Slovak settlements. Agitate for the Posviceni, speak of it in your organizations and urge them to send delegates to the arrangements committee. Sell tickets, and leave nothing undone that could assist in the success of this festivity!</p>
   <p>Let us hope that next year we shall have a festivity in a much more joyful <pb facs="5418478_6_1777.jpg" n="7"/>spirit, when we know that German militarism and autocracy are defeated, when we know that the cause of the Allies, and our own, has won. We shall be blissfully conscious of the fact that, at a time when thousands of our brothers gave, or risked, their lives and their health in Europe, we who stayed at home--for whatever reasons--did not remain inactive, but helped at least by collecting financial means for the liberation of our people.</p>
