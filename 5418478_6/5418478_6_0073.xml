   <p>A good patriot, who does not wish to have his name revealed, deposited in our office the sum of ten dollars, and urged us to deliver the same to the Czechoslovak Aid Committee. This amount is to be used as a donation toward the gift which will be given to President Thomas G. Masaryk on his seventieth birthday. Then he remarked that the reason for sending his donation through the above named committee is that he not only is trusting this committee, but he also knows that the Czechoslovak Aid Committee is using the full amount which is received toward the specified cause, because its officers receive no compensation whatsoever, and because after all the years of its existence, it is able to show the best of records.</p>
   <p>The sum deposited with us was sent to the said committee, and it is our desire that such a generous deed of patriotism and modesty will be followed by many others.</p>
