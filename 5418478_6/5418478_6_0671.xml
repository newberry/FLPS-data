   <p>P.1--Our public gave a splendid example of beneficence, following the Cherry, Ill., catastrophe, where more than 300 miners died, leaving almost 1,000 widows and orphans. Thousands of dollars were gathered, contributed mostly by the working class, for the purpose of alleviating the distress and drying of the tears of the survivors of the unfortunate miners. Bohemian women and girls were the chief contributors to the collection started by this paper.However, this did not suffice for them. They wished to show more emphatically, their desire to aid the most wretched of the unfortunates. To do this the J.C.D. and the S.P.J. of the State of Illinois, appropriated considerable sums of money from their treasuries and urged individual lodges to do likewise. The money so gathered, was turned over to Mrs. Marie Liska, an experienced worker, who will surely use it in such a way, as will do the most good.</p>
