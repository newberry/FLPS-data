<title level="a">ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SVAZ CESKOSLOVENSKYCH LEGIONARU OF AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>After protracted negotiations between the headquarters of the Svaz Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Federation of Czechoslovak Legionnaires) of America and the Czechoslovak Legation in Washington, all complications, in the way of the disposal of their questions have now been removed and we are in a position to announce that demobilization blanks printed in the English language are now in process of preparation, and will be sent to applicants upon a written request. Recognizing the importance of the documents in the English language, the Headquarters is using this method to advise all those who served in the Czechoslovak Army during the war that their applications for demobilization blanks (forms) should be sent by way of the Druzina (Fellowship) to which the applicant belongs, to the Headquarters of the Svaz which, after endorsement, will forward each application to the Czechoslovak Legation for further handling.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1045.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>With regard to prosecution of Czechoslovak Legionnaires for desertion, the Headquarters office, through co-operation with the Czechoslovak Legation in Washington and the simultaneous aid of Professor Sarka Hrbek, director of the foreign-language department of the American Red Cross in New York City, has concluded successful negotiations with Federal authorities, particularly the Department of War, regarding a few instances in which Czechoslovak Legionnaires have been erroneously put on a list of deserters by these authorities. These errors have occured because these authorities failed to receive notice that the men in question had enlisted in the Czechoslovak Army during the World War. The court-martial proceedings against our brothers....have been stopped. In similar cases it is quite sufficient to submit a simple proof of service in the Czechoslovak Army, which may be done either personally or by letter delivered to the commanding officer of the nearest military body , and must be accompained by an affidavit of the formation in which the volunteer served and a document by which his identity can be determined.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1046.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The problem of pensions for invalids has been solved. Three full years after the proclamation of Czechoslovak independence, after consolidation and disposal of a large number of state problems which directly concerned the existence of our liberated nation, now the question of incapacitated Czechoslovak Legionnaires in America is being taken up. This problem, which you will remember, was one of the important points on the agenda of our second general convention, has now been definitely solved through the offices of Dr. B. Stepanek, Czechoslovak Minister in Washington. All those who are directly interested in the cause of the invalids will be glad to learn that, upon repeated intervention of the Washington Legation with the Ministry of Foreign affairs and the Ministry of National Defense in Prague, the military authorities of the Czechoslovak Republic have declared themselves ready to take over into their own jurisdiction all invalid Legionnaires, and in that connection....have adopted a clause....according to which all members of the Czechoslovak Legion who have become invalids as a result of their military service in the Legion, or who, for the same reason, have lost at least twenty per cent of their ability to discharge the duties of their <pb facs="5418478_6_1047.jpg" n="4"/>civilian occupations, are entitled to the same pensions as professional soldiers, even in cases where these Legionnaires are citizens of countries other than Czechoslovakia.....</p>
   <p>The Ministry of National Defense has requested the Ministry of Finance of the Czechoslovak Republic to have these pensions disbursed to American Legionnaires in accordance with the former exchange value of five crowns to one dollar.....</p>
   <p>As to compensation for Czechoslovak Legionnaires, Czechoslovak consular offices in the United States have lately been showing considerable interest in Czechoslovak Legionnaires in America. We state this fact with a great deal of satisfaction and we are very much pleased with their earnest endeavor to improve the conditions of those who were ready to make the supreme sacrifice during the time of our national revolution and our fight for independence. We are not interested in such trifles as a formal recognition of merit and appreciation of services. We are, however, <pb facs="5418478_6_1048.jpg" n="5"/>interested in positive, constructive co-operation and moral or material support in cases where such support is needed. It would be unjust if we should fail to state that, ever since the beginning of our efforts toward organization in America, we have been receiving help from the official representatives of the Czechoslovak Republic ir this country, but all that has been done so far for Czechoslovak Legionnaires does not exceed the minimum of our modest requirements. Thus, the consulates of the Czechoslovak Republic in Chicago, New York, Omaha, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, etc., have always been helpful in our organizing efforts, and at the present time we have been receiving a great deal of attention and sympathetic understanding from Dr. B. Stepanek. Hence we have every reason to hope that a large number of our projects promoted for the benefit of our members will receive favorable consideration on the part of the Czechoslovak Republic.....</p>
   <p>For the Svaz Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru in America: Frana Klepal, reporter, 1401 South Keeler Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
