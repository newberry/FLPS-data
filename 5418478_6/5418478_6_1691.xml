   <p>The Sbor Cesko Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates of the Bohemian National Cemetery), in order properly to observe Memorial Day, has worked out an extensive program for that occasion.</p>
   <p>The celebration will begin early in the morning with a parade which will start from Plzen (Pilsen, a Bohemian settlement of Chicago). The parade will be managed by Mr. Frank Stejskal, its marshal and a member of the Grand Army of the Republic. The order of the march is as follows: 1) Veterans of the Civil War; 2) a band led by Mr. Josef Kalabza; 3) the Board of Delegates of the Cesko Narodni Hrbitov; 4) Bohemian-American veterans of the Spanish-American War; 5) soldiers of the World War; 6) Czechoslovak Legion Post; 7) Czechoslovak veterans of Chicago; 8) Sokol units.</p>
   <p>The parade will start promptly at 7:30 A. M. in front of the building of the <pb facs="5418478_6_1692.jpg" n="2"/>Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets, and will march west on 18th Street to Blue Island Avenue, south on Blue Island Avenue to 22nd Street, where it will board the streetcars and go to the building of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), 5065 North Crawford Avenue. At this point the parade will form again at 10 A. M. and will march to the speakers' dais which is placed in front of the soldiers' monument at the Cesko Narodni Hrbitov.</p>
   <p>Military rites in honor of our fallen soldiers will follow; the Czechoslovak veterans of Chicago will fire a salvo. This group of men consists of veterans of the Spanish-American War.</p>
   <p>The program will continue as follows: 1) The official opening of the celebration by the vice-president of the Board of Delegates of the Hrbitov, Mr. Stanislav Simecek; 2) band music, American songs; 3)an English poem recited <pb facs="5418478_6_1693.jpg" n="3"/>by Miss Anna Burian, an inmate of the Sirotcinec; 4) speech in the English language by County Judge Frank S. Righeimer; 5) Music; 6) speech in the Czech language by Albert J. Havranek, editor of the Denni Hlasatel; 7) Music; 8) poem in the Czech language recited by Miss Vlasta Stipek, an inmate of the Sirotcinec; 9) Music, Czech national songs.</p>
   <p>Notice: At the request of our soldiers the public is requested not to decorate the graves of their dear deceased ones with flags, for this honor is the prerogative of only those men who laid down their lives for the flag. Let us hope that this request will be honored.</p>
   <p>We also call the attention of our people to the crematory in the hope that they will not fail to visit it. There will be an organ concert there between the hours of one and four in the afternoon. Everybody is asked to take precautions not to destroy the property of the cemetery.</p>
   <p>For the Sbor Cesko Narodniho Hrbitova:</p>
