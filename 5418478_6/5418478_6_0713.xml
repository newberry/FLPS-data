   <p>The mystery surrounding the tragedy in the family of Jan Jaros, a plasterer contractor of 4142 West Ogden Avenue, has not been solved up to the present. Jaros was found shot to death at his home on the night of June 10. His wife Anna, and his youngest daughter, Mamie, were poisoned by illuminating gas.</p>
   <p>All sorts of rumors are being circulated. Some say that Jaros shot himself after becoming despondent over heavy financial losses in the recent failure of the private banking house of Joseph A. Cerny. Others claim to know that Jaros had amorous proclivities and associated intimately with other women, among them a Miss Josephine Havelka, who in turn committed suicide by gas after the Jaros tragedy became known. Mrs. Jaros, <pb facs="5418478_6_0714.jpg" n="2"/>it is rumored, shot her husband in a fit of violent jealousy, then turned on the gas and took her youngest child along into death.</p>
   <p>The coroner's inquest will be held in the Lawndale Avenue police station next Friday.</p>
