   <p>There was a lively time in Pilsen Park at 26th Street and Albany Avenue yesterday. The active ladies of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society) worked from early morning until 2 o'clock in the afternoon filling Christmas baskets for two hundred Bohemian families and preparing Christmas presents for four hundred children. At 2 o'clock, when all this work was finished, little tots accompanied by their mothers began streaming into the hall to receive their presents and to be entertained by a Christmas program prepared for them by the ambitious secretary of the Society, the Reverend Vaclav Vanek.</p>
   <p>The distribution of the baskets began at 2 P. M. and lasted a full hour. Several members of the Bohemia Masonic Lodge came in automobiles to help distribute twenty-seven baskets among families whose names had been given to them by the Society. They also delivered presents to twelve little girls whose names had been published in the Denni Hlasatel....</p>

   <p>Promptly at 3 o'clock the Christmas program began....After the playing of a piano selection, Santa Claus entered, walking majestically to the Christmas tree which, shining brightly with hundreds of electric lights, was placed on the platform. He addressed the children with a good-natured, simple talk. His speech was followed by a dramatic recitation and two Christmas carols sung beautifully by the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society).</p>
   <p>The distribution of presents then took place under the direction of Mr. John A. Sokol....</p>
