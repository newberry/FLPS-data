   <p>A well-attended meeting was held by the directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost in the main office on Kedzie Avenue last night, Mr. Stanislav Loula, chairman, presiding. After Mr. Vaclav Vanek, secretary, read his report on current business, and Miss Hutter submitted her findings on some relief cases, Mrs. Kreml, of the ladies' section of the Czech Charitable Association, spoke on the preparations that group is making for tag day, which is to be held on May 13, in common with the Chicago Federation of Adult Charities. She announced that 78 women have signed up to work on that day, while 125 are needed for her division. The Federation demands certain requirements of all workers, she stated, and it has also sent out posters to all branches, which should, in turn, see that they are conspicuously displayed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, one of the directors, spoke of the death of Joseph Z. <pb facs="5418478_6_0124.jpg" n="2"/>Uhlir, associate judge of the Municipal court, who was one of the Association's founders and chairman for many years. The members rose to honor the memory of the late judge. Mr. Vanek then declared that a permanent memorial should be erected befitting the esteem in which the member of many years' standing was held by the community. A committee consisting of Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, Kreml, and Hajicek, with the aid of two ladies yet to be named, will begin preparations for the memorial. For the time being, a motion by Mr. Janovsky was passed which provides for two pictures of the late judge, one of which is to be placed in the office of the Association and the other in the Court of Domestic Relations, where Judge Uhlir spent many years in blessed activity.</p>
   <p>The idea of the creation of a fund for charitable purposes has found decided favor in two special meetings held recently, and it is one plan long cherished by Judge Uhlir, whom death prevented from working for its realization.</p>
   <p>Directors of the Association and some ladies have already begun to contribute, <pb facs="5418478_6_0125.jpg" n="3"/>so that a nucleus of one hundred dollars is on hand. The ladies of the Association have, no doubt, also started an independent collection.</p>
