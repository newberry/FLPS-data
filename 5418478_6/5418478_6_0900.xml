   <p>It is not for the first time that we are calling attention to this matter. We have said several times already that the tactlessness and rabidity with which the Germans in America are defending the "Vaterland" will not damage them so much as it will harm us and all immigrants. There was a time when immigrants used to enjoy every political liberty in the United States, but we have been afraid that our enemies will take advantage of the events accompanying this war to show that the immigrants are an unreliable element, that they are not loyal to America but remain attached to Europe. Now, our prediction has proved correct. An old and embittered enemy of the immigrants, Theodore Roosevelt, has been heard from these days, a man who hardly had warmed up his presidential seat when he inaugurated an attack against the immigrants, a man who in his first message to Congress, in 1901, devoted long columns to attacks against European immigrants "who murder the Presidents," and succeeded in that way in having immigration restricted by Congress.</p>
   <p>Roosevelt has written an article in the July issue of the magazine Metropolitan <pb facs="5418478_6_0901.jpg" n="2"/>which indicates what treatment immigrants may expect in the United States in case more such fanatics as the rough-riding colonel are among the American political leaders. He writes among other things:</p>
   <p>"The terrible war which threatens to pull us also into the struggle has bared the cancer of 'conditional' Americanism in our midst and has shown us the necessity of trying to unify our nation. There should be no 'hyphenated' Americans (by which Roosevelt means German-Americans, Anglo-Americans, Bohemian-Americans, etc.) but only Americans. Every foreigner in our country who wants to become a good American, citizen should demonstrate his good intentions by becoming a thorough American, without any equivocation, any condition attached to his being a good American, or any inclination to his old country, and by repudiating entirely any double nationality. He should be an American only, and nothing else whatever. Only under these conditions may he expect to be treated like any native-born citizen of this country."</p>
   <p>Following this, Roosevelt shows how this end should be reached. He says that <pb facs="5418478_6_0902.jpg" n="3"/>the first condition of good American citizenship is for the immigrant to acquire the knowledge of the English language as soon after his arrival as possible. Every school, every business, every institution should see to it that the immigrants stop using their native language and learn English at the earliest date. The knowledge of the English language should be the first interest of all schools, and factories should pay higher wages and give better chances for advancement to those workingmen who talk English. Roosevelt would permit the immigrants to preserve some of the good customs they had acquired at home, but their first duty should be to adjust themselves to American customs and traditions. The English language should be considered the foundation of any success in America, and should be the first qualification for American citizenship. In times of peace, the knowledge of the English language is necessary for personal safety, for the performance of the duties of citizenship, and for the acquiring of a measure of prosperity. In times of war, it is an important qualifying factor of national unity.</p>
   <p>Illiteracy should be limited to the least possible degree. Every immigrant up <pb facs="5418478_6_0903.jpg" n="4"/>to the age of forty-five should learn to read and write, either in school or at home. He should be reading at least one English periodical. He may also read newspapers or other periodicals printed in his native language, but he should be sure to cultivate the language that will be most likely to be the language of his children, and very definitely the language of his grandchildren.</p>
   <p>The provisions for admission to citizenship should be changed. They should be simplified, require less expense and less time, but the certificates should be issued only to immigrants manifesting loyalty and an understanding of the duties of citizenship. Also women should be required to apply for and acquire citizenship.</p>
   <p>Our country, says Roosevelt, is a pot in which various nations are being melted into one. It is to be desired that this melting be as complete as possible. If there is anything left that cannot be melted and blended with the rest of the mixture, it is worthless and harmful. It is harmful to the individuals, and consequently to the whole nation. In other words, it is a disgrace if one or <pb facs="5418478_6_0904.jpg" n="5"/>another American citizen acts as a German-American, Anglo-American, Irish-American, and not as an American, a simple, hyphenated American. It is criminal for such a hyphenated citizen not to give all his loyalty to the United States, and to have a part of it reserved for another country.</p>
   <p>These are Roosevelt opinions. We are afraid that they are also the opinions of other influential and leading statesmen, who will want to introduce them into practice as soon as an opportunity can be found. Will it benefit America? America should take advantage of experience in Europe and realize that every forcible action generates a forcible reaction, and that no nation in the world can be deprived of its language by compulsion.</p>
