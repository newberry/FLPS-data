<title level="a">ENTERTAINMENT FOR JAN KUBELIK IN LIBUSE HALL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Last night the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) gave an entertainment in honor of the great violin virtuoso, Jan Kubelik, and his accompanist, Mr. Svaba. The affair took place in the upper hall of Libuse Hall on Twelfth Street. Many ladies and gentlemen were present to greet the artist. There was a program of vocal music. Mr. Novak, of Manistee, Michigan, a distinguished basso, was the soloist of the evening. Mr. Kubelik personally expressed his pleasure and praised Mr. Novak's work. He paid the strictest attention to all numbers on the program and was not grudging in his applause. In the society of his acquaintances, Mr. Kubelik heartily enjoyed the evening till late at night. It is to be regretted that the upper rooms of Libuse Hall were almost too small to accommodate the many guests. The main hall is under contract to a dance club and for that reason it was not available.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1510.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After the conclusion of his concerts here, Mr. Kubelik will continue further west. His tour ends on the Pacific coast.</p>
   <p>We hope, however, that this will not be his last tour.</p>
