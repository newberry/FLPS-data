   <p>It is possible today to foretell that the Czechoslovak section of the Libertyparade, to be held next Saturday, is destined to be the best arranged, the most colorful, and the most beautiful. Czech associations of all possible kinds are signing up for participation, in truly impressive numbers. Sokols, the Czech Butchers' Guild, groups of the Czech section of the Red Cross, Catholic societies, Free-Thought associations, and many others, have already applied. They have promised to appear with flags and banners which are bound to create a magnificent spectacle.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovak mothers whose sons died while in service, either in camps, hospitals, or in battle overseas, are going to form a group of their own in the parade. They are requested to appear at the Czechoslovak main campaign office, 3342 West 26th Street, where all information will be given. Anyone knowing a mother who might wish to participate in this group, but who has not been informed, is requested to invite her to join. [Program and arrangement of parade follows.].....</p>
