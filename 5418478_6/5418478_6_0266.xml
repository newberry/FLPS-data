   <p>An important meeting of the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor (Bohemian Relief Committee)....was held in the premises of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost(Bohemian Charitable Association) on South Kedzie Avenue near 26th Street last night.....</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Chairman Anton J. Cermak with an explanation of the relationship existing between this Vybor and the American Red Cross committee in charge of the relief funds for the victims of the "Eastland" disaster. That committee held a meeting night before last, but not much was accomplished. It was decided, however, that the fund, which is considerable, should be divided among the victims "right away," but what was meant by "right away" was not defined.....</p>
   <p>The Cesky Pomocny Vybor agreed to send cards to all those who had relatives among the victims of the "Eastland" catastrophe, asking them to report at the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, where two employees will be on duty at all times, ready to help them in any way. All those who have unpaid undertaking <pb facs="5418478_6_0267.jpg" n="2"/>bills should take them along. These will be paid by the Vypomocny Vybor upon receiving proof that the family has not enough money to take care of them. Those who are in need of immediate cash because of the catastrophe should apply for help without feeling embarrassed. They will receive whatever they need. Anybody who knows of a family that is in need and is too timid to ask for help, should report to the Vypomocny Vybor. This report should be made either to Mr. Cermak's office, Room 804, City Hall, or in the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost.</p>
   <p>This was the most important action taken by the Vybor, and it was a most sensible one. The general committee downtown and the Red Cross do nothing but "investigating". But the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor wants to help, and asks those who need help to come and tell them about it. This is really a kind of co-operation.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Jos. A. Holpuch....reported new donations amounting to $129. His total receipts so far amount to $8,800.25. Certainly a goodly sum, although we still hope that it will reach the ten thousand figure.....</p>
