   <p>The fall brings new life into our associations. Fall is also the most suitable time for meditation, speculation, and reminiscence. This is the second fall of the war in Europe, the second year of suffering for the Bohemian people overseas.</p>
   <p>Thousands of our countrymen in a hundred Bohemian-American communities are longing for good, sincere Bohemian talk. The best way to use a free evening week-days, or Sunday afternoon in the fall season, is to spend it in a meeting, particularly when there is an interesting lecture on the program. A spoken word is much more powerful than a written one. It goes from the speaker's heart to the heart of the audience, increasing the happiness of the occasion. No Bohemian association, no Bohemian community should be wasting time in these historic days.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) makes herewith <pb facs="5418478_6_1309.jpg" n="2"/>a candid offer to arrange lectures in all Bohemian associations societies, and communities, where Bohemian feeling still prevails, where the people have not lost interest in the Bohemian cause, where they are not indifferent toward the future of their severely tried nation. The Narodni Sdruzeni offers to send its best workers and speakers, those who are known from their previous public appearances, anywhere where lectures are desired.</p>
   <p>For all Chicago associations which express the desire for a lecture, the Narodni Sdruzeni will arrange for a good man who will speak about conditions in the old country and the action for the liberation of our nation free of charge in case the association is a member of the Narodni Sdruzeni. Nonmembers will be asked to make any donation of their own choosing to the national fund.</p>
   <p>Associations outside of Chicago will be required to defray the transportation <pb facs="5418478_6_1310.jpg" n="3"/>expenses of the speaker, and his food and hotel bill if stay over night is necessary or indicated. The speaker receives no fee, but a donation , in accordance with the association's own discretion for the political action and relief in the old country, is expected.</p>
   <p>In vicinities where more than one lecture can be arranged, the expenses for each participating association or community will be correspondingly smaller. All associations and the leaders of all Bohemian-American communities are requested to apply for lectures as soon as possible. Correspondence should be addressed to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance)[sic], 3639 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois. Lectures with stereoptican slides are available.</p>
   <p>Now a word to our educated classes and our intellectuals: In the list of our contributors, the names of many of our educated countrymen are <pb facs="5418478_6_1311.jpg" n="4"/>still missing; that is, we miss there the names of men who doubtless know and understand what we are doing, and trying to do in the future. No doubt these men, especially our lawyers, physicians, pharmacists, teachers, etc., are just waiting for our solicitors to call on them with a collection form. Since, however, the Narodni Sdruzeni finds it necessary to use its workers for an intensive propaganda campaign elsewhere, our intellectuals are requested to send in their contributions without requiring the service of a solicitor, and in that way save a great deal of time and effort that is badly needed elsewhere. Among our contributors of the medical profession are, for example, Dr. B. Simonek with $200, Dr. J. E. Jelinek with $25, Dr. A. Mach with $25, Dr. [Ludwig J.]Fisher with $10 a month, Dr. Bilek with $3 a month; there are also others who have made contributions on collection forms now in circulation. We are directing our appeal likewise to Bohemian druggists, lawyers, and especially bankers and owners of large industrial or commercial establishments, to make their contributions now.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1312.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Any Bohemian bank will accept a donation deposited for the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni. Let our intellectuals and prosperous classes be an example to all other countrymen. In Boston and in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the donations of poor Bohemian workingmen average up to $25. So, let's go to it. All correspondence to the Narodni Sdruzeni should be addressed to 3639 West 26th Street (corner Millard Avenue). We are glad to receive there callers desiring any information.</p>
