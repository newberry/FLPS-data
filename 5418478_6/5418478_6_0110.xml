   <p>The Red Cross Organization of the Thirty-fourth Ward is making vigorous efforts in behalf of the Second Fund for the American Red Cross. It is making sure that every individual does his duty. Work has doubled in volume during the second week of the campaign and the results are very satisfactory. They show that the Thirty-fourth is ahead of the rest of our Czech Wards.</p>
   <p>Alderman Joseph O. Kostner informs us that $11,643.54 has been paid by 6,707 contributors up to today.</p>
   <p>To the ladies goes, of course, most of the credit for this achievement. Mrs. Danek brought in the largest amount so far.</p>
   <p>Our ladies are not satisfied with single collections. They make repeated drives for further donations, no matter how high an amount our better situated fellow countrymen had contributed before. Tagging will be continued <pb facs="5418478_6_0111.jpg" n="2"/>today. In yesterday's meeting, at Hubbard Memorial Church on Lawndale Avenue, the workers decided on individual locations for canvassing. They picked the liveliest corners of the settlement, and, of course, on a holiday like Memorial Day they expect to reap a rich harvest. Crawford Avenue, 26th, 22nd, and Twelfth Streets, will be the streets canvassed most.</p>
