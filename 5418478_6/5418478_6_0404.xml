  <body>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) herewith presents its fourth monthly report on its work to our public. The longer the war lasts, the greater catastrophe it causes, and the greater are our duties toward our nation and our old country, both of whom are suffering by it. Each day takes a number of fathers away from their families; each day brings new sorrow and despair; and each day should bring a new benefactor.</p>
   <p>The Christmas season, the season of joy and happy memories, is approaching. What a gloomy Christmas this will be in our old country! How sad will those people whom the government has already advised that their dear ones are among the wounded, or dead, be; and how sad will those who can expect similar news any time be! How sad will be the scene around the deserted Christmas trees in families of workingmen whose wages have been stopped! The number of such cases will be innumerable; may the number of philanthropists be equally great! We hope that all our countrymen will remember that there will be sad Christmas holidays <pb facs="5418478_6_0405.jpg" n="2"/>in Bohemia, and by substantial contributions prove their munificence.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor is far from closing its collections. The fact is that we have had five hundred new subscription forms printed which bring the total to two thousand, and we hope that they will be returned to us full of substantial contributions. Our activities are growing from day to day, a fact which is demonstrated by the growing number of our national organizations that take part in our work. With their help, we shall overcome all the obstacles put in our way by various critics and busybodies. The success of our endeavor will be the sweetest reward to all those who have worked with us.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to compare the results of our relief work with the results of similar actions undertaken by other Slavs in the city. The inquiries sent out by our secretary have so far been answered only by the Slovaks. Mr. Krizan, secretary of the Slovanska Liga (Slovak League), has told us that their fund amounted to $9,208.33 at the beginning of November, and that it has grown since <pb facs="5418478_6_0406.jpg" n="3"/>then. But he has no exact figures on hand, because some of the depositaries have not sent in their latest reports. It would be well if we would make up our minds and emulate the Slovaks both in their willingness to sacrifice and their unity in these serious times. They work together and are getting splendid results, although their people are comparatively poorer than ours.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us do our duty!</p>
   <p>For the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, J. F. Stepina, president; Jaroslav Nigrin, secretary. Address: 1825 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
