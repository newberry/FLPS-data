  <body>
   <p>Before my departure from the beloved homeland several men, outstanding in Czech political life, entreated me to keep in my mind the necessity of establishing in America an institution similar to the Czech National Council. Among those who approached me on the subject were the heads of the foremost national corporations, leaders in the Czech National Council and in the department for national affairs outside the borders of the homeland. They all emphasized the fact that the Czechs of America represent the strongest branch of our people outside the borders and should, therefore, be the first to join in the rally for our one great common aim: the good and the glory of our nation, for a more active national life, here, and closer relationship with our old homeland, alas, so far away. We, therefore, aim at a unification into a league of all patriots, male and female, of all good people regardless of allegiance or convictions - of all those who are willing to work for the success of our respective needs.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1608.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After having taken counsel from numerous personages, chairmen and secretaries of prominent associations, I decided to give my idea concrete form. My efforts were acknowledged with such hospitality that I received responses of approval and promises of cooperation to everyone of the inquiries I had sent out to Czech societies all over the country. This proved that they were in sympathy with my organizing endeavor, more, they became members of the league, and applications for membership are arriving daily in great numbers. The trustees of the Czech-American National Council will have established local groups in every American town before long.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Czech-American National Council will have its seat in Chicago for the first three years, whereupon the executive power will be transferred to some other town, and the Chicago organization will assume the name Chicago Group, Bohemian-American National Council.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_1609.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The locals are to work rather independently, and will be subject to orders from the Central Executive committee only in the most weighty decisions.</p>
   <p>The Czech-American National Council - I say this with emphasis - is not, and cannot be, a national institution to which the entire Czech-American public would owe allegiance, not even voluntarily, and for the good cause. This is possible in Bohemia, by no means in America. It differs fundamentally, and in many points from the National Council in Bohemia, and will be adapted to American conditions. I, being cognizant of the situation of the American Czechs, have not the remotest idea of creating something which is not possible and cannot be realized here; our league is simply a rally of good patriots who are willing to work for the Czech cause in Bohemia and in America. We will discuss national enterprises, give advice and will lustily begin with detail work of whatever sort is needed and that is all. Our initial plans are <pb facs="5418478_6_1610.jpg" n="4"/>simple and possible to carry out; if they bear fruit all of Czech-America will be with us. More than one-half feel with us already, as they have grasped the necessity of this well-meant experiment now in progress. The meritorious, and in its work successful, Bohemian-American Press Bureau has promised to cooperate so far, indeed, as to become part of the Czech-American National Council itself. The latter is a sister of the National Council in Bohemia, and will come to its aid whenever the main interests of the Bohemians should be at stake, and in everything concerning the economic or cultural welfare of the people and of us, here, who not only speak but also feel Czech.</p>
   <p>The work of paramount importance to be done is to inform the Czech-American youth of our needs, call on their support in our work and to show them how to be dutiful American citizens and good Czech-Americans at the same time.</p>
   <p>Signed E. St. Vraz.</p>
