<title level="a">ARE OUR IMMIGRANTS PROPERLY PROVIDED FOR?</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Perhaps there is not one of us who does not know from his own experience the hardships of an immigrant who, after arriving in America, finds himself not only bewildered and lost, but in most instances at the mercy of a whole string of unscrupulous agents who take advantage of his lack of proper information.</p>
   <p>The daily newspapers are full of instances where our people are plundered by the use of sinister methods, and not a week passes without the fear, that another young girl has fallen into the snares of men with criminal motives.</p>
   <p>Tired by the long journey, disappointed times without number by dishonest agents, and robbed of his last coin, our immigrant sets foot on American soil and is kept on that notorious Ellis Island. To whom should he turn after so <pb facs="5418478_6_0490.jpg" n="2"/>many disappointments? In whom should be put his confidence?</p>
   <p>The Slovanska Spolecnost Pristehovalecka (The Slavonic Immigrant Protective Society) is at this time the only organization which daily sends its representative to Ellis Island to look after the interests of our people, to advise and direct, and otherwise be helpful, without expecting from them any remuneration. Nationality is not considered among the Slavs, nor does profession or political affiliation have any bearing with this Society. Urgent need of help is the criterion.</p>
   <p>This Slovanska Spolecnost Pristehovalecka has been founded on humanitarian principles and it is entirely independent of any steamship company or any other profit-seeking organization. Headed by leaders of unblemished reputation who are conscious of their responsibility to all, it remains the best guide for an immigrant in need of assistance.</p>
   <p>The Society owns its own home at 436 West 23rd Street, New York, and in the <pb facs="5418478_6_0491.jpg" n="3"/>year 1913 it helped and intervened at Ellis Island in 3,111 cases which affected 4,341 persons. In that year, work for 309 men and 592 women was secured by the Society. Thus the Society took care of a total of nine hundred persons, and anyone who knows how hard it is now to find employment will be able to appreciate the significance of these figures.</p>
   <p>In 234 cases the representative of the Society appealed to Washington against the rulings of the immigration officials. Of these 234 cases, 81 have been decided favorably, that is, practically thirty per cent, which means that 153 persons were ordered deported, whereas 81 were saved for America through the Society's intervention.</p>
   <p>To those who are familiar with prevailing conditions it is well known that in cases on Ellis Island where the law seems to be against the immigrant, or in cases where a protest filed against the ruling of the immigration officials has been overruled, the fate of the immigrant is certainly deplorable. Where an immigrant needs not only financial, but also moral support, his case should be studied very closely, to make certain that there is no miscarriage of justice.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0492.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Society helped 165 families financially. It assisted in 168 cases where deportation because of physical disability would have been enforced, in 369 cases of mental deficiency and communicable diseases, and also in 52 cases of pregnancy of single girls. It dealt with the cases of 26 workingmen who received deportation notices because they had been hired on contract, of 44 children less than 16 years old, of 43 people with criminal records in Europe, and of 10 people who had been denied entry into Canada. All these cases required more time to investigate than the ordinary ones.</p>
   <p>In spite of these respect-compelling results we cannot say that our immigration problems get the proper attention.</p>
   <p>Practically 12,000 Bohemians and 30,000 Slovaks land on our shores every year. Since its means are very limited, how many of these immigrants can receive from the Slovanska Spolecnost Pristehovalecka the attention they require, and how much money would be needed to take care of them all?</p>
   <p>The Society is dependent upon public charity, and its members can only be <pb facs="5418478_6_0493.jpg" n="5"/>The Society helped 165 families financially.

Under these circumstances the majority of our immigrants do not get at all the attention they should receive, and in most favorable cases are left to the questionable direction of agents who are concerned in furthering objectives not always very favorable to the immigrants.</p>
