   <p>Should our Bohemian national community and organizations prosper and develop in a desirable way towards progress, we are always in need of new blood,new members. We should watch the youths, descendants of Bohemian parents, that they join our national organizations, and of importance besides the necessity to study English, the youths should study Bohemian and the rich history of Bohemian schools have a generous task to fulfill, more difficult than anyone would think.</p>
   <p>The old settlers, who brought to this country the love of everything Bohemian, are passing away, one after the other, and should the Bohemian youths not be raised and educated in Bohemia, individually, our ranks of healthy minded Bohemian-Americans, and the number of Bohemian organizations in the United States would be diminished in a few years.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0952.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As a matter of the future and nationalistic development, it is the duty of every Bohemian, in this country, to care for and watch, also to support the free thinking Bohemian schools, founded in this country, and to agitate and work to be an ardent protector and propagator of this idealistic cause. It is the right plan to mention that the Bohemian Falkou Organizations in Chicago is the most meritorious organization of the nationalistic Bohemian movement in Chicago, and we are full of hope that its efforts will be indefinitely prolonged.</p>
