   <p>The activity in behalf of our prisoners of war in Serbia....is gaining new friends and is growing into a movement which, next to the great activities for the liberation of our nation....will prove that the American Bohemians are realizing their duty toward the neediest of their brothers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan Vita of Montgomery, Minnesota, writes in the paper to which he subscribes: "Upon the appeal in your paper I have made up my mind to dress at least one....prisoner. Hence I am sending you a package containing one suit of underwear, two shirts, one pair of trousers, suspenders, one pair of shoes, one felt hat, and a coat."</p>
   <p>To this we just add....that if only one of every ten of our countrymen would follow Mr. Vita's example, all our countrymen in Serbia would be clad....</p>
   <p>Countryman Frank Pasek....called on Josef A. Husek....one of our first and <pb facs="5418478_6_0336.jpg" n="2"/>most active collectors and delivered to him, in addition to a bundle of clothing, $1.50, his first earnings after an idleness of several months.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Antonie Horacek of South Omaha, who collects in her community....has already sent five bags of linen and clothes, all nearly new....</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Stekl, businessman of Pine City, Minnesota, has sent to Mr. Husek a dozen new shirts.</p>
   <p>Paul John Minovsky of Branch, Wisconsin....has sent a case of very good apparel.....</p>
   <p>Countryman C. Hal of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin....has sent a large box full of linen.....</p>
   <p>[Fifteen more of such individual donations are mentioned.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0337.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The organizers of the clothing undertaking owe a debt of gratitude also to Mr. Chas. A. Grant of Korbel Brothers, who induced the Chicago &amp; Erie Railroad Company to transport our donations, free of charge, to New York,and possibly to Saloniki. This has been necessary because the Red Cross, in accordance with its rules, cannot accept for forwarding anything but new material. Negotiations are, however, in progress in Washington to make it possible for the Red Cross also to accept secondhand goods after a thorough disinfection.....</p>
   <p>....The women members of the Sokol Praha in Town of Lake....voted twenty dollars for the purchase of inexpensive but substantial clothing for the prisoners....This Sokol, although in rather restricted circumstances, had previously voted five dollars for cotton for Serbia and five dollars for the political action of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance).</p>
   <p>Another source of substantial help will be the work of volunteers, both men and women, who are getting ready for their first affair, a great carnival to be held in the Bohemian-American Hall on 18th Street May 7.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0338.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We again address our countrymen with the appeal to send....their donations of clothing to the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), R. J. Psenka, at 541 West 12th Street, Chicago, Illinois. He will also arrange for the picking up of material upon receiving the necessary information.</p>
