   <p>This week's meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society) was held last Friday and was presided over by the Society's vice-president, Mr. F. J. Petru. The minutes from the last meeting were approved as read....</p>
   <p>The secretary, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, reported that many applications for support were received from single men, and pointed to the fact that, according to its bylaws, the Society may provide for families only. Because of prevailing unemployment and the approaching winter season, requests for shelter and food by single men are expected to be coming in in increasing numbers. After a debate the meeting agreed to appoint a committee of three members who will consider the possibility of establishing a shelter where destitute single men could spend nights and receive food....</p>
   <p>The receipt of an additional $115 for tickets to the charity ball was reported, which increases the amount received by mail to $1,378.50. Thus far, the net <pb facs="5418478_6_0514.jpg" n="2"/>income from the ball amounts to $2,261.27, and there are still many tickets neither paid for nor returned.... It is expected that the ball will net at least $2,400....</p>
