<title level="a">MEETING OF THE CESKA DOBROCINNA SPOLECNOST</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held in the office of the Pilsen Brewing Company last Friday evening. Judge J. Z. Uhlir called the meeting to order in the presence of a majority of the members. The meeting was attended by Mr. Frank Venecek, Cook County welfare agent, and Mr. Frank Nedbal, county agent at the branch office on Blue Island Avenue. Mr. Venecek was elected a member of the board of directors at the previous meeting, and Mr. Nedbal received that honor in Friday's meeting. The presence of these two men will be to the advantage of the Association if they co-operate with it.</p>
   <p>Many requests for aid were received, and these were turned over to the Association's agent for investigation. A communication was received from the headquarters of the United Charities in regard to the founding of a social service registration bureau in Chicago. It is to be an association of all charitable organizations in the city, each of which is to send a delegate to a general meeting to be held on July 17. This association will <pb facs="5418478_6_0561.jpg" n="2"/>exchange among its affiliated organizations the names of those receiving assistance, because it sometimes happens that some persons receive assistance from two or more associations. Mr. John Sokol was delegated to attend the above-mentioned meeting.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Bohemian Central Singing Society) sent a communication announcing that it is willing to contribute ten per cent of the proceeds from the sale of tickets for its concert in the Coliseum to three of our national institutions--that is, one third to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, one third to the Patronat Svobodomyslnych Skol (Trustees of the Free Thought Schools), and one third to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (The Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The communication was received with gratitude, and it was resolved that all friends of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost should try to attend the concert and sell as many tickets as possible.</p>
   <p>To the ladies who so effectively assisted on tag day, a special request is being sent to assist in selling the concert tickets. Mr. Uhlir was authorized <pb facs="5418478_6_0562.jpg" n="3"/>to secure recognition of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost by the Chicago Association of Commerce. It is an important matter to see that the activities of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost are familiar to American circles. Mr. Drije announced that the net proceeds of the tag day will amount to $1,918.53. The tag day committee is to make a final report at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Cervenka made a motion, which was seconded by Mr. V. Vanek and unanimously passed by the board of directors, that one hundred dollars be appropriated for the benefit of the Orphanage near the Bohemian National Cemetery and one hundred dollars for the Bohemian Catholic Orphanage at Lisle, Illinois, for those Bohemian orphans who have been or may be sent to that institution by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. Mr. Lalla was entrusted with the task of visiting the bank where the Association has its funds deposited, relative to having the bank pay some interest upon the deposit.</p>
   <p>The manager's report, which was approved, showed the following disbursements:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_6_0563.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Rents paid for clients, $54.75; groceries, $47.33; coal $19.13; medicine, $6.80; office expenses, $14.40; total, $150.16.</p>
   <p>The committee on applications of children for Camp Bartzen at Oak Forest, Illinois, consisting of Messrs. Vanek and Krasny, announce that thus far they have received about two hundred applications from Bohemian children. Their names have been turned over to Mr. Nedbal, manager of the branch of the county agent's office on Blue Island Avenue, for examination. Other applicants may contact Mr. Krasny at the Svornost, Mr. V. Vanek, 2324 South Central Park Avenue, or Mr. F. Nedbal, county agent, 1655 Blue Island Avenue. Applications will be accepted until July 1.</p>
