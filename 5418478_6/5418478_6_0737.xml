   <p>The city and state should take serious steps to prevent the sale of guns to people who have no business carrying them. It is true, there are state laws and city ordinances prohibiting the carrying of arms by such people, and the sale of guns to them. But these provisions apparently do not meet the situation as any boy seems to be able to obtain possession of a gun. In a city like Chicago there are dozens, nay, hundreds of stores, where the criminal element are able to get their supply of firearms and ammunition without any difficulty. And this should be stopped! But it cannot be done by mere passing of laws. The authorities must also see to it that such laws as exist are enforced, and nobody but an inveterate prohibitionist will deny that the enforcement of such laws is much more important than snooping after liquor. If the army of prohibition agents could be put to use combating the traffic in firearms, it would be of much greater benefit to society, the community, the state, and the nation <pb facs="5418478_6_0738.jpg" n="2"/>than spying around for places where a quart or so a day of liquor is being sold.</p>
   <p>The possession of a gun does not offer a great deal of protection nowadays. Just the opposite is true. A peaceful, unarmed citizen has a better chance in a hold-up than an armed one, because the discovery of a gun on the person of his victim serves to anger and enrage the hold-up man, and his victim rarely comes into a position to defend himself successfully. Therefore the carrying of a gun in the pocket is not only against the law, and the city ordinances, but is useless. To have a gun at home, particularly in outlying districts, may be useful providing the gun is handled carefully; but even so it has frequently been found to be of greater damage than advantage.</p>
   <p>Some means, therefore, should be found to make firearms obtainable only by those who have a legal right to carry them, and who can be relied upon to use them so as to endanger nobody around them. What these means should be, is up to the respective authorities and legislative bodies to determine. There is a very <pb facs="5418478_6_0739.jpg" n="3"/>definite impression in the public mind that neither our elected representatives nor any other authorities have done very much in this respect. The suggestion that the carrying of firearms should be limited to the members of the army and the police is too restrictive inasmuch as private citizens also are, under certain circumstances, in legal need of them; but it should be possible to devise a method of controlling the manufacture and sale of firearms which would be much stricter than the present one, and would not constitute an undue infringement of the personal liberty of the citizens. There should be a strictly enforced registration of owners of firearms. Persons who have been convicted of a crime should never be given the right to carry a gun, and a person carrying a gun without a permit should be subject to severe punishment. An end should be put to the situation as it is now, otherwise security of person and property in this country will become a joke.</p>
