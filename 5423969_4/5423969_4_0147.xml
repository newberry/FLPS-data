   <p>The Reverend J. H. Meyer of Zion Church conducted services last Sunday at the Home for the Aged in Norwood Park. The minister brought with him his organist and the whole choir, so that the afternoon became a real song festival. The young people of the church declared themselves highly pleased with the visit. They visited the aged ones in their rooms, studied the institution, and found that it greatly surpassed their expectations in every respect. Afterwards they went outside to play games on the wide lawn behind the building. During the evening, they gave vocal numbers from the veranda of the building, and when, in the brilliant moonlight, they went home about ten o'clock in the evening, they were accompanied by the gratitude and good wishes of the aged people, who wished that the young ones would soon return.</p>
