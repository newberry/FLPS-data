   <p>About three o'clock this morning fire was discovered in the new building of the Home for the Aged, in Norwood Park. Approximately sixty of the old people were sleeping in the old building. It appeared for a time that the old building would also be destroyed.</p>
   <p>The matron soon had all of the aged residents dressed and out in the yard. The night was very cold, and the old people had to find shelter or freeze. The station master at the N. W. R. R. station soon had a roaring fire in the stove in the waiting room, and the old people were made snug for the night.</p>
   <p>The fire burned merrily throughout the night, and by morning only a pile of ashes remained. The building was fully covered by insurance.</p>
