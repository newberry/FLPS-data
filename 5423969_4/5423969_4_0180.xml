<title level="a">GRAND OPENING OF SCANDIA HALL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The entire Scandinavian Colony must have been present at the opening of Scandia Hall.</p>
   <p>Every Scandinavian Singing Society in Chicago sang, and every organization and church was represented.</p>
   <p>The new president of Branch One was installed. He is the well-known Dane, P. Holgersen, who has been one of the most prominent members of the Scandinavian Colony.</p>
   <p>Several men from out-of-town spoke, but we will only give ex-Sheriff, C. R. Matson's speech, which is as follows:</p>
   <p>"The subject assigned to me is so great that a few points of interest can only be dealt with in the short time allotted to me in this program.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0181.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>America! How the word fills its citizens with pride! A loyal sense of patriotism fills the breast of freemen, wherever they may be. This great America, which we can call ours, with its most wonderful material developments, with its grand and noble institutions, and with a government which the immortal Lincoln described as being "of the people, by the people, and for the people" and where every man is a peer, this land has become the Mecca toward which the eyes of the oppressed and downtrodden from all nations, turn.</p>
   <p>We, as Scandinavian-Americans, call it ours. And why should we not? To be sure, we are engaged with other citizens in arranging for the World's Columbian Exposition to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of this continent by Christopher Columbus. But, still the fact remains that the hardy Norseman, Leif Ericson, was at least four hundred years in advance of Columbus. So, who will dispute our right to call it our country? Scholars and historians have long since admitted the fact.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0182.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I said that we call it ours, and Scandinavia has furnished her full share of those who are glad to become citizens by adopting such a glorious country. It is a matter of very great satisfaction to know that Scandinavians have the reputation of becoming the most useful and loyal citizens of all those who are of foreign birth. Patriotism and love of freedom is bred in the bones of our Scandinavian-Americans. The man who is wont to sing "Ja Vi Elsner Dette Landet" (Yes, we love the 'land that towers'), and other national songs of his mother country, can with equal fervor and patriotism sing, "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean; the home of the brave and the free," for his adopted country. The vast area of her territory, the great diversity of climate, and countless industrial institutions give an abundance of [opportunity] to all types of people. The mechanic, the artisan, and the professional man are all welcome. The tillers of the soil are offered a bounty. They are given a quarter section of land and the only thing required of them is that they become citizens and reside on the land for, at least, five years and make certain improvements. They may enjoy our free schools, full protection under our laws, as well as every privilege of a native born.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0183.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The dedication of this magnificent building tonight is evidence of the thrift and energy of our Scandinavian citizens. It is also evidence of a higher and loftier aim and principle, manifested in the love and protection of the home, of the widow and fatherless children. The good influence of an organization such as the Scandinavian Workers' Association cannot be explained in a five-minute talk. Its work for relieving the sick and distressed, and its provision for those who are dependent on them, can not fail in making better citizens of those who are engaged in this noble work.</p>
   <p>Then, let us say, America forever, and success to the Scandinavian Workers' Association.</p>
