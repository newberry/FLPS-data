   <p>P. 5. - National Forbundet (The Norwegian National League) held its annual banquet at Bjorgvins Hall on Friday, February 24th. Mr. P. W. Stuhr, vice-president of the league bid the guests welcome and presented Mr. Carl Backer as the evening's toastmaster. The speaker for the league, Mr. Berger Osland, was one of its organizers and is still one of its most active and influential members. He gave a short, concise review of the history of the league, its work, and accomplishments.</p>
   <p>The League consists of thirty-two organizations. Since 1899 it has given $15,000 to worthy causes; it has sent $400 to Norway, $3,000 to the League's employment agency. The object of the League (gathering delegations from every Norwegian organization in Chicago to carry out a co-operative program) has been successfully carried out up to the present time, and all are of the opinion that the program outlined for the future will be backed by member societies one hundred per cent.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers of the evening were Olof Bernts, Norwegian Consul; A. Howard, Dr. Warloe, Mr. Sonsteby, Emil Bjorn, A. Abrahansen, and Mr. Svendson <pb facs="5423969_4_1640.jpg" n="2"/>, of the Ski Club. An hour's Svingom (dancing) followed the session of the league, a pleasant ending to a thoroughly pleasant evening.</p>
