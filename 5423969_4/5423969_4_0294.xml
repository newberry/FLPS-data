<title level="a">STENSLAND BANK SCANDAL</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The famous Stensland Bank scandal has been an object of great interest during the past week owing to the arrest in Tangiers, Morocco, of Paul O. Stensland, the refugee, by Harry Olson, Chicago Assistant State's Attorney, and Mr. Keeley, representative of the Tribune.</p>
   <p>The main subject of discussion for a week has been "Who tipped the Tribune off as to Stensland's whereabouts?"</p>
   <p>Theodore Stensland, the son, is pointed out by some papers as a traitor to his father; other papers name Attorney Jacob J. Kern while still others name Mrs. Theodore Stensland. These suspects firmly deny the charge while the younger Stensland is busy defending his father and swears that he had no idea where his father was.</p>
   <p>New discoveries about the details of the bank failure have been brought to light resulting in a change from day to day in the number of excited victims coming to the bank.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0295.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To date it has been impossible to determine which notes, mortgages, etc., are of value, or are worthless. The moral degradation of Stensland has been verified a number of times by bank transactions; an outstanding incident was the money he spent on a lady baker in Irving Park; finally, to seal her tongue he gave her a check for $1,400. This transaction was explained by Gustaf Gullickson, who was Stensland's first bookkeeper. The woman in question was the wife of Felipe Votova. Two or three nights each week, Stensland had appointments with this unfaithful wife in her home, while the husband was sweating in the bakery shop.</p>
   <p>Depositors of the crashed bank are becoming nervous over hearing how many notes and other documents cannot be judged as to whether they are good or good for nothing. There seems to be a feeling prevailing that many who actually signed various papers are denying it now, in order to avoid paying the amount shown.</p>
   <p>The Grand Jury has formulated charges against a number of former officers and employees of the bank. Among these we note twenty charges against Paul O. <pb facs="5423969_4_0296.jpg" n="3"/>Stensland, and Henry W. Hering, former cashier, for forgeries and one charge of faking securities for $1,003,000; two charges against Hering for perjury; many other charges against directors and employees of the bank. Theodore Stensland was considered entirely innocent, a fact which the directors strongly resented.</p>
   <p>A telegram to Washington announces that Harry Olson and James Keeley, with Paul O. Stensland as prisoner, sailed from Tangiers on board the Hamburg-American line's "Prince Adelbert" on Thursday, September 13 and expect to reach New York on Saturday.</p>
   <p>Stensland has made three attempts to commit suicide since his arrest and his captors are especially vigilant in order to prevent any suicide attempts while they are en route to Chicago and the trial.</p>
