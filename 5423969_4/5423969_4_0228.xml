   <p>The Norwegian National League met on Monday at Kedzie Hall to discuss the advisability of continuing the employment office. The manager's report showed a deficit of $40.29 for July, and $85.75 for August. Several members advocated a change of policy in order to make the agency self-supporting, if not profitable, while others intimated that if it were to be run like the public agencies, it would defeat its purpose, i. e., to help immigrants get started.</p>
   <p>The finance committee reported that the banquet given in honor of Minister Grevstad required no financial aid from the League. A vote of thanks was given to the Bjorgvin, Nordmendenes, and Glee Club choruses for their assistance in the banquet program and at the festival at Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>The question of financing the project of sending children to summer camps will be taken up at the next meeting, and the suggestion by several members <pb facs="5423969_4_0229.jpg" n="2"/>that the League establish a camp of its own will also be considered. Scandia is strongly in favor of such a camp, and we see no reason why this suggestion should not be carried through with success.</p>
