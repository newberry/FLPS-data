   <p>Last Thursday evening the Norwegian Women's Federation held a patriotic rally in the auditorium of the Chicago Norwegian Club. The hall was crowded and many were unable to get in.</p>
   <p>The president, Dr. Helga Ruud, opened the meeting. She gave a resumee of the activities of the federation, which although less than two years old already publishes its own magazine, The Bulletin, the fourth number of which has been issued. The magazine is being sent free of charge to every member of the federation.</p>
   <p>A building committee has done excellent work towards buying, or building, a club house, which is highly needed by the federation. There is the Red Cross division which is growing larger every day, and the work accomplished by this division is praised everywhere. Such are the results of work started less than year and a half ago. The members go to it with energy and they are <pb facs="5423969_4_1571.jpg" n="2"/>ready to sacrifice themselves. Of course, interests vary, but there are two strong ties which bind the members together - their love for the old homeland and their love for the new.</p>
   <p>After a period of oratory and singing, the service flag of the federation was brought forth by boy scouts. There are ninety-five service stars in the flag.</p>
   <p>The federation's rally will long be remembered.</p>
