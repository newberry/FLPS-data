   <p>I agree with the writer of "Another Plea for English" that every American citizen, or anyone who intends to become such, should be able to master the language of the country he or she Lives in. It is only a duty of patriotism. But there is always more than one side to a question. What are we going to do with our old folks? We have them yet in our midst; they still cling to their old habits and the old mother tongue nature taught them. We are their children and as such we owe them our respect.</p>
   <p>I am personally acquainted with a number of Scandinavian families who use the English language in their homes entirely. Grandfather and grandmother are thereby debarred from all conversation with their grandchildren, who are their only delight in their old age. I do believe that any intelligent child, even if he has been taught the mother language, can be educated and taught the English language so as to inspire him, and enable him to read the beautiful works of our great authors and also to become a good, patriotic citizen of our great republic.</p>
