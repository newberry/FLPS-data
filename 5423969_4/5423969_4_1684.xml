   <p>The president Mr. Abrahamsen reported fully, covering these questions.</p>
   <p>At the regular meeting the 2nd day of April, 1907 a resolution was carried, authorizing the Norwegian National League to send a delegation to Norway to represent the "League" at the crowning of the king at Jrondhjem.</p>
   <p>The delegation was chosen at an extraordinary meeting taking place the 16th of April.</p>
   <p>At a meeting April 2, upon the recommendation of the officers a committee of five members were chosen to take under consideration the establishment of an employment office. The committee recommended the establishment of an employment office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_1686.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A new committee was choosen to make new laws and rules for the office. The recommendations of this committee was approved at an extra ordinary meeting.</p>
   <p>At this meeting were chosen the first Norwegian officers for Chicago's Norwegian Employment Office, consisting of Messrs. C. J. Backer, D. Ricter, Lars J. Siljan and H. J. Belvewz. The president of the association acted as an officer according to the laws of the society. In accordance with the officer's report the office was opened September 15. Up to November 30, there were 411 requests for employment.</p>
   <p>This far 158 were employed. According to the report several of Chicago's largest business concerns employed people from this office. The office expenses were $300.29 from the time the office was established up to the later part of November.</p>

   <p>At the same time $25.00 to $50.00 was collected from applicants, that received employment. The net cost had been $274.79.</p>
   <p>The officers of the national association recommended that a license should be procured in order to simplify the collection of fees from people who received employment.</p>
