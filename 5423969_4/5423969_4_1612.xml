   <p>The Norwegian National League, of Chicago, met in Kedzie Hall, Monday, Nov. 18. A communication protesting the use of Brand's Park for the May 17 festivities was read, but ignored because of its tone. The letter was written by some crank who stated that the greatest income of the festivities came from the sale of liquors in the park, and he demanded a change to a "dry spot."</p>
   <p>Plans were made for a big meeting to be held, Dec. 2, in the interests of the campaign for funds for the 1914 memorial gift to Norway. Fifty dollars was appropriated for Christmas presents for the children at the Edison Park Orphanage, and $25 for Bethesda, the old people's home.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. R. Zimmerman reported that the Norwegian section of the Public <pb facs="5423969_4_1613.jpg" n="2"/>Library is in a deplorable condition; no new books have been bought for a long time, and books now in the library are falling apart. A committee was appointed to investigate the matter and make recommendations to correct these conditions. The manager of the league's employment office reported September placements of 44 men and 47 women, out of 108 men and 70 women applicants. The October report read: applicants--men, 125; women, 115; placements-49 men, and 65 women. Under present conditions this is a very good record for an office dealing only with members of one of Chicago's national groups.</p>
