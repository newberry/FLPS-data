   <p>The Trinity Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held a pleasant meeting last Monday evening at the home of Mrs. H. Johnson...Membership fees amounting to $10.50 were paid. Mr. Meonard Undem was received as a new member. The candidates for the board of directors, nominated at the previous meeting, resigned in order that a new election could be held. The hope was expressed that Mr. A. Petersen would accept re-election to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The resignation of nominees was accepted and a new election was held with the result that Mr. A. Petersen was elected for three years; Mr. A. K. Malum was elected for one year; Mr. C. Nelson was elected treasurer for the Trinity Branch... The suggested new building for the Home was discussed; it is to be further studied at the Home Society's annual meeting next Friday in the Trinity Church. All the <pb facs="5423969_4_0083.jpg" n="2"/>members of the Branch were urged to be present at this meeting to take part in the decision and thus shoulder a part of the responsibility for this undertaking so important to the Home....</p>
