   <p>Is the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America the looser on account of the language?</p>
   <p>Yes, many think so. We use too much Norwegian and not enough English, hence we lose our countrymen.</p>
   <p>No doubt many leave the church for the latter reason, but there are a hundred others of less importance for which the American born will leave our church.</p>
   <p>Whenever someone leaves a church there are always those, who with that as an excuse will stir heaven and earth to abolish the Norwegian language from the church all together.</p>
   <p>Among the many factors and causes for our church's recession can be mentioned <pb facs="5423969_4_1477.jpg" n="2"/>inter-marriage into other denomination; marriage within the same denomination but of two different nationalities, for instance; Norwegian-German etc. The church has seen the "handwriting on the wall", and is trying to remedy the situation by having both Norwegian and English sermons, this movement has met with approval and success, best judged by large attendance at both services. Much can be accomplished here by the ministers and leaders of the Young Peoples Societies, but the writer knows, that many of these have not been in possession of a balanced judicial temparement.</p>
