  <body>
   <p>....In his article in Skandinaven for December 14, Mr. L. A. Larsen says that "the Norwegian Home for the Aged, which is controlled by the Norwegian United Church, has held a fair with raffling". In this he is mistaken.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged is not controlled by the Norwegian United Church, and this Church is not responsible for the acts of our Society. The Home is maintained mostly by Norwegian church people in Chicago although several of the residents at its beautiful Home in Norwood Park have come from distant parts of the country, and the Home is conducted in harmony with the principles of the Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>Article III of the Society's constitution, under the heading "Self Government", reads as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0108.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The Society is in every respect its own highest authority; it does not permit any individual or any church organization to have control of the direction of its property or control over any of its decisions."</p>
   <p>In order to avoid misunderstanding and unnecessary correspondence, I beg to request that all the papers which have published Mr. Larsen's article kindly give space to the present correction.</p>
