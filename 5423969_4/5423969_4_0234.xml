   <p>The Norwegian National Association held its regular meeting yesterday at Sleipner Hall. President Sonsteby was not present, and for that reason the first vice-president, Mr. O. E. Wold, presided at the meeting. The meeting did not last long since no very important business was up for consideration.</p>
   <p>The banquet committee reported a deficit of fifty dollars; the visiting committee reported or recommended certain appropriations for needy people; the Seventeenth of May committee had nothing to report.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. M. Fossum resigned from the visiting committee. A request for contributions by the Chicago Relief and Aid Society was presented. Consideration was postponed until the next meeting. The Association decided also to take care of a poor Norwegian woman who at present is at the Detention Hospital. It was decided that the president and the visiting committee take care of this matter.</p>

   <p>After the delegates had accepted an invitation to be the guests of the Tabitha Hospital later in the evening, the meeting was adjourned. The occasion was the social to be held at the Hospital for Miss Savereide who is leaving the Hospital's service for a supervisory position at a hospital in the West.</p>
