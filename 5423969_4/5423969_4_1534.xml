   <p>Marquise de Fontenay writing through Skandinaven asserts that President Roosevelt has declined to recognize the claim of Norway to be an independent state. A reader wants to know whether this statement is true. It is not true, Norway has not as yet presented claims for recognition at any capitol; hence neither President Roosevelt nor any other ruler has had the opportunity of declining to recognize her claims. But there can be no doubt as to the recognition of Norway by our government in due time.</p>
   <p>The other day a proclamation was issued by the president giving force and effect to a seperate copyright treaty with Norway. Final action in this matter was taken by the Norwegian government only a few days before the dissolution of the union, while the president's proclamation was issued after the "Revolution" had been official reported to the state department by Consul General Bordewich at Christiana.</p>
