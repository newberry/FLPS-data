   <p>The Scandinavians in Chicago seem to be taking an unusual interest in the strained situation in Sweden. Tuesday evening, a well-attended mass meeting was held at Clifton Hall, Clifton and Belmont Avenues. Hundreds of people were unable to get in. After several speeches had been made, fifty-five dollars was collected for the strikers in Sweden. A telegram reading as follows was sent to the strikers: "Scandinavian workers in Chicago are sending aid."</p>
   <p>Tonight, Thursday, a mass meeting will be held at Northwest Hall, North and Western Avenues, and on Saturday there will be another meeting at Kensington Turner Hall, Kensington. A committee has been appointed, and subscription lists have been sent out. The societies that have thus far taken the lead in the work are: the Karl Marx Club, the Lake View Scandinavian Socialist <pb facs="5423969_4_0233.jpg" n="2"/>Club, the Seventeenth and Twelfth Ward Scandinavian Socialist Clubs, and the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society.</p>
   <p>Subscription lists may be obtained from John Dawn, the financial secretary of the Scandinavian Socialist Propaganda Committee, 2382 Sacramento Avenue. Contributions will also be received at the Socialists' county office, 180 Washington Street.</p>
