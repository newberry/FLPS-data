   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Club has a new club house, now, located on the West Side of Kedzie Blvd., South of Fullerton Ave., an unusual convenient and attractive location close to Logan Square. In summer the view from the club house is like the view in a park.</p>
   <p>The facade of the building has strong Norwegian aspects, dragon heads, carvings, etc. Above the entrance the shield of the club is placed. Two beautiful lanterns rise up at the foot of the front steps.</p>
   <p>Inside the house is arranged for the convenience, entertainment, and inspiration of the members and their guests.</p>
   <p>Norwegian paintings decorate the walls of the large club room. From carved beams in the ceiling, lanterns formed like dragon ships are suspended, and a large <pb facs="5423969_4_1583.jpg" n="2"/>"peis" (fire place) built in old Norse style invites comfort and rest. The "peis" is a piece of art, probably unique in America. The second story contains a library with reading room, ladies' parlor, wardrobe, locker room, and service room with 'dumb-waiter' from the kitchen in the basement.</p>
   <p>The third story contains a billiard room.</p>
   <p>The salon or room for festival gatherings is on first floor. It has its own cloak room and is directly connected with the dining room and kitchen in the basement.</p>
