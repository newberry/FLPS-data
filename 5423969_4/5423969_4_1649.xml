   <p>The Norwegian National Association met last evening at Sleipner Hall. Only about one half of the delegates were present. The rest were either on their vacations or were kept away by the heat. The delegates from some of the societies are showing but slight enthusiasm for the cause they are supposed to represent.</p>
   <p>President Sonsteby was absent, so that the first vice-president, Mr. O. C. Wold, presided. The Seventeenth of May Committee reported a surplus of slightly over $900, so that there is now more than $1,900 in the treasury of the Association.</p>
   <p>Two new societies were received into the Association, the Svithun, a club composed of people from Stavanger, Norway, and the R. H. K. Lodge Henrik Wergeland.</p>

   <p>The auditing committee reported that the books and accounts of the Association were in good order, but the committee thought that the business practices employed in the business office of the Association left something to be desired.</p>
   <p>A few requests for aid were referred to the board of directors and the visiting committee.</p>
   <p>It was decided to repeat the illustrated lecture for children at the next Seventeenth of May celebration. The committee that handled this matter before ...was requested to act for the same purpose next year.</p>
   <p>Finally, it was resolved to direct the board of directors to arrange for a suitable celebration of the Association's tenth anniversary. The board was also requested to take up the question of whether the Association will be able to do anything for the jubilee gift to Norway in 1914.</p>
