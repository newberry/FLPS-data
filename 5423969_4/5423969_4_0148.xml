   <p>The Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged held its regular monthly meeting last Monday evening at the residence of Mrs. Louise Nilsen, 768 Haddon Avenue. The meeting was very well attended.</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Board reported that conditions at the Home were good, and that the aged people there were happy and well. Dr. Hess, the treasurer reported that the income of the Branch during the past three months amounted to $54.75.</p>
   <p>Dr. and Mrs. [N. T.] Quales of the Wicker Park Branch were present at the meeting, and the Doctor reported on the recent purchase of a burial place for the old people of the Home. The burial place is large enough for about one hundred graves; it is located on high ground that is well drained, and is beautifully situated about fifteen minutes' walk from the Home. The Doctor also reminded the members of the annual picnic to be held on Saturday, August 25, at Norwood Park.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Thye reported that a midsummer festival will be held at Norwood Park for the benefit of the Home, on Saturday, June 23.....</p>
   <p>After the meeting, refreshments were served while Miss Lulu Larsen gave some attractive vocal and guitar selections. The next meeting will be held at the home of Mrs. Anna Hoeck, 565 North California Avenue, on July 9.</p>
