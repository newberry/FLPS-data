   <p>The Norwegian Old People's Home was substantially aided yesterday by the festival held at Norwood Park. Over 1,500 people were in attendence. The grounds surrounding the buildings were placed at the disposal of the pleasure seekers, the building being decorated for the occasion. A train of ten coaches made up the special on the Northwestern road which carried the excursionists from the city. During the afternoon there were a number of addresses, some of the speakers being from outside the State. There were races and other contests for the young people. The home has $6,000.00 in its treasury, which it expects to spend for improvements.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian National league will hold its annual picnic at Long Lake on Sept.1. There will be athletic exhibitions, a musical program and addresses by prominent <pb facs="5423969_4_1703.jpg" n="2"/>men, among them Senator William E. Mason, Congressman H. S. Boutell, and Thomas J. Benson. Every society and club belonging to the league is preparing to take part in the celebration. A feature of the day will be a number of young women appearing in the picturesque Norwegian peasant costume.</p>
