   <p>The annual report of the Norwegian National Association has appeared in its new printed form--a neat, attractive pamphlet of sixteen pages. This matter of printing the report was a practical step. On many occasions it is of advantage for delegates to have easy reference to past annual reports. If it becomes the rule of the Association to present the annual reports printed in uniform size and style, the history of the Association, so to speak, will write itself from year to year and will always be available in compact form.</p>
   <p>The annual report shows that the Association has done a great deal of good work during the past year. The gross income of the Association was more than seven thousand dollars, and at the end of the year the treasury held more than one thousand dollars. Considerable amounts have been donated by the Association to the Norwegian Orphanage and the Norwegian Home for the Aged. Other worthy undertakings, too, have been given support. The representatives of the Association <pb facs="5423969_4_1656.jpg" n="2"/>have, on the various occasions, acted with discernment and tact.</p>
   <p>The employment office represents and important branch of the activities of the Association. This office still is in the red because so many of those who have received assistance at times when they needed work have omitted to pay the slight fee which the office charges for its work. It is regrettable and shameful that so many Scandinavians prove unreliable. In spite of disappointments of this and other types the office has continued its work undisturbed. During the year there were 1,447 applications from men and women for positions, and positions were found for 701. When one considers the stagnation prevailing in nearly all lines of business during the past year the result must be considered most satisfactory. About 200 men were placed on farms in the country; in most cases both the farmers and their new employees were well satisfied. During the months from April to November the farmers sent more than $550 to cover the cost of tickets for the employees sent them by the employment office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_1657.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Norwegian National Association during the past year has strengthened its position with the Norwegian people. It is to be hoped that its work in the year to come may measure up to its splendid work in the past years.</p>
