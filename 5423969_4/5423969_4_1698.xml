   <p>The Norwegian National Association a few days ago sent to the Norwegian societies in Chicago the following circular, signed by the president and the corresponding secretary:</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian National Association is holding its annual conference on Monday, January 6, 1902, at Humboldt Park House, and the various societies are requested to elect new delegates and alternates unless those now in office are to remain.</p>
   <p>"At the conference the following proposals for changes in the statutes come up for consideration:</p>
   <p>"Article 6. The treasurer's bond is to be reduced from $3,000 to $1,000.</p>
   <p>"Article 10. The rule that a society must have existed one year and be incorporated in order to become a member of the National Association is to be rescinded.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_1699.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Article 17. The rule that delegates from branches of societies represented in the National Association is to be omitted.</p>
   <p>"These proposals were unanimously recommended by the last quarterly conference, and they will probably be adopted.</p>
   <p>"The board of directors of the National Association in this connection appeals to such Norwegian societies as are not now members of the National Association, to elect delegates for the coming annual conference of the Association and join us.</p>
   <p>"It is probably not necessary to call attention to the advantages to our nationality of an organization that can deal with matters of interest to our group and which is ready, when required, to act in support of Norwegian-American interests. All the other national groups have such organizations, and they have been able to some extent to bring about undertakings of great significance. During the years of existence of the Norwegian National Association it has succeeded in supporting several Norwegian institutions and undertakings; during the past year the Association carried to completion two matters that won general approval among the Norwegians, both of which were successful.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_1700.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"The financial position of the Association is good, and one may venture the assertion that at no time was there a more decided spirit of co-operation present among the various societies than at present.</p>
   <p>"During the winter the National Association will provide a series of free lectures, on Sunday afternoons .... for which free use of the auditorium at the Von Humboldt School, Hirsch Street, has been granted us.</p>
   <p>"The individual societies, in joining the Association, will at least gain the advantage of a closer and better relationship with the other Norwegian organizations; this is ever one of the results of belonging to the same society and working for common interests."</p>
