   <p>The new clubhouse of the Chicago Norwegian Club was officially opened July 4. About 250 people were present, not only at the official dedication services, but at the banquet following.</p>
   <p>The architecture of the new building is of a style that is seldom seen anywhere. We can hardly name the style of architecture; it is entirely new. Inside and out, we find carved dragon heads. In the large clubroom we at first think that the ceiling is one great big tapestry, but looking closely we see that it is one great big painting. The six large chandeliers in the main hall are moulded in "dragon style". And the walls are difficult to describe. We see a panorama of the Saeter country, with its peasants and buildings such as are seen only in Saeter Dalen, in Norway, This hall is on the top floor. On the first floor there is a well-equipped theater, with a quite large balcony above the lower end of the auditorium. In the basement are two kitchens, pantry, refrigerator, and a large dining room. Up in the so-called attic there is-called attic there is a billiard room, library, <pb facs="5423969_4_1585.jpg" n="2"/>and card rooms.</p>
   <p>This new clubhouse will, some day, be one of the sights or Chicago.</p>
