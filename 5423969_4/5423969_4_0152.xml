   <p>The latest meeting of Concordia Branch of the Society for Norwegian Home for Aged was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Christian Pedersen, 206 West Ohio Street. At the behest of Mr. Duncan, the president of the branch, Mr. A. Melum functioned as chairman.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened with singing and a prayer by the Reverend J. Z. Torgersen. After the report of the secretary had been read and accepted, Mr. Melum called the attention of the members to the necessity of being present at all the regular quarterly meetings of the Society. Mrs. C. Pedersen, who is a member of the Ladies Aid Society, informed the meeting that the net income from the festival at Wicker Park Hall had been very satisfactory, and reminded everyone that it was necessary to start the preparations soon for the annual picnic to be held in Norwood Park sometime during the month of August.</p>
