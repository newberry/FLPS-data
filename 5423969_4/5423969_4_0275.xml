   <p>It is high time that the Chicago Police began closing the brothels which are flourishing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Several thousand of these "schools of vice" are now spread throughout Chicago. The prices, for the entertainment rendered, is from fifty cents to three dollars. The fifty-cent brothels are the worst offenders in causing diseases; the higher priced ones in kidnapping young girls.</p>
   <p>Recently, many girls, some as young as fourteen, have been in these brothels.</p>
   <p>In every case, the girls found that they were either diseased or disabled for life, because of several illegal operations. One child, thirteen years of age, had [been subjected to] two abortions and was suffering from venereal diseases. Most of the girls were there against their will, a few--a very few--because they liked [this kind of] life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0276.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We, as citizens, should demand that the city clean out those places. Although there are comparatively few Scandinavian girls found in these places, we do insist that the voters of this city demand that the mayor take some action.</p>
