   <p>The Norwegian Women's Federation held its regular meeting Friday evening at the Parish House, Humboldt Park. The social department was in charge of the affair. The meeting was open to the general public, and there was a large audience.</p>
   <p>The first topic was The Juvenile Court. Mrs. Bertha Petersen gave an exposition of investigations made by the Law and Order League concerning the matter.</p>
   <p>The Juvenile Court was created seventeen years ago to help the minors who have drifted into the shady side of life and have come in conflict with the law. The intention had been that this court should help the children to better conditions, but the activities of the court have not been along lines desired, according to the speaker. During the years The Juvenile Court has grown into a large institution, employing several <pb facs="5423969_4_1575.jpg" n="2"/>hundred people whose task it is to trace cases coming under the jurisdiction of the court. These assistants do not always possess the insight and tact one has the right to expect. It does not require much to separate children from their parents in the homes of the poor. The speaker cited several cases of arrogance on the part of the court and contended that it was unconstitutional.</p>
   <p>The whole lecture was an expression of true humanitarianism and defense of the home. However poor, the home is after all a home, although an unsatisfactory substitute, yet nothing better has been found.</p>
