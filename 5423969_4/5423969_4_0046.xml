   <p>The Bethlehem Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held its regular monthly meeting last evening at the home of Mr. and Mrs. M. Tollefsen, 172 North Humboldt Street. The meeting opened with the singing of a hymn, and reading from the Scriptures by the president of the Branch, Mr. John Thompsen.</p>
   <p>The secretary's report of the previous meeting was read and accepted. Several new members were inducted. [Translator's note: Names of new members omitted in translation.] The monthly membership fee was paid.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Conrad De Lange invited the Branch to hold its next meeting at her home, 1028 Augusta Street. The invitation was gratefully accepted. An informal discussion ensued concerning the interests of the Home and the Society, after which the official part of the meeting was concluded.</p>

   <p>The business meeting was followed by a social hour...</p>
   <p>The meeting was well attended. The reports were encouraging, and the social following the business meeting occasioned true enjoyment.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This same issue publishes a very similar account of a meeting of the Trinity Branch.]</p>
