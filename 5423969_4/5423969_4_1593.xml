   <p>The Norwegian National League held its regular meeting at Kedzie Hall last night, Lasse Grundeland presiding. A letter was read from Harry Ludvigsen thanking the League for the assistance which enabled him to make a trip to Norway. A letter was read from the Roald Amundsen Lodge requesting Monetary assistance for the purchase of a gramophone to be sent to Amundsen and his men at the Pole. [Translator's note: This will make the third talking machine sent by Norwegian organizations.]</p>
   <p>The executive board of the employment office reported that during September applications were received from 150 men and 100 women, of whom 37 men and 50 women had been "placed" in the city, and 19 men and 3 women in the country. The income of the employment office for September was $102, and the expenses were $138.52. For October the figures were: income, $132; and expenses, $146.56.</p>
   <p>Two new lodges were admitted to the League: The Henrik Ibsen Lodge, I. O. G. T. <pb facs="5423969_4_1594.jpg" n="2"/>[Good Templars], with forty-four members, and the Narrona Lodge, I. O. G. T., with eighty members.</p>
   <p>On the recommendation of the chairman, a committee was assigned to prepare an illustrated historical paper to be sent to the anniversary exhibition in Christiania in 1914.</p>
