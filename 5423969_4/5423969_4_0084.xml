   <p>The Concordia Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held its first monthly meeting of the year last Thursday evening at the home of Mr. L. Crook, Oak Park. Since the weatherman had made the cold weather somewhat milder for the occasion, a large number of people dared the distance to the "Far West" and the meeting was very well attended. After the opening worship the board of directors presented its reports about the Home. Matters are moving as smoothly and quietly at the Home as anyone could wish....The residents of the Home stated that the past Christmas was the best they had ever experienced....No wonder, then, that the board of directors is considering the erection of a large new building in order to extend the good work which is being done. The Society hopes that it will be able to house more than twice as many aged Scandinavians as at present. According to a statement by Director Melum, this matter of a new building will be taken up for consideration at the annual meeting to be held in the <pb facs="5423969_4_0085.jpg" n="2"/>Trinity Church next Friday.</p>
   <p>The treasurer and the secretary presented their reports which were adopted. Reverend and Mrs. Haugan were received as members of the Branch. Election of officers was then undertaken, and since it proved impossible to persuade the retiring president, Mrs. Anton A. Melum, to become a candidate for re-election, Mrs. L. Crook was elected in her place, and Mrs. H. Hogans became vice-president. The secretary who had served for the past year was re-elected without opposition. Miss Alma Dahl was elected assistant financial secretary; Mrs. Mamie Marshment having been re-elected as financial secretary. Mr. B.J. Johnson had been treasurer for twelve years. It was generally agreed that it simply would not do to have a new treasurer start the thirteenth year, so Mr. Johnson was compelled by unanimous opinion to accept the office of treasurer for one more year. Membership fees, amounting to $26.25, were collected at the meeting.</p>

   <p>By this time, however, the members had become tired of business transactions and the hostess responded to the change by bringing in refreshments. In the meantime Miss Hannah Johnson had been prevailed upon to take her place at the piano, and for quite a period she entertained the people with her beautiful singing and music, and there was considerable clamor to get the young lady appointed permanent musician for the Branch, an honor which she declined.</p>
   <p>The treasurer spoke of the deep debt of gratitude owed by the Branch to the retiring president for her long and able service in the interest of the work.</p>
