   <p>Concordia Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held its regular monthly meeting last Thursday evening at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ander, Cedar Street, Austin. Many of the members were present; it was evident that the inauguration of President Taft had not kept the people away....Everything went according to schedule.</p>
   <p>The meeting opened with prayer and the singing of a hymn. Reports were read and duly accepted, after which Anton A. Mellum lifted the veil from the discussion of the board of directors. The members of the Branch learned through him that the board of directors has accepted the plans of the architect for the new building so that now it is known how the big new building, which is to take the place of the old as a home for the aged, will look. It is also known what the cost of the new undertaking will be. Mr. Mellum also informed the Branch that it has been decided to hold a spring festival at Wicker Park <pb facs="5423969_4_0058.jpg" n="2"/>Lutheran Church on April 21. An annual report is being prepared and a committee is now soliciting advertisements for the report. $22.50 was paid in membership fees. A tasty luncheon was served.</p>
   <p>Mrs. John Peterson, Miss Clara Peterson, and Mrs. Haugan gave some beautiful song numbers which were warmly applauded; Mrs. Johnson recited some touching and some comical pieces in a masterly manner.</p>
   <p>The Branch was invited to hold its next meeting at the First Emanuel Methodist Church at Logan Square, and the invitation was gratefully accepted. Two new members....were received into the Branch....</p>
