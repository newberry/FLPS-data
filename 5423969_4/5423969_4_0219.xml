   <p>The Norwegian National League called a special meeting as soon as the report of the Eastland disaster was received. It immediately set up an emergency committee to collect funds to help the Scandinavian survivors. Up to this time seventy-three bodies have been identified as Scandinavians. Sixty-two Scandinavians are still missing. Fifty-six Scandinavians are known to have been saved. The above figures are correct at this time. Much sorrow has been brought into Scandinavian homes by this disaster.</p>
   <p>The captain, Harry Pedersen, is a Scandinavian. Skandinaven will interview him as soon as he can be reached. Entire families were lost; children were made orphans and women were made widows. A widow, Mrs. Lembe, who lives at 2729 Kedvale Avenue, lost three daughters. An entire family of seven by the name of Sindelar was lost. The Nelson family, 548 North Rockwell Street, husband, wife, and three children were killed. A total of 1,300 are dead according to the latest report.</p>
