   <p>The Norwegian National League held its regular quarterly meeting last Monday at Schoenhofen's Hall. Mr. A. Hummeland, the president, took charge of the meeting. A letter of thanks enclosing a receipt for the money sent was received from Aalesund, Norway; the relief money had been received by Minister Hagerup of Norway.</p>
   <p>T. L. Newgard protested against the false article in Skandinaven concerning the League's last meeting. Mr. Hummeland said that he was out of order, but Mr. Newgard answered, very sharply, "You, Mr. Chairman, are too small a potato to use Dr. Marie Olsen's tactics". Mr. Newgard then moved that all moneys collected for the Aalesund relief fund should be sent directly to Norway, not through Skandinaven. This motion was not carried.</p>
   <p>Sleipner's [Sleipner Athletic Society] delegate proposed that a committee be set up by the National League. This proposal was considered and the executive <pb facs="5423969_4_1693.jpg" n="2"/>board was instructed to discuss the same and return concrete proposals at the next regular meeting. The meeting then adjourned without anything being accomplished, as usual.</p>
