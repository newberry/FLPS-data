   <p>The Norwegian Relief Association held its general meeting at the Hotel Danevirke to elect new officers. A letter of thanks was mailed to Mr. Hansen for his generosity in letting the association have his hall free of charge. The meetings will now be every first and third Monday of each month. The Norwegian Relief Association's aim, is to help all their countrymen who are in need because of illness or unemployment.</p>
   <p>In the seven to eight years we have been in existence we have given out over $7,000. to poor country men. We owe a sum of $1,000.00 on a first mortgage. The last few years have been rather hard; it seems the public dosen't feel like donating to our society; it seems they do not like our ways, they think we are misusing money. We are sure that there are many good well-to-do Norwegians who will be glad to give us a helping hand. So as to keep our society going, every good Norwegian can subscribe by paying $3.00 to our treasurer and become a member for a year.</p>
