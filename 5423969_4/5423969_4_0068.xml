   <p>The Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held its annual meeting last Friday.....The minutes of the previous meeting were read and accepted, and the president, Dr. N. T. Quales, presented the following annual report:</p>
   <p>....Thirteen years have elapsed since we started the home for aged men and women in Norwood Park. The undertaking has made constant demands on our time and energy; a continuous struggle it has been; no end to work and care and worry, but there has also been much to create joy and satisfaction at the successful development of the undertaking.</p>
   <p>The affairs of the Society are in every way in splendid condition. There is peace and co-operation throughout; there has been steady progress.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0069.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The expenses connected with maintaining the Home have increased materially; prices have increased in practically all lines, and we have found it necessary to raise the wages of our workers. Owing to excellent leadership and system in the Home we are able to get along with the same number of helpers at the Home with fifty-four residents as were needed when the number of residents was thirty. We have only three maids, one to do the cooking and have charge of the kitchen, and two to do the ordinary house work.</p>
   <p>We have four milk cows that keep the Home well supplied with the very best kind of milk, and we have a large number of chickens that laid more than 17,000 eggs during the past year. All of these eggs were used in the Home. It will be understood from this that the food at the Home for the Aged is not bad. During the year we have supplied the whole building with storm windows. This will make the rooms warmer and hence more comfortable for the aged.</p>
   <p>In a home for aged people one expects to find weakness and illness. Old age <pb facs="5423969_4_0070.jpg" n="3"/>does not come alone, they say, and we have found the saying to be true. When we reported the state of health at the Home to be comparatively good, it merely means that on the whole we have had no particular disease, only such as are the companions of old age...Three of the residents have been confined to their beds, one for eighteen months, one for twelve months, and the third for a shorter period.</p>
   <p>Never, I believe, has there been better order and better behavior at the Home than at present. All of those connected with the Home seem to be satisfied and well pleased.</p>
   <p>Six of the residents died in the course of the year...Seven new residents have been received since our last annual meeting...</p>
   <p>When the Society for a Home for the Aged was organized in 1896, our first task was to find a suitable home and have it altered and furnished to suit its <pb facs="5423969_4_0071.jpg" n="4"/>new purpose. As is known we found a property in Norwood Park that seemed to meet most of the requirements. There were about five acres of land laid out as a park, and there was a house of twenty-six rooms. The house had been built to be used as a hotel. The rooms were large with high ceilings. The stairs were high and steep. Several alterations and improvements were required in the building to meet the requirements of a home for aged people. The high, steep stairs could not well be changed, however; especially difficult were the stairs to the top floor. The board of directors always felt concern about using the top floor for the purpose of living quarters for the aged people. The number of applications has been great, however, and most of them of a kind that we could not well refuse. So the board has placed the youngest and most agile on the top floor, then as they grew older they were moved to the lower floors. For a long time the board of directors has been hoping that the day would come soon when this upper story of the Home need no longer be utilized for living quarters for the aged ones. For this reason, but still more in order to meet the need of the many new applicants, the board of directors has decided--after careful <pb facs="5423969_4_0072.jpg" n="5"/>consideration of the various phases of the matter--to place before the Society plans for the erection of a large building on the grounds of the Home in Norwood Park, the construction of which is to be started as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The plan which the board of directors has considered, based on a sketch by Architect Theslow, presents a three-story building of brick, 134 feet long and 36 feet wide, with halls eight feet wide along the middle of each story. The rooms are to be nine and one half by twelve feet, arranged on each side of the hall. In the basement will be located the kitchen, the dining room, etc. The building is to be simple, solid, and comfortable with practically no ornaments. The ground floor will hold the office, the matron's apartment, hospital rooms, etc., in addition to rooms for residents. Between the old building and the new there is to be a passageway walled and roofed. The heating plant, boiler, coalbin, etc., will be located in a separate building....</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_0073.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>A building as here indicated will cost much money, and this has not been forgotten by the board of directors. There are considerable amounts at our disposal, however, and the board believes that as in the past, so in the present task the members will stand by and come to the aid of the Home..... Prospects are bright in so far as the matter of getting the building erected and paid for is concerned. There need be no fear as to the question of getting the rooms occupied. The difficulty will lie in the increased expenses connected with such a large institution. Anxiety, doubt, and fear have hovered about us from the time we started the Home , but up to the present things have gone well. We are hoping that blessings will accompany our undertaking in the future as in the past.</p>
