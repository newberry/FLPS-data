   <p>The Norwegian National League is a central delegated organization formed by Norwegian societies, clubs and lodges of Chicago; it is their joint-organ in matters of common interest. It is composed of two delegates elected respectively for one or two years from such Norwegian societies in Chicago as desire representation twenty-five organizations, the principal Norwegian societies of the city, are now affiliated. The league is strictly non-sectarian and non-political. The main thought in founding it was the establishment of a central organization representative of the Norwegians of Chicago, which would be prepared and equipped to take the initative and to undertake the management of joint action on the part of the Norwegians of Chicago. The aim is to make the league as representative of our people as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_4_1506.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It has also been the policy of the league to secure the co-operation of such of our Norwegian citizens as are not represented by the various Norwegian organizations, by including on its committees for special national undertakings representative Norwegian-Americans not directly affiliated with the league. The league was formed on June 26, 1899. In that year delegates from twenty-three Norwegian societies met in response to a call issued by a number of representative men among whom were Dr. Karl F. M. Sandberg, Birger Osland, D. Johansen, Julius and Ferdinand Nelson. The desiribility and necessity for a central organization had long been recognized. It was felt that many occasions would arise as they had arisen in the past calling for joint action by all Norwegians in Chicago. The organization was completed at a meeting held Aug. 7, 1899 at which the following officers were elected: President, Dr. K.F.M. Sandberg; 1st vice-president, D. Johansen; 2nd vice-president, Mrs. M. Mansen; 3rd vice-president <pb facs="5423969_4_1507.jpg" n="3"/>Julius Jaeger; corresponding secretary, Ferdinand Nelson; recording secretary, Birger Osland: treasurer, C. H. Lee. The league was incorporated under the laws of Illinois on Sept. 14, 1899. Within a few months after its organization proof was strickingly afforded of the utility of the organization. In the fall of 1899, in a fearful storm 173 Norwegian fishermen lost their lives at Rover, Norway, bringing distress and want into as many homes. The situation of the widows and orphans called for immediate relief from kinsmen on both sides of the sea. The league was found equipped and ready to take care of the matter as far as Chicago Norwegians were concerned. At a meeting of the league on December 3rd, 1899 it was decided to render aid and a committee was appointed to arrange a benefit entertainment and concert at the Auditorium, which was held on December 20th, with the result that the new proceeds thereof amounting to $1,100 were sent to the proper local authorities in Norway for distribution. On many <pb facs="5423969_4_1508.jpg" n="4"/>other occasions the league had rendered its financial assistance to alleviate distress as well as in aid of Norwegian charitable institutions. Among its contributions may be mentioned: to the Norwegian Tabitha Hospital in Chicago, proceeds of a bazzar under the auspices of the league, $2,300; to the famine sufferers in Norway, Finland and Sweden, proceeds of a notable auditorium concert, etc, $2,700; to the Norwegian Children's Home in Chicago, $450.00; to the fire sufferers at Alesund, $550.00; to the Leif Ericson's monument in Chicago, $250, all the patriotic celebrations under the auspices of the league have become annual events among the Norwegians of Chicago. The attendance has reached 10,000, and United States senators and governors of the state have been speakers on these occasions. The crisis in 1905 in Norway found the league fully prepared to do whatever would seem necessary and advisible in aid of the cause. A great mass-meeting was arranged at the Auditorium in Chicago by the league within ten days in which the Norwegians pledged their support to the Father Land.</p>
