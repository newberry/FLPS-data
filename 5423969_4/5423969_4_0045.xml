   <p>The Wicker Park Branch of the Norwegian Home for the Aged held a meeting last Wednesday evening at the home of Mrs. H. L. Anderson, 98 Fowler Street. All the members of the board of directors were present together with several members of the Ladies' Aid Society. The purpose of the meeting was to make arrangements for the fourteenth annual picnic of the Society. This picnic will be held on Saturday, August 28, at the Home for the Aged, in Norwood Park.</p>
   <p>The new brick addition to the Home will probably cost about $45,000.</p>
   <p>The Branch meeting was very well attended. Four new members were admitted.... Twenty-seven dollars in membership fees was collected. After the meeting the hostess served coffee, cake, etc. The next meeting is to be held at the home of Mrs. H. G. Holton, 706 North Maplewood Avenue.</p>
