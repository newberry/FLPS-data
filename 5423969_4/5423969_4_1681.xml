   <p>The popular society opened the season with a successful social last Friday. As guests of honor were invited opera singer Rolf Hammer and painist Ludwig Haugan. At the last moment Mr. Haugan was prevented from coming. Mr. Hammer rendered several numbers which were received with vigorous applause and enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The president, Guttorm Viker, thanked Mr. Hammer, not merely for the songs of the evening, but for the great and valuable work he is doing by his song, creating longing for the old home, directing many a thought to Norway.</p>
