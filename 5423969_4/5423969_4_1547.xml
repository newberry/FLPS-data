   <p>As far as we can foresee it, the result of the presidential election is determined. Everything points to the re-election of President McKinley by an overwhelming majority. This fact, however, must not induce anybody to indifference. It is the duty of everybody to vote, and nobody can defend omitting this duty even though he may think his vote unnecessary. For one thing, he might be mistaken. Skandinaven does not place any confidence in those election forecasts which predict that Mr. McKinley will receive 802 electoral votes.</p>
   <p>The re-election of the President is merely a part of the victory which must be won, however, if the welfare of the country is to be assured. The laws of our country are decided upon in Congress, and if the Democrats gain the majority there, they will be able to tie the President's hands and do mischief in many ways. If they were to get a large enough majority in both the houses of Congress, they could carry through Mr. Bryan's program over the opposition of the <pb facs="5423969_4_1548.jpg" n="2"/>President. They would be able to legalize free trade, free silver, compel the President to use silver instead of gold when making payments; compel him to lower our flag in the Philippines, etc.</p>
   <p>The Democrats will not get a large enough majority at the coming election to carry through all the objectives mentioned above. But if they gain a majority at all, however small, they will be able to put into effect a part of their program.</p>
   <p>The result of the congressional elections will be of special significance in its influence on peace in the philippines. The Filipinos know that the Democrats will lower our flag in the Island, and during the past few weeks the insurgents have shown special activity in order to support Bryan's cause. All reliable authorities agree that Bryan's defeat will mean the downfall of the insurrection. The Filipinos will understand that insurrection and defiance are not the road to liberty, to peace, and to happiness for them. If, however, the Democrats were to win at the congressional election, there are enough demagogues <pb facs="5423969_4_1549.jpg" n="3"/>in this country...who will begin to explain to the Filipinos that the Democrats were the real victors at the election, and that, consequently, the Filipino insurrection ought to be kept alive. In order to prevent such developments it is necessary that the Republicans win decisively all along the line.</p>
   <p>The important matter in this connection is the election of congressmen and of members of the legislatures. In the House of Representatives the Republicans have but a few votes' majority, which might easily be lost. In the Senate they can still less afford to lose any votes.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians are strong enough to secure the Republican majority in both the houses of Congress if they stick together and use their power.</p>
