   <p>The notion of uniting individual units into a central bureau for co-operation has been stirring in the minds of Polish printers since long ago. Heretofore, this notion has appeared spasmodically but the chief drawback has been the lack of Gutenberg enthusiasts. Now, with the increase of Polish printing shops in Chicago there is also an increase of workers in this field. These have felt the need of solidarity, lest in the future as in the past they grope along in the dark, and have determined to have a central office where the unemployed could obtain information.</p>
   <p>This move, if generally approved, will be of service to the owners of printing houses as well as to the printers. Until now, when a shop wanted help, there was no means of getting any information in this regard. On the other hand, compositors in search of employment were obliged to inquire <pb facs="5423968_7_0867.jpg" n="2"/>from one shop to another. From now on, the secretary of the Polish Printers' Association in Chicago, will keep a list of the unemployed and, should a vacancy arise, he will inform them of the address involved. The fee is not stipulated, this being left entirely to the good will of the members, so as not to curtail the rights of the printing shop owners.</p>
   <p>The purpose of mentioning this is to correct the news spread by some newspapers outside Chicago that a printers' union was organized here. From a broader point of view, a union is the same as an association; but in America, only those associations are termed unions that adhere to a certain wage scale. The newly-organized association of Polish printers has no such purpose. Polish printing in the United States is as yet at such a low level that copying the standard of Americans or Germans would be a pipe dream.</p>
   <p>The wish of the organizers was to provide for the peaceful settlement of disputes with the shop owners, and also to provide moderate payment for <pb facs="5423968_7_0868.jpg" n="3"/>their colleagues, in the event of illness. This aim was theoretically adopted in the constitution. In order to confirm it by action, the good will of printing house owners in search of help, is indispensable. They should apply to the association's secretary, Mr. H. Maychrzycki. Likewise the support of the printers is important; they should support this association which eventually may be of help to them.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, only Chicago printers may register now. They do not lose their association rights in the event of leaving town. This, however, does not prevent printers and owners in other towns from making use of this information department. Quite to the contrary, a wider sharing of this institution can bestow mutual benefits, and widen its usefulness.</p>
   <p>Additional features of the program proposed for the association are lectures, amateur performances, education, as well as an energetic participation in the national activities of Polish emigrants.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0869.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>What fruit the above proposals will yield, time will tell. Not anticipating any particular event, we may call the organizing of this association a step forward.</p>
