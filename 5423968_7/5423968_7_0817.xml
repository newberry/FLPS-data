   <p>Proclamation to Polish societies on the Northwest side of our city.</p>
   <p>Fellow countrymen: - A few months ago on the initiative of the P. N. A. Ladies Societies in America, the idea of building a Polish hall on the Northwest Side of Chicago which will serve as a meeting place for all the societies in and around Chicago was considered.</p>
   <p>This Polish hall would be the life of all Polish societies in Chicago, it would be the means of uniting all Polish interests, for promoting friendship among the Poles and for the betterment of living conditions and sanitation.</p>
   <p>This Polish hall will serve as a real home for all societies, circles, clubs and group organizations. At the present time these different clubs and groups have to rent halls for their dances and dinners from people of <pb facs="5423968_7_0818.jpg" n="2"/>different nationalities; many times the hall is not suitable or the rent is too high, but having no hall of their own they have to be satisfied.</p>
   <p>This Polish home should have a large hall for mass meetings, conventions, balls, celebrations, banquets, etc. Adjoining this hall a Polish theatre should be built where Polish pictures and dramas will be shown, also to teach Polish youngsters patriotism, love and respect for this country and their native language.</p>
   <p>Besides this big hall a good number of smaller halls, to be used as meeting places for these different societies should be built in this same building. This would eliminate renting small halls elsewhere, very often improperly lighted and at high rental and the continuous changing of halls because of disagreements.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0819.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Polish parish halls will not have to set aside their own school affairs so that societies can have their meetings.</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact a Polish hall of this kind is very esential in Chicago and there is no reason why it had not been built already. All the groups, clubs and societies should donate money for this building; we Poles want to show the other nationalities that we can have as big and beautiful a building as they have.</p>
   <p>A substantial structure as we Poles would like to have built will cost about $100,000. A building of this kind would meet all the requirements set by these different organizations. Societies donating a hundred dollars at a time, will receive a bond redeemable after the hall is on a paying basis. Every society and organization will be permitted to send one member to represent that group at their special meetings.</p>
   <p>A committee was chosen to carry on the work of selling shares to these <pb facs="5423968_7_0820.jpg" n="4"/>different groups and organizations and informing all the Polish people of any progress, through our Polish newspapers.</p>
   <p>The committee will endeavor to avoid all expenditures if possible, so this Polish hall can be constructed. People wishing to donate $100 or more on their own name can do so, with the understanding that as soon as the hall is constructed and is on a paying basis, the people will be repaid, plus interest, no organization or individual will lose any money.</p>
   <p>Many prominent political and business men are supporting and backing this movement.</p>
   <p>The committee consists of John F. Smulski, Victor Bardonski, Frank Koralewski, Sigmund Odalski, Steve Sass, Stanley Osada, Helen Zebrowska, Dr. Marie Kaczorowska, Dr. Adam Szwajkart, Anna Korzeniewska, Lillian Kadow, Theofil Sniegoc, Stephany Chmielinska, Marion Durski.</p>
