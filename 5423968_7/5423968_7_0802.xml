   <p>The Russell Square Community Center, in the Sullivan School, has taken on renewed activity since it opened again for the New Year, after being closed for the Christmas holidays.</p>
   <p>The Community Dramatic Club gave their first program on Jan. 7th, 1930, before an audience of three hundred and seventy-five. It was a great success in every way and they are now preparing two more plays which will be staged in March.</p>
   <p>The cooking class, sponsored by the Polish Falcons and taught by Mrs. Peterson, of the People's Gas Company, has an average attendance of seventy people, the majority of whom are married women.</p>
   <p>The activities now are as follows:</p>
   <p>English class, for Polish people to learn the English language, every Tuesday and Thursday, at 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>Cooking class, every Tuesday, at 7:30 P.M</p>
