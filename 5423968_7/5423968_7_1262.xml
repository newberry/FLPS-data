   <p>The slogan of all Poles today should be: "Let us give money," not for good times, entertainments and the pleasure of individuals, but for the cause of Poland, this martyr who is at last being freed from the chains of slavery. Let us give money now, not for the erection of impressive parochial buildings, which become the property of foreign ecclesiastic degnitaries, but let us give it for the erection of the Powerful edifice, which is our free homeland.</p>
   <p>For many years before the outbreak of the European war, at various gatherings and in discussions among ourselves, we bragged about what good Poles and what loyal patriots we were, how ready we were to offer on the altar of the homeland our lives and goods, when this should be required of us. Now the time has come to prove that we are patriots not only in words, but also in <pb facs="5423968_7_1263.jpg" n="2"/>actions. We must show that we were not bragging and mutually deluding each other, but that the true Polish spirit is within us--this boundless love for the home land, of which each of us boasts--that the sacred torch of duty burns brightly in our hearts, and that we desire to add one little brick to the building of this edifice of free Poland, about which we have dreamed for so many years.</p>
   <p>From Eurpoe--from our homeland--comes the call to make contributions, because Poland is rising. Already it has autonomy; Polish battalions are being formed to settle with our eternal enemy-oppressor, the Teuton; and the powers themselves have agreed that Poland must regain its freedom if a balance of power is to be maintained in Europe. Our hearts have begun to beat faster, tears of joy have misted our eyes, pride is expanding our chests, and we feel the extraordinary strength within us which only a free man can feel.</p>
   <p>But this is not enough for us--this is too little for Poland. Poland rising</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1264.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>free today, rises amidst the ashes and ruin, the poverty, and the orphaned homes which war brings. She must rise by her own economic powers and build her government from its very foundations. Poland needs money today with which to dry the tears of the widows and orphans left by those who went to battle and never returned; to rebuild the hamlets and towns which were destroyed; to form its own strong government; to create battalions of volunteers who will defend this liberty which Poland is winning; and to do many other things. No stranger will give us the money, we shall have to give it ourselves.</p>
   <p>There are no Carnegies, Rockefellers, Astors, and other millionaires among us, who could give millions for the Polish cause; but there are twenty-five million of us Poles and if each one recognizes his duty and offers as much as he can afford millions of dollars will be found with which to rebuild Poland economically and politically. We have given our enemies the gift of our lives and our goods, now let us give freely and generously for our own <pb facs="5423968_7_1265.jpg" n="4"/>country.</p>
   <p>Each of us can afford some small sum which we ought to contribute to the national treasury, without any great loss to ourselves. Therefore let us not hang back with out generosity but give as much as we can afford. Today let everyone--priest, merchant, craftsmen, laborer, farmer, industrialist, doctor, lawyer, and editor--donate and collect for the national cause, because Poland belongs to all of us and all of us should love and support her.</p>
   <p>Let us deny ourselves some pleasure or luxury, as some of us do here and there, and drop our pennies into our joint national cashbox. We, ourselves, do not have too much here, but our brothers over there in war-torn Poland, where starvation and poverty reign, have even less. We do not have too much money but on the other hand we have liberty here, the main goal for which our countrymen in the homeland are fighting.</p>
   <p>Money is needed over there in the greatest amounts. We can collect it only <pb facs="5423968_7_1266.jpg" n="5"/>by means of asking for donations, since we do not pay Poland a regular tax. Therefore let us add penny to penny wherever we can, let us tax ourselves voluntarily as much as each can afford. Thus, we shall collect millions of dollars, which are so necessary to Poland today.</p>
   <p>Enough words have been spoken--now it is action that we need!</p>
