   <p>Christmas Eve, at midnight, Father Theophilus said a Christmas Eve Mass, called in Polish Pasterka, at which the Polish orphans sang. Many charitable people attended this service.</p>
   <p>At half past six in the morning, three more Masses were said. In the afternoon, there was a benediction with the Blessed Sacrament, after which the orphans sang Christmas carols, and some of the boys made speeches suitable for the occasion. There was no lack of small children. The little ones stood on the benches and, with clasped hands, sang holy songs to the Infant Jesus. As Zacchaeus climbed the tree in order to see our Savior Jesus Christ <pb facs="5423968_7_0775.jpg" n="2"/>so the little children climbed the benches to see little Jesus in the manger. It was a great joy to see the faithful at the reproduction of the holy manger; to see young and old offering gifts to the Divine Infant throughout the day until midnight.</p>
   <p>The visitors brought many presents, including toys and candy for the orphans. The following gifts and donations were received: The Fair [Department] Store, State Street and Adams, a large box of toys and groceries and twenty-five dollars in cash; Mikitynski's family, a roll of flannel and groceries; Mrs. Relewicz, a roll of apron muslin; Mr. Joseph Marson, 635 Noble Street, $3; Mrs. Kolodziejewski, $3; Mr. Stencel, $1 (This gentleman makes donations quite often); Mr. Boleslaus Woloszyk, $5; Mr. Michael Osuch, an assortment of groceries; Mrs. Bock, a box of cookies and a box of oranges; Mr. Valentine and Mr. Adam Piszczek, from Saint Hedwig's Parish, $6.67. The members of the Holy Cross Society made a special collection for the orphans. An anonymous person donated three dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0776.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Those who have not yet seen the manger at the Polish orphanage are invited. Remember the words of the Savior, "Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me."</p>
