   <p>We have written many times in the Dziennik Zwiazkowy about conditions prevalent in department stores. We have pointed out many times that 'knowing where our daughter is' and 'imagining where she is' are two different stories. Today we are going to show how close we were in our predictions.</p>
   <p>Miss Alice Clement, who is an outstanding Chicago policewoman, has brought charges against Stephen Saridan, who was caught making advances to the girls in the Fair Department Store. A judge fined Saridan one hundred dollars for his so-called kind-heartedness. However, this is not all.</p>
   <p>"In the waiting rooms of the department stores," said Miss Clement," I meet various street-walkers and white-slavers. These vice dealers we have known a long time. They gather here daily before noon to make plans for the day. In these rest-rooms it is possible for them to strike up conversations with <pb facs="5423968_7_1570.jpg" n="2"/>the young ladies who come to these stores unchaperoned. This is well-known to men of vice.</p>
   <p>"The salesgirls are aware of this and know what is going on. They realize that it is possible for them to make an acquaintance with these men. They benefit through these contacts. When one loses her job, she joins their ranks. While she is meeting various men, the mother thinks that she is gainfully employed, whereas she is undermining her life. At the end of the week this daughter turns in three or four dollars, as if it were earned in the store and this goes on for many weeks. This is prevalent in almost all the large department stores. These people mingle with the best and have a good appearance. Therefore, these street-walkers are hard to wipe out, for they are well-trained, well-organized, and the efforts of the police are fruitless.</p>
   <p>"Even if the efforts of the police were to be the greatest, it still would be <pb facs="5423968_7_1571.jpg" n="3"/>impossible for them to track down the guilty individuals," continued Miss Clement. "If the parents will not become aware of this, they will not be able to understand what is actually happening. For the daughter, instead of working in a department store, is running about with any man she makes an acquaintance with in the store. The money she brings home is often earned through immoral conduct and not through her sales work in the store, which she pretends she is doing."</p>
   <p>This was the revelation of Miss Alice Clement. To these disclosures we cannot add. We may say that the trial of Miss Julia Borecki and Miss Czarski, who have been picked up in a department store, has opened.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the mothers, who often do not like to believe what the papers publish, will believe what the policewoman has revealed. She understands this kind of life well because she sees it every day.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps this is not new to us," many a mother will say. "We know where our <pb facs="5423968_7_1572.jpg" n="4"/>daughters are during certain parts of the day, but we do not know where she is and what she is doing the rest of the time."</p>
