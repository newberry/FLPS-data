   <p>Compatriots! The unemployment situation has been with us for such a long time that there is not one person who is not aware of its gravity. In times of depression thousands of families are rendered destitute, for the hands that earned the bread are idle. With the sudden stoppage of funds even the bare necessities of life are beyond their reach.</p>
   <p>The recent cold wave has rendered the situation more pitiable. Our unfortunate compatriots crowd the offices of the Cook County Relief Agent, welfare associations, and goodwill committees, while others go from door to door begging for something to eat.</p>
   <p>It often happens that their walking, searching, and begging is fruitless. The commissioners of the County Relief Agent and directors of welfare institutions are of other nationalities and do not understand our predicament. Many times a poverty-stricken Pole is turned away while others who are more aggressive and <pb facs="5423968_7_1355.jpg" n="2"/>more forward, get aid, although they do not deserve it.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Poles during these critical times to prevent unworthy people from getting relief, as is prevalent at present, and to make an effort to have our destitute people who are really in need, get the necessary assistance.</p>
   <p>Realizing the necessity for such activity, a large group of Poles of the Sixteenth Ward have organized the Polish Welfare Association of the Sixteenth Ward. A committee, whose duty it will be to raise funds and give help to our Polish brethren in distress, was formed of outstanding Polish leaders. This group will make every effort to assist our poor and needy people.</p>
   <p>Such work can prove invaluable if the Welfare Association receives the necessary support from the citizens of this ward.</p>
   <p>We invite the priests of the two parishes to lend their support to our efforts. All Polish societies are cordially invited to offer their assistance in this <pb facs="5423968_7_1356.jpg" n="3"/>noble work. All businessmen are urged to offer whatever help possible.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, Sunday, January 31, a mass meeting will be held at the Polish Hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. The aims of the Welfare Association will be fully explained. All Polish citizens of the Sixteenth Ward are urged to attend the meeting and offer a helping hand to their needy compatriots.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>The Committee of the Polish Welfare Association of</p>
   <p>the Sixteenth Ward,</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, president,</p>
   <p>Victor Bardonski, vice president,</p>
   <p>F. Bieszki, treasurer,</p>
   <p>T. Gordon, secretary.</p>
