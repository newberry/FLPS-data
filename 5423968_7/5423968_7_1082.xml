   <p>As is already well known to everyone from the appeal of the Bazaar Committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee, which was published in all of the local Polish papers, the Poles of Chicago and vicinity are invited to participate in the Allied Bazaar which is being held by prominent local American citizens for the benefit of the war victims in Europe.</p>
   <p>A committee of Polish women belonging to all organizations, parishes, and clubs in and around Chicago has been organized for the purpose of creating a Polish section at this Bazaar. This committee has already divided itself into numerous subcommittees, which immediately went to work collecting either money or articles to be sold at the Bazaar.</p>
   <p>All this is not enough, however. We desire that local committees be created in each Polish parish without delay, and that subcommittees thereof should be chosen for the purpose of collecting money and articles for sale. There <pb facs="5423968_7_1083.jpg" n="2"/>are a great many Polish merchants and manufacturers in Chicago who depend largely upon Polish support for their existence and business success. Let then contribute, now that the deliverance of the people of Poland is at stake. We must go to everyone, however, and ask for contributions.</p>
   <p>Subcommittees have also been organized, to solicit advertisements for the memorial booklet that will be issued to commemorate this occasion, to approach owners of nickel-shows regarding the donation to the cause of at least one evening's receipts, to variegate the Polish section with national costumes, and so on. Here is a wide field of action for all our Polish women, young and old.</p>
   <p>It is our hope that all will co-operate in this work, without regard to personal convictions or party affiliations, for in this cause it is not ourselves who are concerned, but Poland--the preservation of millions of Polish people for the brighter days that are sure to come.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1084.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Some of the Polish pastors have already promised to hold special collections in their churches for this cause. It is our unswerving hope, our sincerest plea, that everyone will do as much. Here is a field in which all of our countrymen, regardless of age or sex, can lay upon the altar of this cause that is so holy to all of us--the rendering of aid to our motherland--evidence of their good will and their desire to perform at least some small service, either in work or by giving money.</p>
   <p>Any suggestions which may contribute to the success of the Polish section at the Allied Bazaar will be gratefully received by the Bazaar Committee.</p>
   <p>According to the General (American) Bazaar Committee, fifty per cent of the receipts in each section will be given to that nation which the section represents. The remaining fifty per cent will be pooled in the Bazaar treasury and divided among the participating nations, with the sole exception of the American nation, in proportion to their respective populations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1085.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Americans are not participating in the Bazaar for their own benefit, but for the benefit of those nations most affected by the war. Not fifty per cent, but the entire proceeds from their sections will flow into the Bazaar's general treasury for division among the other nations. If one considers that the American sections will contain the most valuable items, and that their purchasing public will be drawn from the wealthiest American circles, one can be certain that the income from this source, donated in its entirety to the general treasury, will be very large, and will add a considerable sum to the Polish relief fund.</p>
   <p>To action then, countrymen! Let us show our own people and others that we do not lack solidarity where relief to our motherland is concerned. We will thus awaken our own people to greater effort, while, at the same time, we will gain the respect of others as well as their livelier interest in the Polish cause, which today, more than ever before, stands in need of the understanding and sympathy of the entire world.</p>

   <p>For the Women's Committee:</p>
   <p>Mrs. Harriet Smulski, chairman,</p>
   <p>Miss A. E. Napieralski, secretary.</p>
