   <p>On the northwest side of Chicago in the 15th, 16th, 17th, 27th and 28th wards there are over 100,000 Polish inhabitants. These quarters until this time were in no position ever to possess a Polish hall to serve for purposes such as meetings, banquets, etc. The main reason for not achieving the possession of such a needed home was due to the lack of initiative on the part of the greater Polish organizations. At the begin in of this year the Polish Women's Alliance of America had taken this affair into consideration and addressed a plea to all Polish societies here in Chicago, which resulted in a great meeting held yesterday in the home of the Polish Women's Alliance on Ashland Avenue. The hall was completely packed with people.</p>
   <p>All of the various societies representatives spoke enthusiastically for the erection of such a Polish home, also expressing acknowledgment of the thought of the Women's Alliance for undertaking this.</p>

   <p>Some of the following societies were represented, the P. N. A., Z. R. K., P. W. A., socialists, falcons, choir and various other groups.</p>
   <p>Mr. Odalski, together with seventeen other fellow citizens, were chosen, composing a committee, who will work and map cut this project for the Poles here in Chicago.</p>
