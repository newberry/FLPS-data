  <body>
   <p>The Polish Welfare Association will convene every Monday in order to make its services easily available and expedite its plans, according to a proposal adopted at a meeting held last night. The Welfare Bureau will be open during week days from 10 A. M. to 4 P. M. all those in need of help will be interviewed at once so that they may receive help as quickly as possible. This office is also open to any member of the organization wishing to offer suggestions or having to attend some business.</p>
   <p>Plans for the Information Office, which will serve as an employment bureau for those in need, have been widely discussed. Further discussion, however, was continued until the next meeting, pending certain developments. Due to its widespread connections, this office when opened will be of great benefit to the man looking for employment.</p>
   <p>The results of next Monday's meeting will be announced at a later date, as well as the outcome at the projected Information Bureau. All members are urged to attend.</p>
