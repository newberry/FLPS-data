  <body>
   <p>The committee sponsoring a Christmas drive for funds for Upper Silesia held its first meeting Monday, December 5, in the small P.R.C.U. Hall. Delegates from Upper Silesia, Captain Grzesik-Hauke, and Dr. Mikolajczyk were present. The following representatives of the Polish-American Veterans were also present:</p>
   <p>President Hanasz, Dr. Pietrzykowski, Dr. Leonard Ciaglo, Mr. Cwik, and Mr. Rudnicki.</p>
   <p>The Mnes. Milewska, Neuman, Obarska, Wisla, Rupinska, Czujowna, d'Arlet, and F. Lenard were also representatives of the committee.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Milewska was appointed chairwoman of the meeting. Mrs. Neuman was selected as her assistant. The secretary's chair went to Dr. Gruinski, and Mrs. Czujowna was elected assistant secretary. Dr. Pietrzykowski was chosen treasurer <pb facs="5423968_7_0935.jpg" n="2"/>, and Mr. Hanasz assistant treasurer.</p>
   <p>One of the proposals that was adopted was for a Christmas kermis at which Polish-made goods, both of Poland and America, are to be sold exclusively by Polish merchants. One of the specialties will be the selling of toys for children. Works of Polish art will also be featured. A portion of the proceeds will go for the widows and orphans of Upper Silesia.</p>
   <p>A special plea will be made to the Polish-American citizens, particularly the mothers, to make their Christmas purchases by buying Polish-made goods.</p>
   <p>It was also agreed to have the Polish Falcon societies promote donations of candy, and sell it during the fair.</p>
   <p>At the final day of the kermis, there will be the auctioning of three pieces of Polish art valued at $700, which consists of (1) one large oil painting <pb facs="5423968_7_0936.jpg" n="3"/>by F. Porankiewicz, well-known artist of Krakow, entitled "Epilogue of the Insurrection at Upper Silesia"; (2) one golden, woven, valuable carpet; (3) one beautiful, silk, woven carpet.</p>
   <p>The committee also agreed to have the following Polish women of the entertainment field participate: Mmes. Korolewicz-Waydowa, Pawlowska, Zebrowska-Perlowska, Kwasigroch, Rydlinska, Kwiatkowski, Kochanska, Rybowiak, and many others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wieclaw, proprietor of the Gdansk Restaurant, has made arrangements with Leon Bzowka to operate a buffet during the entire fair.</p>
   <p>A piano, worth a thousand dollars, has been donated by Mrs. Milewska, of the clothing committee.</p>
   <p>In order to facilitate the plans for the program, three sub-committees were appointed to take care of all the arrangements. Mrs. Smulska was put in charge <pb facs="5423968_7_0937.jpg" n="4"/>of the auctions and raffles, Mrs. Milewska was put in charge of the contributions, and Mrs. Neuman was put in charge of the merchandise.</p>
   <p>A special meeting of the women of the Committee will be held December 7, at the P.R.C.U. headquarters.</p>
