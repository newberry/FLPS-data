<title level="a">INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF FREEDOM</title></bibl>

   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, the installation of officers of the Cory Wolnosci (Daughters of Freedom), Group 2448, of the Polish National Alliance, took place at Julius Slowacki's hall, 48th and Paulina Streets. Incidentally, the Daughters of Freedom is the only women's group on the South Side affiliated with the Polish National Alliance. By the close of the year, this organization had already accomplished a great deal.</p>
   <p>The installation of officers, which was preceded by an afternoon repast, was in charge of Mrs. Wanda Makowan, president of the Society. Mrs. Makowan called upon Mrs. Obarska, one of the directors of the Polish National Alliance, to act as chairman of the meeting and as toastmaster, despite the fact that Mrs. Obarska could only stay for a short while, as she had to be present at another installation in South Chicago. Mrs. Obarska, in her address, explained <pb facs="5423968_7_0097.jpg" n="2"/>the purpose of women's groups in the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>"For Lindbergh's mother," said Mrs. Obarska, "the past year was one of great joy and honor, which we women as mothers share. Proud, indeed, is America to have such a distinguished son. For the miners, to whom you have so kindly contributed ten dollars, the past year has been one of sadness, need, and struggle against exploitation."</p>
   <p>The oath of the newly elected officers followed. In this ceremony the following members took part: Wanda Makowan, president; R. Gonerka, vice-president; Sophia Mytych, financial secretary; B. Dusik, cashier; Miss Olga Oblaza, secretary. W. Oblaza, L. Budz, and K. Wanat, members of the Management Council; and Mrs. Wanda Makowan, delegate to Group 39.</p>
   <p>Francis Synowiec, vice president of the Polish National Alliance, was next to speak. He stressed the importance of the work done by the Alliance, which <pb facs="5423968_7_0098.jpg" n="3"/>has been and is a harbor for all immigrant Poles.</p>
   <p>Louis Lesnicki, a journalist, spoke on the need for solidarity within the organization, emphasizing the fact that the Polish National Alliance is not only a protective organization but also, in a great measure, an organization of ideals which has served thousands of Polish people. During the past fifteen years, the Alliance has also been of assistance to Americans of Polish descent. It protects the ideals of the Poles, ideals which are so closely related to those of the country in which we live. It has, besides, played an important part in the political and economic structure of our resurrected homeland.</p>
   <p>"People in every walk of life may belong to the Polish National Alliance, be they rich or poor," Mr. Lesnicki said in conclusion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alex Hinkielman, delegate of Group 15 of the Polish National Alliance, <pb facs="5423968_7_0099.jpg" n="4"/>was called to the speaker's stand by Mr. Synowiec, who had taken over Mrs. Obarska's place when she left. Hinkielman spoke about the work of the Polish National Alliance, pointing out the things that have been done for the Polish people. Special emphasis was placed on the fact that the members of this organization, being well organized, were among the first to offer their lives for Poland during the World War.</p>
   <p>"Poland knows of our organization, and Joseph Pilsudski, the leader of immortal fame, has praised our members for offering their sincere aid to Poland. I have hopes that this organization will continue its work at the present rate, and that it will become one of the largest groups in the Polish National Alliance," said Mr. Hinkielman.</p>
   <p>A program of music and song, presented by members of the Daughters of Freedom, followed. Outstanding performances were given by the Misses Alice Bloch <pb facs="5423968_7_0100.jpg" n="5"/>and Irene Makowski, who played violin solos, and by Olga Oblaza, who sang several solo numbers. The monologue delivered by John Oblaza was superb.</p>
   <p>George Piatowski gave the closing speech.</p>
