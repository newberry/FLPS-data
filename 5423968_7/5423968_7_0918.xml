   <p>The Guardian Angel Shelter on the South Side is sponsoring a bazaar for the benefit of the institution. The bazaar was officially opened on December 4, and will continue until December 18. This affair has attracted the attention of the Polish people from many parts of this city.</p>
   <p>To make this event more interesting, special days for certain groups are featured. December 4 was Doctors Day; December 6 was Dentists' Day; and Sunday, December 11, will be a General Day. On this day, the founding of this institution will be celebrated. Another interesting day will be December 13. Special events for pharmacists will be held. Many other plans are also scheduled for December 15 and 18.</p>
   <p>Such an array of plans cannot but attract the attention and win the support of our professional men as well as the general public. Their participation in this bazaar, which is being held for the further support of the Guardian Angel Shelter, will help to make this affair a success.</p>

   <p>One of the outstanding supporters and energetic workers for this home is F. Kowalski, president of the Sherman Park Bank. He has had an active part in the administration and program committee. Mr. Kowalski is also president of the Polonia Soap Company. However, he has found time to be very active in the affairs of this Polish Shelter on Chicago's South Side.</p>
