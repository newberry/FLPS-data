<title level="a">THE CASE OF MR. MERMEL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>This Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, in another column has touched upon the resignation of Mr. S. Mermel, erstwhile vice-president of the Polish National Alliance. Although the resignation was forwarded before it was demanded, such a demand would have been the inevitable result if Mr. Mermel had waited until the charges against him were thoroughly investigated before the central administration of the Polish National Alliance. One of the many transgressions of which Mr. Mermel was accused was his lack of keeping in confidence certain organization transactions which were of importance, and which required the utmost secrecy. Mr. Mermel abused this trust and moreover conveyed confidential information to the enemies of the Polish National Alliance. Mr. J. Borkowski and Dr. W. Bochenek, both of whom are hostile to the Alliance and therefore not prejudiced against Mr. Mermel, have in a sworn written statement given evidence against Mr. Mermel. The affidavit in question is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Because suspicion had again been cast upon members of the central administration <!--5423968_7_0140 omitted, duplicate of 5423968_7_0141--> <pb facs="5423968_7_0142.jpg" n="2"/>of the Polish National Alliance, I was asked how many reports I had prepared in the entire year, to which I replied [that I had made] only twenty, and not more.</p>
   <p>"Learning that the report book had been seen upon Mr. Debski's desk, [I knew that] suspicion also attached to me. Saying nothing to any one, I requested Mr. Borkowski to be kind enough to do me the favor to communicate with Mr. Debski and find out from whom he had received this book.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Borkowski saw Mr. Debski on February 3, 1915, and in my name asked Mr. Debski for the book. Mr. Debski had it on hand and stated that he had received it from Mr. Mermel, and that Mr. Mermel was going to obtain another book for Mr. Debski. Mr. Debski in the presence of immediate witnesses [then] picked up the telephone. This telephone call was made on February 3, 1915, between the hours of 3 and 4 P.M., from the office of the Committee on National Defense to the vice-president of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. Mermel. The telephone call was made to the office of the Alliance, and it was made in the presence of witnesses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0143.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"'Mr. Mermel, you gave me a book and promised me another, which you have not as yet brought over.'</p>
   <p>"Reply: 'I'll bring it this evening.'</p>
   <p>"'Yes, but you delivered a book and threw suspicion on others; you said that you had seen the book on a desk.'</p>
   <p>"Reply: 'It was not I who said that. I'll see you at nine o'clock this evening and tell you who it was.'</p>
   <p>"The Conversation between Messrs. Olszowy and Debski</p>
   <p>"It was the first time that I had been in the offices of the Committee on National Defense and had talked with Mr. Debski.</p>
   <p>"'Mr. Debski, I have a request to make of you. Did you ever have in your <pb facs="5423968_7_0144.jpg" n="4"/>possession the year book of the meetings of the central administration of the Polish National Alliance? I ask this because I have frequently been unjustly accused.'</p>
   <p>"Mr. Debski replied: 'Mr. Olszowy, I received this book from Mr. Mermel, the vice-president of the Polish National Alliance, and he promised to bring me another [book] because I should like to give it to a museum in Europe.'</p>
   <p>"'Mr. Debski, Mr. Mermel said that I was here on the third of February, and that I caused a disturbance.'</p>
   <p>"Every one declared, including Mr. Debski, that this was the first time that I had ever entered the premises of the Committee on National Defense.</p>
   <p>"Private</p>
   <p>"Mr. Debski said to me: 'Mr. Olszowy, since the time when I arrived from Europe,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0145.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Mermel has often visited me. If I should want the books, I know, as a member of the Polish National Alliance, where to go to get them. But it is not fitting that people should issue books themselves and then accuse others of doing so. Only a person of no principle would be capable of conduct so ignominious.'</p>
   <p>"I asked Mr. Debski whether he would be kind enough to put that in writing. Mr. Debski then called upon all those who were present in the offices of the Committee on National Defense, and who had heard Mr. Debski telephone to Mr. Mermel and my entire conversation, to give their word of honor that what I had said about the book was the truth.</p>
   <p>"I have asked all the gentlemen who were present to be my witnesses. They promised me that they would report what Mr. Debski had said to me, and what he had said to Mr. Mermel over the telephone.</p>
