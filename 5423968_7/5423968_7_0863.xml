   <p>Employment offices are in great demand by workers seeking jobs. Factories are idle, those that still exist maintain only a skeleton force of employees. And so everyone fears the hard winter aheadof him. Many people hasten to private employment agencies, who in return for a dollar, or two, promise to seek a job for them. Few fortunates receive these positions, while the majority wait anxiously, and many more become the victims of these unreliable agents, swindlers we call them, who prey upon the profits of those in misery. About one of these agencies we have written previously.</p>
   <p>It is a "free" bureau of employment established by Hearst of the Chicago Examiner, Mr. Hearst's activity for the people in misery, blessed the Poles in Chicago with one of those "free" agencies located on Milwaukee Avenue. In this office one may gain an exceptional position, since the agent seated in his office doesn't attempt to exert himself to seek work for others, but still demands a dollar from each unemployed person, and gives a suitable excuse to the police <pb facs="5423968_7_0864.jpg" n="2"/>as to where this money must go. He claims it is for the purpose of advertising to achieve classifications for the working people.</p>
   <p>We caution the workers to not let themselves get "strung" by this kind of "employment institutions", and remind them again, that there really exist free bureaus of employment in their vicinity. These instititions are not maintained by swindlers or by those "Blessed People", who make a proficient business for themselves. Bureaus of the good sort are established from money collected by taxation, guided by the state and city. Bureaus of this kind can be found in any of the largest cities in the United States. Here in Chicago we have the good fortune of possessing three of these bureaus and only to them should we first go when seeking aid for work. The addresses of these bureaus are:</p>
   <p>Illinois Free Employment Bureau</p>
   <p>9 South Canal Street</p>
   <p>259 North Clark Street</p>
   <p>429 Wabash Avenue.</p>
