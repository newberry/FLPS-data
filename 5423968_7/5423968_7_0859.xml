   <p>The Polish people of Chicago are complaining against the employment agencies. Until now we had very little to do with employment agencies which are sending men to work in the woods and on railroads. There is no doubt that only the poorest workers take such jobs.</p>
   <p>These agencies are sending workers very far, hundreds of miles from their homes, and many times these workers become stranded and stay there without money and without jobs.</p>
   <p>On October 26, about twenty-five workers, mostly Polish people, were sent out to build a railroad at Wyerville, Wisconsin. The Jacobson and Keapple Employment Agency, 26 S. Canal Street, promised them $2.50 a day while their living expenses would cost $3.00 a week. But instead, they were charged 75Â¢ a day for meals and after four days all were laid off.</p>
   <p>One of them came back to Chicago (Andrew Halas, 3627 Marshfield Avenue) and <pb facs="5423968_7_0860.jpg" n="2"/>immediately went to the employment agency which sent him to work. But at the employment agency they gave him a brutal kick. All workers who are applying for a job at employment agencies must be careful, especially during Winter time when workers are hired to work in the woods.</p>
