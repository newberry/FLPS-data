<title level="a">POLISH LEAGUE, POLISH NATIONAL FUND AT RAPPERSCHWYL, AND MR. JERZMANOWSKI--FACTS AND QUESTIONS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We have already announced that Mr. [Erasmus] J. Jerzmanowski has resigned from the office of president of the Polish League in America. We have also published in extense the appeal of Mr. Jerzmanowski, general commissioner of the Polish National Fund at Rapperschwyl, in behalf of that institution.</p>
   <p>Since at present not only individuals but also our public is interested in these facts, we feel that it is our duty to make a few remarks. But before making the remarks let us review the actual course of events.</p>
   <p>As we all know, the Poles in the United States, in order to honor "Kosciuske Year", organized the Polish League in America at a Polish mass meeting held for this purpose in Chicago. The aim of this institution is and will be patriotic work in the full sense of the word and the collection of money <pb facs="5423968_7_1426.jpg" n="2"/>for the Polish National Fund in America. One of the founders of the Polish League, who was the first signer of the appeal to the American Poles in behalf of the mass meeting for the purpose of organizing the aforesaid institution, was Erasmus J. Jerzmanowski, a wealthy, prominent, and greatly respected man, who has distinguished himself by his nobility and his generosity here in America and in the old country, a person whose willingness to work for humanity cannot be questioned. It is quite true that Mr. Jerzmanowski did not participate in the preliminary work of preparing the plans for the poposed League; neither did he participate in the Polish mass meeting, for he was too busy and could not attend. Yet Mr. Jerzmanowski must have read the printed outline of the constitution of the League, for it was mailed to him a few weeks before the mass meeting took place, and this outline of the plan was printed and widely commented upon by the Polish press.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. Jerzmanowski was not present at the mass meeting, he was elected president of the Polish League. As soon as he was elected, he <pb facs="5423968_7_1427.jpg" n="3"/>was notified by telegraph in New York City, and a telegram was received from him stating that he accepted the office. A few days later the president of the League sent to Chicago a large cash donation for the Polish National Fund and for the upkeep of the League.</p>
   <p>Soon after, Mr. Jerzmanowski took a trip to Europe for a few months, and there, in Switzerland, he was appointed general commissioner for America of the Polish National Fund at Rapperschwyl, Switzerland. This Fund, by the way, he supported by his cash donations, his encouragement, and his activities.</p>
   <p>From Mr. Jerzmanowski's appeal [in behalf of the Fund] we have learned that he has accepted the appointment as commissioner of the Polish National Fund at Rapperschwyl, Switzerland, and has promised that "he will endeavor to merge all Polish funds existing in America with the fund in Europe" [at Rapperschwyl].</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1428.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It may be said that Mr. Jerzmanowski, as president of the Polish League, contradicts himself because it was decided at the mass meeting that the Polish National Fund in America is to be an independent fund until its total sum amounts to $100,000. This contradiction was disclosed at the meeting of the central board of directors of the League, at which Mr. Jerzmanowski was present. At this meeting the president of the League [Mr. Jerzmanowski] made the request that certain articles of its constitution be changed, namely, the paragraphs defining who should be admitted to membership, and what part the Polish clergy shall have in it, and also the articles defining the Polish National Fund in America. The board of directors declared that it had no authority to change the decision of the mass meeting, and when Mr. Jerzmanowski threatened to resign, the members of the board agreed to consider Mr. Jerzmanowski's request for amendments and to submit it at the next convention. Mr. Jerzmanowski agreed to this. A special report of this meeting was prepared and presented to Mr. Jerzmanowski for his approval, which he accepted, and it was published in newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1429.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It seemed that this misunderstanding had been temporarily removed, for the sake of the public welfare, until the people, the public, should have the opportunity to voice their opinion at the next convention. In the meantime, only a few days afterwards, suddenly a new event occurred; Mr. Jerzmanowski submitted his unconditional resignation from the office of president of the League on account of circumstances which were "beyond his control". What these circumstances were it is hard to conjecture, for since the last meeting of the central board of the League and the acceptance by Mr. Jerzmanowski, of a modus vivendi with its members the conditions in this respect had not changed. It is quite true that a communication from New York was published in Zgoda after the resignation of Mr. Jerzmanowski explaining the reasons for this resignation, but in the first place, we do not know its source, and in the second place it gives less explanation than the ready-made phrase "on account of circumstances beyond my control".</p>
   <p>Finally, the last act of this whole affair was the issue of an appeal by Mr. Jerzmanowski, former president of the League and present commissioner <pb facs="5423968_7_1430.jpg" n="6"/>of the Polish Fund at Rapperschwyl, which was published in our paper last Saturday. In this appeal the commissioner describes conditions among the Poles in the old country and in America; he reminds them of their duty, as if it had been neglected by them, and as the first step he recommends "patriotic activities in all parts of Poland" to create a powerful National Fund. The right to establish such a Fund in America is denied to us by Mr. Jerzmanowski, for he says that "we are not capable of designing plans for activities", and "we are not conscious of our nationality". He also refuses to recognize our National Fund in America and advises us to limit ourselves "merely to collecting funds and intrusting the management [of them] to people who are enlightened and of good character, who can give financial guarantees, and who are in touch with [Polish] national life". The management which he refers to is that of the people of the Polish Museum at Rapperschwyl, the guardians of the Polish National Fund in Europe. Mr. Jerzmanowski, after excluding the collection of money for any funds here in America (and this includes the Polish National Fund of <pb facs="5423968_7_1431.jpg" n="7"/>the Polish League), in his appeal asks for donations for the Rapperschwyl Fund and for that Fund only; then accusing all those who may not agree with him of "egotism and selfishness he desires that "Kosciusko Year may lay the foundation for a happy future".</p>
   <p>There are openly admitted facts, and no one is trying to conceal them. These facts may be summarized as follows:</p>
   <p>Mr. Jerzmanowski, a man whom the Polish people here in America and in Europe regard as one of the most prominent Polish citizens, after contributing toward the foundation of the Polish League in America by words and deeds and accepting its leadership not only resigned from his office six months later but as commissioner of the Polish National Fund of Rapperschwyl opposes that which is the very foundation of the Polish League in America (see paragraph one of Article 1 of the constitution of the Polish League), that is, he is against that "uniting of our moral and material forces which <pb facs="5423968_7_1432.jpg" n="8"/>is so necessary for our national development" here in America. He is also against one of the most clearly defined aims of the League, namely, the collection of money for the Polish National Fund in America (see seetion"g," paragraph three, Article I of the constitution of the Polish League).</p>
   <p>Thus Mr. Jerzmanowski is against the Polish League, which was founded at the Polish mass meeting in Chicago, and of which he became the leader in May.</p>
   <p>As a natural consequence a few important questions arise from these facts, namely: Who is right in this controversy, the League and its Administration or Mr. Jerzmanowski? Will not the League, as such be harmed on account of this? Does Mr. Jerzmanowski's resignation prove that the League is defective? Or on the contrary, and despite everything has the League a right to exist, to develop, and to work for the good of our people? Who in reality is right? Those who deny us the right to any independent action and tell us that we <pb facs="5423968_7_1433.jpg" n="9"/>must limit ourselves to "contributing toward a fund" which we have no right to control, or those who regard us as grown-up people, capable of doing purposeful work?</p>
   <p>These questions will be answered in other articles. We wish to declare very emphatically that although these first questions have a personal character, we are not interested in personal matters but in the general issue. On the answers will depend who is right, the League or those opponents of the League who predict its death just because Mr. Jerzmanowski has resigned. Therefore, we wish to assure you that personal feelings are excluded here. We may not agree with Mr. Jerzmanowski; his ways are not our ways; but we shall not cease to respect him as a man of good intentions, even though our viewpoint remains unchanged.</p>
