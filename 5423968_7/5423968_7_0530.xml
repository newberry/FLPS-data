   <p>Without doubt a Polish hospital is necessary in Chicago, considering the Polish population of one hundred and fifty thousand. Often, however, we hear people remarking, "Why a Polish hospital? I speak the English language. When I get sick I will go to an American hospital."</p>
   <p>In reality, a Polish hospital is not necessary for one who is well acquainted with the English language. It would be considered necessary only by one whose attention was centered upon himself and his own selfish interests. From a Christian and humanitarian point of view, however, it is our duty to help one another if we are able. That which may be unnecessary for one person may prove indispensable and desirable for another.</p>
   <p>One who is able to speak English may have a family which has just arrived from Europe and which does not yet understand the English language. If a member of <pb facs="5423968_7_0531.jpg" n="2"/>such a family becomes seriously sick and is taken to a hospital of some other nationality where no Polish is spoken, one can imagine such a person's predicament.</p>
   <p>American citizens of other nationalities have their own hospitals even though they do speak English.</p>
   <p>The following incident, which took place on Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago, proves that a Polish hospital is necessary. A grown-up daughter of a Polish restaurant man scalded herself with boiling water so badly that it will take at least three months to cure her. The doctor says that if he treats her at home the cost of the medicine and bandages alone will amount to three hundred dollars, but if she were treated in a Polish hospital--she does not speak English--she would have a better chance of recovery. Moreover, if the hospital charges were a dollar a day the treatment would cost only ninety dollars.</p>
   <p>Thus the cost of hospital care would be far less in a Polish hospital. Moreover <pb facs="5423968_7_0532.jpg" n="3"/>a patient in a Polish hospital, under the supervision of the Sisters of Nazareth, would be sure of receiving courteous and careful attention.</p>
   <p>Therefore, I appeal to the hearts and convictions of the Poles in Chicago, especially to you fair ladies, who always distinguish yourselves by your tender hearts, and I ask you to support the plan of establishing a Polish hospital, and to support it not only with words but with deeds. All of us should at least attend the amateur play which will be staged at Pulaski Hall, at Ashland Avenue and 17th Street, on April 15, at 7 P.M. The proceeds from this play will be turned over to the Polish Hospital Fund in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A beautiful drama, based on the life of the common people, entitled "The Hut Beyond the Village" (Chata Za Wsia), will be staged by prominent Polish artists from Chicago. There will be a dance after the play.</p>
   <p>I am convinced that our fair Polish ladies would rather enjoy themselves for a few cents at a play than purchase a ribbon or some other ornament which would <pb facs="5423968_7_0533.jpg" n="4"/>become useless in a short time. Combine pleasure with usefulness, and contribute toward a noble cause.</p>
   <p>Tickets will be on sale at Szwajkart's drug store, on Noble Street; at Xelowski's and Bardonski's drug stores on Milwaukee Ave; at the offices of Zgoda and Gazeta Katolicka, near Noble Street; by the Sisters of Nazareth on Division Street; in St. Hedwig's Parish; at Dr. Strzyzewski's drug store, on Hoyne Avenue; at J. Mirski's drug store, 1093 Hoyne Avenue; at the office of Sztandar on 17th Street; at Mr. Chmielinski's residence, 656 West 17th Street; at Pulaski Hall by Mr. Marcinkowski; at the residences of Mr. Czechowicz and Professor Machnikowski in South Chicago; and, finally, at the ticket office of Columbia Hall on the day of the play.</p>
   <p>George Mirski.</p>
