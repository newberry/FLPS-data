   <p>Last Thursday, July 12, at the 3:30 P. M., at the school hall of the cathedral, a meeting was held by clergymen of Polish parishes, called by Archbishop Quigley, for the purpose of considering the matter of a Polish orphanage.</p>
   <p>Almost all Polish parishes were represented at the meeting.</p>
   <p>At the hour above mentioned the archbishop entered the hall and opened the meeting with a long speech. He explained the lack of charitable activity, especially among the young Polish generation.</p>
   <p>He spoke of being interested in the activity of Polish youth. He also read from the records of the representatives of several institutions to show that there are two hundred Polish children in various institutions. Part of these children are in orphanages; others on account of petty violations are in the Juvenile Home of Correction, where they come in contact with other criminal types of children, lose not only their nationality but also their faith. That it is time right now Chicago Poles should take care of their unfortunate children.</p>

   <p>After that speech they elected Rev. Rhode secretary of the meeting, and the assembled clergymen under the leadership of the archbishop, continued to debate the matter of the Polish orphanage.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile everybody agreed to make a donation for this purpose. The archbishop, besides the loan from the archdiocese for this orphanage, personally donated $1,000. Finally there was a committee elected to find a suitable location for this orphanage; to outline a plan how to receive voluntary donations and the control of same, then how to prepare a method of taxing the parishes for this institution, also to select a plan for a suitable structure; to form the rules and regulations for this institution and incorporate it under the laws of the state.</p>
   <p>They elected the following committee: Rev. Gordon, Lange, Nawrocki, Wojtalewicz, Rogalski, Gronkowski, Sztuczko, and Rhode. The committee will give its report at the next meeting, Monday, August 20.</p>
   <p>The clergymen also agreed to explain the situation of the orphanage from the pulpit, Sunday, Aug. 15, and at the same time make donations for the purpose. Contributions for this purpose will be accepted by parsonage.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0595.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The names of the donors will be published in the local newspapers.</p>
   <p>In regard to the clergymen, who, on account of short time had not been informed and so could not attend the last meeting, the whole matter of the orphanage will be fully discussed at the next meeting. It is essential to be in complete agreement about the plan in order to start building the orphanage and have it completed as soon as possible.</p>
