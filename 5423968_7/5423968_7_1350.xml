  <body>
   <p>A mass meeting of the Poles of the Fifteenth ward was held yesterday afternoon at the St. Hedwig school hall, for the purpose of rendering aid to the destitute Polish families of this ward. At 4 P.M. the president of the Welfare Committee, John Krajecki, opened the meeting. The Reverend John Piechowski, pastor of St. Hedwig Church, was appointed chairman and Peter J. Lama, recording secretary.</p>
   <p>In a few words, the pastor explained the aim of the gathering and expressed his gratification that the citizens of this ward were taking a vital interest in helping the poor.</p>
   <p>At a earlier mass meeting, held on January 17, a resolution was adopted, a copy of which was sent to the Bureau of Associated Charities. At yesterday's mass meeting this resolution, and a reply from the Bureau of Associated <pb facs="5423968_7_1351.jpg" n="2"/>Charities, were read. This was followed by an open discussion in which the following took part; W. Obecny, F. Sobieszczyk, A. Nowak, J. Nowicki, John Krajecki, Michael Osuch, and many others.</p>
   <p>A motion to take up a collection for the destitute was made by the Reverend Piechowski and was accepted unanimously. The contributors and their contributions were as follows:</p>
