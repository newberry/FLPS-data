   <p>"Chicago, Illinois,</p>
   <p>Jan. 14, 1892.</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor: I read the account of Father Barzynski's plea for organized charities in yesterday's issue. His efforts are executed in the true style of a priest. His duties are not only performed in pro Deo et ecclesia but also in et pro hominibus, for thousands of his kind deeds have dried the tears of many a poor widow and unfortunate waif.</p>
   <p>"Allow me the privilege of making a proposal. My suggestion is as follows: Let a reliable committee be chosen and be called 'Polish Red Cross Charities.' The aim of the committee would be to look after the funds with the express purpose of providing for the proper distribution for the needs of the poor. Proper <pb facs="5423968_7_1551.jpg" n="2"/>administration and the finding of generous donors would also be in line with the duties of the committee. Whether this suggestion is favorable or not, I am enclosing five dollars towards this noble cause. I realize the severity of winter and the needs of the many who are destitute.</p>
   <p>Your servant,</p>
   <p>Zygmunt F. Czaplinski</p>
   <p>and</p>
   <p>Pearl Czaplinski."</p>
   <p>The five dollar contributed by Mr. and Mrs. Czaplinski is greatly appreciated. The money will be set aside until the organization of a society or a committee be made, pending the results of next Sunday's meeting at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Hall, which will take place at 4 P.M.</p>
   <p>The Editors.</p>
