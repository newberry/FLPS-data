   <p>We have received a copy of the constitution of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Society which celebrated its silver jubilee last Sunday. The document was printed in Paris in 1869.</p>
   <p>This constitution is a very important document because it is the first constitution of a Polish society and has served as a model for drawing up other constitutions.</p>
   <p>The title of this constitution adopted in Chicago, Illinois, in North America, on June 1, 1866 is: The Constitution and Bylaws of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Brotherly Aid Society. The introduction to this constitution reads:</p>
   <p>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.</p>
   <p>Introduction</p>
   <p>In order that the Polish Roman Catholic people may be united by the bonds of <pb facs="5423968_7_0350.jpg" n="2"/>brotherly love; in order that charitable deeds such as visiting and helping the sick, burying the dead, and helping the widows and orphans may prevail in this brotherly group; and in order that brotherhood, harmony, unity, and moral habits of body and soul may be found among us, we have founded a Brotherly Aid Society under the patronage of Saint Stanislaus Kostka.</p>
   <p>Titles of articles containing the bylaws:</p>
   <p>I. Name and emblem of the Society. II. Principles of the Society. III. Officers. (These are: a president, a vice-president, a secretary, an assistant secretary, three advisers, a cashier, a marshal, and a doorman.) IV-XI. Duties of officials. XII. Membership and dues. XIII. Election of candidates. XIV. Religious ceremonies. XV. Conducting of meetings. XVI. Taking care of the sick. XVII. Funeral ceremonies. XVIII. Unforeseen incidents. Article XIX. reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Article XIX.</p>
   <p>Section one. The constitution and bylaws cannot be changed, amended, or <pb facs="5423968_7_0351.jpg" n="3"/>suspended without the consent of three-fourths of the members of the Society, and such changes, etc. can only occur at an annual meeting.</p>
   <p>This constitution and these bylaws have been unanimously adopted by St. Stanislaus Kostka's Brotherly Aid Society in Chicago, Illinois, on June 1, 1866.</p>
   <p>President: Peter Kiolbassa</p>
   <p>Secretary: Marcellus Ziomkowski</p>
   <p>Advisory Council:</p>
   <p>Lawrence Stasz</p>
   <p>Joseph Dziewior</p>
   <p>Thomas Nowicki</p>
   <p>Anthony Bok</p>
   <p>Anthony Matysiak</p>
