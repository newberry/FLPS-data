   <p>The Kosciusko Monument Fund movement is spreading throughout the United States and Canada. Statistics from the secretary's office reveal that 232 people have made contributions totaling $523.96. Only recently, eighty-five donors gave $102.55. A five-dollar offering came from Canada. Forty-seven members of the Thomas Zana Society gave a total of $47. The Polish Harmonia Society of New York gave $5.</p>
   <p>Three persons from Galicia gave eighty-five cents. One person from Vienna gave fifty cents. These donations give definite proof that the movement has spread to Europe.</p>
   <p>The following letter came to the monument headquarters from Mr. Terski, secretary of the Polish Sons Society, of Detroit, dated March 4, 1892:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"To the Honorable Committee of the Kosciusko Monument Association: I wish to enclose the following reaction to your recent letter asking support for your Fund. When the letter was read,at our regular monthly meeting on March 2, the members all began to applaud. A motion to support the Fund was unanimously accepted. A committee of five was then chosen to lay plans for securing contributions in our area.</p>
   <p>"The Polish Sons Society heartily wishes the Association success in its endeavor to build a statue to our patriot, Thaddeus Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>"Fraternally yours,</p>
   <p>"L. Terski, secretary,</p>
   <p>"Polish Sons Society,</p>
   <p>"Branch 28,</p>
   <p>Polish National Alliance."</p>
