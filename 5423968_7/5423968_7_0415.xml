   <p>From the time of its foundation the hospital of St. Mary of Nazareth has aided the suffering people. There were many poor people in the hospital, and many more were getting the aid of the hospital clinic free, but the people that did pay, paid very little. In time the hospital could not meet its bills, and the directors of the hospital were compelled to appeal for aid and kindhearted contributions of donors.</p>
   <p>The Society of Assistance and Guardianship at this hospital is striving to raise funds for necessities such as beds, bed-sheets, bandages, etc. They are arranging a great concert at Orchestra Hall, located in the heart of Chicago, the 28th day of June, in which the well-known artists have given their consent to do their part for the good cause.</p>
   <p>Every one understands that the purpose of the concert is to obtain your support. The concert program is as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Overture - Raymond "The Queen's Secret," Thomas - Metropolitan Orchestra-Carl Bunge, Director.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. Declamation - "Old Age," Brooks, - Mr. W. W. Carnes.</p>
   <p>3. Soprano solo - "Voci di Primavera," Strauss, Paul Jadwiga, M. Smulska.</p>
