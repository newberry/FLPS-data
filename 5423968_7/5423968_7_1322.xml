  <body>
   <p>A beautiful and good thought has appeared among our Polish people. Thanks to private initiative, deserving of honorable mention, it was resolved to arrange in Chicago under the auspices of the clergy, organizations and press, a great musical and artistic evening in one of the downtown halls, the profits to go toward the fund for our hungry countrymen in that part of Poland, which is within the Russian empire. Joining to make this splendid project a success, the representatives of the clergy, organizations and press assembled last week, and after a thorough deliberation decided to arrange an evening of music in conjunction with a theatrical entertainment in the largest hall in Chicago - the Auditorium (4,000 seating capacity) on January 28th the coming year.</p>
   <p>At the same time an executive committee was elected to make up the program and all the necessary arrangement; at the head of this committee stands the city attorney of Chicago Mr. Smulski, the treasurer is the Most Rev. F. Wojtalewicz, chaplain of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and the secretary is Mr. St. Osada.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1323.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is proper that we anticipate that a concert and entertainment, into the program of which are to be entered the best productions played by the first class artistic forces, will interest all of us together with our spiritual and civic leaders and that the public will support this beautiful, worthy and noble cause, a cause to help our poor Fatherland and our countrymen suffering misery within it.</p>
