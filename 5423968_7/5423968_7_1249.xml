   <p>At last Monday's meeting of the Polish Central Committee, which is composed of prominent citizens and representatives of the largest Polish organizations collecting funds for the cause held most sacred by every Pole, the Polish Central Relief Committee was formed.</p>
   <p>Representatives of practically all Polish organizations in America have joined the Polish Central Relief Committee, with the exception of the Socialists and their sympathizers from the present K.O.N. [Committee on National Defense]. These people are never harmonious and co-operative in their work, but want to foster their own party politics everywhere. None of the organizations and groups united in the Polish Central Relief Committee wants to have anything to do with these people. We emphasize this especially for the information of</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1250.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Kurier Polski [Polish Courier published at Cleveland].</p>
   <p>The executive committee elected at the first joint meeting is composed of the following members: Mr. A. Karabasz, censor of the Polish National Alliance, as president; Mr. P. Rostenkowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and Mrs. A. Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, as vice-presidents; Mr. S. Osada, secretary of the National Council, as secretary; and Mr. J.F. Smulski, president of the Polish bank, who, as everybody knows, was elected joint treasurer. Besides these officers being elected, the following people were appointed to the executive committee: Dr. T. Starzynski, president of the Alliance of Polish Falcons (represented by J.S. Rybicki, president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Falcons); Mr. J. Stryjak of Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, President of the Polish Union of America (represented by Dr. Tenerowicz); Mr. R. Porzuczek, president of the Alliance of Polish Military Societies in America; and Reverend W. Zapala, rector of St. Stanislaus Kostka's College.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1251.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The very composition of this executive committee gives one the right to deduce that goodwill must have guided the assembled representatives. All parties and factions were given a representative in the executive committee, so that the possibility of even the slightest disharmony on the subject of the membership of this important committee has been removed in advance.</p>
   <p>No accusation of political partisanship can be made because of the names and offices of the people appointed to the executive committee. We find there Polish men and women who have rid themselves of all aspirations for leadership. Their only ambition is to work for the homeland in these difficult times, which are so full of responsibilities.</p>
   <p>The Polish Central Relief Committee is going to create a revisory commission composed of the most prominent citizens of this country. The task of this commission will be to oversee all six treasury centers to which the Polish people have been sending their contributions and to control the joint treasury, which will be in the care of the treasurer of the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1252.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>(Those who still do not trust any of the six treasuries already functioning should send their contributions to this joint treasury.)</p>
   <p>The basic principle to guide the Polish Central Relief Committee deals with this committee's work in regard to the stand of the American Poles on the events now taking place in Europe. Since the principle has been stated less drastically than was expected, we can hope that even the eternally dissatisfied critics may be vanquished for the good of the cause. One can therefore expect that almost the entire group of Polish immigrants will soon be united by the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>The basic principle of the Polish Central Relief Committee now reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Polish Central Relief Committee aims at unifying the opinions of parties and organizations in regard to the political situation of the nation. If it succeeds in this, it will then undertake diplomatic endeavors in the official <pb facs="5423968_7_1253.jpg" n="5"/>sphere at Washington. In the matter of collecting funds, in the event that unanimity cannot be attained because of the pressure of events, the Committee will give the several treasury centers absolute freedom of action. This freedom of action will end the moment a national government is organized and recognized by all three of the annexed parts of Poland. The Central Polish Relief Committee will, when requested, transfer the funds collected here to the treasury of the new government, provided that these funds are not indispensable to the fulfillment of the projects undertaken here by the Polish Central Committee--that is, bringing active help to the homeland."</p>
   <p>In view of this arrangement, there should be an end to all dissatisfaction and all sorts of sarcastic criticism which still appear at times in some of the publications which like to criticize everything, on the principle that it is easier to criticize than to act.</p>
   <p>The people as a whole must now support that which they have been wanting and demanding for weeks. Now no one can make the old excuses: "I shall give when <pb facs="5423968_7_1254.jpg" n="6"/>everybody unites," "I do not know to whom to give because so many are collecting," or "We shall send our contributions when a general treasury and a central committee are formed."</p>
   <p>A joint committee exists. We have a joint treasury and for treasurer a man who enjoys the greatest confidence. Therefore it is time that all little committees in the provinces transfer the funds which they have collected and are keeping to one treasury over which all of the people will have control. We should know at last how much we are able to contribute for our homeland's purposes and, after a joint accounting, should get to work with zeal for the task of collecting further funds, which our homeland and our brothers across the sea already need.</p>
