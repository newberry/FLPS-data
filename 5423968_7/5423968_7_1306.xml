   <p>Yesterday the Aid Society for the Unemployed made its first quarterly statement of activities, published in Dziennik Ludowy.</p>
   <p>It is not difficult to see that it presents itself very poorly. During the entire three months the Treasury Committee collected only $101.25, of which the unemployed received only $70.30.</p>
   <p>Glancing at these "lean" figures a question arises. Why did not the whole mass of the working people respond to the call of their brothers who are in a deplorable situation?</p>
   <p>The answer is not difficult, though indeed sad. It is this:- that in the Polish community, the working class in America has very little proletarian solidarity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1307.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In spite of the fact that there is much misery and poverty among us and thousands unemployed whose families are hungry, we must admit that the majority is employed and have a steady source of income which insures their welfare for some time to come. There is them something to give if there was a will to do so; but that will does not exist. It is a fact that those who are employed and well aware of conditions do forget about the existence of the Unemployed Aid Society, taking for granted that all contributions are favors and not obligations. It is also a fact that the small fund which the Society has on hand is contributed by a minority of organized labor; the rest forget that all members of the Society are obliged to make regular contributions, even though small ones, to the funds of the Society.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, some of the delinquent members will say that they are giving aid to someone outside of the Society, but the number of such is very small; others will refer to the possibility of losing their own jobs and the necessity of saving for that purpose. Are they not too thrifty?</p>
   <p>On what then,depends their solidarity and through what deeds?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1308.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Is the propagation of the watchword enough? If so, it would be very sad.</p>
   <p>We are appealing to the nameless masses. Let this statement serve them as an awakening of their conscience.</p>
