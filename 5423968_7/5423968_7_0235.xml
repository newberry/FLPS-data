<title level="a">THE CASE OF MRS. M. SZATKOWSKA AND THE POLISH NATIONAL ALLIANCE</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>The charter of the Polish National Alliance has cost the organization seven hundred dollars, and the central administration is concerned about its value in the eyes of the law.</p>
   <p>In reality, the Polish National Alliance possesses three charters, and all are binding, for not one was rejected. This is derived from the fact that this makes it easier for certain members of the central administration to twist the law according to their personal outlooks.</p>
   <p>At least, this can be said, being familiar with the facts of the Mrs. Szatkowska case. The case presents itself as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0236.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Szatkowska's husband died two years ago. Before his death, Mrs. Depkowa held a note for several hundred dollars against him. Since the late Szatkowski was insured with the Polish National Alliance and the Foresters, Mrs. Depkowa saw fit to get a court order restraining payment of the death benefits to the widow, and having them turned over to her on the grounds of her claim. The Foresters had this order revoked by a higher court on the grounds that a benefit organization is obligated by law to pay the death benefit to the widow of the deceased, and no one else is allowed to attach a claim to this money.</p>
   <p>The Foresters paid the death benefit to the widow, Mrs. Szatkowska, while the Polish National Alliance turned it over to Mrs. Depkowa. This payment was made despite the threat of Attorney Casimir B. Czarnecki, who took an interest in this matter and told the central administration that it would pay the death benefit twice.</p>
   <p>That is exactly what happened. A higher court, with Judge Chetlain <pb facs="5423968_7_0237.jpg" n="3"/>presiding, ordered the Polish National Alliance to pay the death benefit to Mrs. Szatkowska, disregarding the fact that the organization had made a previous payment on the same claim to Mrs. Depkowa.</p>
   <p>We are not concerned in this matter only for the reason that the Polish National Alliance had to pay twice on the same policy. However, we take particular interest in the statements made by the attorney of the central department. According to him, the Polish National Alliance has been lawfully in existence only since March, 1896. The death of Mr. Szatkowski came prior to this date, consequently the matter was merely a private one and not for the Illinois courts, the attorney contended.</p>
   <p>If the court had agreed with the opinion of the attorney, the present central administration would have the right to prejudicate, that is, everything that was in existence prior to March, 1896, when the Polish National Alliance was incorporated as a benefit society, would have lawfully ceased to be the property of the Alliance--and would be merely a private matter beyond the <pb facs="5423968_7_0238.jpg" n="4"/>sphere of the organization.</p>
   <p>As to how the Polish National Alliance would stand, together with its capital collected prior to March, 1896, in this respect, we decline to make any further statement. The official organ [Zgoda] of the Polish National Alliance is ready to seal our lips with the following statement: "This is not your concern." We concede this privilege to the Zgoda. We wish also to ask those members of the Alliance who wish to consider us enemies this question, "Does the patriotic and nationalistic institution, with its huge capital, exist only since March, 1896, or--longer?" The rest is not of much concern to us.</p>
