<title level="a">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE PULASKI HALL FOUNDATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We have just received the financial statement from the administrators of the Pulaski Hall Foundation (South Ashland Avenue), covering the period from January 1, 1890, to July 1, of this year. Pulaski Hall was built last year by the above mentioned society. It was officially opened last New Year's Day. According to the financial statement, the total cost of construction of the hall was $41,135.33. The principal expenditures were $7,560.51 for labor, $5,750 to the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company for the decorative frontal material and work, $5,003.10 for iron, $4,280.12 for lumber, $3,528.80 for doors and windows, $2,645.50 for brick, $1,700.50 for plumbing, $1,675.20 for plastering, $1,457.14 for an iron roof, etc.</p>
   <p>The total expenditures of the Foundation within the period given above were $65,603.57, the total income, $65,689.95, leaving a surplus of $86.38. The itemized statement of income is as follows: $5,379 from the <pb facs="5423968_7_0838.jpg" n="2"/>sale of shares; $666.70 from excursions; $376.91 from balls and other social affairs; $3,107.09 from the Fair [St. Adalbert's Parish]; $130.34 from patriotic exercises; $203.09 from the cornerstone ceremony; $100 from advertisements on the main stage drop; and $15 from private donations. Two loans were made, the first at the bank of Dreyer and Company, for $25,000, the second, privately, for $28,105, totaling $53,105. Income in rents from the Hall for the first six months of its existence was $2,606.82.</p>
   <p>Expenses, aside from those already mentioned above ($40,000 of which was allotted in advance for construction of the hall by the financial committee), were as follows: Cost of real estate, $8,000; installments on private loans, $8,330; interest on loan from Dreyer and Company, $1,350; interest on private loans, $422; stage decorations, $900; furniture, $992; and general upkeep of the hall since its opening, $769.75.</p>
   <p>As we see from the above, Pulaski Hall is still encumbered with debts <pb facs="5423968_7_0839.jpg" n="3"/>amounting to about $50,000. Its annual income will be $5,000 or more. This sum should pay the overhead, interest on loans, and perhaps even pay off part of the principal.</p>
   <p>Naturally, amortization of the debts will proceed at a much faster rate, directly in proportion to the additional shares issued, and to the amount of possible extra income.</p>
