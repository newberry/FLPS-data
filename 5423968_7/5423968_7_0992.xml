   <p>The General Committee for War Victims in Poland has sent us the following communication:</p>
   <p>Vevey, Switzerland,</p>
   <p>Hotel Du Lac</p>
   <p>Feb. 12, 1918.</p>
   <p>Polish Roman-Catholic Union in America</p>
   <p>984-6 Milwaukee Avenue</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>The federal bank in Vevey has paid us on the basis of a telegram, a copy of which we take the liberty to enclose, the sum of 86,700 francs, constituting the gift of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union in America.</p>
   <p>We take the liberty to offer to you, respectable gentlemen, our hearty and ardent thanks for such a liberal gift for our unfortunate brothers in the Fatherland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0993.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The situation in the country, as a result of the prolonged war, becomes with each day more tragic; from everywhere come urgent calls for help.</p>
   <p>Russian Poland, Galicia and Lithuania are equally touched with the disaster of war. At present, indeed, the situation of the unfortunate people in Galicia deserves special attention, returning from their forced exile to their abodes, completely destroyed and ruined.</p>
   <p>We had some fresh news about the unusual misery reigning among the people in this category from Count Leon Poninski, former viceroy of Galicia and member of the Lwow Delegation K. B. K., and from Mr. Anthony Gorski, professor of the Jagiellonian University.</p>
   <p>According to their words, thousands of homeless children are roaming the roads. The population, finding their homes in ruins, remains without a roof and is suffering untold misery.</p>
   <p>Equally lies in our hearts and deserves fellow feeling the destiny of <pb facs="5423968_7_0994.jpg" n="3"/>our unfortunate countrymen, prisoners in German and Austrian camps. In as great a measure as possible we come to their aid, sending food to forty camps in Germany and expending in this aim about 20,000 francs monthly.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, we are not able to provide food in all the camps where our countrymen are being kept.</p>
   <p>In this situation we accept with much greater gratitude the gift of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union in America, which, strengthening remarkably the treasury of our Committee, will allow us to fill more than one urgent need.</p>
   <p>Expressing once more our sincere acknowledgment for such a liberal gift, we annex expressions of high regard.</p>
   <p>The President of the Executive Department and General Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Anthony Osuchowski.</p>
