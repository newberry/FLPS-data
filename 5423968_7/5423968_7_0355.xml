   <p>Every christian is familiar with the bibical saying, Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself. If this proverb would be respected by every one, this world would really be a paradise.</p>
   <p>This Commandment does not say that we should love our neighbors more than ourselves. Wishing good for them with a clear open and sincere intent, and the same for ourselves.</p>
   <p>When we go to purchase personal needs, we like to get the best and the most for our money. This is a logical attitude. Frivolous-minded are those who do not follow this procedure; these are the people that live a rather shallow life in this world.</p>
   <p>One of our necessities of life, without doubt, is the insurance policy; its possession is as important as having a garment or a warm inclosure in the winter time. He who does not have or follow this policy, also belongs to the category of light-minded people, who do not understand their personal wants.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0356.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A father who has a family and is not a possessor of this quality, either has poor regard for his family, or none at all. The father who respects his home, on the other hand, would see that it is provided for after his death, should it come unexpectedly.</p>
   <p>The loving wife and mother should look after her interest of the household in the same manner.</p>
   <p>Security for existence and provisions of insurance against the unexpected are of vital necessity.</p>
   <p>However, this question arises: where are we to find the proper insurance? In what company, or organization? Without taking this question into deep consideration, one would cause himself a grave wrong. By picking up a company, at random from the list, one can easily lose a great deal. The fact remains that there are two kinds of policies against the inevitable; one that gives full benefit and another that gives partial benefit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0357.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It would be foolish not to get the one that offers the most protection.</p>
   <p>Above all things, we must remember that when it comes to the safeguarding of one's family, we should not seek it among' strange gods.' We have our own Polish organizations that give as good a protection as the stranger's. The terms of the Polish organizations are much better.</p>
   <p>Has anyone heard of any other corporation besides the Polish offering assistance against strikes and other common mishaps? Never! Do these insurance companies offer aid to talented students who cannot afford to finance their career? Not at all. Do they try to see that we gain more influence in Chicago? Not in the least. When one does not meet the payment on the instalment date, one is suspended, ending a hopeful beginning.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0358.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Conditions are much different among Polish organizations. Those that belong to these companies not only derive substantial benefits, but also gain many other privileges. It would be a finer thing if we would take out life insurance policies among our own concerns. It would be to our advantage.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman Catholic Union is a typical organization that offers more than most other companies. Comparing the policies of this concern with that of others, will show the difference. The terms of the policy are more advantageous, whether the rates are higher, or the cash value of the policy lower, The P. R. C. U. is the only Polish organization that pays its members dividends. This year the fifth dividend was paid. Isn't this better for the member in a financial way?</p>
   <p>It is enlightening to know that the P. R. C. U. carries on a splendid work program among its members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0359.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It not only looks after the best of its own interest, but also after that of the members. It sincerely tries to run its business on the most economical basis. This in turn enables its clientele to benefit from its savings.</p>
   <p>Instead of investing in a bad policy, isn't it better to be more alert, make comparisons, then decide to take the best one? Instead of taking one somewhere else, wouldn't it be an advantage for our Polish Catholic people to take out insurance in the P. R. C. U?</p>
   <p>We have the obligation of loving our neighbors as we would ourselves. If we are insured and safe-guarded in the Polish Roman Catholic Union, because it is better for us, then we ought to tell others, of the benefits and influence them to join.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0360.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is our duty to inform our Catholic friends what our Polish organization stands for, how it is operated, along with its advantageous conditions. This would not only help the individual, but also bring the Polish forces into greater unity and security.</p>
