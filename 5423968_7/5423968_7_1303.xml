   <p>Compassion is one of the most noble characteristics of man. He who feels the misfortune of his fellow man, and hurries to his assistance when he is in need, is great in spirit, noble in heart, and worthy of respect. But a person cannot be considered a true philanthropist and benefactor of humanity who, after amassing several millions of dollars from several millions of his fellow citizens, gives a pittance to a welfare society or erects a library or some other public building, and thus gives himself good publicity. It is the man who quietly, and without attracting the attention of others, gives help, and shares his last few pennies with his fellow men, who really deserves the name of philanthropist.</p>
   <p>So it is even now, when we find poor workers making financial contributions for the needs of the less fortunate worker, deprived of employment, ill, and suffering <pb facs="5423968_7_1304.jpg" n="2"/>want. They share their last few pennies with those who are in need. Owners of huge fortunes hardly ever come to the aid of those who are in financial straits. The list of contributors is composed predominantly of less wealthy people. The needs here are so great, so pressing, that immediate help is necessary if thousands of poor people are to be prevented from suffering hunger and cold. This is especially true in this part of the season, when misery stalks abroad.</p>
   <p>And so, let those who are well fed and clothed, and have heated homes, rush with assistance to the needy and suffering. Let us contribute at least small donations as a fund for the poor, that they also may have a merry Christmas. Let a ray of good fortune and cheer greet the homes of those who are poor, ill, neglected, and worried. After all, we are human beings and we should feel the misfortune of our fellow men who have become desperate.</p>
