<title level="a">PROBLEM OF POLISH HALL AT BRADLEY STREET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Incidentally, we received a handbill in Polish, signed "Committee," announcing a political meeting at Walsh's hall on March 11. The meeting was held last Sunday, and its purpose was to secure supporters for Mr. Dahlman, candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>In this handbill the following statement appears: "The Polish hall, which was built by us Poles with our hard-earned money, is open only to the Freemason and Lutheran Ellert. Where is justice?"</p>
   <p>As there is only one large Polish hall at this settlement, that is, the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish hall at Bradley Street, and as there is an insinuation in this handbill that Polish meetings, political and social, are not permitted at this hall, which constitutes a serious charge against its management, therefore, we, the undersigned legal representatives of the committee in charge of the hall in question, submit the following explanation:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0834.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1) The hall in question was built by St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish and is its property. All parish activities, such as business sessions, parish meetings, school exercises, parish societies' gatherings, and theatrical performances are held there.</p>
   <p>2) Moreover, since this hall is very costly and must bring fair returns, it is rented to anyone who desires to hold gatherings there, regardless of nationality (and this stipulation does not exclude Poles), provided that these gatherings are lawful, decent, not degrading religion or morals, and that the party renting it complies with the stipulations made by the management of the hall.</p>
   <p>3) However, in this particular case, neither the committee supporting Dahlman's candidacy nor Mr. Dahlman himself did apply either to the committee in charge of the hall, to the parish office, or to any person for rental of this particular hall. No one was refused the use of the hall.</p>
   <p>This proves that the statement made in the announcement referred to should <pb facs="5423968_7_0835.jpg" n="3"/>not be considered truthful.</p>
   <p>Committee in charge of the Polish hall at Bradley Street.</p>
   <p>Jacob Mucha, president.</p>
   <p>T. Krolik, secretary.</p>
   <p>(Signed)  Jan Maca.</p>
