<title level="a">INCREASE DRIVE FOR CHRISTMAS FUNDS FOR UPPER SILESIA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Illinois and Indiana lodges of the Polish Army Veterans of America have taken upon themselves the task of securing larger funds for the destitute people of Upper Silesia before the advent of the Christmas season.</p>
   <p>We realize what it means to help unfortunate widows, children, and orphans of our own brothers, because we have seen many pitiful sights on American soil. Many of our young, brave men sacrificed their lives on the battlefields during the World War. Therefore, every effort shall be made to ease the pangs of hunger of those who are left without any means of succor.</p>
   <p>Brothers of Silesia, although we are faced with our own problems, <pb facs="5423968_7_0953.jpg" n="2"/>because of a shortage of money, we will furnish work and material help for your cause. Great plans are being made in Chicago to raise funds for Christmas.</p>
   <p>We feel confident that support will be given our drive and this aid will help to dry the tears of many unfortunate souls in Upper Silesia. Representatives of the Polish Army Veterans of America, members of the Upper Silesia Fund Committee, the press, and many of our representative individuals will gather to lay plans for this drive.</p>
   <p>Complete details of the plans and arrangements that are made at this goodwill conference will be published as soon as the announcements are completed.</p>
