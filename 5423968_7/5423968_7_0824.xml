   <p>Fellowmen:</p>
   <p>Five years have already elapsed since the time when the assembly of Polish citizens of Chicago, prompted by the sincere love for their fatherland and homage toward our hero, Casimir Pulaski, companion of Kosciuszko, who also fought for the liberty of this country, decided to erect a monument to him.</p>
   <p>One idea was added to another and it was decided to build a magnificent Polish national home, embellishing the front of this structure with the bust of our hero.</p>
   <p>This was done. The idea was supported greatly by everyone and today this beautiful home, the Pulaski Hall, stands and gives shelter to the Polish <pb facs="5423968_7_0825.jpg" n="2"/>minds and Polish songs. Our fellowmen gather here every evening, the Falcons and the Polish youth drill here with body and soul.</p>
   <p>In the early beginning the enthusiasm toward this affair was great. Fellowmen gave donations, lodged their small funds for the Pulaski Hall and we then thought that this monument which would be the great pride of our nation in America, would be easily paid for.</p>
   <p>But alas! there came hard times after the building of this structure had already begun, no one foresaw that this would happen. Banks began to fail, creating a financial panic that spread and is spreading to this day, people lost and are losing their entire wealth.</p>
   <p>Amidst these hard times, organizations are presenting fewer shows and other various festivities, the hall naturally remains vacant at all times, remains worthless. And now the interest on the bank loans must be paid up, shareholders must be paid out, debts on this or that have to be paid.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0826.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Expenses are becoming so much greater, the income decreasing each new day.... If it were the good old times, this monument of Pulaski would have been paid for by now without any financial struggle, we would not have to turn toward you people then in this financial need. But in the presence of the above-mentioned fact, in view of the fact that times are not getting any better, that the Polish colony in Chicago is poor, and also in the light of the fact that hundreds of thousands of our fellow-men are faced with unemployment, we are forced to make a plea to the generality of the nation, all the Polish organizations and societies in the United States, and cry in a loud voice:</p>
   <p>"Fellowmen! save the monument of our hero! Save the Pulaski Hall in Chicago!"</p>
   <p>We cannot permit this monument to slip from our Polish hands, and let the Jews or any other nationality gain possession of this. It would be disgraceful for us if this were admitted.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0827.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Pulaski monument in the hands of others, that would be disgrace for us!</p>
   <p>The Pulaski monument should and must be the possession of the Poles. We have a strong faith and also a strong conviction that you will not permit it to come to this, dear fellowmen, the degradation of our character in general.</p>
   <p>So we then turn toward you, fellowmen, in the name of our nation, in the name of the ones dearest to you, in the name of the honor that you have for the memory of Pulaski, save this monument! Your smallest offerings will be greatly appreciated. If only every Pole in America would set aside one cent toward this aim, the Pulaski Hall would be saved.</p>
   <p>We request all of the papers to publish our plea.</p>
   <p>Attention: Send your donations to: Vincent Jaworski, 861 South Ashland avenue. For ten-dollar shares in the Pulaski Hall, report to the secretary of the Pulaski Hall, Mr. S. Lauferski, 654 W. 18th place.</p>
