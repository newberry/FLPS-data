   <p>At today's meeting of a committee formed of representatives of Saint Michael Archangel Parish, it was agreed to make public the results of a massmeeting held for the purpose of raising money for the orphans and widows of the victims of the Latimer, Pennsylvania, miners massacre.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the list of donors is too long, we give here only the more significant details.</p>
   <p>At a meeting held on September 19, $7.70 was collected; J. Pawlicki and A. Niewolski collected $24.76; F. Przybylinski and J. Kajtaniak, $50.08; and P. Lulinski and A. Makowski $25.</p>
   <p>All told, a total of $107.54 was collected.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1328.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As you, dear brothers and sisters, can see from these results, the Poles in Chicago, in spite of hard times, not only had a heart but also gave as much as they could afford to help the orphans and widows of the innocently killed miners. However, the number of victims is large, and more money is needed.</p>
   <p>Perhaps we will be compelled to knock again at your doors and ask you for more assistance. We feel that the perpetrators of this crime will not escape the justice of the Lord, but we cannot let them escape the law of the people either. If this were to happen, it would be our fault. That is why it is imperative that more money be collected. Therefore, dear brothers, let us all join hands in this cause with the slogan "One for all, all for one."</p>
   <p>All those who wish to make further contributions should leave the money at the Saint Michael Parish Rectory.</p>
