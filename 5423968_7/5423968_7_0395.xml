   <p>General secretary warns all new members coming into the Polish Roman Catholic Union, that in making out their membership applications their correct age be given. Faulty registration deprives all such members of any benefits that may be derived.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman Catholic Union had to suspend several members for registering incorrectly. One member in particular, former President of the Polish Roman Catholic Union a lawyer Mr.Klemons J.Belinski, who forgot his birth date, met with this fate.</p>
   <p>After one of the unusual meetings which the Union had Mr.Belinski resigned his membership. Later he made an application for reinstatement October 13, 1899. In his application he gave his birth date as October 23,1854.</p>
   <p>When his birth certificate was submitted to the Polish Roman Catholic Union his correct date of birth was revealed as</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0396.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>October 2, 1853.</p>
   <p>Most of this incorrectness as to the date of birth was due principally to the rule limiting the age of admittance to the Polish Roman Catholic Union at 45 years.</p>
