  <body>
   <p>Perhaps the most opportune time to join the organization known as the "Polish Army Veterans Alliance of America" is the present, for the central body is holding a membership contest.</p>
   <p>Many of our comrades of the last war are under the impression that they can do more for themselves alone, and for that reason are not taking active part in social affairs--but they err. Life in America has definitely shown that belonging to an organization helps those who are seeking aid. Membership in such organization shows that one cultivates an interest in the affairs of society.</p>
   <p>Our organization was founded, after the return of the soldiers from the Polish armies, for the purpose of preserving military tradition, to promote self-help, and to assist the injured along the road to recovery, so that they may become self-supporting. The society publishes an illustrated monthly magazine which is filled with many interesting articles on military life, as well as with <pb facs="5423968_7_0102.jpg" n="2"/>items of educational import. The members sought are those who have a close and proud attachment to their late army services, for they are the ones who will work energetically to uphold the principles upon which this society was established.</p>
   <p>The membership fees are so nominal that there is no excuse for not joining....Therefore, in order to create a desire to join this organization, our friends are given herewith the day and place of meeting of the various posts, where application blanks for membership may be obtained:</p>
   <p>Post 2: First Wednesday of every month at 8 P. M., Slowacki's Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets.</p>
   <p>Post 5: Third Friday of every month at 8 P. M., K. Lacha's Hall, 1125 Noble Street.</p>
   <p>Post 9: Second Thursday of every month at 8 P. M., 2959 West 40th Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0103.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Post 10: Third Sunday of every month, Sokolnia Hall, 48th Court and 29th Street, Cicero, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Post 14: Second Sunday of every month, K. Marciniec' Hall, 2859 West 25th Street.</p>
   <p>Post 15: Third Sunday of every month, the Clubhouse, 1701 Massachusetts Street, Gary, Indiana.</p>
   <p>Post 28: Second Friday of every month, Hall 205, 115th Street, Kensington.</p>
   <p>Post 39: First Wednesday of every month, the Parish Hall, Lorel and Fullerton Avenues.</p>
   <p>Post 56: Second Friday of every month, Pulaski's Hall, Ashland Avenue and 18th Street.</p>
   <p>Post 90: Second Wednesday of every month, Sokolonia Hall, 1062 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0104.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Time and place of meetings of Post 40, in Hammond, will be given at a later date.</p>
   <p>You will benefit by joining the organization. It is well organized, and has been operating for more than seven years. It has always extended assistance to its members.</p>
   <p>Post 1 of the Polish Army Veterans' Alliance of America</p>
   <p>J. S. Cwik, president</p>
   <p>W. Kaczmarski, secretary</p>
