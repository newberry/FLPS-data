   <p>A special meeting was held last Sunday, at 4 P. M., at the Polish Hall on Bradley Street, to discuss the proposed fair for the benefit of the Polish hospital.</p>
   <p>At this meeting a decision was reached that the fair should be held next Saturday, January 13, at 7 P. M., at the Polish Hall on Bradley Street.</p>
   <p>Last night's meeting was the scene of great activity. Those who attended it were of the conviction that a Polish hospital was absolutely necessary and proceeded to name committees to take charge of the supervision of the fair. The following persons were chosen as members of the executive committee: Mr. A. Kowalski, Mr. T. Krolik, Mr. Albert Jedrzejek, Mr. Frank Wleklinski, and Reverend Vincent Barzynski. Mr. B. Klarkowski was chosen <pb facs="5423968_7_0540.jpg" n="2"/>secretary of the Fair. Ten cents will be charged for admission; combination tickets will cost 75 cents.</p>
   <p>The next meeting to discuss further arrangements will be held on Friday January 12, at the Bank Hall. Since the benevolent aim of this undertaking deserves the Poles' wholehearted support, we are positive that they will contribute towards the realization of this good work.</p>
