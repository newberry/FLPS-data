   <p>The installation of the newly elected officers of the Ladies' Society for the Protection of the Old People's Home took place on January 15 of this year. In spite of unusually cold weather a considerable number of members attended, some bringing their friends and acquaintances with them. All the guests enjoyed the affair very much. The new officers' oath was received by the Reverend J. Tarasiuk, chaplain of the institution and of the Society. In a short address he thanked the women for the assistance which they have given so far and encouraged them in their efforts on behalf of this poor but deserving institution.</p>
   <p>The new administration of the Ladies' Society for the Protection of the Old People's Home is as follows: Mary Neumann, president; Louise Szwajkart, vice-president; Eleanor Nowak, recording secretary; Gertrude Wronska, financial secretary; and Catherine Lakowka, treasurer. The ways and means committee is composed of Mrs. Z. Gorska and Mrs. B. Burda. On the welfare committee are Masdames R. Skummer, R. Drzymalska, H. Ratajczyk, W. Biedka, A. Markowska and <pb facs="5423968_7_0565.jpg" n="2"/>W. Drufke.</p>
   <p>As a further Christmas contribution to the treasury of this Society we must add five dollars received from Michael Nowak. May God bless you!</p>
