   <p>A great national massmeeting was held on February 16th in St. Hedwig's Parish, whose pastor is the Rev. J. B. Obyrtacz, C. R., president of the Educational Aid Department in the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. The chairman of the massmeeting was Ignatius Wroblewski, secretary-general of the Union. An elevating speech, among others, was rendered by the rector of St. Stanislaus College, the golden-voiced Rev. W.Zapala. About $2,500 was collected for Poland.</p>
   <p>St. Hedwig's Parish, under the active leadership of the patriotic and vigorous pastor, Rev. J. B. Obyrtacz, C. R., is showing an unusual interest in national affairs. At different times there are being held in the parish hall national massmeetings, entertainments, concerts, and not long ago the welcoming of Polish volunteers, and all of this directed with the intention of giving Poland the benefit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0963.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Everything we have said above serves the fact that St. Hedwig's Parish has already collected up to date $27,001.50 for the ten million dollar fund. The work in this direction does not stop. The ardent parishioners evince themselves as the most interested in the destiny of Poland. Among these are to be found many members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The Union is developing splendidly in this parish. The members of the societies are preparing themselves for agitation during the contest which begins the first day of March.</p>
