<title level="a">FORESTERS' SILVER JUBILEE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday the Polish Catholic organization known as the Order of Foresters celebrated its silver jubilee, that is, the 25th anniversary of its existence.</p>
   <p>The main celebration took place in Chicago, because it was here that the Order of Foresters originated, but groups in other towns and cities celebrated this great jubilee also.</p>
   <p>In our city, this jubilee celebration was held at the Coliseum, where beautiful speeches were given by prominent officials of the Order, as well as music and singing by prominent orchestras and choirs.</p>
   <p>The keynote speech was given by His Excellency Archbishop J. E. Quigley, who thanked this organization for its wonderful support of the Catholic religion. Besides Archbishop Quigley, Bishop Muldoon spoke about the tremendous number of people converted to the Catholic religion through <pb facs="5423968_7_0229.jpg" n="2"/>the help of the Foresters. Mr. T. H.Cannon, J. H. Seaslow, of Chicago; F. X. Bilidean of Quebec, and many others gave speeches. One of the main features of this jubilee was the choir of St. Adelbert, which sang many songs,among them the Polish anthem "Jeszcze Polska nie zginela" in Polish and English.</p>
   <p>Due to the great number of delegates from other towns and cities, the Coliseum was too small to accommodate all.</p>
   <p>The Order of Foresters was first organized in Chicago in the year 1883. Today it numbers 38,423 members and during its 25 years of existence it has paid to families of the deceased over eleven million dollars.</p>
   <p>The financial standing of this organization is good and strong, and it is expanding continuously.</p>
