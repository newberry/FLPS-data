<title level="a">OUR LADY OF DOLORS SOCIETY, AT ST. ADALBERT'S PARISH, IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>On January 1, 1879, an association, then known as The Sacred Heart of Mary Society, was formed at St. Adalbert's Parish, in Chicago. Its primary aim was to help maintain a Christian spirit among its members and to retain a close relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. The secondary purpose, but equally as important as the first, was to aid its members, or their families, in time of sickness, misfortune, or death.</p>
   <p>The first active members of this society were Messrs. Francis Szymanski and John Manna, who were also known as its first organizers. Until September 2, 1888, this society existed as an independent entity, not affiliating itself with any other larger organization.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, however, a certain tension developed in the society and entirely <pb facs="5423968_7_0323.jpg" n="2"/>unsavory and undesirable practices began among its members. Rev. John Radziejewski, the pastor of St. Adalbert's Parish, as a zealous spiritual leader, looked into these matters and, after admonishing the guilty parties, implored the members to conduct themselves in a manner befitting true sons of the Church, to behave in accordance with the principles and aims of this association.</p>
   <p>Despite this admonition, many members gave no heed to the plea. Those who were causing the greatest commotion withdrew and several others soon followed suit. This was done officially on September 2, 1888, when they refused to receive Holy Communion in the company of the society. In this way they openly indicated a severance between themselves and the unity of the Church.</p>
   <p>The result of this rift was that only eleven members remained to carry on the work. A staunch determination to remain faithful to the Church encouraged them to reorganize the society on that very same day. The names of these resolute <pb facs="5423968_7_0324.jpg" n="3"/>members were: John Manna, Joseph Bozyk, Ignacy Mankowski, Michael Pietras, Michael Andrzejewski, Stanley Andrzejewski, Theophilus Placzek, K. Dardaszewski, Joseph Sikora, T. Aniszewski, and Thos. Patt. A meeting was called at which Mr. John Manna was elected president. It was then decided to become affiliated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union Under The Auspices Of The Sacred Heart Of Jesus. Moreover, a change in the original name of the association itself to that of The Sacred Heart Of Our Lady Of Dolors Society was also agreed upon.</p>
   <p>An examplary unity and harmony reigned in the society from the time of its reorganization. The result of this is that its membership has now grown to seventy. Each member receives a sum of five dollars per month in time of illness. This is given as a relief measure. In the event of death, however, the family of the deceased member receives fifty dollars for funeral expenses and the society takes charge of the burial. In addition to all this, the association always assists its members in any type of serious and sudden need.</p>
   <p>The following members compose the administrative body of this association for <pb facs="5423968_7_0325.jpg" n="4"/>the fiscal year of 1892: Messrs. Ignacy Mankowski, president; Stanley Andrzejewski, vice-president; Andrew Obiala, recording secretary; John Malicki, collector and financial secretary; Ignacy Skorupa, treasurer; Michael Pelka, Joseph Bozyk and Francis Swiatowski, trustees; John Damski, Joseph Wajman and Martin Kasprzak, sergeants at arms; August Wezner, Francis Wezner, Martin Kolodziejski, John Kolodziejski, Anthony Stolpa, and A. Sitniewski, ensigns; and Matthew Cesarz, marshal.</p>
