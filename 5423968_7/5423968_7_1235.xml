   <p>Countrymen! The hour of action on the clock of history has at last struck for Poland after a century of subjection. Never in our history since the partitions has there been a more auspicious time than now for the realization of our ideal of an independent Poland. Neither have Polish lands ever been more ravaged by the horrible consequences of war. Death, hunger, and arson have taken over our unhappy land. Out of this hellish chaos some day our "new life" is to come to light.</p>
   <p>The four million Poles in America, in the face of this horrible tragedy, continue to behave as they have up to the present, with almost complete indifference. They waste time and strength on foolish polemics, unmindful of the fact that it is their lot in the first place to unite all their forces to bring active help to the mother country, which is breaking her chains!</p>
   <p>Will we not rouse ourselves from this shameful inactivity? Will we continue <pb facs="5423968_7_1236.jpg" n="2"/>to wallow in the mire of fraternal jealousy and back-yard quarrels? Never!</p>
   <p>It is our most sacred duty to speak up determinedly before the entire world for our unexpired rights, and at the same time to bring help to our countrymen in the homeland who have been deprived of food and shelter.</p>
   <p>To fulfill this duty we must all unite, regardless of differences of convictions, states and social classes!</p>
   <p>The Polish Central Relief Committee has united within itself practically all Polish organizations and the most prominent individuals from among the American Poles for the purpose of carrying through the most efficient united action for the cause of Poland's independence.</p>
   <p>He who believes in this sacred ideal and wants to serve loyally, let him join our ranks. There is room for all who love Poland whole heartedly, in deed as well as in word.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1237.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Our first problem is to collect a million-dollar relief fund.</p>
   <p>If we can just collect in a few weeks tens of millions of dollars, a way will be found--means and many willing hands--to roll away the stone from the grave of our mother country and to dry the tears of misfortune of millions of our brothers and sisters!</p>
   <p>Away with disunion and all sorts of political orientations! Active help for the homeland is our only aim! Strong in our unity let us dare to do great deeds. To action, Countrymen! Long live united independent Poland! (Signed) The Executive Committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee</p>
   <p>A. Karabasz, President</p>
   <p>P. Rostenkowski, Vice-president</p>
   <p>A. Neuman, Vice-president</p>
   <p>J. F. Smulski, Treasurer</p>
   <p>S. Osada, Secretary</p>

   <p>Notice: Mr. John F. Smulski, president of the Polish Bank in Chicago, was elected treasurer of the Polish Central Relief Committee. Mr. Smulski is known and respected throughout the United States and Poland. His name and responsible position give the best assurance that the funds under his control will reach their destination.</p>
   <p>Therefore, anyone who does not belong to any organization forming a part of the Polish Central Relief Committee, or who for any reason does not want to send his money to any of the six treasury centers established by these organizations, can send his contribution to the Relief Fund in care of Mr. John F. Smulski, President of the Polish Bank, 1201 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>All contributions will be acknowledged in all Polish papers in America.</p>
