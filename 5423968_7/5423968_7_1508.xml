   <p>A director's meeting of the Polish Welfare Association was held yesterday at which W. Bardonski, the first vice-president, presided.</p>
   <p>According to the financial report of the financial secretary it was shown that the Association had a $291.80 income thus far, and that the expenses amounted to $184.85, so that the sum of $106.65 remains in the treasury. in twelve cases of extreme poverty and need it was recommended to issue relief in amounts ranging from $2.00 to $7.50; the total sum recommended to be paid out was $56.50. The sum of $50.15, therefore, will remain in the treasury. Since the bills for several printings are not as yet paid, they must be paid shortly, consequently, such a small amount will remain in the treasury that it would not suffice even for the most urgent necessities of the ensuing month.</p>
   <p>A quarterly mass meeting will be held on the coming Sunday and it is hoped <pb facs="5423968_7_1509.jpg" n="2"/>that the quarterly membership dues will come in at that time. The administration of this association requests a most numerous attendance for this meeting, because the funds are exhausted and the needs are increasing. A request is also made to those who do not as yet belong to this association and have the feeling of obligation to offer aid for the needy and are in a position to bring this help, that they come to this meeting and enroll in the association. We will have an opportunity to mention more about this during the week.</p>
