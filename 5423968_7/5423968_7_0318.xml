   <p>We wish to request all members of the Polish Tailors' Society to attend the annual meeting, which will be held on August 7, at 1:30 P. M. We also want to encourage all tailors who do not belong to our society to take advantage of and attend this meeting. After familiarizing yourselves with the new constitution as well as convincing yourselves [after reading] the yearly statement of the activities and conditions of the Polish Tailors' Society, it is desired that you join and co-operate with us.</p>
   <p>This society, in spite of its many enemies, has faithfully performed its duties. It is true that most of the weaker members have resigned; but the smaller number remaining have endured.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0319.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And today, we can proudly say that this society is on the road to improvement.</p>
   <p>If, by the grace of God, we live to see it--working on the basis of the constitution of which we were so long deprived--in a year we should honestly and sincerely be able to say that the Polish Tailors' Society again stands strong. Therefore, tailors, embrace the ranks of your profession without delay. Every tailor who attends the coming meeting and is willing to join the society will be admitted for one dollar.</p>
   <p>Meetings are held in Mr. M. Majewski's Hall at 779 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>With brotherly regards,</p>
   <p>M. Zwierzchowski, president,</p>
   <p>Stephen Terczewski, secretary.</p>
