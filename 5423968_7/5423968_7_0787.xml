   <p>At the end of last week a new society was added to the ranks of our useful welfare organizations. The new society will fill a need which has been felt for a long time. We are speaking of the Welfare Society of St. Joseph's Home for the Aged in Avondale, conducted and supported with great sacrifice by the Franciscan Sisters.</p>
   <p>To form this new outpost of our welfare work, our most hard-working women, practically all of those whose names we run across in every good cause, in every public service, have united. They met at the office of our Home for the Aged on North Hamlin Avenue, and in the presence of Reverend Joseph Tarasiuk, whom they invited to be the chaplain of their society, solemnly promised to support the work of the noble sisters in charge of this only Polish refuge for our aged, whom age and fate have cast at the mercy of human kindness.</p>
   <p>It was decided to post a list of the founders of the society and to invite <pb facs="5423968_7_0788.jpg" n="2"/>as charter members all Polish women of good will, especially those living in Chicago and vicinity. The following women entered their names first on the list: Mary Neuman, Victoria Biedka, Louise Szwajkart, Anna Jozwiakowski, Valerie Gorski, Salome Jarka, Mary Kruszynski, Catherine Lakowka, Leocadia Kadow, Anna Switaj, Mary Wyzykowski, Anastasia Murkowski, Frances Czuj, Anastasia Wiedeman, Frances Lengowski, Helen Larkowski, W. Perlinski, Elizabeth Szczepanski, Anna Korzeniewski, Rosalie Skuner, Florence Kornatowski, Mary Osuch, Frances Masiak, Catherine Wasiewicz, Maryanne Dadey, Valentine Drufka, Maryanne Drufka, Anastasia Zalikowski, Elizabeth Zamorski, Frances Kunz, B. Hellmuth, Frances Klosowski, Harriet Turalski, and Clementine Dybala.</p>
   <p>By voluntary contributions a nice little sum was collected for the society's purposes. The following officers were elected: Mary Neuman, president; Louise Szwajkart, Anastasia Wiedeman, and Elizabeth Szczepanski, vice-presidents; Anna Switaj, recording secretary; Mary Kruszynski, financial secretary; Catherine Lakowka, treasurer. The following were elected <pb facs="5423968_7_0789.jpg" n="3"/>organizers for specific districts: Elizabeth Zamorski (St. Mary of Angels); Valerie Gorski (Irving Park); Valentine Drufka and Frances Lengowski (Avondale); Frances Masiak (Cragin); Frances Czuj (St. John Cantius); Salome Jarka (St. Stanislaus Kostka); Rosalie Skuner and Mary Osuch (St. Hedwig); Catherine Wasiawicz (Five Holy Martyrs). As the society develops further, organizers will be delegated to other districts and parishes.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of obtaining the sponsorship of municipal and state officials, a committee composed of the following women was appointed: Leocadia Kadow, Anna Korzeniewski, Valerie Biedka, and Anna Jozwiakowski.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the new society will be held on Tuesday, March 20, at 2 P. M., at St. Joseph's Home, 2649 North Hamlin Avenue.</p>
   <p>All Polish women willing to co-operate with this new welfare project are invited to become charter members. Further details can be obtained from <pb facs="5423968_7_0790.jpg" n="4"/>any one of the above-mentioned women, the Franciscan Sisters, or the Chaplain Reverend Joseph Tarasiuk.</p>
