  <body>
   <p>On January 1 the St. Josaphat Society celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding. At 8 A. M. Mass was celebrated in its honor. Kostki's orchestra played during the services. Schmit's "Mass" for four voices was sung.</p>
   <p>At 7:30 P.M., all the members attended Vesper Services, during which they sang Polish songs.....Prayer was offered to the Lord with the hope that it was received. The services were concluded with the song "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>The society now numbers 126 members. Its financial status is sound, as indicated by the nine hundred dollars in the treasury. Fourteen hundred dollars was paid out during the past year in death benefits (four members passed away).</p>
   <p>Every Roman Catholic Pole from eighteen to thirty-five years of age can become <pb facs="5423968_7_0247.jpg" n="2"/>a member of this growing organization. All Polish youths are invited to join. At the same time they will be helping themselves and others in the event of misfortune and sickness.</p>
   <p>Theophilus Kwidzinski, who has been re-elected president several times, has done a great deal for the development of this society.</p>
   <p>The parishioners of St. Josaphat Parish wish this society success and hope that its membership will be more than doubled during the coming year.</p>
