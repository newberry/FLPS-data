   <p>Members of the Kosciuszko Monument Association have adopted a resolution to send out an appeal to all Polish newspapers, societies, organizations, and groups, including business men and corporations, asking them to support the Association. Polish groups abroad will also be contacted.</p>
   <p>In every letter, a questionnaire and a self-addressed envelope will be included. The list of names is now almost complete, and by the end of this week the letters will be in the mail.</p>
   <p>In addition to its mail campaign, the Association is organizing a group of house-to-house solicitors. This has been done in order to intensify the campaign and at the same time get new members, since every member <pb facs="5423968_7_0079.jpg" n="2"/>of the group must belong to the Association. At present we need five new members for the Revision Commission. Candidates for this commission cannot qualify unless they are well known in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In order to increase the funds of the organization, the directors are planning to publish a memorial book, in which all prominent Poles will be listed, The book will also contain short biographies of artists, poets, musicians, heroes, and men of letters, as well as a historical sketch of Polish tradition and aphorisms. It will be illustrated with many pictures and artistic sketches. The Poles of America and Europe will be represented in this book, a reason why many prominent Poles are enthusiastic about it.</p>
   <p>"We hope that every Pole will support this cause and do his best to make <pb facs="5423968_7_0080.jpg" n="3"/>the ideals of this organization possible," stated Dr. Casimir Midowicz, secretary of the Kosciuszko Monument Association.</p>
   <p>According to the secretary's report, forty nine persons have already contributed $132.91. Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer, and Walter Nowaczewski contributed twenty five dollars each.</p>
