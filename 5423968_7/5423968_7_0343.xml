   <p>Because of the inclement weather last night the meeting of the Polish Welfare Association's board of directors was postponed. The few directors who were present decided that it would be advisable to hold the meeting next Friday at 7:00 P.M.. Important administrative matters are to be discussed.</p>
   <p>Although the meeting was attended by a small minority, a number of well-known Polish people came to join the society. This is a good indication that this organization is highly regarded by our people. It is apparent that the love-thy-neighbor spirit has not been extinguished in their hearts. The patriotic spirit has not only been revived but it has been spread.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0344.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This support is not only for the people, it is also for the support of God. It shows that the Polish people are banding more closely together. That class differences are being forgotten, that they are joining forces to help one main cause. And this is the preservation of their kind. They are only concerned with the welfare of the unfortunates.</p>
   <p>The beginning of this kind of work, like any endeavor, is difficult from the beginning, for the work bears no remuneration. But the love of the neighbor and the love for God has become a triumphant banner. This kind of work is of an altruistic nature and should be considered heroic.</p>
   <p>Whoever is working and offering his time gratis to fulfill the work of God: "Blessed is he that giveth, just as the one that receiveth," becomes <pb facs="5423968_7_0345.jpg" n="3"/>like unto God.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday a general meeting will be held by the Association at 4 P.M. All those interested in the procedure, purpose, and progress of the Welfare Society are invited to attend.</p>
   <p>The initial efforts and accomplishments will be revealed to the public. Many of its aspects will be open for discussion. The steps taken in the direction of helping the poor may be small, but since the inception of this service the purpose of it has been completely carried out. The future strides will be easier, bigger and better.</p>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to point out the biblical saying; "If you do not build the home, all the work for its preparation is wasted." And so it is with this organization. But the home was built and the work was fruitful.</p>
