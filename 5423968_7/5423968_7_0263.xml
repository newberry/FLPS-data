<title level="a">TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF SACRED HEART SOCIETY CELEBRATED AT ST. JOSEPHAT PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Sacred Heart Society of St. Josephat Parish celebrated its tenth anniversary Sunday, May 19.</p>
   <p>At 8 A.M. Mass was celebrated by the Reverend F. Lange, pastor of St. Josephat Parish, in honor of the society. During the course of the services Kostki's orchestra, engaged by the Society, played. A special quartet sang beautiful songs.</p>
   <p>This was indeed a surprise for the parishioners, because it had been a long time since an orchestra played in the church. It was more of a surprise since Mr. Kostki was engaged only a few days before the celebration. He conducted the orchestra superbly, much to the pleasure of the congregation.</p>
   <p>The radiant faces of the members of the Sacred Heart Society were sufficient <pb facs="5423968_7_0264.jpg" n="2"/>evidence of their happiness--and no wonder, harmony has always prevailed throughout the decade this society has been in existence, which gives evidence of further development of this model organization.</p>
   <p>The officers of this group did not stint on work or costs in order to make this tenth anniversary a memorable one in the parish. Credit has been rightfully earned by the members for their efforts in making this affair possible.</p>
   <p>Last night at 7:30 o'clock requiem vespers were celebrated, and this morning Mass was read for the dead members of the society.</p>
   <p>The Sacred Heart Society at present numbers 185 members; it has $900 in its treasury, and has paid out $600 in death benefits. Despite hard times and meager support, this society is forging ahead.</p>
   <p>The officers are as follows: Anthony Leznar, president (third term); Xavior Zielka, secretary (third term); Thaddeus Klein, treasurer. Mr. Klein has held <pb facs="5423968_7_0265.jpg" n="3"/>this post for nine years.</p>
   <p>All those who do not belong to any society are urged to join the Sacred Heart Society. No one will regret joining this Society, for its standard is happiness and protection.</p>
   <p>The staff of Dziennik Chicagoski wishes this society continued success for many years to come.</p>
   <p>Thanks are extended to Rev. Lang, the singers, both men and women, and Mr. [?] Bachinski.</p>
   <p>A member of the society</p>
