   <p>Yesterday in the presence of the censor it was unanimously decided to send money to all parts of Poland. Fifteen thousand dollars will be sent at once.</p>
   <p>Yesterday evening the department of independence of the Polish National Alliance held its meeting. Mr. A. Karabasz of Pittsburgh, censor of the Polish National Alliance, was present. All of the members of the central board of directors voted to send the money collected by the Independence Fund to Europe at once, in care of those committees which have been established there for the purpose of bringing relief to the poor widows and orphans left by the victims of the war, as well as to those suffering poverty in the various centers in which refugees have sought shelter.</p>
   <p>It was decided to send fifteen thousand dollars of the Independence Fund at this <pb facs="5423968_7_1208.jpg" n="2"/>time. The balance of the money collected and that which comes in later will be sent in installments.</p>
   <p>How The Funds Were Divided</p>
   <p>The fifteen thousand dollars which will be sent at once will be divided in the following just manner: five thousand dollars for the relief committee in the Kingdom of Poland; five thousand dollars for the relief committee in Galicia; two thousand dollars in care of the committee at Paris; two thousand dollars to the Polish-American Hospital in Warsaw; one thousand dollars to the relief committee at Vienna; and one thousand dollars to the relief committee for Hungary and Moravia.</p>
   <p>In view of the above decision of the central board of directors of the Polish National Alliance, there remains nothing for us to do but appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters in the Alliance, not to be lazy but to continue to collect <pb facs="5423968_7_1209.jpg" n="3"/>funds and contributions wherever possible, in order that we may show that the Alliance is always first to dry the tears of the poor and orphaned, always first to aid the homeland.</p>
   <p>Now at last there will be an end to the talk that the money is lying about in Chicago. The department of independence has given the first impulse to the sending of aid. Now other Polish centers and funds will follow its example. But let the Alliance, which first pointed the way, show that it can soon send another appreciable sum. This will happen when the army of 100,000 Alliance members gets to work with enthusiasm and follows the guide posts of the founders, who said, "We are willing to sacrifice everything for our homeland and for our brothers across the sea."</p>
   <p>Therefore to work, members of the Alliance, to sincere hard work in unison!</p>
