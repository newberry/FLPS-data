   <p>The Venerable Franciscan Sisters attached to the Guardian Angel Orphanage gave a surprise party on Thursday, August 22, 1918, in honor of the Reverend Louis Grudzinski's name day. Father Grudzinski is pastor of St. John the Divine's parish. When the reverend pastor arrived at the Orphanage, he was led triumphantly into a large, beautifully decorated hall. Here many valuable gifts and baskets of flowers were presented to the priest. After first extending their congratulations to the reverend pastor, the children of the Orphanage sang several beautiful Polish pieces. After this the St. Cecilia choir and the St. Hedwig Choir, both of St. John the Divine's Church, under the direction of Mr. F. Malinowski, its organist, sang in honor of the priest. In conclusion Father Grudzinski thanked everyone who had participated in the affair and had helped to make it a success. After these ceremonies the guests repaired to another hall, where an appetizing banquet awaited them. The food was prepared by the venerable Franciscan Sisters and served by ladies of the White Cross group, whose president is Mrs. A. Misiewicz. Among those present at the table of honor were the Reverend L. Grudzinski, guest of honor, the Reverend Francis Karabasz, pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus parish, the Reverend Fathers Stephen Bubacz, Stephen Szczepanski <pb facs="5423968_7_0570.jpg" n="2"/>and John Stoinski, assistant pastors of St. John the Divine's parish, Mr. and Mrs. Bruno Kowalewski, Mr. and Mrs. Roman Kowalewski, and Mr. and Mrs. J. Janicki.</p>
   <p>When the banquet was concluded, the guests returned to the main hall and spent the remainder of the evening listening to songs and instrumental music. The affair will long be remembered with pleasure by all who were present.</p>
