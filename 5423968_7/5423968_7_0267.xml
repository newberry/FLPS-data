<title level="a">FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE POLISH ROMAN CATHOLIC UNION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A statement of the financial report of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, from August 15 to December 1, has been received by our office.</p>
   <p>The report shows that since the Polish Roman Catholic Union's convention in Cleveland, 380 members have joined the organization, which brings the total number of members paying assessments to 9,270. During the same period, 905 members, of whom 590 were from Detroit, were dropped from the record, which brings the total, as of December 1, 1894, to 8,745 (sic). Eight new societies joined the organization, namely: one from Berea, Ohio, another from Mt. Pleasant, and six from Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0268.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The income for the past year amounted to $27,103.56. The expenses reached $21,488.49. A balance of $5,615.49 (sic) remains in the treasury. Most of the outlay was in the form of death benefits, which were as follows: 21 widows received $12,600, and 22 widowers received $6,600. According to the statement, the organization is growing stronger every day in spite of the fact that over one hundred members who were unable to pay were dropped from the books during the past quarter, and in spite of the fact that two new unions have been organized, in Detroit and Bay City, Michigan. The present economic donditions, along with the rise of two new unions, could have easily ruined any other organization not so strong as the Polish Roman Catholic Union Under the Guidance of the Blessed Heart of Jesus.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that when the present depression is over this organization will be once more on the road to constant and prosperous growth.</p>
