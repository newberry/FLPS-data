<title level="a">THE POLISH ARMY VETERANS' MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last night a second meeting took place in the library of the Polish Women's Alliance preparatory to a campaign for the benefit of the "Invalid Hallerczyks". [Translator's note: Hallerczyk is a name given to Polish army veterans from America who in the World War, after being rejected by the American Army, enlisted in the Polish Army then being formed in Canada. These Poles were, according to the letter of the law, alien enemies, born either in the German or in the Austrian part of Poland. They all served in France and later in the Poland under General Haller. After helping to defeat Russia in 1920, most of these Polish-American volunteers returned to America, many of them invalids because of wounds or sickness. Any soldier who served under General Haller was called, in Polish, a Hallerczyk, pronounced Hallerchik.]</p>
   <p>As we all remember, only a few short years ago we sent thousands of young men <pb facs="5423968_7_0885.jpg" n="2"/>to fight, volunteers in the Polish army then being formed. We bade the volunteers farewell with sumptuous dinners, marched with them, with bands playing, to the railroad stations, and solemnly promised to take care of them after their return from the war.</p>
   <p>After the war, in which they fought terrible battles, not all returned in sound health; some of them died on the field of battle, and others were wounded and are unable to work. The Polish Army Veterans' Association is taking care of them to the best of its ability, but its meager funds are insufficient to support them all. This is the reason why a great campaign to raise funds for the benefit of the invalid Hallerczyks will be started next March. We sincerely hope that there will not be a single Pole who will refuse an offering for this noble purpose. The executive board of the Polish Army Veterans' Association has sent Mr. Nastala to manage this campaign with the help of our pastors and local committees; these will collect offerings, visiting homes, stores, and factories.</p>

   <p>Mr. Nastala remarked yesterday that eight hundred letters were sent to Polish leaders in Chicago asking them to attend this meeting, but only twenty persons came.</p>
