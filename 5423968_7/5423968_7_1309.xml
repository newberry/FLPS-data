   <p>Philanthropy is indeed a sublime virtue. A philanthropist is a person who loves his fellowmen and shares what he has with them.</p>
   <p>To be a philanthropist it is not necessary to be wealthy; a poor person who has compassion for the suffering of others and who is willing to share his last piece of bread with his brother, is the best example of philanthropy.</p>
   <p>We know many poor people who help the needy at every opportunity; they go so far as to even deny themselves of a piece of bread so that it may go to a hungry mouth.</p>
   <p>Whenever a collection is taken for a charitable purpose, the poor contribute more than the wealthy. Even though there is little they can do about it, the <pb facs="5423968_7_1310.jpg" n="2"/>poor feel the misery of their fellow-men and never fail to do their share in helping with small donations. By helping in this manner, they feel the satisfaction that they have done their duty toward their neighbors.</p>
   <p>According to statistics, in New York, the city of multi-millionaires, the poor have contributed more to charity than the rich. It is true that occasionally a millionaire will give a few thousand dollars for some philanthropic purpose, but, in most cases this is done for publicity or to promote business, not because of his Christian love of a neighbor. Such people are as heartless as a stone. Each step they take must bring them a profit. They figure in advance what they will gain through the publicity of their donation. The publicity given them in newspapers, together with the praises of the public, feeds their vanity.</p>
   <p>American millionaires do not direct their philanthropy toward the element among whom it would do the most good. It is true, that some of them do spend large sums of money for good causes, but they forget the very people <pb facs="5423968_7_1311.jpg" n="3"/>who through their labor made it possible for them to get rich. In New York and Chicago, the wealthiest cities in the country, a great number of families suffer from starvation and cold. The millionaires do not help them; they are too busy making money to pay any attention to the poor. Millionaires such as Rockefeller and Carnegie give millions of dollars to universities and libraries, but they forget the misery of the thousands of workingmen whose hard labor made their millions possible. The building of universities and libraries is no doubt a noble deed, but feeding the hungry is more important. What benefit can a workingman derive from a library built by Carnegie, when only the privileged class can use it? An underpaid, ill-clad, and undernourished laborer, working long hours for the philanthropist who built the library, cannot take advantage of it, because he is too tired and too hungry to think of anything but his stomach.</p>
   <p>The son of a poor laborer cannot attend a university built by Rockefeller because he has to go to work as soon as he is old enough to help support <pb facs="5423968_7_1312.jpg" n="4"/>his poor family. When the head of a family finds himself sick, who will help him? Of what benefit to the workingman are university and library buildings?</p>
   <p>Such great philanthropists should first supply the workingman with bread, and then feed his mind with knowledge; they should lift the working people from degradation and misery; they should protect the workingman against unemployment and sickness; they should make it possible for the working-man's children to get an education. But such benefactors as Carnegie and Rockefeller do not care for this kind of philanthropy; they would run short of the working mules which they exploit so unmercifully. In their opinion, helping the downtrodden would not bring honor and glory, but spending a few million dollars for a building would bring much publicity and immortalize their names as founders.</p>
   <p>This is not philanthropy, but repugnant hypocrisy.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1313.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let us honor the real philanthropist, the humble person who quietly shares his last piece of bread with a hungry fellow-man, even though no one talks or writes about him.</p>
