   <p>Last Sunday, a special Christmas night was tendered the children of the Good Shepherd Parish by the men's Freedom of the Fatherland Society, group 1574, and Women's Star of Freedom Society, group 2340, P.N.A. The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>S. Peszynski, chairman of the committee, opened the event with an introductory speech. He called on Mary Majka, president of the women's group and Secretary Sierocinski to take a bow. Then the orchestra composed of young men of the men's group, began to play. An American and Polish hymn was played. This was followed by a classical dance, rendered by Miss Elizabeth Jerz; she was accompanied on the piano by Miss L. Mikrut.</p>
   <p>John Mikrut, president of the Freedom of the Fatherland Society, gave an historical sketch of his organization. A speech based on the theme that the Polish youth should foster its mother tongue was given by F. L. Majka, well-known real estate man.</p>

   <p>The monologue executed by the students of the Alliance College, Alex Kutta and John Baran, was well received by the audience. This was followed by a talk by Alexander Kutta. A puppet show, based on the Bethlehem scene, was staged by P.N.A. group 2448, under the direction of Mr. Makowan.</p>
   <p>The role of Santa Claus was portrayed by Joseph August. Children belonging to the minor groups of the P.N.A. were called from a list by the secretary. A long line of these was formed and each received a gift from smiling Santa. Over 220 gifts were given out. Not one child left the hall without a gift.</p>
   <p>The seventy-five children that were associated with the minor groups received the following gifts: Boys' watches; girls' watches, handbags and accessories. Some of them also received letters from several building loan banks.</p>
   <p>The committee was composed of the following members:</p>
