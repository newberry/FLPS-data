   <p>There is probably no subject so often discussed in our conversations or press as generosity for national purposes. Especially during the present times we hear and read everywhere--wherever Polish hearts beat--appeals for generosity for the homeland. It would seem that the result of these appeals should be impressive and should be in keeping with the importance of the times and the purpose. Unfortunately up to the present the exact opposite has been true. Why? Because we have neither a proper comprehension of generosity, nor a profound understanding of the importance of the times and the sacredness of the cause.</p>
   <p>Many of us look upon generosity for the national cause as upon ordinary charity, which is expressed by the giving of alms to a beggar. Therefore, when even a wealthier Pole, at a mass meeting or some other occasion, tosses a <pb facs="5423968_7_1189.jpg" n="2"/>dollar into the Independence Fund collection plate he imagines that he has fulfilled his obligation in respect to the homeland, and on returning home goes to sleep calmly, with the sleep of the just, and of course--the generous.</p>
   <p>It is exactly this failure to understand the difference between ordinary charity and generosity toward the homeland that is the main cause of the meager results from collecting funds to save our mother country (which is falling with horrifying speed into the abyss of poverty and despair.)</p>
   <p>Charity is an act of a more or less deeply felt love for one's neighbor and, as such, depends solely on the good will of the individual. In accordance with the dictates of his heart and character he can, but does not have to, react to human misfortune in a specifically defined manner. He has, in this respect, complete freedom of evaluation and conviction, and considers, in accordance with universally accepted ideas, every good deed performed in this field as an act of benevolence.</p>
   <p>Generosity for the homeland is another matter entirely. Here there can be <pb facs="5423968_7_1190.jpg" n="3"/>no thought of any sort of benevolence or free evaluation of a given situation. The homeland asks for help, and all of us without exception are obliged to answer this call. Countries having their own governments do not ask whether their citizens want to sacrifice their lives and property in their defense but, in case of necessity, use the lives and property of their citizens at will.</p>
   <p>For us, who do not have our own government, generosity for the homeland is a stronger obligation because it is only a moral one. From such an obligation, none of us who bears a Polish name and considers himself a Pole can free himself.</p>
   <p>We must once and for all understand that the days when "one was free to do as he liked in Poland" are gone forever; that since we desire the independence of our homeland, at the time of its greatest misfortune we must show our moral strength, which depends on our ability to subject ourselves absolutely to the moral obligations which the moment dictates to us.</p>
   <p>Such an example has been given us by the Poles in Galicia. Although we are <pb facs="5423968_7_1191.jpg" n="4"/>far from agreeing with the so-called "Austrian orientation" guiding Galician politics, nevertheless we must bow before the truly unsurpassed generosity which people there have shown, in the belief that they are serving the cause of the independence of the homeland.</p>
   <p>In a country ruined by defeats and long mobilization, oppressed by unusually heavy taxes, and, thanks to the Austrian system of government, almost entirely deprived of commerce and industry--several million crowns were donated in a few months for the needs of the homeland! Everyone--from the poorest laborer to the few magnates--laid on the altar of the sacred cause, everything that he could; wedding rings and family keepsakes were not rare in this beautiful treasury of Polish sacrifice.</p>
   <p>These were generous deeds!</p>
   <p>We here in America, on the other hand, have only a great many pretty speeches and empty phrases!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1192.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The collection of several thousand dollars during several months from the penny contributions of the hardest-working people--for the most part members of the Polish National Alliance--is a praiseworthy example of the famous generosity of the three million Poles in America. But where are our financial experts, our bankers, and all types of businessmen who have hundreds of thousands of dollars at their disposal?</p>
   <p>In the lists and receipts of contributions of all the treasury centers, one sees only the small, dollars-and-cents donations of poor people. Only one moderately wealthy Polish businessman in all America has contributed five hundred dollars. Honor to him for it!</p>
   <p>The rest obviously are all philanthropists who by graciously tossing the homeland small alms want to squirm out of their sacred duty of generosity.</p>
   <p>Transfer yourselves in thought, all you gentlemen who are miserly in your contributions for the homeland, to this unfortunate Poland where hunger and <pb facs="5423968_7_1193.jpg" n="6"/>death reign supreme. Picture these hundreds of thousands of Polish families without a roof over their heads during the hard winter months, dying without rescue from cold and hunger!</p>
   <p>Christmas is coming, this happy day for all who have known the warmth of the family fire. You here in America will celebrate it in joy and plenty. But over there in Poland on Christmas day itself Death and Hunger will reap their greatest harvest.</p>
   <p>American ships are carrying millions of presents to the Belgians, but no one-- not even her own sons across the sea--wants to remember poor martyred Poland.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance was the first to decide to send Poland before Christmas fifteen thousand dollars from the funds amassed so far. This, however, is only a drop in the ocean of destitution which covers all of Poland. Let all wealthier compatriots contribute within the next few days as much as they can afford--not as alms, but as a dutiful offering. An appreciable Christmas present will be formed, which, at least in some measure, will <pb facs="5423968_7_1194.jpg" n="7"/>lighten the terrible lot of our brethren in the homeland and will rescue more than one soul from death by starvation.</p>
   <p>Deeds are needed over there, not words!</p>
