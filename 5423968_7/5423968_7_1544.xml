<title level="a">POLISH WELFARE ASSOCIATION HOLDS IMPORTANT MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Fifty-five Poles joined the ranks of the Polish Welfare Association yesterday [during the latter's meeting] at the Polish Hall, Bradley street near Noble. A large crowd had gathered at this meeting to hear the proposals of the Welfare Committee. The new members volunteered their help after the committee explained the conditions prevailing among the Polish poor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Lord Christ said: You shall always have the poor among you. These words have come to pass over and over again everywhere. In hamlets and cities, the poor are always found. However, the number of needy families is always greater in large metropolitan areas, and our beloved city of Chicago is not an exception to the rule.</p>
   <p>Kind-hearted people cannot remain indifferent to the hardships of their brothers; therefore, they join forces to assist the poverty-stricken fight the dark, lean days. The Poles in this city have not stood back, but have <pb facs="5423968_7_1545.jpg" n="2"/>organized their own forces to solve this problem. A committee was chosen to draw up plans, meetings were held, and the problems were presented to the people. This activity brought out the fact that, through collective cooperation by voluntary donations of money, goods, and services, and through the spreading of cheer and hope, much can be accomplished to wrest the people from the clutches of uncertainty. Mothers, children, and widows, the sick, and the aged will be spared the shame of begging in the streets.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting showed a gratifying response. The enlistment of fifty-five members is only a beginning, just an impetus for others to join.</p>
   <p>Publication of the activities of this organization will bring those unable to attend this or the previous meeting in contact with the crying need of our less fortunate people. This appeal for help, this effort to quiet the uncertainty of the poor will soften the hearts of our prosperous element. The ranks of the generous will swell from a hundred to a thousand, possibly into thousands. Having no multimillionaires or millionaires in our files, <pb facs="5423968_7_1546.jpg" n="3"/>we do not expect any large sums of money to fill the empty coffers of this welfare organization. But our people are rich in Christian love, tenderness, and hospitality. They are fond of the words of Christ: whatever you have done to the unfortunate brothers in their need, you have done unto me.</p>
   <p>What we need now is to have all the kind-hearted gather at the next meeting, to be held this coming Sunday at 4 P. M., so that they may join the ranks of those who have offered to help this cause.</p>
   <p>The help of the businessmen, property owners, and our prominent citizens will be valuable to our cause. The dollar that they may contribute to the fund for the poor is not so important as their vote and opinion. On February 14, the meeting will finish a discussion on the constitution [of the society], and a vote will be taken concerning the adoption of certain amendments. The suggestions of our prominent citizens, therefore, will be of great help in this respect.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1547.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This meeting is not being held for the sole purpose of obtaining money. A matter of greater importance, the continuation of this work and the materialization of plans to put this association on a sound foundation is the main issue. The money contributed will serve a two-fold purpose to the donor: it will be a sacrifice of money to help save the needy, and a sacrifice to God, Who places this upon the altar of love for the poor.</p>
   <p>Let us all join this noble cause. Remember the words of Jesus: Come, blessed children of my Father, and share the kingdom set aside for ye since the dawn of time.</p>
   <p>Please bear in mind that the pockets of the indolent, false beggars, parasites, and traveling hoboes will not be bulging with these donations. Only those in urgent need will get assistance. In order to get this help, the recipients must be residents of this city.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1548.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A committee is needed to warn the people against misleading advertisements in which the claim is made that Chicago is a Mecca for those in need of work. Chicago, like any other city, is facing an unemployment crisis. People of long standing in this city and familiar with the English language, who besides being skilled tradesmen are intimate with influential people, have difficulty in getting work. The many beggars and unemployed that fill the streets are a good example [of the crisis now prevailing in Chicago].</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the Poles living in the Northwest Side will set a memorable example by joining this cause and offering their aid without being asked. In a short while, as the number of good-hearted people be increased on the rolls of the welfare association, the poor will be salvaged from their penurious state. The donations will be recognized by God as a token of good will to all men. The honor of our Polish people in this rapidly growing city will be saved. Their cooperation will long be remembered and the Poles will become a fine example of immigrants.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1549.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>There is no charge to attend the meeting next Sunday. To become members, those desiring to help the poor will contribute a dollar to this charitable organization. Members will have their name published in the paper. At this meeting, to be held in the new Polish Hall, a board of directors will be elected.</p>
