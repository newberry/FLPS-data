  <body>
   <p>Of the English-language newspapers, only one, the Examiner, is occupied with the notorious matter of the deficit found in the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy has already presented an extensive explanation of this matter. The information was forwarded to the Dziennik Zwiazkowy by the president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz. We cannot follow in the footsteps of some of the other Polish newspapers and repeat every type of rumor circulated over the city. Being unable to ascertain the truth or falsity of every rumor, we would not want to harm a Polish organization by presenting whatever might come to someone's mind. Those Polish-Americans who trusted their leaders, and did not worry about making certain that order existed in their organization, have been punished sufficiently for their gullibility. It is therefore improper to create a panic among brethren in the Polish Roman Catholic Union by writing extensively, and in a sensational manner, about this sad state of affairs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0193.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The English-language newspaper the Examiner writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"The deeper the attorneys, experts, and officials of the Polish Roman Catholic Union look into the mysterious deficit of approximately eighty-seven thousand dollars, the more mysterious this matter appears. It is probable that this matter will be aired in the courts, although the type of court action to be instituted has not been decided.</p>
   <p>"It is a general tendency to consider Ostrowski responsible for others, not morally but legally. Mr. Ostrowski has been the treasurer of the Polish Roman Catholic Union for the past eleven years, and yet he did not keep any financial record of the organization.</p>
   <p>"Judging from the statement made by Mr. N. L. Piotrowski, the attorney for the Polish Roman Catholic Union, one may deduce that every indictment of Mr. Ostrowski will also be an indictment of L. Szopinski, the former president, and T. Krolik, the former secretary of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0194.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"'If Mr. Ostrowski fails to cover the entire shortage himself,' Attorney Piotrowski stated, 'I will be compelled to take legal action. I do believe, however, that Mr. Ostrowski's fault is not as great as that of the former officials, whom he trusted. Every court action undertaken by me will be combined with a demand from the others to present figures!'</p>
   <p>"Mr. Ostrowski's daughter, Mrs. W. Czaja, of 1447 Gibson Street, who was her father's secretary and bookkeeper, makes the following statement:</p>
   <p>"'Szopinski, Krolik, and my father had a misunderstanding last year while at the convention at Cleveland. My father did not wish to be a candidate on the same ticket with them. My father was elected and they lost. They have spoken ill of my father and threatened him with revenge.</p>
   <p>"'My father asked them frequently to make an accounting, but all to no avail. Mr. Frank M. Fairfield, father's attorney, discovered that one of the former officials of the organization had a checkbook without duplicates. This <pb facs="5423968_7_0195.jpg" n="4"/>official had the habit of taking money out of the bank at the organization's expense. In this manner a considerable sum of money was probably taken, but many checks are missing.'"</p>
   <p>Mr. Ostrowski's bond, it is believed, assures the Polish Roman Catholic Union against loss.</p>
