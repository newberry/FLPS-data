   <p>During the past four years the people of America, especially the Poles, have experienced trying times. How many people have taken their lives because of lack work--lack of bread? This is a sad thing to say but it is true, and present-day conditions are even worse.</p>
   <p>Of the hundred and fifty thousand Poles in Chicago, mostly of the working class, a majority find themselves in dire circumstances. How many families are suffering from cold and hunger? Over one half of the Polish population has no means by which to clothe itself--often going about begging. Similar situations are few in American annals. It is not a rare thing to find a family sustaining itself for a day or even for a week on a loaf of stale bread that it has managed to get or find....unclad children trying to keep warm by the waning fire in the stove.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1364.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One cannot look upon such conditions with indifference; one cannot wait for better times, but must, as quickly as possible, offer assistance to these destitute families who from day to day live in hunger and cold.</p>
   <p>At a meeting arranged by program committees of Polish societies on January 16, A. X. Centella made a motion to appoint a committee to collect contributions for the poor. The motion was unanimously adopted and the following were chosen:</p>
   <p>A. X. Centella, president, 43 Chapie Street,</p>
   <p>Edwin M. Dyniewicz, secretary and treasurer, 552 Noble Street,</p>
   <p>Jacob Slowikowski, 13 Crittenden Street,</p>
   <p>J. Kempczenski, 49 Emma Street,</p>
   <p>Nikodem Polcyn, 297 Wabansia Avenue,</p>
   <p>Alexander Nagawiecki, 458 Noble Street,</p>
   <p>M. Moszczynski, 87 W. Division Street.</p>
   <p>The above committee will make a list of all contributors, and their donations will be acknowledged in the local Polish papers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1365.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Through the mediation of Mr. Centella, the committee came to an understanding with the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, and certificates are going to be issued to needy families and individuals, signed by the president and secretary of the above-mentioned Polish relief committee. The Chicago Relief and Aid Society will act upon the presentation of these certificates and assistance will be given to the person or persons presenting them.</p>
   <p>Certificates may be obtained by calling on the secretary, Edwin M. Dyniewicz, 552 Noble Street.</p>
   <p>It is anticipated that the Poles of Chicago and vicinity will support this drive to give succor to their destitute compatriots. Both material and financial help, no matter how small, will be gladly welcomed by the secretary. Act today! Your penny may aid some unfortunate family.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Committee,</p>
   <p>Edwin M. Dyniewicz,</p>
   <p>Secretary and Treasurer.</p>
