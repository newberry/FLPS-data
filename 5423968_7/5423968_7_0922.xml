   <p>The Polish-American Veterans of the Polish Army of America are sponsoring a Christmas Kermess in order to raise funds for the widows and orphans who have been rendered destitute because of the rebellion in Silesia in which the best part Upper Silesia went to Poland.</p>
   <p>Those of the Committee who have been asked to assist in this drive are trying their best to make this campaign a success, however, their work will only be partly done if they will not receive whole-heartedly the support of our people. In order to make this drive a success, the following plea is made to the Polish mothers who are <pb facs="5423968_7_0923.jpg" n="2"/>requested to participate with their entire families:</p>
   <p>Above all, we are turning to the Polish mothers who are planning to purchase toys for their children to buy these and other articles at the Christmas Kermess, for here will be found a variety of Polish-made goods.</p>
   <p>The purchase of Polish-made goods will serve a twofold purpose: first, it will aid the orphaned children and widowed mothers whose husbands have lost their lives during the Silesian insurrection; second, it will aid Polish industry.</p>
   <p>This invitation is made to the mothers because we feel that they have a better feeling and understanding of the sad plight of the poverty-stricken mothers of Upper Silesia, that they know best how to influence <pb facs="5423968_7_0924.jpg" n="3"/>others to participate in so noble a cause.</p>
   <p>If we took into consideration the sacrifice of those Polish men who saw an opportunity to get a part of Silesia that was falling into German hands, took arms, and boldly fought until their last drop of blood ran out, we would not hesitate to lend our support in this drive. We must remember that these valiant Polish men gave up their lives so that Poland and her people would have possession of a territory that was once hers. These soldiers forsook their families and homes, a grand sacrifice indeed, for the benefit of Poland.</p>
   <p>We anticipate without any doubt that the Polish people of Chicago and vicinity will eagerly participate in the Kermess, which will start December 11 and will continue until December 18, at the large <pb facs="5423968_7_0925.jpg" n="4"/>hall of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Milwaukee and Augusta Streets.</p>
   <p>At the offices of the Polish National Committee, a meeting was held last night relative to organizing a group of salespeople to sell toys at the bazaar and other details pertinent to selling toys.</p>
   <p>The Fair will officially open next Sunday at 5 P.M., and continue until 11 P.M. A Silesian Nights program will be given by District 2 of the Sokol Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>The firms that are to take part in this program are requested to have their goods delivered at Union hall not later than Saturday, December 10 between 3 and 5 P.M. Miss Milewska and Miss Neuman <pb facs="5423968_7_0926.jpg" n="5"/>will give out signed receipts for goods received.</p>
   <p>Saturday evening at 7 o'clock, a general meeting of the Christmas Kermess Committee of the Polish-American Veterans will be held. At this meeting, final instructions about the conduct of the Kermess will be given and discussed. Questions will also be answered.</p>
   <p>A last plea is made to the merchants to have their goods delivered before Saturday, the zero hour being 5 P.M.</p>
