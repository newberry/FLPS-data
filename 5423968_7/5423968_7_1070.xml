   <p>The Clothing Committee organized for the purpose of supplying clothing to our suffering brethren in Poland was one year old last February.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the energetic work of our Polish women in Chicago and other cities and to the generosity of our people, the Clothing Committee has sent three shipments of shoes and clothing to our unfortunate brethren abroad.</p>
   <p>The first shipment was sent to France, in care of Miss Mary Miczkiewicz, for distribution among Polish prisoners interned there. It consisted of five cases containing 481 pieces of clothing for women, 195 for men, 74 for boys, 108 for girls, 321 for children, and 166 mixed--a total of 1,345 pieces, representing a wholesale value of $760.</p>
   <p>The second shipment, also sent to France, consisted of 652 pieces of clothing for women, 106 for men, 19 for boys, 39 for girls, 249 for children, 12 mixed, <pb facs="5423968_7_1071.jpg" n="2"/>and 2,500 cakes of soap--a total of 3,575 pieces, representing a value of $675.</p>
   <p>In November, in response to a letter from the Polish Relief Committee in Irkutsk, Siberia, the Clothing Committee sent thirteen cases containing 954 pieces of clothing for women, 1,154 for men, 175 for boys, 59 for girls, 486 for children--a total of 2,827 pieces valued at $2,710. This shipment, which contained more than 600 pairs of shoes, was distributed among Polish refugees in Siberia. These refugees, after being forced out of Poland, were suffering from cold and hunger.</p>
   <p>All together, 7,717 pieces of clothing, representing a value of $4,145, were sent.</p>
   <p>Thanking all the Polish women for their generous and productive work, and the people in general for their generosity, the Clothing Committee asks for their continued support of its relief work.</p>
