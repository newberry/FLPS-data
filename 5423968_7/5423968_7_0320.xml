   <p>The St. Joseph's Youth Society held its semi-annual meeting on Tuesday, August 2. The president, Mr. Stephen Konkel, opened the meeting with the Lord's Prayer, after which he called upon the secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting. They were approved and were then signed by the president. Mr. Joseph Golubski applied for membership in the Society. The president then called for the report from the financial committee. The accounts were found to be in good order. The committee rendered a statement of income and expense. The semi-annual income, was $323,65; the semi-annual expenses, $370.55; the balance in the treasury from last year, $74.83; total sum of loans, $200.</p>
   <p>The St. Joseph's Youth Society has been in existence since 1883, and has 107 members. It belongs to the Polish Roman Catholic Union under the guidance of <pb facs="5423968_7_0321.jpg" n="2"/>the Blessed Heart of Jesus. There were three deaths reported within this period: one member and two wives of members.</p>
   <p>The initiation fee was reduced from eight dollars to five dollars. The banner and emblem cost forty-five cents.</p>
   <p>This Society accepts members between the ages of sixteen and thirty-two. However, because there are many youths in Chicago, especially in the St. Stanislaus Parish (the only one to have two youth societies with over a hundred members each), our youths are requested to become members of this new Society, which gives benefits in the event of an accident.</p>
   <p>Stephen Konkol, president,</p>
   <p>Frank Jankowski, recording secretary,</p>
   <p>128 Cleaver Street.</p>
