  <body>
   <p>It is of great importance to all societies in and about Holy Trinity parish to send their representatives to the meeting of the Educational Aid Society. The meeting will be held on Sunday, September 29, 1918, in the Holy Trinity school auditorium. Matters of vast importance are to be settled, and especially the matter of accepting applicants to the Holy Trinity High School at the expense of the Educational Aid Society.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that there still are many societies affiliated with the Educational Aid Society which are in arrears in their dues of last year, some of them owing for the last two and even three years, an appeal is made to the representatives of such societies to be present at this meeting and to bring the money to pay these dues. Every one knows that without money <pb facs="5423968_7_0126.jpg" n="2"/>it is impossible to conduct so important a matter as giving secondary education to our financially embarassed Polish youth.</p>
   <p>The Educational Society also wishes to take this opportunity to inform every one that the postponed sale of a lot, donated by Mr. T. Majewski for the benefit of the Educational Aid Society and the new school, will definitely take place on November 10, 1918. This affair will also present a varied entertainment program. Every one who has purchased his raffle ticket for the lot may have free admission by merely exhibiting the ticket. Whoever has not as yet purchased a ticket may still get one for twenty-five cents at the rectory or of the students or the members of the Educational Aid Society. It is hoped that no Pole will be absent on Sunday, November 10, 1918. The cause is worthy of the support of every right-minded Pole, since the proceeds of the raffle will benefit many Polish boys who might otherwise <pb facs="5423968_7_0127.jpg" n="3"/>be deprived of a better education.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>T. M. Helinski, president</p>
   <p>Adalbert J. Danisch, secretary.</p>
