   <p>Our readers will no doubt recall the series of articles which we wrote about saving and the wise investment of money. We warned you urgently then, and we caution you again to invest your money prudently, not to take chances, not to speculate, and not to expose yourself to unnecessary financial risks. But on the other hand you should not keep your money in stockings, mattresses, or other hiding places where it brings you no interest and may easily be lost. Today we add another article to the series for the benefit of interested persons. As usual we begin with an example from everyday life.</p>
   <p>A certain Mr. Alve W. Harshman was recently arrested in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as a codefendant with C. W. French and J. W. Worthington, two notorious master swindlers. Harshman made a statement in which he explained that several years ago he lent to French $50,000 and then found himself forced to <pb facs="5423968_7_1565.jpg" n="2"/>play the role assigned to him by French in order to get his money back.</p>
   <p>Colonel J. V. Clinnin, assistant United States district attorney, had these persons arrested after he had learned that Messrs. Worthington and French had organized their business in order to get rid of $6,000,000 worth of stolen bonds and about $3,000,000 in worthless notes, besides a great number of certificates of deposit.</p>
   <p>We have written very extensively about this affair so that our readers might be quite familiar with its details. What we want to do now is to remind you of it and to call your attention to the fact that the victims of these swindlers were, one might say, principally intelligent and well-to-do people who, it seems, should have had sense enough not to permit themselves to be so shamelessly cheated. But the fact remains that they were defrauded by these shrewd financial manipulators, and what is worse, they were involuntarily dragged into co-operation in their swindles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_1566.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Worthington and French were careless with their money; they were dealing in millions. They set their nets only for big fish, and when one was caught, it was picked clean. Every millionaire who fell into their trap had his pockets picked to the very last penny.</p>
   <p>But this was quite unusual; one might call it an exceptional affair. There are swarms of swindlers of smaller caliber who do not aspire so high but go after the savings of poor people, not disdaining those of children who put away in little banks pennies given to them by their parents. they even stretch out their paws to rob the church boxes into which pious and warm-hearted parishioners put their contributions for the poor. Many poor widows have been induced [by them] to invest in shady business enterprises the insurance money left to them by husbands and fathers of families. These are the exploiters, the true jackals.</p>
   <p>There is also another type of person who brings ruin to himself and to others by promoting all sorts of impractical and chimerical business schemes in the <pb facs="5423968_7_1567.jpg" n="4"/>hope of getting rich quickly. Some of these people are honest but have the habit of looking at things subjectively. They take dreams for reality; they imagine themselves able to run railroads, to construct skyscrapers, and to organize and manage gigantic corporations, although in reality they have had no experience in such matters.</p>
   <p>This class of harmful dreamers has cost us millions already, and we see no and to it because these people are continually crying for more money to carry on their experiments, which, we may be sure, will end in failure.</p>
   <p>The only way for the average individual to protect himself and his savings is to avoid doing business with strangers who are trying to induce people to speculate with their hard-earned money. One should invest one's iunds in honest and reliable business enterprises the shares of which are sold on the stock exchange, bringing sure and good profit. There are many bonds and much valuable commercial paper which are sure and safe, bringing in good steady income and having the added advantage that in case of need they can readily <pb facs="5423968_7_1568.jpg" n="5"/>be sold without a cent of loss. But before one makes any investment, one should avail himself of absolutely competent advice.</p>
