   <p>The Polish people of America have been paying and are still paying millions of dollars yearly to non-Polish fire insurance companies simply because heretofore no one thought of creating a Polish fire insurance company that could compete with the others, which, parenthetically speaking, have made good business out of the Poles. A time finally came, however, when the Poles realized that here was a great field for a Polish fire insurance company and that the proper thing was to take advantage of it. Thus, a few months ago, a Polish fire insurance company was organized under the name, "The Great Lakes Insurance Company". At first, this company had its offices on Monroe Street, but thanks to exemplary management and a new business system, its clientile grew to such proportions that it was necessary to look for larger quarters. Thus, the company now occupies the whole left wing of the ninth floor of the Insurance Building, Wells Street and Jackson Boulevard. These offices are well equipped and are entirely adequate.</p>
   <p>The proportions to which the business of this new firm has grown can be judged <pb facs="5423968_7_0365.jpg" n="2"/>from the one fact that, despite the short time of its existence, it has received the support of the largest American firms in Chicago, such as Swift and Company, Morris, Thomas Wilson, Armour and Company, large grain elevators, and large lumber yards, which have all insured their buildings and other property for enormous sums.</p>
   <p>There is no insurance company in America with so large a field of action and so brilliant a future from its very inception as this Polish insurance company. Because of the World War, great European companies, i.e., the German and Austrian companies, have lost their right to conduct business here, as a result of which the clientele of these firms has gone over to American companies. The latter, greatly overburdened, turn the new accounts over to new insurance companies, among which the Polish Great Lakes Insurance Company leads.</p>
   <p>The Great Lakes Insurance Company has more than two thousand stockholders in the United States and Canada. Shares are sold at the present time at twenty-five dollars, whereas in the beginning the Company's stock was sold at twenty dollars <pb facs="5423968_7_0366.jpg" n="3"/>a share. And before long, shares will be worth $27.50, or even thirty dollars.</p>
   <p>The Company's business is conducted by an administration consisting of well-known and trustworthy people. N. L. Piotrowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and former city attorney, a mature and wealthy man, is its president, while Albert Wachowski, well-known banker and organizer of building and loan societies is its vice-president. Julius Smietanka, president of a bank in Town of Lake and internal revenue collector for the port of Chicago, is secretary of the corporation. John F. Smulski, president of the North western Trust and Savings Bank and former treasurer of the State of Illinois, is its treasurer.</p>
   <p>At its inception, the corporation's capital was $200,000, but it was later raised to $600,000 to enable it to do business in every state in the United States and in neighboring countries. The Great Lakes Insurance Company is under state control and is directed by well-known, capable Polish businessmen, which is sufficient guarantee that money invested in the corporation is safe and will bring large dividends.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0367.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The insurance business is one of the most profitable enterprises in which investors can place their money. For example, a hundred dollars' worth of shares in the American Fire Insurance Company of Newark, New Jersey, purchased several years ago, is valued at five thousand dollars today. This means a return of six hundred dollars yearly on an original investment of one hundred dollars.</p>
