   <p>May 30th, as a solemn holiday of decorating graves, has been gathering many hundreds of people to the graves of their beloved ones. It is that day on which more than one heart beats livelier and more benevolently at the remembrance of the loved ones and those close to your heart, who are today covered with a mound of cold earth.</p>
   <p>On this day of remembrances all the Polish organizations in Chicago jointly resolved to knock at the hearts and pockets of Poles, who understand the importance of the appeal of such a humanitarian national institution, as the St. Hedwig's Polish Orphanage in Norwood Park.</p>
   <p>With this aim, backed by the general harmony of all the organizations, a special committee arranged a tag day at the three Polish cemeteries: St. Adalbert's, Resurrection and Holy Cross, and got for this noble and benevolent function Chicago women and girls who are always full of devotion, giving themselves to every cause, having as its aim the <pb facs="5423968_7_0585.jpg" n="2"/>national well-being.</p>
   <p>Thanks to you and honor to you, honorable Polish women, for your unselfish help; for your work for the increase of the funds for our orphans.</p>
   <p>Your devotion cannot be measured with kindness, but ought to find equipoise in unforgetful gratefulness within the little hearts of the children, to whom by your undertaken task you give the opportunity to grow up in the Catholic faith and to be brought up as proper and vigorous Poles.</p>
   <p>Let the gratefulness of these orphans replace the consciousness of the aim of generosity, and they will repay surely this debt of gratefulness to the next generation with a noble feeling.</p>
   <p>The result of the tag day was as follows:</p>
