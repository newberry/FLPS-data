   <p>Because many Polish mothers have to help their husbands earn the daily stipend, the Nazareth Sisters at 130 W. Division Street will open a home to accomodate the children of working parents. It will be called Sister Freblowska's Garden. This home will solve many wearisome problems for working mothers and will save many children from unfortunate mishaps.</p>
   <p>Beginning May.1, those children who are not of school age will be accepted in the Garden. The children will be under the constant care of the nuns from 7:00 A.M. to 7: P.M. They will receive three meals a day: at 10 A.M. 12 noon, and 4P.M. The fee for those services will be very nominal and the <pb facs="5423968_7_0764.jpg" n="2"/>benefits will be great.</p>
   <p>Those mothers who find their children a handicap when they are working about the home will find these pleasant accommodations a timely relief. They will be able to do more work and have less worry on their hands. Many Polish mothers who take in homework,such as, sewing, laundry, needlework, will be able to increase their earning power by taking advantage of these services.</p>
   <p>The fee of ten cents per child, or less, will pay in return ten times the amount. Worry, accidents, waste of hours will be averted, while the children will be acquiring new playmates in a homelike at atmosphere.</p>
   <p>Mothers take advantage of these services.</p>
