   <p>In spite of difficult economic conditions in America and disgust with collections of all kinds and indifference to them on the part of Polish emigrants in America the Polish Army Veterans' Association is going ahead with preparations for its drive to collect $200,000 for the settlement of war invalids, to give to the veterans of the Polish army a start on the farms assigned to them in the eastern marches of Poland by the Polish government. This is a very serious step, and the executive officers of this young organization [Translators note: Organized in the fall of 1920] have long debated the question of collecting over the whole country this comparatively modest sum at this time because there have been drives of all sorts in the last few months, almost without interruption.</p>
   <p>"Enough of these collections!" writes the Polish press. "Enough of these collections!" shouts the worker. They took advantage of the public's generosity, which was always willing to contribute regardless of whether</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0880.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>the object of the contribution was some political party or certain individuals; anyhow, what mattered in each case was the money, the collection, and nothing else. There were cases in which under the pretense of patriotism sums of money were coaxed out of people with the help of our local spokesmen [and were used] merely for party purposes. Today [the exploiters] impudently laugh, encouraging others to do the same thing. "Others have taken; let these also get what they can," say the leaders who used to "lead" visitors from overseas before the Polish public in America.</p>
   <p>In this case, however, the question is aid for the invalids who in fighting for the ideals expressed by you have lost their health. The veterans are emigrants of the peasant and working classes, men experienced in life, moderately conscious of their nationality while living in the occupied parts of Poland [Translator's note: He means here the three parts of Poland under Germany, Austria, and Russia, as at present under two foreign governments, Germany and Russia], who had to leave their native land for economic or political reasons; others were reared in America in the Polish-</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0881.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>American spirit. They are those who answered the first call to fall in line and fight for the freedom of our country.</p>
   <p>They are the soldiers who followed the bloody path, baring their breasts to open the way to free Poland; they are those who by the sacrifice of their blood put the question of Poland in the forefront among the political questions in Europe. The veterans were the armed representatives of the Poles in America and in Europe before the peace conference. They are the first regular army formations of independent Poland; they are those who by their labor created Poland, throwing her enemies out of her territory.</p>
   <p>The veterans are frequently the nameless "border sharpshooters in blue," the thorns in the flesh of the Bolsheviks [Translator's note: Reference is here made to the defeat of the Russians in 1920 by the Polish army, composed in large part of these "border sharpshooters in blue"]; they are those who frequently strewed the fields of Champagne and of the eastern marches of Poland with their dead. They are those who after the war and the victorious</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0882.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>peace were compelled, in tattered uniforms, covered with scars, with crosses of military glory on their breasts, to seek their bitter bread in a foreign land, hoping to save a few dollars before returning to their native fields.</p>
   <p>The veterans came here in unenviable economic condition. They organized themselves in a Veterans' Association to continue to stand guard by the flag of their country, to defend the good name of Poland and the dignity of her government, and to work for the benefit of their native land.</p>
   <p>The veterans have in their Association comrades who are unable to make their own living--the war invalids. They are a burden to the Association, and they must be taken care of so as not to be left to the tender mercies of cruel fate or to be forced to accept beggar's bread. There are even now such veterans, those suffering with wounds received in France, who must live on alms in a foreign land.</p>
   <p>The veterans are receiving now, as compensation for their war service,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_7_0883.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>farms in the eastern marches of Poland from the Polish government, but because of lack of money not all are able to benefit by this grant. For this reason the executive board of the Veterans' Association has decided to open a campaign to collect a larger sum of money which would enable us to bring all our invalids together and place them in our own soldiers' home. Our second aim is to give to the veterans a start on their own farms. The eastern borders of Poland will thus gain good citizens and defenders, [Polish] agriculture will gain good workers, and we shall have fulfilled our solemn duty.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, in spite of the prevalent cry of "enough of these collections," this action of the veterans should prove successful and bring satisfactory results.</p>
