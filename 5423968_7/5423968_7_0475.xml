   <p>The Polish Hospital, 258 West Division Street, was the scene yesterday of an unusual operation performed on Mrs. Mary Kufl, wife of a storekeeper on Noble Street. The operation was performed by Dr. Davis, assisted by Dr. Czerniewski, Dr. W. A. Kuflewski, Dr. Laibe, Dr. Mueller, and others.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Kufl had complained of severe pains in the side and abdomen for several months. After removing the growth and cutting it open, the doctors found something like a rotten liver covered with hair and containing some human teeth.</p>
   <p>The operation lasted an hour and a half; the sick woman recovered consciousness promptly and there is hope that she may ultimately recover completely.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis took the growth with him for a thorough examination. He thinks Mrs. Kufl.....may have been born with it, but others declare such a theory <pb facs="5423968_7_0476.jpg" n="2"/>is not probable....</p>
   <p>At any rate this case is very rare in the annals of medicine.</p>
   <p>Three other Polish women were operated on yesterday at the Polish Hospital. They are M. S., from Hoyne Avenue; R. W., from Dickson Street; and M. T., from Dickson Street. The operations were successful.</p>
   <p>So we can see that the Polish Hospital is performing a very worthy service by giving relief to the suffering people--and it deserves the hearty support of all Poles.</p>
