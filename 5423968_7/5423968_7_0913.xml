   <p>We are all familiar with the excruciating sufferings our comrades had to undergo during the Bolshevik invasion. The work of reconstruction had to be set aside, while the men banded together and went out to repel the destructive enemy. And this had to be done practically with bare hands, for there was no time to arm completely. The objective of our people was to safeguard what little had been restored after the World War. When this voluntary movement started, men from all walks of life, both young and old, hurried to the battlefield to defend their country.</p>
   <p>All sections of Poland suffered as a result of this invasion, but the city that suffered most was Vilna, and the territory surrounding it was equally hard hit. The people of this territory were the first to fall victims to the bullets of the Reds, and the attack on Vilna was the greatest of the war. However, not <pb facs="5423968_7_0914.jpg" n="2"/>even the heaviest assaults of the invader were powerful enough to subdue the spirit of the Poles, who were tasting freedom for the first time in many decades, and were determined to reconstruct the ruins of war.</p>
   <p>Who was it that parried this attack with herculean valor? Who showed Europe that Poland, her land still bloody from the recent war, would not tolerate any unjustifiable invasion of her territory and persecution of her people? It was the youth of Vilna, the pride of our fathers who had felt the lash of the Czar's knout--it was youth determined to be free.</p>
   <p>The future citizens of Poland will be patterned after this youth. Already their valor is being praised throughout Poland. And why not? When this chivalrous youth returned victorious from the battlefield, debris faced them where their cozy homes once stood. But they did not despair. They shook off the sight of the ruins with a smile and began to rebuild with the same energy that they had shown on the battle front four months before. The Brotherly Aid Society, organized after the World War, began to function once again. But the ravages of the <pb facs="5423968_7_0915.jpg" n="3"/>four-month encounter with the Bolsheviks were too great to overcome. Tremendous damage had been done, especially to creative work.</p>
   <p>The Brotherly Aid Society is doing its best to restore things to normal, but the odds are too great. It tries to help as many students as possible to continue their schoolwork. This, of course, requires a large amount of money. At present, things look bad. Funds are low. The Society would like to help many of the students who fought the Reds. Then, too, who is going to clothe the returning soldiers and dress their wounds? Money is required for all this. All the students that left their wounds? Money is required for all this. All the students that left their studies want to return, but what good are hungry students? Besides food, they are in great need of clothing. Their desires are but dreams at present. Who will help them?</p>
   <p>Just recently, the editorial department received a letter of appeal from the struggling youth of Vilna, asking for assistance from the people of Polish extraction in America.</p>
   <p>"Help us in our plight, dear friends, for we fought not only for our liberty but <pb facs="5423968_7_0916.jpg" n="4"/>also for yours. You alone can help us, you who have not experienced hunger and death in moats and trenches. Those of you who sent your sons to fight in the World War have learned what this is like from their very lips. Many of you have given generously. Give now! Do not let us face the pangs of hunger and the withering of our youthful lives!</p>
   <p>"Contributions, no matter how small, will help us a great deal. The Brotherly Aid Society of Vilna asks not only for financial help but for clothing and food as well. Books and school supplies will also be gladly received.</p>
   <p>"Please do not disregard this plea. Give us some kind of encouragement. We do not wish to disappoint the countless numbers that come to our doors for aid. Let us assure them that assistance will be given them very, very soon. Large sums of money are not needed. A moderate donation will go a long way. Give this your fullest consideration."</p>
   <p>Within the near future, the Polish National Committee will start its Christmas campaign for the poverty-stricken in Upper Silesia. We are certain that there <pb facs="5423968_7_0917.jpg" n="5"/>will be a place for the Brotherly Aid Society in this drive.</p>
   <p>Contributions for both of these worthy causes will be gladly received.</p>
