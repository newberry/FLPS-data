   <p>"Ottawa, Illinois, January 29, 1901.</p>
   <p>"Recently, in company with the Chicago "Fidelians," I had an opportunity to be present during an evening entertainment given by the German Division of Northwestern University, in Evanston. I have been told that the German Division, consisting of 400 students, men and women, is the largest contingent of the institution. The following gentlemen teach our mother-tongue: Professor Hatfield, well known among the readers of the Staats-Zeitung as an excellent and most capable linguist; Professor George Edward, author, who attained a reputation as composer of ballads and songs (published by Baumert and Runge, Leipzig, Germany, 1897) and as a translator of Scottish and English works, all exemplary creations; Professor Curme, versatile philologist and an authority on literature; Professor Dr. Schoetze, and Miss Caraway.</p>
   <p>"Such a faculty of tried, proved and outstanding individuals in its German <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0991.jpg" n="2"/>Department, should give Northwestern University ample reason to be proud above all others.</p>
   <p>"The evening entertainment which I mentioned brought many students, a large number of professors of other faculties, the trustees of the University and their companions, as well as other guests.</p>
   <p>"The program consisted of recitations, singing, and the presentation of that highly dramatic scene showing Lieutenant-General Octavio and his son, Max Piccolomini, in the last part of Schiller's trilogy, "Wallenstein." As a pleasant variant of the program, the singers of the Fidelia Club, led by their masterly leader Heinrich von Oppen, added a number of their enchanting popular songs and airs.</p>
   <p>"Now, in regard to the linguistic attainments of the Americans, as shown at the stage of that music hall, I must admit that they satisfied me in general, and even surprised me in some respects. That the German pronunciation presents <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0992.jpg" n="3"/>exceptional difficulties to the American, is a well established fact, and should always be considered. I was especially pleased when I perceived how these young people fully comprehended the intricacies of the author's eloquence, and I felt elated by their thorough absorption of the intrinsical spirit which permeates the play.</p>
   <p>"The German teachers of Northwestern University obviously subscribe to the principle of Gustav Frytag, the greatest of the German romanticists. He asserts that a linguistic knowledge is the most important asset to science, as it promotes the highest understanding, enabling us to become conversant with the motivating spirit of other nations. And therefore I accord them deserving recognition and admiration.</p>
   <p>"We Americans may well be content that instruction in our mother tongue has been entrusted to such proponents of education, men to whom unhampered wisdom is an ideal, a gift of the gods, and not an "efficient cow" supplying butter for their daily sustenance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0993.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"And here I also wish to record how I enjoyed myself in their midst, which applies alike to teachers and students. The scholars of today will be the instructors of tomorrow. These four hundred students of Evanston university's German class are a fair-sized fraction of those elements which are destined to fashion the mental standards of the twentieth-century North Americans.</p>
   <p>"May they always consider science as a free and holy entity. Let us hope that they continue in the traditional spirit of their masters when they acquire leadership and influence new generations, thus affecting future destinies."</p>
   <p>C. Zwanzig.</p>
