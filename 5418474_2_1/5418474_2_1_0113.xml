   <p>The widely travelled Odysseus, hero of the divine poet Homer, once said that he had seen the cities of many peoples and had understood the significance of their symbols. According to the concepts of the ancient Greeks of that time, a city had a[symbolic] meaning. In our country, although cities and towns have less tradition and individuality than in any other civilized country in the world, Americans are fond of talking about the individuality of their cities. There is one town, however, which can justly point to its history and tradition as distinguishing it from all other cities in the land. This town is Westerville, in the State of Ohio.</p>
   <p>For many years Westerville had been the headquarters of the Anti-Saloon League. At the same time it was the unofficial capital of the country. Here was the center of that huge organization which covered the entire <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0114.jpg" n="2"/>country and which even had some connections abroad, for the "drys" also maintained an international organization whose objective was nothing less than to make the whole world "bone dry". This was not a delusion of grandeur: the leaders honestly believed that the day of universal Prohibition was not far away.</p>
   <p>Today, when National Prohibition is about to give up the ghost, it is of special interest to recall a statement of the late William Jennings Bryan. During the first few months after Prohibition had become effective, a violent controversy raged as to what the Government should do in case ships of other nations, carrying spirituous liquors, called at American ports. Eventually the Government decided on a rather liberal policy in this respect, but there was a time when the "drys" earnestly demanded that the Government deny these ships American port facilities. At that moment Bryan entered the argument by making an important announcement. He said that it was perfectly silly to become excited over this problem because within a few years the whole world would be "dry" anyway, and there wouldn't <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0115.jpg" n="3"/>be any more ships carrying intoxicating liquors on board.</p>
   <p>There cannot be the slightest doubt whatever that not only Bryan but also most of the other "dry" leaders believed this appalling nonsense. But if one stops to think of what they had accomplished in the United States, their attitude seems reasonable enough. The Anti-Saloon League and its associated organizations were really the government behind the Government in this country. From Westerville connections were maintained with Washington and the state capitals. In Westerville, plans for the complete subjugation of the country were concocted and presented in the form of bills to Congress and to the various state legislatures. In most cases, the bills went through without protest.</p>
   <p>Actually, the "drys" never controlled any large number of votes, and it is very doubtful if they ever had a majority in any one state. But they habitually played one party against the other, and since they were masters in political strategy, they managed to keep both parties under their thumbs.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0116.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In Westerville there was also the war chest of the League, the fund of collections and contributions from which, over the years, huge sums have been spent to finance the "dry" campaigns. from this little town in central Ohio, not far from Columbus, there poured a torrent of "dry" campaign literature over all of this country and into parts of others.</p>
   <p>It has frequently been claimed that the country would never have rid itself of Prohibition if prosperity had lasted. This assertion is by no means unjustified; for in the first place, many people--even those who otherwise were not at all enthusiastic about Prohibition--believed that prosperity was a direct consequence of prohibition; and secondly, high prices for illegal liquor were not felt so painfully during the era of prosperity. But when the great crash came, Westerville's glory began to fade.</p>
   <p>The contributions became less and less generous, and the circulation of campaign literature more and more restricted. Other countries, like Canada and Finland, which had adopted partial Prohibition, abolished it gradually, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0117.jpg" n="5"/>and the chieftains of the Anti-Saloon League made the painful discovery that universal Prohibition would remain a beautiful dream for the next few centuries at any rate. And neither could the fiction of prosperity through Prohibition be maintained any longer. The bank in Westerville had to close its doors. That was bitter medicine for the "dry" agitators.</p>
   <p>But that was not all. More and More of the wealthy and powerful supporters of the "dry" cause went over into the "wet" camp, and the collection plate remained empty. And finally came the victory of the Democrats; that marked the beginning of the end of Prohibition. The story of the Ohio country town typifies an essential part of American history. Now beer is sold openly in Westerville, where booze was once sold under the counter.</p>
