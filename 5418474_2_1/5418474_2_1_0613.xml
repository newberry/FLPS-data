  <body>
   <p>At the General Meeting, held in Quincy No. 9 yesterday, President Miehle presented his yearly report, of which we cite the following: The writer shows how unfavorable the fight against the Harper law was and declares that nothing was undone on the part of the State organization to secure a favorable decision from the Superior Court. In regard to the attempts of a few saloonkeepers associations, to resist the law, intending to procure only beer licenses and under same also to sell liquors, Mr. Miehle remarked, that those Saloonkeepers did not succeed and through their action only incited the public against them, which would have resulted in their inability to change the unjust Dram Shop law in the near future.</p>
   <p>At the next elections to the Legislature, everything shall be done, that only liberal minded men, favorable to the saloon business, should be elected and therefore the association will actively in their own interest, if they stick solidly to the State organization, which he created.</p>
