   <p>Every day for over a month now about one hundred aliens have been calling at the local internal revenue office. They are obeying the law of the country which has offered them her hospitality, and are paying their back taxes to obtain permission to return to their native land. J. Popper, the head of the local internal revenue department whose job it is to examine these people very closely and to issue certifications to all applicants who have complied with the law, claims that the majority of these people have told him that in their opinion the temperance fanatics and self-righteous bigots have finally managed to dig a grave for liberty.</p>
   <p>He adds this comment: "On the average I have to examine about one hundred America-weary people a day: Rumanians, Greeks, and also some Swedes, Irish, and Germans. The largest contingent are the Rumanians and Czecho-Slovaks. These good people usually complain that they are poverty-stricken and that <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0261.jpg" n="2"/> they have not earned a dime that could be taxed because they have been sick for months. After I explain to them in detail that, regardless of sickness or other unfortunate occurrences, they have to pay taxes on their aggregate income--for the years 1916 and 1917, twelve per cent for the year 1918, and eight per cent for the current year--they leave the office very discouraged. They usually tell me that they are going to think the matter over and that they will return some other time. Of course, in the meantime, we have checked up on their earnings. When we show them these figures they feign amazement but with a sigh they reach into their pockets, and in many cases they not only pay their taxes but also the stipulated fine for tax evasion, which amounts to fifty per cent of the total amount for 1916 and 1917, and twenty-five per cent for 1918. And the average prospective emigrant takes approximately a thousand dollars in cash with him. A Greek, who obtained his passport recently had twenty-five thousand dollars in his money belt. One can get an idea of the sums of money which are leaving America when one considers that every day between four and five thousand emigrants, tired of America, leave New York harbor to return to the old country. That is quite a surprise, is it not? But even more amazing is the reply which almost all <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0262.jpg" n="3"/>these America-weary people with whom I have talked give me when I ask them why they wish to leave America. The response is: Because over here personal freedom is a fake--because we, as grown-up men, cannot even get a glass of beer or wine any longer--and because we have to dance to the tune of hypocritical bigots and Puritans. We don't have to do that in the old country. Over there we can still get all the beer and wine we want, and every citizen of the land enjoys a greater measure of freedom than the American over here."</p>
