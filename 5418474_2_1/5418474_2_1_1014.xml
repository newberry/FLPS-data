   <p>Through the Irish eloquence, many laborers in the U. S. have been bribed already to their own prejudice, for the Irish orators know how to merge an immense verbosity with such a passionate and charming appearance, that it is hard to withdraw from their influence.</p>
   <p>He who does not thoroughly know them and their ways of talking, cannot imagine, that they only play a part, that they feel nothing of that what seemingly is rending their bosoms and tearing their hearts. When they whisper and curse, shout with joy and lament, coo and rumble, are witty and cry, the listener does not perceive at all that they only snatch at oratorical effects, or that they as an ironical English statesman put it, intoxicate themselves at the bubbling fountain of their own word-manufacture.</p>
   <p>The Irish themselves are used to "blarney" since childhood days, so that it does not harm them. They take their orators Just with as little seriousness, as they took <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1015.jpg" n="2"/>perhaps the tale of the Kilkenny-cats, who ate themselves up to their tail ends. While they, for instance let themselves become angered over the British yoke, they enter without hesitation the services of the well-paying "Saxon" suppressor and fight for him in all parts of the globe.</p>
   <p>Therefore the Irish-American laborers will know, how to take a stand upon that challenge, to use the fire-brands in place of a voting ballot. They will take this simply as oratorical extravagance and are now as before striving, to raise themselves, by means of good political jobs or fat public contracts to become millionaires. But other laborers, who do not share the privilege of having royal Celtic blood in their veins, might perhaps be tempted to believe the horrible Irish threats. For their own personal sake, it would be a pity.</p>
   <p>To the German Socialists in the United States, who began already to have expectations of the new"American" socialism, a great , disappointment has probably been prepared by the blood-dripping speeches of Murphy, Iwinn and company. They will perceive, that their scientific or educational socialism, which closely examines the origin of capital, of surplus value, and of the unequal division <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1016.jpg" n="3"/>of property, will never be understandable to the American and Irish-American laborers. The German Armchair erudition can, by no means, be carried into the American labor movement.</p>
