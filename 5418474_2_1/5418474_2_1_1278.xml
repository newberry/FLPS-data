   <p>To the editor of the Sonntagpost:</p>
   <p>An article that had the approval of the president of the First National Bank, and other prominent men in the world of finance, appeared in one of the morning newspapers. This particular article pointed out the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago was negligent in the performance of its duty to investigate banks that are members of that institution, notwithstanding the fact that many persons have deposited their small savings in these banks as a result of a sign displayed in the window, "Member of the Federal Reserve Bank." The people trusted these banks with their hard-earned money, many of which became defunct as the result of insufficient investigation.</p>
   <p>It is beyond apprehension why nothing has been done to prevent this dilemna, since the majority of receivers declare that most of these banks are really not insolvent. Their plight has shown itself by long term mortgages, impossible to turn into cash money right now. For what reason did not the Federal Reserve Bank discount these mortgages? It would have been the most natural thing to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1279.jpg" n="2"/>accept these perfectly good securities in exchange for cash money and still show a great profit derived from the deal--since 41/2 per cent would have been paid as interest for the use of its paper money. Thus the crash of many of these banks could have been avoided. In view of these facts it is obvious that the gentlemen governing the Federal Reserve Bank do not deserve the high salaries they receive and should be removed from their positions as quickly as it may deem expedient.</p>
