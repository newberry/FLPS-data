   <p>As reported a few days ago, Pastor A. Lincoln Shute, had used improper language last week in his attack on Judge Walker for the latter's attitude in the problem pertaining to Chicago prohibition and Sunday laws, advocated by the Temperance fanatics.</p>
   <p>Judge Walker promptly sent to Pastor Shute a summons to defend himself in court to-day for contempt of court. Punctually at 11 A. M., Pastor Shute, accompanied by his lawyers E. B. Tolman and R. Redfield, appeared before Judge Walker and apologized for his behavior, which he termed as a misunderstanding regarding Judge Walker's decision in prohibition affairs.</p>
   <p>Judge Walker, accepted the apology and dismissed the case, which has proved again to Chicago citizens, how even a judge can be the target of hatred and vicious attacks from intolerant backward and onesided fanatics. The latter must realize gradually, that they are not swimming with but against the stream of human progress.</p>
