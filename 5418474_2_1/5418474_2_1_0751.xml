   <p>"Greatly astonished I see what interpretation you give my letter in the Chicago Journal of March 22nd. Nothing was further from my thought than to defend the recently adopted so-called Temperance Law. My German colleagues in the Legislature will testify that I did everything I could to prevent its adoption - and, that is to say, by the only means at our disposal, namely, by submitting a substitute. My law simply prohibits the sale of intoxicating drink to known drunkards, to those already intoxicated, to minors, and, in cases where a member of the family forbids the barkeeper orally or in writing the sale of liquor to an alcohol addicted relation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0752.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Does that make me a temperance advocate? But I protested against an agitation that apparently is directed only at the Germans. This may be an error of the head, but not of the heart.....That violent language in meetings only develops the full strength of the opposition, and, if restricted to Germans, exclusively, will create the most extreme know-nothingism I firmly believe. To avoid this was my motive. As my intention was only to prevent bitter hatred between Americans and German-Americans I have nothing to retract.</p>
   <p>Signed: William Massenberg."</p>

   <p>Comment of the Editor: What Mr. Massenberg said in his letter to the Evening Journal was that he agreed with the principle of the Temperance Law.........The principle says that not the drunkards shall be punished for the damage they do, but the innkeepers. The Drunkards are to be coddled and rewarded and made into agents "provocateurs" against the innkeepers. That is the magnificent "principle" with which Mr. Massenberg declares himself in agreement......The whole intent and meaning of his letter to the Journal was to present him to the American temperance advocates as a fit candidate for Secretary of State. The intent and meaning of it is to recommend him to the German anti-Temperance people.......We would have to lie if we were to say that the double face that Mr. Massenberg exhibits inspires in us any feeling that resembles esteem....</p>

   <p>Quotation from the Evening Post:</p>
   <p>To the question of the interviewer if his step had, "The political significance that certain people ascribed to it"? Mr. Raster answered:</p>
   <p>"The whole affair is purely personal which of course will not prevent the papers from imputing to it such significance as they will find agreeable. As far as the Illinois Staats Zeitung is concerned, I will only say that editor and publisher of the Zeitung have expressed their political convictions without giving my personal position the least consideration. From that follows, automatically, that my resignation has no relation to the attitude of the Zeitung.</p>
