   <p>The fight of the Prohibitionists against the liberal elements of Chicago found its ignominious end yesterday. The election officials decided, that the petition did not have a sufficient number of legally qualified signers. The question therefore, will not be decided by the hallot, at the next primary election, in the spring. The decision of the election commission signifies a gloriuos victory for the United Association which, after a great sacrifice of money and time, conducted an investigation and so unearthed an astonishing amount of irregularities and fraud which has been perpetrated in the gathering of signatures. Of the 74, 026 signers, the election commissioners consider only 44, 278 as uncontestable. According to Levy Mayer, attorney for the United Association another 6700 are doubtful, which would reduce the number to 37,500 legal signatures. As the petition requires 63,511 names, the prohibitionists lack 19,233. In considering the fraudulent aspect <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0460.jpg" n="2"/> and possible prosecution by the States' Attorney this case is published.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. T. Goldstein, 1526 N. Halsted Street who lives in the 10th precinct of the 22nd ward, affirms: that the agent of the Anti-Saloon League, who obtained his name for the petition, also added the name of E. Goldstein to it, without any permission whatsoever. As a matter of fact, Mr. E. Goldstein, who resides in the same building, has not signed the petition.</p>
