   <p>Everything written about President Coolidge stresses the fact that he is an exceedingly practical gentleman. No disparagement is intended by this characterization; on the contrary, it merely shows that the genius of the American people is excellently embodied in the head of the nation. For Americans are no theoreticians and doctrinaires; they are, first and foremost, practical people. Unfortunately, there are times when the President feels the urge to issue forth upon the slippery ice of philosophical considerations.</p>
   <p>In his address to the national committee of Congregational churches, he spoke of the relations between church and state, between law and morals. In the course of his speech, the President became entangled in a maze of contradictions. He took the correct view that the power of the state is <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0233.jpg" n="2"/>not in a position, nor is it its duty, to make better men and women out of people. But how this viewpoint of his can be reconciled with his stand on Prohibition is not quite clear. President Coolidge further makes the terse statement that government is based upon religion. It would probably be difficult for him to offer proof of this statement.</p>
   <p>The President admits that under our Constitution, the church is separated from the state. But he maintains that "the forms and theories of our government were molded in conformity with the religious views of the people." This statement has no foundation in fact. For the religious convictions of the people were, at that time, so substantially different from one another that they never could have served as the foundation for the form and theories of the government. The Puritans of New England, the Cavaliers of the South, and the Quakers of Pennsylvania had, as far as religion and Weltanschauung were concerned, nothing in common.</p>
   <p>In his address the President again makes the statement that the increase <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0234.jpg" n="3"/>of crime and the disappearance of respect for the law are results of the war. This statement likewise cannot be maintained. Sir Basil Thompson, who for many years was head of the British police, has, on the occasion of a visit to this country, given statistical proof that crime has not increased in Great Britain as a result of the war. Effects of this sort [i. e. increase in crime] may well have taken place in Germany and Russia where the end of the war brought in its wake a complete internal breakdown--but not in other countries.</p>
   <p>Since the state has not yet succeeded in checking the increase of crime, the President now turns to the churches and demands that they fulfil their duties in this field. The President is quite right in expecting favorable effects upon the people's morals from deepening and revitalizing religious forces. But he overlooks the fact that our churches, in many instances, have divested themselves of their original religious character and have become political organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0235.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These churches make no secret of the fact that their methods have been a total failure. This is why they no longer try to influence those of the fold with religious means. In their helplessness, they turn to the state and want to replace religious feeling, chastity, and morals with the policeman's night stick. For some time they have confessed their moral bankruptcy, and it is a rather comic spectacle to see the head of the state turn to them for help, while they themselves, to achieve their own purposes, have called upon the power of the state.</p>
   <p>That, through his statements, the President has unconditionally condemned the night-stick morality of the church, he himself may not be aware of. Yet it is quite true. No more decisive or proper critique of the endeavors of our reformers-by-compulsion (Zwangsreformer) and pulpit politicians could be made than was done by the President's words. It is remarkable coincidence that on the same way on which that church gathering was greeted by the President, Mr. Wayne B. Wheeler, the leader of the Anti-Saloon League, called at the White House.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0236.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Following his interview with the President, Mr. Wheeler announced that from now on the army would be used to enforce Prohibition. But we have not yet come to this. However, with the Lord--and in America--nothing is impossible. So Mr. Coolidge would enforce respect for the law upon his loyal subjects by means of bayonets and gas bombs! Which hardly can be reconciled with his statements about the purposes and duties of government.</p>
