   <p>What a taste for art, and what a degree of civilization must the English-American press take for granted in its readers, when the papers contain column after column, and page after page with nothing but an elaborate description of a prize fight, the announcement of which had held the American public, in feverish suspense for weeks. A fight in which no decision could be rendered, because the fighters did not fight hard enough, because not enough blood was spilled, because they could still see through their eyes and stand upon their feet, instead of being carried away as a bloody mass of quivering flesh. And it calls itself the most civilized nation on earth! It boasts about its education and culture, and, of its appreciation of art! What a mob, that it can find pleasure in such cruelty! Its hordes are numbered by thousands and reach into the highest social circles. They would be pleased if the Roman gladiatorial fights would be resumed! Many of the "tender-hearted ladies, who now look with contempt upon brave German housewives, would give the sign with downward pointed thumb, like the Roman nobility, to butcher the vanquished victim lying helpless on the ground! Nothing but disgrace to a press, which stoops so low as to arouse and cultivate a taste for these abominations! It arouses a suspicion, indeed, that the English-Irish-Americans are what Napoleon said of the Russians, varnished over barbarians, and that, if the varnish is scratched off, the Sioux Indian appears.</p>
