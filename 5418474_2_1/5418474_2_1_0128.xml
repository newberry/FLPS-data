   <p>The National Prohibition Emergency Committee has accused Postmaster General Farley of using his office to propagandize against Prohibition and to bring about the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. For example, there is no post-office employee, who has not known perfectly well that he could gain and preserve the favor of his chief only by making active propaganda for the repeal of the Prohibition Amendment. The opponents of Prohibition fully appreciate the feelings of their opponents because they have had the same experience for almost a decade and a half. During all these years have not the Prohibitionists scrutinized every representative of the people, testing his sentiments regarding Prohibition and his vote on questions concerning Prohibition? And have they not mobilized all their powers, openly and secretly, against him, if he ever dared to vote differently, or say anything that did not please the Prohibition czar, Wayne B. Wheeler?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0129.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It certainly is unpleasant and not very comfortable to be subject to such permanent restraint, and it is too bad that the Prohibitionists now find themselves in a similar situation. But, strangely enough, the same medicine which they had originally prepared for their opponents, is now the cause of their complaint. They have suddenly discovered that it has a bitter taste. They will not have to swallow it for fifteen years as their opponents did. It is probably that before the year is over they won't have to take it any longer, because by that time the country will have recovered from that medicine fever with which they had inoculated it so insidiously.</p>
   <p>The National Prohibition Emergency Committee should refrain from these preposterous accusations against the Postmaster General. Have they forgotten that at the time when the Anti-Saloon League was boss, Representative Ernest William Upshaw used to ask for the floor of the House at regular intervals to demand categorically that all federal officers be required to take an oath in addition to their regular oath of office, binding them to strict obedience to the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0130.jpg" n="3"/>Eighteenth Amendment? It is a well-known fact that politicians sometimes suffer from a bad memory, but we trust the Committee will still remember this incident. The present Postmaster General doesn't go nearly as far in his demands to the post-office employees as Upshaw did when he made his proposal. Farley does not ask his men to take an oath binding them to agitate for the abolition of the Eighteenth Amendment. He is merely making a suggestion. And it is a good thing that he does because he was appointed Postmaster General by President Roosevelt, and the President was elected by people who favored him primarily because it was known that he might clean up that Augean stable called Prohibition. The President has pledged himself to carry out this mandate of the people and consequently has instructed his cabinet to do their part to redeem this pledge.</p>
   <p>Postmaster General Farley is a member of the cabinet and therefore has to carry out the instructions given him by the president if he cares to hold his job.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0131.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Of course he is only too pleased to carry out the President's orders, because he himself is firmly convinced that the Eighteenth Amendment is the evil mainly responsible for many scandals and corrupt activities which have plagued us during recent years. It is only natural, therefore, that he will do every thing in his power to hasten the repeal of this objectionable Amendment to the Constitution. If he advises his subordinates to do their share to bring about the victory of common sense, we can only agree with him and praise him. He will hardly have to make converts out of his employees. There could not have been many water-wagon fanatics among them anyway, and of the few that might be left, none would be asked to act against the dictates of their conscience. They will not be bothered. But neither will they be permitted to take an official or semiofficial stand against the definite policy of the administration. Every government has the right to demand loyalty from its employees. Disloyal officials, who make propaganda against their superiors or against the government itself, thus undermining its efforts, only jeopardize their own positions.</p>
   <p>One can depend on Postmaster General Farley to keep a watchful eye on his <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0132.jpg" n="5"/>subordinates. The "drys" did the same thing while they were in power. Why should a policy which for a decade and a half was so effective be good no longer? Where is the logic in that? Farley's slogan is, "Do unto others as they do unto you." And that is a perfectly reasonable policy.</p>
