   <p>Next year the presidential election takes place. That explains much, if not everything. If it does not explain the failure of the Sixty-fifth Congress to act during the past few days; if it is not responsible for the fact that, aside from many other very important proposals, bills to appropriate $3,000,000,000 were not disposed of, thereby retarding and hindering the work of the Government, then the nearness of the national election--Presidential as well as Congressional--does explain the strenuous efforts of the Republican National Committee to ascribe the cause of the failure of the great "War Congress" to act during the last days to the Democratic party, the Democratic members of Congress, and the Democratic Administration.</p>
   <p>Because the leading Republican leaders of our country have reason to fear that our citizens will, in the next national election, make those who were instrumental in defeating so many important bills pay for their sins, the Republican National <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0310.jpg" n="2"/>Committee is distributing campaign literature gratis' to all newspapers (there is no other name which could apply to the "announcements," "correspondence," etc., of the "News" Department) in an endeavor to convince the public that the inactivity and inability of Congress and the White House, and not the well-known Republican filibusters, caused the rejection of those bills. [They would have it that] the deplorable situation was due to the disharmony and sluggishness of the Democrats and not to the obstructionist tactics practiced by the Republicans. When this explanation appears too implausible the Republicans try to extenuate or justify the rejection of those important bills in some other way. By doing so the Republican National Committee is skating on thin ice and will only expose itself to the ridicule of less gullible people.</p>
   <p>Thus, for instance, an attempt is being made to justify the failure to pass the bills appropriating money for the army and navy by stating that these bills not only appropriated $2,000,000,000 but also were contrary to legislative customs, inasmuch as they contained new legislation and would have committed the nation to a new military and naval policy. Strictly speaking, this point is <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0311.jpg" n="3"/>well taken. An appropriation bill should not contain new legislation, for every bill should confine itself to its specific object. But, how often, how brutally, and how inconsiderately, this principle has been disregarded--needlessly and inexcusably!</p>
   <p>When they cry about the fact that those bills included new legislation, we are reminded of the old parable of the mote and the beam. If the bills appropriating money for the army and navy contained new legislation, this legislation was necessary and had the approval of the masses of our nation. That is the mote in the eye of the Democrats, of the Administration. By calling attention to it, the Republican leaders remind us of the fact that they not only did not oppose the prohibition rider to the agricultural expansion bill, but even fostered it, and were directly responsible for its passage. And that is the beam in the eye of the Republican leaders and representatives in Congress; the beam which is plainly visible and offensive to the people of our country; the beam which makes the Republicans' howls about the army-navy appropriations bill appear ridiculous.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0312.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Anyone who aids in attaching the "war prohibition" rider to an agricultural bill (even after the war has been concluded) and thus helps to deprive our citizens of their freedom, but nevertheless becomes incensed because an attempt is made to establish a maximum strength for the army and navy, is like a man who yells for the police when a bee steals nectar from his flowers but, when his neighbor is robbed of watch and money says, "Friend, this happened for your own good--lest you, too, be tempted.</p>
