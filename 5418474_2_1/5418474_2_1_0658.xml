   <p>The Chicago Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers' Association) held its regular semi-monthly meeting recently at the North Side Turner Hall. John Feldkamp presided. After reading the minutes of the last meeting (a very brief procedure), and attending to routine business, the bonds of the various officials were considered.</p>
   <p>As Financial Secretary <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Moerle was not present, P. Mueller was appointed to collect the monthly dues.</p>
   <p>P. Enders said that there are at least fifty drug stores in the city which sell more whiskey in a day than he sells in a month. None of these drug stores pays a liquor license, and he would like the committee on legal matters to consider this.</p>
   <p>Schwuchow said that that is true; an acquaintance had asked him yesterday morning <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0659.jpg" n="2"/>to have a drink of whiskey in a drug store. Schwuchow would not partake of anything, but saw his friend being served.</p>
   <p>Bruder and others made similar statements.</p>
   <p>Mueler make a motion that the matter should be referred to a special committee to make a report to the committee on licenses of the city council.</p>
   <p>Somebody suggested that, since the committee on legal matters has nothing much to do at this time, it would be best to present the problem now. The suggestion was accepted.</p>
   <p>In connection therewith, the pool license question was brought up again, and it was shown that the city had tried to collect, although there are prospects that this revenue will not be demanded by the council. The committee on legal matters was asked to act immediately.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0660.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A member declared that the brewers and liquor dealers are in arrears with their dues, and therefore the chairman said that a collector should be employed. A motion was made to this effect, and was passed despite objections, since it was shown that the brewers benefit more by the Wirthsverein than the saloonkeepers, and that the brewers would lose heavily if the tavernkeepers do not prosper; therefore the brewers, as well as liquor dealers, should be treated in the same manner as other members so far as payment of dues is concerned.</p>
   <p>This, then, settled the matter of distinction between brewers and tavernkeepers.</p>
   <p>Mueler read the article, "Barrel and Glass," published in yesterday's Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldcamp said that the saloons which give free lunch, also serve the largest portions of beer. Langenhahn was of the same opinion, and added that the writer of the article was not a tavernkeeper. Baum full agreed with the last paragraph of the article in as far as free lunches were concerned, but with respect to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0661.jpg" n="4"/>the size of glasses, said that conditions are different. No one wants large glasses; if an American drinks two large glasses of beer, he wants small ones after that. The public demand differs in various districts; in some parts of the city, large glasses of beer are expected, and free lunch besides; in other sections, the customers ask for small glasses of beer. The saloonkeepers give the public whatever measure is desired, and the brewers should also be expected to give the right measure.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller said that, if you consider the gallon as it is legally defined and accepted in Chicago (231 cubic inches to the gallon), and beer were measured accordingly, then the tavernkeeper will be cheated out of a half-gallon whenever buying a quarter-barrel of beer. On a thousand quarter-barrels, a saloonkeeper looses fifty-four quarter-barrels which, at present prices, would be a loss of $108 a year. The speaker asked that a special committee be appointed to investigate just how much beer the tavernkeepers can demand, and to take steps towards prosecuting those who cheated.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0662.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A motion was made, and the following gentlemen were nominated to serve on the committee: Peter Mueller, Charles Bruder, and Frank Schroth.</p>
   <p>Baum asked whether it was fair that the citizen whose measures were found to be correct should always pay a fee for subsequent inspections.</p>
   <p>He was told that that is one of the customs of the country. The chairman said that the measures of the tavernkeepers are certified, but that evidently the brewers' barrels are ignored.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller, in referring to the article in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, declared, for the edification of the writer, that the measure used by saloon-keepers is the officially adopted standard pint, but that glasses and steins, are a luxury.</p>
   <p>Schwuchow made a motion not to use the Aurora Turner Hall in the future, because there are never sufficient people present to adopt a resolution; besides, the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0663.jpg" n="6"/>tavernkeeper who sells beer at the hall is not a member of the Wirthsverein. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held at Baum's Park Place Pavilion.</p>
