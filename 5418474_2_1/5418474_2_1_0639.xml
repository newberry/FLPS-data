   <p>The Saloonkeepers' Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon which was not so well attended. The Committee which had been elected at the previous meeting to investigate the accusations against the Republican County Counselor, Candidate Knopf, made its report.</p>
   <p>The Committee stated that the accusations made were perfectly justified, as Knopf as alderman voted for the nomination of fifty temperance spies, though a full explanation as to the true motive of this measure had been given to him by members of the Saloonkeepers' Association. He refused to follow their request to vote against the proposed saying, "What do I care for the Saloonkeepers?" The Committee has been ordered to have printed and distributed 50,000 circulars in which the position of Knopf will be explained. Mr. Clemens communicated that Mr. A. C. Hesing had attacked the president of the Saloonkeepers' Association, John Feldkamp, and his lawyer, Rubens, last Sunday, and accused them of agitating against the Republican party. Mr. Wasserman stated that the Staats Zeitung has attacked him in an article and refused his defensive reply in their columns.</p>
