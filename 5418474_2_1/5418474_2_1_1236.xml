   <p>Large sums of money are to be made available to attract the necessary numbers of visitors to the Fair this year. Tickets are being offered for sale in advance, and the Mayor, too, has used his influence to emphasize the importance of this preliminary sale. It is certainly in the interest of all Chicagoans to do their part in making the Fair a success.</p>
   <p>Though the matter is of great importance to Chicago, yet the efforts that are being made pertain only to the next few months. It may be, and, in any event, it would be very desirable, that the Fair will be so successful this year that it could be made a permanent exhibition. That would certainly be an advantage to Chicago. Still, the Fair would be open only during the summer, even though it were made a permanent institution, and the people who are employed at the Fair would be obliged to seek other employment <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1237.jpg" n="2"/>during the winter.</p>
   <p>Therefore, serious consideration should be given to the provision of opportunity for permanent work for our citizens; otherwise it might happen that a certain part of our population would be attracted to other parts of the country, and a "migration" on a large scale would have an adverse effect upon business in general, and especially upon the value of real estate.</p>
   <p>The surest way to create opportunities for employment is undoubtedly to interest new industrial enterprises in locating here, and the city administration should make vigorous efforts to supply the necessary inducements.</p>
   <p>A large city offers industry certain advantages; smaller cities have certain other advantages. Thus, smaller cities are often in a position to donate the necessary land to industries, and many manufacturers make use of such offers. Chicago cannot compete in this respect, for the real estate situation here differs greatly from that which prevails in smaller cities. Certain cities <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1238.jpg" n="3"/>go a step further, and grant large commercial or industrial firms immunity from taxation for a period of years. Chicago should give this point special consideration. Taxes are a very important item in the cost of industrial operation, for they include not only taxes on land, but also taxes on movable property. Though immunity from taxation for a few years is quite an inducement, industrialists will not fail to inform themselves as to the tax policy which is followed by the cities concerned. And Chicago's present policy would not prove very attractive when compared with the policy in vogue in other cities. Though some effort has been made to reduce local taxes in order to appease our indignant citizenry to some extent, the taxes have not been reduced sufficiently to render then attractive to new industrial enterprises. Our city administration will have to make special efforts to remedy this situation.</p>
   <p>In other respects, Chicago offers advantages that are equal, if not superior, to those of other large urban communities. For one thing, it is centrally located, and that is a very important factor. Then, Chicago is the greatest <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1239.jpg" n="4"/>railroad and air line junction in the world. In addition it has a waterway that, we hope, will soon be extended to the Gulf of Mexico and to the Atlantic Ocean. Then too, Chicago's large population is assurance that industry will have no difficulty in securing sufficient employees in normal times, and that is important to firms that do most of their business during certain parts of the season. Necessary materials can also be had without delay, since every branch of industry is represented here.</p>
   <p>Everything considered, one must conclude that Chicago's chances generally are good, but that taxation remains a sore spot.</p>
