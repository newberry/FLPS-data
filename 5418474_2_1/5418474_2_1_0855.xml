   <p>Increasing unemployment is the subject of discussion in many parts of the United States. The reports of the Federal Employment Bureau seem to confirm the fact that commerce and industry are somewhat slack, evidently because of the uncertainty of future economic conditions. Dullness in business creates unemployment even in normal times, and more so in periods of economic unrest such as we are now experiencing. And the fact that just at this time thousands of soldiers are returning to civilian life and are seeking jobs makes the situation worse. Everyone admires and respects these men who risked their lives for their country, and everyone wishes them success during the future. Certainly they greatly deserve this happiness. But this does not alter the fact that they have greatly swelled the ranks of the unemployed. As a result, the men who were prevented from army service because of age, physical handicaps, or other plausible reasons have found it more difficult <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0856.jpg" n="2"/>to obtain work. But these men and their families also have the right to earn a livelihood.</p>
   <p>If the present period of "watchful waiting" to which commerce and industry have apparently resorted is soon followed by a turn for the better, all unemployed persons can soon be put to work. In any event, the unemployment situation is not as serious in winter as it is in summer (sic). Farmers require help on their fields if they are to produce the food supply of the country. However ways and means should be provided now to improve conditions for those who will be in need of employment next winter. It is predicted that general economic conditions will be more promising next fall for two reasons: (1) because the number of unemployed will be greatly reduced owing to the European emigration expected at that time; and (2) because by that time local industry should be revived by the restoration of normal conditions in Europe, unless unforseen events take place in Europe to destroy this prospect. But in the meantime, the number of unemployed could be reduced even now, if the job hunter tackled the problem with intelligence and deliberation. It is not likely that all applicants could secure jobs by this method, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0857.jpg" n="3"/>but a large number of ambitious, needy family heads might find employment.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the World War began, when millions of men were called to the colors, the shortage of factory and office workers became so acute that women and girls had to be employed to perform industry's most essential tasks. Many, entirely too many, of these women and girls who began working at that time are still holding their jobs. Evidently some of them have gained considerable experience. They are doing their work well, and apparently their employers see no reason why they should be dismissed, even though the War is over and there is no longer a shortage of labor. And yet from the standpoint of our economic structure, it is wrong to permit women to perform work for which men are available. We do not mean that women should not be engaged in some occupations and professions. Women of today are offered employment in an ever-increasing field of industrial activity. A woman who must earn her living, above all an unmarried woman, has just as much right to work as a man. But this is not true of the women and girls who are not forced by necessity to earn their daily bread, and who accept positions merely to escape <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0858.jpg" n="4"/>the supervision of their parents, or to enjoy the independence which their personal income affords. Under present conditions every one of these females is depriving some male family head of the right to make a living for his family. Married women whose husbands earn an adequate salary have the least reason to work to increase the family income. A married woman belongs in her home, in the circle of her family, except in the event of unusual circumstances, such as the illness of her husband, or his inability adequately to support is family. The welfare of a working woman's home, husband, and children must suffer because of her business activity. Financial insecurity, or the opportunity of earning a good salary, has induced many married women to work who previously had had no intention of working. Later, although her husband's salary may have become adequate to meet the family need, she cannot decide to give up the income to which she has become accustomed, even though her activity outside of her home may be undermining the family life. In such cases the employer should be the one to sever the relationship, to provide employment for an unemployed head of a needy family otherwise matters will come to such a pass that the wife will have to work in order to feed and clothe and shelter the family, while the husband takes care of the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0859.jpg" n="5"/>home and minds the children. The outcome may be that the husband will be expected not only to care for the children, but bear them!</p>
