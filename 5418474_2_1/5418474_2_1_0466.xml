   <p>The mass meeting in the interest of the liberal cause, instigated by the United Association for Local Self Government, held in the Vorwaets (Forward) Turnhalle, yesterday, at 12th Street, near Western Avenue, was well attended. In spite of the fact that the hall is not located in a German settlement, a large number of people appeared to obtain elucidation on the serious consequences a prohibition victory night bring. Speakers, both in English and German, explained what the "drying up" of Chicago would mean in the matter of financial curtailment to the city administration as well as to the foreign born element, when we produce restriction of liberty for the individual through the application of a local option law.</p>
   <p>The financial side of the question--how it affects the taxpayer--was treated by Ald. J. Cermak, secretary of the United Association. The repeated applause showed that the audience was fully aware of the situation. As proof of his assertion that the wards with saloons have to defray a large part of the expenses for wards without saloons, Secretary Cermak called attention to the three driest and three wettest wards. The 6th, 7th, and 30th wards belong to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0467.jpg" n="2"/>the first; the 9th, 16th, and 17th to the last category. Taxes, license fees, property tax, etc. produced $1,464,000 for the city, whereas their maintenance requires $2,176,000. The three wettest wards produced $1,319,000 for the administration but only $1,172,000 are needed for their upkeep.</p>
   <p>In the interest of the small taxpayer, concluded the Alderman, it is imperative that he object to the attempt to "dry up" Chicago.....</p>
