   <p>Since people are still commenting on the 1933 report on income tax payments, a few more remarks may be of interest, A comparison of this report with that for 1932 shows that the number of taxpayers whose taxable income was over a million, grew from twenty in 1932 to forty-six in 1933. On the other hand, the total amount collected dropped by about three hundred and fifty million. If it is taken into consideration that a greater percentage of the larger incomes is paid out in taxes, only one conclusion is possible: the incomes in the lower brackets have decreased. This is confirmed by Helvering's report, for the number of taxpayers with incomes of from $1,000 to $25,000 dropped from 3,735,300 in 1932 to 3,634,000 in 1933, and the total amount of income received by this group dropped from $9,834,000,000 to $9,367,000,000.[Translator's note: The Abendpost gives $9,367,000 for the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1212.jpg" n="2"/>second figure. This seems an obvious misprint.]</p>
   <p>At the same time the Security and Exchange Commission has published an order which is of especial interest in connection with what has been said above. In the future all requests for the listing of stock on the exchanges must be accompanied by a report of the names and salaries of the two or three most highly paid officials. It will be questioned whether it is reasonable to require this of all concerns whose securities are listed on the stock exchange. The figures published so far do not permit the drawing of any general conclusion on the matter. Undoubtedly there are a number of firms, however, which have not reduced the salaries of the most highly paid officials in proportion to those of the others, and which have also not been justified in what is still only a partial increase in the salaries of their employees. It is, after all, only human for the most influential persons to think of themselves first, but in doing so they forget the responsibility which they owe to the employees as a whole. In their shortsightedness and <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1213.jpg" n="3"/>selfishness they forget that economic progress can continue only if the buying power of the public increases, and they are knifing themselves when they fight the efforts of the Administration in this direction.</p>
   <p>In this connection, the minimum pay prescribed by the N.R.A. may, to a certain extent, have done more harm than good, for it seemed to give selfish employers some moral justification for paying just the minimum wage, or a little above it. It must be remembered that when Washington sets a minimum wage the employer, whose personal representatives take part in the proceedings, can exert far more influence than can his employees, who are not represented, especially if the employees are unorganized.</p>
   <p>If the Security and Exchange Commission should decide to make its order apply to all concerns whose stocks are listed on the stock exchange, we could get a clearer picture of the situation. As the proverb says, "Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander". Thus the Government would be faced with the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1214.jpg" n="4"/>problem of whether it would be advantageous to require that all concerns furnish exact information on this matter. For here we are dealing not so much with the private rights of the businessman, as with the fact that businessmen have blindly fought the attempts of the Administration to increase the general purchasing power. At the same time, consideration must be given the fact that, with the expected and, to a large extent, already accomplished increase in prices, low wages have the direct effect of lowering the purchasing power.</p>
   <p>In this situation we cannot rest content with information about the salaries of the highest officials, but must also demand information about all the special privileges of these officials--privileges which are very useful to the high officials, but detrimental to the financial condition of the company. Thus, the right to buy stocks at a definite price which is below that of the market, and the right to royalties or other compensation, whether these are actually paid to them, or merely credited to them on the books, must be taken into consideration.</p>
