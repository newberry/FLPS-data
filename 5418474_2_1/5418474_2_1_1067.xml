   <p>The question is often asked, why the nation becomes increasingly degenerated? To me, it is surprising, that meanness and vulgarity did not destroy all of that which is fine and noble in a human being; also that it did not strangulate the interest in progress... I realize now, that I have been an optimist all my life, and am terribly disappointed in coming to the conclusion that all my faith in humanity was only an idle dream... I was one of the crazy ones, who under the leadership of Hecker, fought for liberty and for the establishment of a republic in Germany.... Coming to this country, I have fought with the abolitionists and was an eye witness to the most horrid persecution, to which those valiant combatants for liberty were subjected. And yet, all these can not be even compared to the mad and boundless persecution, and to the moral decay of the present time.... One almost refuses to believe that these inquisitors were born by human mothers, but Raster is even below this type of human beings! I am willing to grant, as so many who come in contact with Raster say, that he is a sufferer from mental derangement caused by immoderate drinking; but the fact, that his written hallucinations and mad outbursts are read by a multitude of people is simply inexplicable....</p>

   <p>I have read the Staats Zeitung for twenty years, and as a past subscriber of that paper for so many years I call on every reader of the Staats Zeitung to discontinue the subscription of that paper, until a more suitable management replaces the present one. It is our duty to put a barrier to planned vileness; else, we have no right to complain about the progress made toward cannibalism. Once more I call on every reader to boycott the Staats Zeitung until it will, through a change of the management declare, that in their opinion the German people are neither idiots, not barbarians nor even swines.</p>
