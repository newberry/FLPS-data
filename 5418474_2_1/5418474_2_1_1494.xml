   <p>Bohlman and Fred Monahan and that they were employed by the Teamsters' Union.</p>
   <p>During the trial of Bohlman and Monahan before Judge Cornelius J. Hartigan (sic), Jarvas refused to identify the two representatives of the Union as his attackers. It developed that he had received numerous telephone calls warning him that great harm would come to him if he made any statements against the defendants. Since Jarvas had already suffered from a sample of the methods which the unions employ against anybody who does not do as they wish, he preferred to make no statements against Bohlman and Monahan, and to join the Union.</p>
   <p>Thereupon he was charged with contempt of court by Judge Hartigan and sentenced to serve ten days in jail. No doubt the verdict of the Judge and the sentence which he imposed were in accordance with the letter of the law; yet the sentence was unjust. While a person can take the exalted position that it is the duty of every citizen to aid in the suppression of crime, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1495.jpg" n="3"/>without giving any thought to possible consequences, nobody can justly expect a citizen to support the authorities unless the latter are able and willing to protect that citizen against any attack by criminals. And in this country the courts cannot meet this condition, especially where violence by unions is concerned.</p>
   <p>A few months ago a teamsters' union decided to force the employees of a bus company to join a union, and resorted to violent measures, throwing stones at bus drivers and passengers and killing a woman. The officials of the union were suspected of having hired men to do the dirty work, and they were prosecuted. The trial lasted several months, and finally all of the defendants were acquitted. Hundreds of similar cases have occurred in America.</p>
   <p>Such experiences will cause even the most loyal citizen to think long before openly opposing professional killers. It certainly is a civic duty, but every citizen has another duty besides his civic duty, and that is the duty <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1496.jpg" n="4"/>of self-preservation. The latter duty demands that a man should not risk his life in this way. The Court ignored this fact. When Jarvas had refused to identify the defendants as his attackers, it was the duty of the authorities to protect him and his family, and then, to get to the bottom of the matter, by investigating the business methods of the unions that prevent loyal citizens from making statements against criminals.</p>
   <p>Now Jarvas is to be tried for perjury, too. Thus the life and business career of a man are being ruined--of a man who is guilty of no offense except that of wanting to preserve his life. What justice, indeed!</p>
