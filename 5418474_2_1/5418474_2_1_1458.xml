   <p>Here is a film which belongs among the best of the German productions. "Hungarian Rhapsody" is its title, and a Hungarian rhapsody are the scenes, the action, the people and the music whose leitmotif is provided by Franz Liszt's compositions. A film undoubtedly of international importance, reminiscent of the best Swedish works, marked with a humor whose effect would not be lost even upon New England, replete with scenic splendors which captivate everyone.</p>
   <p>New York film critics of both the German and English press were warm in their praises of this work, which the director Hanns Schwarz has marked with the stamp of living distinction; a work which has provided the proof that the U. F. A. producer, Erich Pommer, who was so disappointed in Hollywood, knows more about films than he is given credit for in the American film paradise.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1459.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>De facto: (sic): Pommer shows the Hollywood crowd how to produce films.</p>
   <p>Films which have nothing in common with those shabby, cheaply made productions which are turned out by the dozen. Films which have quality. Films such as Murnau began to make, when the talking-picture rage in Hollywood drove out the finest exponents of film art. Films which do not have to rely on the shrillness of our modern talking-pictures in order to retain the waning interest of the masses. Films which even Charlie Chaplin likes to see.....</p>
   <p>The small Bugg theater--small in comparison with the large Loop play-houses--was packed with people who came to do homage to a great German film production. In the midst of their enthusiasm, these people asked, in astonishment, how is it possible that such a film is not shown in the large theaters. This picture was a success throughout the world, and even the hardboiled New York critics praised it as a masterpiece. But in Chicago it is banished to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1460.jpg" n="3"/>the suburbs. And this happens in Chicago, where it is said there are six hundred thousand Germans and a hundred thousand Hungarians. This happens in our city, which has always been regarded as a great German-American center.</p>
   <p>How is it possible? An editorial in the Abendpost of October 30, 1929 gives the answer. That article can also explain to our present readers what our theater owners think of their German and Hungarian paying customers.</p>
   <p>The Fate of German Films in Chicago</p>
   <p>[Translator's Note.--At this point in the present article the editorial is reproduced. Since this editorial has been previously translated (cf. Abendpost of October 13, 1929), the translation will not be repeated here.]</p>
