  <body>
   <p>The adoption of the Temperance Bill in the Senate should awake the Anti-Temperance which was founded here last summer, out of the sleep in which it has indulged since then. Meetings should be called, mass protests stages. We called several times in the autumn, attention to the danger of acceptance of the bill already drafted. Our warning was not heeded... The adoption of the Fill would be the first step for further temperance legislation. What results the apathy of the Chicago Germans has had, one can see from the fact that all of the Senators of Cook County have dared to vote for the Bill.</p>
   <p>According to the Bill, drunkenness in itself, that is to say, without any disturbance of public order, is a punishable misdemeanor. Primarily, however, the Bill is directed against the saloon keepers. These must give a Three Thousand Dollar bail as pledge that they will obey the law; i. e. that they will pay what fines they are assessed in execution of this law. The Bill makes the saloon keepers responsible for every window that an intoxicated customer breaks, for every damage that he does in his own, or another's house. The business of the saloon keepers will be restricted by the Three Thousand Dollar pledge to the richer class, while at the same time, the most <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0759.jpg" n="2"/>malicious charges against them will have a Roman holiday. It would be very wise if the innkeepers would get a legal opinion about the constitutionality of the Bill. It would, in our opinion, necessarily be adverse, and could be sent with other protest to Springfield....</p>
