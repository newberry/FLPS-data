   <p>From the Bureau of Labor at Washington comes the information that prices of food rose during March instead of falling, as was expected in view of the Armistice. The prices on twenty-two different kinds of food were two per cent higher in March than they were in February, and fourteen per cent higher than they were in March, 1918. During the period from March, 1913 to March, 1919, the retail prices of foods in general increased eighty per cent, and the prices for pork, lard, and corn meal increased one hundred per cent--a rise of eighty per cent in the prices of all foods in the short span of six years! That permits the inference that times are "hard"--"hard" in the strict, narrow sense of the word. In this instance, "hard" does not mean what we usually take it to mean. Yes, the prices on all foods are very high--pork, ham, juicy steaks, and other delicacies advanced more than eighty per cent in price--but it cannot be said that privation and misery are apparent. People are not starving, and malnutrition is no more prevalent now than it was in former times when <!-- 5418474_2_1_0851 omitted, duplicate of 5418474_2_1_0852 --> <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0852.jpg" n="2"/>food could be bought for less. Many people are obliged to eat "common" foods which are more wholesome and beneficial than are "rich" foods, and very many may be living better now than they did in times past, not despite the high prices but because of them.</p>
   <p>"Hard" times are often spoken of as an evil visitation, and it is frequently said that money is a curse upon human beings. Yet everybody tries to acquire money or things of monetary value. Today, people for the most part have come to the conclusion that general security is increased proportionately with the acquisition of property, and that all desires and efforts should be directed toward making as many people property holders as it is possible....</p>
   <p>If our people are not complaining, and if some of them are perhaps better off despite high prices, it is due to the fact that high prices are not confined to foods alone but are general. Thus, it appears that "hard" times are desirable, and that high prices should become more general. If "hard" times are oppressive in some quarters, it is because prices for goods and labor are <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0853.jpg" n="3"/>either too high or too low--in other words, because the right balance has not been found. At present, our entire society--workers, manufacturers, and other business men--wittingly or unwittingly, is endeavoring to strike this balance. When it has been found and becomes generally effective, "hard" times will prevail in all parts of our country, and we will have to pay more for everything, much more, than we have previously, though, proportionately, values will remain the same. And will everything be about the same? About the same on the surface--actually, there will be a difference.</p>
   <p>There are people, and there always were people, who spend just as much as they earn and more. These people would lay aside no more if they earned one hundred or five hundred dollars than they would if they earned fifteen or fifty dollars. Most of us would like to save something, at least, whenever possible without too much of a strain. We would not consider it a special sacrifice when we were obliged to dispense with something which others might prize so highly that they would be willing to pay much for it. Fortunately for us, tastes vary. One who does not insist upon keeping abreast of others or upon <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0854.jpg" n="4"/>having and doing what others may have and do, will find that it is less difficult to save now than when times are not so "hard". Most people likewise will save something while prices and salaries are high; they will save, proportionately, much more than during the "better" times. As a result, they will elevate themselves from the position of the "proletariat" who possesses nothing but his strength to work, to that of the property owner who does not live from hand-to-mouth nor from day-to-day, but who thinks ahead and takes an interest in matters of state, in society, and in the great problems which must be solved. This is the manner of responsible and intelligent citizens.</p>
   <p>If general "hard" times do not prove to be immediately beneficial to every individual, they will be in the future for him who avails himself of an opportunity when it presents itself, and for him who economizes. The housekeeper who lets nothing go to waste, but who saves with moderation during these times, will be valuable, more valuable than during "good" times, to us, to the state, and to society as a whole.</p>
