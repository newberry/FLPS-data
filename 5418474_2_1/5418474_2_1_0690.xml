   <p>We expect the mayoral candidate, Mr. Wright will condescend to answer the following questions: Were you ever a member of the Board of Trade? Were you expelled, and why? Were you ever a consistorial member of a Presbyterian congregation, or president of a temperance club? Or, are you still holding such an office which induces you to oppose all liberal views? Be honest! What would you think of a man, Mr.Wright, who is so unprincipled that he denies his convictions; who, although an ardent temperance advocate, desires to appear before voting time as a broad-minded person in order to satisfy his political ambitions, only later to fetter the populace under the yoke of prohibition?</p>
   <p>Do you believe that a man who advocates temperance will be capable of acting liberally, without violating his oath or even committing perjury?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0691.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Have you insisted that your employees shall disregard a "booze bill" which they owe a German saloonkeeper, after these workers became indebted with your consent? Were not these men threatened with dismissal if they paid the seventy dollars?</p>
   <p>Much depends upon your answers; it will be shown thereby whether you deserve the vote of liberally inclined people and, especially, the tavernkeepers. Mere excuses, such as a statement that your name was used by the prohibitionists without your consent, cannot be regarded as tangible evidence. Indefinite answers, or an entire disregard of these questions, will be regarded by us as an admission that the accusations herein enumerated represent the truth, and we intend to act accordingly.</p>
   <p>The undersigned represent the many tavernkeepers who are disgusted with the temperance humbug:</p>
   <p>T. Mueller, L. Schwuchow, Ch. Bruder.</p>
