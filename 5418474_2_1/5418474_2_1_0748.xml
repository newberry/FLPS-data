   <p>Thanks to the insight and indulgence that the police and police court officials of the North Side have shown, the tavern keepers of the North Side have so far suffered little from the Sunday Law. Wherever it was possible the police did not notice when people entered and left saloons, and if one tavernkeeper or other was indicted, the judge let him so unpunished, or with only a light fine. That this will be done in future, too, the character of the chief of the North Side police and of the police judge is assurance; that is to say, as long as the tavernkeepers through a little compliance with the law, by keeping doors closed and curtains down, make it possible for them to close an eye. But everybody must realize that all this has its limits; that Messre Gund and subordinates are first of all officials, and that they are breaking their path if they do not try to prevent open and wanton law infractions. It would be highly regrettable if some tavernkeepers by ignoring the law completely - as happened last Sunday - would force Mr. Kaufuann to in ose higher fines. With a little caution a little bit of good will not to run <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0749.jpg" n="2"/>counter to the law as long as it unfortunately exists, the tavernkeepers can save themselves and the officials who are on their side all annoyance.....</p>
   <p>It goes as a matter of course that the Staats-Zeitung does not intend to help the temperance people to attain their aims. Perhaps today's warning would not have been necessary if the Vorwarts meeting had been conducted by men who did not only care for their own a ego, but for the whole, and if every tavernkeeper who was present had obligated himself to keep open on Sunday all consequences to be born in common.</p>
   <p>......Our warning is caused by hints that have been made to us, evidently with the desire to see them published.</p>
