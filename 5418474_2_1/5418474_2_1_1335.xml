   <p>Up to last Friday night only 126 million dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds had been purchased in Chicago and Cook County. All over the country the situation is hardly more cheering. So far about half of the six-billion-dollar loan has been subscribed.</p>
   <p>This is a shameful thing for the country. It is difficult to find a satisfactory or plausible excuse.</p>
   <p>When America entered the war there were considerable misgivings. Many good Americans did not think it possible for America to raise an army of millions in a sufficiently short time to participate in the war effectively. Others doubted the possibility of obtaining enough boats to transport the troops; others, again, thought it would be impossible to provide the troops with <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1336.jpg" n="2"/>provisions, clothes, and ammunition after they had landed in Europe. It was doubted whether enough officers could be furnished for the newly conscripted men and whether an efficient army could be raised on short notice with millions of rookies--and so on. Doubts and apprehensions of every kind, in every field, except one: that the great and wealthy America would find it hard to raise the necessary cash. Practically nobody ever thought of that. America's financial power was never doubted, nor was the willingness of the people to put the necessary funds at the disposal of the government.</p>
   <p>But the unexpected always happens. This case is no exception. All doubts that had been voiced were refuted gloriously. The country did an admirable job of building up the army and navy, of supplying provisions and transportation. The people themselves marvelled at the efficiency that was displayed in handling these difficult problems successfully. The citizen is amazed at the results and inclined to ask how was it possible, if he is told that today, a year and a half after the declaration of war, an American <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1337.jpg" n="3"/>army, one million nine hundred thousand strong, is in Europe, trained for battle and victorious, and provided, without interference, with all necessities.</p>
   <p>But quite a different picture is presented if we look at the financial side of it. Rich America, always so proud of its wealth and its business sense, finds it difficult to raise the Fourth Liberty Loan; labors so hard at the task of buying six billion dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds that today, after two thirds of the allotted time has elapsed, only half of it has been subscribed, and one finds it necessary to resort to parades and other circus stunts to promote the loan.</p>
   <p>It is not that the money can't be raised. Whoever says that only shows his lack of sense in regard to finance and politics. American could raise twice the amount in the time prescribed without any artificial stimulation, parades, etc., if it really cared to and had the right appreciation of the problem. Here is where the fault lies primarily.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1338.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This does not apply so much, however, to the masses of the people. It is admitted that the "little man" subscribed eagerly and generously, but how about the big ones? The great corporations and financial institutions are holding back. Why? They themselves will know the answer best. We can only draw conclusions which are not pleasant and not at all flattering to these "big ones".</p>
   <p>It seems to be out of the question, of course, to assume that in high business and financial circles the value and security of the Liberty Bonds are not fully appreciated. It is certain that these circles could have subscribed the whole six billion dollars in a few days. Since it was not done and the "big shots," even today, are still holding out, one cannot help wondering if party politics and interests have something to do with it. Maybe they do not want to see the government score a success with the loan; maybe they begrudge the government the chance to win a glorious, just, and lasting peace.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1339.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>They figure it this way: If to the success on the battlefields of France a great financial success is added here in America, by a rapid oversubscription of the Fourth Liberty Loan, the confidence of the people in the present administration and party in power will be strengthened to such an extent that the government will not only have a free hand in the conduct of the war and in the formulation of the peace terms, but will also emerge victorious in the coming elections, and remain in power for another two years to pursue its political and economic plans during the first years of peace; and that this all will be to the disadvantage and vexation of the plutocrats who sit on their moneybags.</p>
   <p>We owe it to the opposition of big business and high finance that the subscription drive is making such slow progress; and this opposition, in turn, can be traced to the close connection of big business with non-American interests and their natural hostility toward the Democratic party and administration, which has pursued a genuinely democratic policy. This <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1340.jpg" n="6"/>opposition means hostility toward the interests of the American masses; it is trying to postpone the end of the war for the sake of selfish interests. It is un-American and undemocratic. To render it powerless, to make the Loan a splendid success, in spite of it, by a quick oversubscription, and thereby to secure a lasting peace--this is the duty of the democratic masses and of every good citizen for the sake of the future and of peace, which the whole world desires.</p>
   <p>To subscribe, and subscribe as never before, should be the answer of every good democratic citizen to the un-American, disloyal conduct of the "big ones"--the internal enemies of a democratic republic.</p>
