   <p>If an Irish tenant who is able, declines to pay his rent, an eviction follows under the sheriff's direction. In that case the American press voices strenuous objections. Those who resist the dispossession proceedings with physical force are even elevated to the status of "heroes."</p>
   <p>In contrast to this, the very same press is perfectly reconciled to the administration of American law when it is applied to the abused and maltreated miners, the victims of the "American" coal barons. Only recently, indebted coal diggers at Walston, Pa. have been mercilessly driven from huts by Pinkerton's hirelings where they so journed under the yoke of heavy rentals, while laboring for the company. Italians and Slovaks have been induced to cross the boundry of Pennsylvania under false pretenses, to replace those workers who would not tolerate further inhuman <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1371.jpg" n="2"/>oppression by their masters. Indeed, they are so frugal that they have been given the appellation of "European-Chinese." Despite their frugality, really penury, they cannot subsist on their meager emoluments, which is akin to death by starvation. Do they not deserve as much sympathy as the begging Irish.</p>
