   <p>There is a movement on foot, which will probably show itself at the proper time, to insert such a provision in the new city charters as to prohibit instruction in German in the public schools in all grades below high schools. So far as Chicago is concerned, it is generally conceded that German instruction is a humbug. While some German is taught, no doubt, the pupils who do not study it are retarded in their studies, and a good deal of demoralization is occasioned on account of the introduction of a branch of instruction which has no place in the graded course. At least, these are some of the alleged reasons for which it is proposed to place the restrictive clause in the new charters. It is said that the universal testimony of the principals and teachers of the Chicago public schools is that the introduction of German into the public schools has been injurious.</p>
