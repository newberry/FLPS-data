   <p>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</p>
   <p>Prohibition does not take into consideration such an insignificant matter as our Federal Constitution. In Alabama, officers who look for violators of the Prohibition law have the pleasant habit of searching people without first going to the trouble of obtaining a warrant. These officers are well rewarded if they succeed in establishing a case. Many people whose persons and effects have been searched know their rights, but are either indifferent or without the necessary means to protect them. But fortunately there are <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0304.jpg" n="2"/>exceptions.</p>
   <p>Recently the father of a Birmingham attorney died in his rural home. A week after the funeral, the son gathered the clothes, books, etc., of the deceased and turned them over to a drayman with instructions to deliver the effects to his (the son's) home in the city. In town the dray was halted by two Prohibition officers who insisted on searching the effects. The attorney, who refused to permit them to make a search without a warrant, was arrested and taken to a police station. There he was booked under the general charge of "disorderly conduct". The officers proceeded to make the search. The next day it was proved in court that the officers had found no intoxicants, and also that they had no right to make a search or an arrest in a questionable case.</p>
   <p>"If a man is good-natured," said the Birmingham chief of Police, "and is not obstinate when officers of the law search his property for spirituous liquors, everything will turn out well."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0305.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And indeed, why should a man be considered "obstinate," when laws and Constitutional rights are violated in the name of holy Prohibition. The City Commission of Birmingham said that "unlawful arrests and searches are necessary to prevent mass smuggling of whiskey". If a choice must be made between Prohibition and the Federal Constitution, only a rum-soaked drunkard will dare defend the Constitution of the American Republic.</p>
