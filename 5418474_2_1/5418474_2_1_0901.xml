<title level="a">THE FATE OF GERMAN FILMS IN CHICAGO</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Were it only a matter of an isolated instance instead of a common practice, and were the films considered here an inferior German product, then there would be no reason for writing about them in the editorial columns. The boycott of German films in Chicago has grown to such disgraceful proportions as to make us ponder about the fate of all the German pictures which passed the largest theaters of metropolitan New York with the most commending criticism. Here after appearing in small suburban theaters, they vanish through stage trap-doors into the nether world, at least so far as their further presentations are concerned. Considerable attention has been given to the fact that powerful theatrical concerns are intent in ignoring German films, regardless of their artistic value. Only in unavoidable <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0902.jpg" n="2"/>cases, and apparently in compliance to the dictates of large distribution houses, have German celluloid creations been given admittance to the Loop. Otherwise, the large percentage of German art enthusiasts, who constitute a great part of Chicago's cinema public, have been given almost no consideration.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Germans are good supporters of picture houses, and this is a fact which no theater owner would deny. Millions of their dollars flow annually to our entertainment tycoons, and it is only right that their demand be satisfied occasionally. In Hollywood, where America is considered as a unit, a sort of bird's eye view of popular trends, these wishes are respected, and it is here that there is no discrimination against German subjects, artists, or music. Proof of this is the fact that they are making preparations at present to produce large American films with German dialogues and songs, for consumption in Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. These films will be available in their <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0903.jpg" n="3"/>English version, then they are rephotographed in their entirety with the German text.</p>
   <p>Obviously, Hollywood, with business uppermost in mind, recognizes the German-American's sentiments. The Chicago theaters, however, display a certain reluctance to select pictures that appeal to the Germans.</p>
   <p>The following is an example: The UFA film "Hungarian Rhapsody," a masterpiece of German creation and manufacture, which was tumultuously acclaimed by the New York public and the press, and which only first-class theaters presented, reached several months ago and was shown to a critic of the Abendpost, who fully concurred with the New York newspaper fraternity. Despite its artistic value, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0904.jpg" n="4"/>this film found no acceptance among Chicago's largest houses, so that it had to be given to an independent Loop theater that caters zealously to the German interests. Here the picture was shown, but nothing developed. Inquiries at the management disclosed that a large Chicago concert hall had accepted the film for a first showing in Chicago. Then followed another lapse, after which the large hall released the film to a suburban theater on the North Side. It is through these maneuvers that a film of great drawing power in New York, a recognized classical work of undeniable artistry, is relegated to Chicago's outskirts.</p>
   <p>It is about time that Chicago's large Teutonic population asserts itself in the matter of German films. We must remember that these theaters, after all, are largely dependent on the Germans for their income.</p>
