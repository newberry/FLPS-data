  <body>
   <p>We present herewith a very drastic picture showing the futility of the midnight closing ordinance and, incidentally, the utter lack of intelligence on the part of our police:</p>
   <p>William Kosek, who has a saloon at the corner of Throop and 15th Streets, believes in law and order and usually closes even before 11 P. M. Recently a neighbor called at a late hour and sought solace in a few drinks because of an altercation at home; a customary procedure under the circumstances. When the midnight hour approached Kosek told the man it was time to go home and the guest departed.</p>
   <p>As Kosek was closing the door three intoxicated men squeezed in and asked for beer, which he refused to serve because it was so late at night. The three then <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0645.jpg" n="2"/>began to fight among themselves, probably as a ruse so that Kosek would interfere and thus give them an opportunity to rob him, since they may have seen him put the day's receipts into his pocket.</p>
   <p>He did not act according to their plan but went to the rear and called his wife out of bed. When the three ruffians still refused to leave he went out to get a policeman. He found an officer soon enough and both entered the saloon, but when the officer saw the trio he somehow lost his courage and thought it advisable to get reinforcements; Kosek was to give the men anything they ordered and retain them until more officers of the law could appear on the scene.</p>
   <p>Whether Kosek followed these instructions or not was not ascertainable, but apparently he did not serve them anything.</p>
   <p>As soon as three officers entered the tavern the toughs departed hurriedly and the officers did not apprehend them. The representatives of law and order then told Kosek that it was 12:20 P. M., that he had kept his place open beyond the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0646.jpg" n="3"/>midnight hour; and that they would have to report him.</p>
   <p>Kosek received a court summons yesterday.</p>
   <p>The Wirthsverein (Saloonkeepers' Association) will defend him.</p>
