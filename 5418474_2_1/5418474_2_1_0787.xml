   <p>This being reported from the three main police stations that altogether about 60 Innkeepers have been denounced for not closing their inns (on Sunday). Nothing as yet has happened to them, but the denunciation is bad enough...The root of the evil-as we said on occasion of the Leonard Scanland Murder trial is the desire to save face... If every German were to carry around in his coat pocket his bottle of beer and were secretly to take a swig in this and that corner, nobody would care...Is it not the same thing with prize-fighting which is being severely punished but attended neverthe less always by the highest officials?</p>
   <p>The personified illustration of this face saving attitude, the most consummate representative of hypocricy is(chief of police) Mark Sheridan. He and Mayor Mason, the products of the greatest hypocritical movement, the People's Reform-Swindle of 1869, are responsible for the newly started policy of intolerance.</p>
   <p>We soon will have occasion to show how from this side also other German interests are opposed, and the German influence is being systematically undermined.</p>
