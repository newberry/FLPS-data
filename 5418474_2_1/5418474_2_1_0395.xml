   <p>Let no one think that the "apostles of dryness" will rest upon their laurels after having so "fortunately" solved the liquor question with the help of fickle legislators. For they are contemplating an attack on the "poisonous weed," and will apply methods similar to those which proved so effective in the fight against liquor. In a preliminary skirmish a well-known Prohibitionist calls attention to the great number of infants and children who die every year because their fathers blew tobacco smoke into their faces. A very auspicious beginning, indeed! No doubt tea and coffee, which contain a certain percentage of "dope," will soon have their turn. Even the movies will have to vanish from the face of the earth.</p>
