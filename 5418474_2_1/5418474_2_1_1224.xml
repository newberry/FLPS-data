   <p>It is an old principle derived from experience that big political campaigns always have a bad influence upon business conditions. This has proved true in the present campaign. But this campaign differs from all previous ones in the way in which the Republican press, as well as the campaign speakers of the party, spread a pessimistic attitude for partisan purposes. In former presidential campaigns the situation was usually such that industry slowed down its pace during the election year. This was entirely natural because at that time Republicans advocated! high protective tariffs while the Democrats wanted moderate tariffs. Naturally the industrial production was influenced by the position of the two parties, and it was only natural for the manufacturers to cut down their production in order not to be left with a large stock on hand in case of a Democratic victory, which would result in the reduction of tariffs on goods from abroad.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1225.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For many years there has been no fundamental difference in the tariff policies of the two parties. The campaign speakers of the Republican party are now preaching that the economy will be completely ruined under the present Administration; that the Administration is doctrinaire and radical, and has no understanding of the practical needs of the economy. They further declare that taxes will climb immensely, and that it is immaterial to the businessman whether he earns any money or not, since it will be taxed away from him in any case.</p>
   <p>This party also maintains than money no longer has any definite value, that the Government is systematically robbing the owning classes by reducing the value of the dollar to sixty cents. It is pointed out that the President has already received from. Congress the authority to devalue the dollar further, and that under these circumstances there is no point whatever in doing business, in earning money or in investing money in productive enterprises.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1226.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This picture of the economic situation is one-sided and false. The Republican press and the spokesmen of the party purposely keep silent about the fact that a whole series of great commercial and industrial countries have abandoned the gold standard, among then even England, whose conservative policies have been proverbial for centuries. Furthermore, they fail to mention the fact that the devaluation of the dollar has an effect only upon commercial transactions with foreign countries, that this devaluation is only artificial, and that every dollar in circulation is backed by three times as much gold as is prescribed by law. They also suppress the fact that the price structure, which is certainly a very important factor in industry, does not depend entirely upon the value of the currency, but that this represents only a relatively unimportant factor in the fixing of prices.</p>
   <p>Beyond a doubt this systematic campaign to destroy confidence has had a certain effect upon the business world, which has been made timid by five years of severe depression. And this propaganda is especially harmful <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1227.jpg" n="4"/>because everybody knows that the present Administration will remain at the helm for two more years, at least, no Matter how the Congressional elections on November 5 turn out. The businessmen who are affected by this propaganda see a future that is not gray, but deepest black. Their energy and enterprising spirit are paralyzed; they work themselves into a mood of defeatism, and it is clear that this mood will affect the whole business world. It is fortunate that the campaign will soon be over, for otherwise business would come to a complete standstill.</p>
