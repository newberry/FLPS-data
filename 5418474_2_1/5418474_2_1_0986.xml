   <p>Professor J. L. Laughlin, who taught at the University of Berlin last year, gave a lecture last night at the Recital Hall regarding his impressions of Germany.</p>
   <p>First of all, Professor Laughlin stated, the representatives of Science in Germany are enjoying more respect than our American Scientists and Educators. Great value and attention is given there to any theories, findings and discoveries of Science, whereas in this country American Scientists and Educators very often meet with mockery or lack of interest from the public.</p>
   <p>There still can be noticed, Professor Laughlin said, a remarkable gap between old Germany and the new Germany.</p>
   <p>The old Germany consists of the Aristocracy and the Bureaucracy with its unearned privileges and outlived rules. The new Germany is the undaunted, daring <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0987.jpg" n="2"/>ambition of the present German middleclasses, which are controlling the labor masses, and the cooperating Industrialists, who are forcing the German States-men towards a policy of commercial and territorical expansion.</p>
   <p>While German exportation has conquered the world-market, the German nation has been gradually convinced by its industrial leaders, that the future of their country is based on Commerce and Industry. Subsequently German agriculture is losing ground as the backbone of its national existence. The future will show, if Germany has chosen the right way.</p>
   <p>The Socialistic movement in Germany. Professor Laughlin continued, is not merely a practical realization of the Karl Marx doctrine, but more distinctively a progressive rearrangement of labor interests and the introduction of protective labor laws. Towards this new status, German Commerce and Industry show a marvelous ability of adaption.</p>
   <p>Apparently unaffected by this reforming process of German national life, the Kaiser, the various Kings and Princes, are still enjoying and undisturbed independence of Feudal Brilliancy in Germany. On the other side, the German nation's pride in its vast army includes its inherited fondness of a ruling dynasty.</p>
