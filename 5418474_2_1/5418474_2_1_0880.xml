   <p>The German Evangelical Lutheran Churches of the south and south-west side of Chicago celebrated yesterday at Cheltenham Beach a mission holiday. it is customary with the Lutherans of the Missouri Synod to do so once every year. Usually several congregations celebrate together. The purpose of these meetings and festivals is to encourage the Lutherans, through sermons and personal reports, to assist their fellow-countrymen and believers in this country who are not as yet enjoying the blessings of church and school. This is being done by educating and sending itinerant preachers. The Missouri Synod has already equipped and sent into the South, the West, and the Northwest of the United States a goodly number of these preachers.</p>
   <p>The eight congregations which had assembled to celebrate this holiday, were those of Rev. L. Hoelter, A. Wagner, H. Engelbrecht. J. Rosenwinkel, L. Lochner, W. Uffenbeck, J. Streckfuss, and C. Leeb. There were approximately 3,000 persons present.</p>
   <p>Rev. J. Schuette of Milwaukee delivered an excellent and touching sermon in <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0881.jpg" n="2"/>the forenoon, and Pastor Leeb gave a splendid lecture of missions during the afternoon. The audience was highly edified by the recitals of many beautiful songs and hymns.</p>
   <p>As closely as can be estimated now, a total amount of $1,000 will be the financial outcome of this splendid festival. This sum will be of considerable help to the work of the home missions.</p>
