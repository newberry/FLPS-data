   <p>"Editor of Illinois Staats Zeitung: 'Our beloved son died several days ago. He had attended the private school of Rabbi F. Schauer, and through his unusual talents and mental alertness he had become the favorite student of his teacher. It is therefore not strange that we requested Rabbi Schauer to speak a few words at the grave of our mutual darling.</p>
   <p>"However, my son was buried at the Concordia Cemetery, which belongs to a very strict Lutheran Church. Their teachings and regulations do not tolerate ministers of other Christian churches, or non- Christian ministers to observe sacred rites upon this cemetery. We had not thought of this in our deep sorrow. Rabbi Schauer had just started to speak, when he was asked by the superintendent of the cemetery to stop at once.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1064.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Of course Rabbi Schauer immediately complied with their request, since none of us had any intention of violating the existing rules and thereby started a fight.</p>
   <p>"We request the editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung to publish in its columns the excellent speech of Rabbi Schauer, H. Kupferschmidt."</p>
