   <p>In yesterday's issue of the Chicago Times we read that until a few years ago, Chicago in its observation of the Sabbath was strongly under the spell of Calvinism. It was not Christianity but Calvinism which dominated here. All the wordly entertainments were under the ban of public opinion as well as of the law. All of this underwent a change. Real christianity conquered over the dark spirit of the religious ardour of Calvinism; - the Sabbath is now supposed to be here for man, not man for the Sabbath. Lectures dealing with scientific questions are given on Sundays now, with a much better attendance than that of the churches. There are concerts, theatres, etc.</p>
   <p>It would have been easy for the "Times" to say, that Colvin was the victor over Calvin! - But every child knows that the crumbling of the repulsive Calvinistic Sunday bigotry never could have been accomplished out for the victory of the popular party in the year of 1873. - At that time Colvin was against Calvin. - Had he been defeated, yesterday's article could not have been published by the Times; The detestable, hateful and malicious Sunday <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0719.jpg" n="2"/>tyranny would have become "trump". - The election of Colvin by a majority of 11,000 votes was evidence enough for believers of Calvinism, that they cannot succeed against the fresh and happy outlook on life as Luther did, with lamentations, scoldings and ragings from the speakers pulpit as their only consolation.</p>
   <p>This of course the "Times" could not admit, it would not be in accord with their insane and infamous language used in 1873 against the popular party. Newertheless the fact remains, that the welcome change of Sunday worship in Chicago, occurred not with the aid but against the raging opposition of the "Times".</p>
