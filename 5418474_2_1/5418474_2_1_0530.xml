  <body>
   <p>As the Coliseum was not free for the 25th of March, the date fixed for the protest meeting against the new course of Mayor Dunne (not to issue any more permits for the serving of alcoholic drinks at meetings and festivals), it had been decided in a meeting of the executive committee, held last night in the Sherman House, to rent the Armory of the 1st Regiment, which is supposed to hold the same number of people as the Colisuem.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a number of Bohemian and Polish representatives of associations were present and wished to take part in the protest meeting. The finance committee stated that as a first contribution it had received $50 from the Chicago Gymnastic Club towards the cost of the protest affairs, which are considered to be very high. As it is necessary to develop a very active agitation, which naturally will cause great expense, all clubs, associations, lodges, etc., are requested to send their checks and monetary contributions to the treasurer, Franz Arnberg, 156 W. Washington street. The list of the speakers has not been completely fixed yet, but will be presented to the committee next Tuesday night at the Sherman House meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0531.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The press committee has issued the following appeal to the German associations and German-American citizens: In the name of law and order a crusade has been started against the absolutely harmless clubs of the poor man. The mayor of the cosmopolitan City of Chicago has been forced by the State's Attorney and Grand Jury to refuse even to the most worthy associations and clubs the permit for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Because there are a few vice-producing dance halls in Chicago, it has been decided to forbid also respectable amusement places. The opportune festivals and picnics of the numerous song, sport, and gymnastic clubs and benevolent and aid societies, snall lodges, etc., are placed on the same level with the orgies of the condemned and criminal vice dens. Against this unjust, unnecessary and narrow-minded policy, an immense protest should be lodged. We therefore invite all free-minded and unprejudiced citizens of Chicago to a large mass meeting, which has been called for next Sunday, March 25, at 3 o'clock P.M., at the First Regiment Armory, Michigan Avenue and 16th Street, where it will be decided what lawful steps will have to be taken to recapture the right of the people to amuse themselves in their own way.</p>
