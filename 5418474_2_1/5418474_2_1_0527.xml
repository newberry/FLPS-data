   <p>From the 16th to the 21st of this month a further trial will be held before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives with reference to the Hepburn-Dolliver Prohibition Bill; but only for members of the Congress.</p>
   <p>It will therefore be necessary for the German associations to ask immediately their Representatives and Senators to agitate before the Judiciary Committee from the 16th to the 21st against the Hepburn-Dolliver Prohibition Bill to have as many members of Congress as possible against it.</p>
   <p>It is also important that the German associations of such states, which have members of Congress in the Judiciary Committee to approach them for their support in the matter. By a prompt fulfillment of the above request the German associations can effectively participate in the fight against prohibition.</p>
