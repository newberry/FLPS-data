   <p>The city council has relegated the traction ordinance, which our citizens accepted three years ago, to the rubbish heap. While it is still possible that the ordinance will be enforced, since the transportation companies have until April 3 to agree to accept it, there is little or no hope that they will do so. When the ordinance, after endless debates and arguments, had finally been submitted to the people for adoption or rejection, many optimistic people believed that the transportation problem was solved for decades to come.</p>
   <p>The press and many other people pointed to the evidently grievous faults of the ordinance. They emphasized that it offered the public no advantages whatever, but favored Mr. Insull, who was then at the peak of his power, in every respect. However, it did at least give prospect of the erection of a <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1232.jpg" n="2"/>subway street car line and of an extension of the present street car system. Had the transportation lines consented to the ordinance, the transportation problem would be closer to solution, and the stagnation which was caused by politicians who made a football of the transportation matter would have been ended. That is why the press urged the people to accept the ordinance, despite its many faults.</p>
   <p>And the ordinance was adopted by a wide majority; and still nothing was done. In order to insure enforcement, it was necessary to induce the holders of the securities of the existing transportation companies to agree to the provisions of the ordinance, and especially to its plans to reorganize the finances of the corporations. That was never done. About six months ago, Mayor Kelly directed a sharp warning to the interested groups, and then the attorneys for the security holders stirred into lively activity. A little later, Judge Wilkerson threatened to take summary action. Soon it was reported that an agreement could be expected within a short time. This report proved to be premature.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1233.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A few days ago, Mayor Kelly made a public statement in which he declared that the ordinance was no longer adequate to the transportation requirments of Chicago and that he considered it best to drop it. He made a recommendation to this effect to the city council, and the recommendation was adopted by that body. So the city is just where it always was. The battles in the last legislature and in the city council, the fights behind the scenes where Sam Insull's graft money played an important part, the campaign for and against the ordinance, and the voting on the issue were all in vain. The ordinance has been scrapped, and its parent and sponsor, Samuel Insull, is riding about in a gondola on the Mediterranean Sea, a fugitive from justice.</p>
   <p>On recommendation of the Mayor, the city council has decided to draft a new ordinance, which all the mistakes and faults of the discarded ordinance are to be avoided. At the same time the city law department has been instructed to file proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission with reference to the introduction of universal transfers between the surface and elevated roads and the bus lines. The council also resolved to renew the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1234.jpg" n="4"/>franchise of the street car lines from day to day. The council took this step to put pressure on the holders of securities of the corporations, to render them more amenable to an amalgamation of the transportation companies; for if the franchise is not extended, the companies will have to cease operating, and their securities will be worthless.</p>
   <p>Transportation matters have always been among the darkest pages in the history of Chicago. True, there never was a lack of adventurous and courageous men who were willing to furnish the city with newer and better means of transportation. However, from the very beginning, graft and corruption played no small part in the organization of transportation companies. The public was most brutally exploited; and still the surface and elevated lines have been bankrupt for years, because their capital stock is watered, and because their enormous income cannot withstand the continuous bleeding and financial schemes of politicians.</p>
   <p>We remember--with mixed feelings--the traction magnate Charles Yerkes, who <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1235.jpg" n="5"/>came to Chicago after he had served a prison term in Philadelphia. He immortalized himself by magnanimously donating the observatory bearing his name to the University of Chicago. It was claimed at that time that he wanted to draw the attention of his fellow citizens to the stars, so , they would not notice what he was doing with their property; the same principle is in vogue today. Our means of transportation are expensive but poor, and the thought that some of our street cars remind us of the heroic time of the Civil War is but small consolation for their lack of comfort. The resolutions of the city council close a period of the history of Chicago's transportation. What will the next period be like?</p>
