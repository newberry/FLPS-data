   <p>After the recently proposed streetcar ordinance was rejected at the fall election, a lull apparently occurred in attempts permanently to solve the streetcar problem. But this quietness was prevalent only on the surface. Under the surface those of the "people's representatives" who are friendly to the corporation were feverishly planning and burrowing, for the closer the time when the present ordinance will terminate, the poorer the prospects of obtaining a renewal of the existing contract, or a new contract containing similarly favorable terms. On April 1, 1927 the stock of the streetcar company will be rated according to the value of the tangible property of the company, and fictitious values, acknowledgment of which was one of the chief objects of the proposed franchise which was rejected, will be out of the question.</p>
   <p>"Something must be done," said the streetcar magnates to one another, "and that right soon, or the time will actually come when the city will take charge <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1305.jpg" n="2"/>of the local transportation system and then the millions in profits which accrue annually will flow into the city's treasury."</p>
   <p>The transportation committee of the City Council is so generally mistrusted, and the ordinance outline prepared by Walter L. Fisher, the expert, is so unmistakably labeled "made by the traction companies," that it was necessary to engage new artists to make fools of the public. And lo! suddenly some of the "most prominent businessmen of Chicago" meet and appoint a committee of three who are to take over the streetcar problem, to assure the city of satisfactory service, and to save the streetcar company from bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>To show that they are impartial, one of the members of this committee declared that they are not prejudiced as far as the rights and wrongs of the opposing interests are concerned; that representatives of both the streetcar company and the city had made statements before the State Public Utilities Commission, but had offered no proofs; that it is necessary to determine whether or not the Commission has these proofs, and to disclose them eventually for <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1306.jpg" n="3"/>the information of the public; and that the task of the committee is difficult indeed; but that it would spare no pains in an effort to enable the streetcar company to render good service.</p>
   <p>While we do not know who the "prominent businessmen" are who assumed the authority to invest a committee of their own choice with the duty of solving the streetcar question, we do know that no private group of a few citizens, no matter what their standing in the business world is, can deprive Chicago's two million inhabitants of their right of self-determination--at least in regard to a question which they decided and discarded only two weeks ago. From the whole tone of the interview which was delivered to the press one can readily recognize the efforts to enable the streetcar company to fleece the riding public in Chicago during the coming decades and to treat just requests with sneers. This is the only possible explanation for the committee's statement that assertions were made before the State Utilities Commission for which no proof was offered. In order to refresh the memory of the "committee" a bit, we call its attention to the fact that a year ago the streetcar company testified before the Board of Review that fifty-five million dollars' worth of its stock is represented by <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1307.jpg" n="4"/>property which no longer exists (for instance, the cables, cable channels, rails, etc., which were removed from the streets and junked in 1907 and 1908)and that the company should not be taxed for such materials. Yet the company included this $55,000,000 in the valuation which it mentioned in the rejected ordinance, and it demands that the city guarantee six and one-half per cent interest on this sum. Again, the company did not include the amount of $55,000,000 in the estimate which is contained in the corporation's request that the Public Utilities Commission grant an increase in the fare rate from five to seven cents. And a statement of the City Comptroller shows how little reason there is to fear that the streetcar company will have to go into bankruptcy. According to this report, the company, despite its heavily watered stock and poor management, earned a net profit of $865,501.48, and of this sum the city will receive fiftyfive per cent, or $476,797.77 (sic). In January of that year the profit was $494,797.77 above the cost of operation (sic). During the first eleven years of the period in which the present franchise has been in force the stockholders received dividends which exceeded the amount of the face value of their stock. The gross profit for the year beginning in February, 1918, and ending in January, 1919, amounted to $3.664,431.16. The profit for January may be larger than <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1308.jpg" n="5"/>stated, because transportation has greatly increased since many soldiers have returned home. And in the face of these facts the company talks about bankruptcy and the necessity of increasing fares.</p>
   <p>The sudden appearance of a "committee" composed of businessmen, who would save the City of Chicago the trouble of solving the streetcar question according to its wishes, is so similar to the methods which were used heretofore that one suspects the fine Italian hand of Walter L. Fisher. But this scheme to side-track the idea of municipal ownership will prove to be of no avail. The patience of the people of Chicago has been tried severely and, as a result, they have learned that public evils are not cured by covering them with a plaster. And so the counsel and expert of the City Council's committee on local transportation had better prepare for the time when the people will open the door leading from the conference room and bid him depart, saying, "Good morning Mr. Fisher!"</p>
