   <p>To the Editor of the Abendpost:</p>
   <p>In the mass meeting of the German Carpenters and Joiners on March 1st, it was made public that the Germans have won their fight for amalgamation into a German Local Union of the Brotherhood for the North and Northwest side. The Charter was granted under recognition of the just demand of the Germans, in spite of all subterfuges of their enemies.</p>
   <p>But the fight is not at an end yet. Our adversaries try to ruin our credit and confidence by spreading the rumor that this newly founded Union is without means and therefore unable to pay sickness benefits to its members. In order not to frighten away our brothers from the just cause, we refer to Section 7 of the by-laws which reads: "Union members who transfer from one Local Union to another, are entitled to a full three month's sickness benefit of that Union from which they withdraw. New members are only entitled to sickness benefit after six months.</p>
   <p>After the expiration of scarcely three months the financial position of our local has become so strong by admission fees and dues that we can compare it <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1594.jpg" n="2"/>with the finances of any other local union; our membership amounts to several hundreds already.</p>
   <p>The principles of this German Local Union are: An honest German management, strictest economy, no high wages for officials......</p>
   <p>Per order of the German Union.</p>
   <p>Ferd. Schnaeckel, President</p>
