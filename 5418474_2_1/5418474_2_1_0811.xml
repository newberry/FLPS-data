  <body>
   <p>Joseph Wentzler, 4448 North Leavitt Avenue, told his brother, Walter, that he intended to go to Miss Ida Shehle's house, 3481 Ravenswood Park, and propose marriage to her; that, in case she should refuse him he would kill not only her, but her entire family and himself. So Walter notified the police.</p>
   <p>A number of detectives went to the house where the young lady lived and lay in wait. when Joseph appeared they overpowered him and his friend Conrad Ilg, 522 Aldine Avenue, before they could enter the house. Wentzler who, it is alleged, came armed with a gun and with a butcher's knife, attempted to resist arrest.</p>
   <p>An attempt is now being made to deport the wild suitor and his friend back to Germany.</p>
