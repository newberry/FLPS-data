   <p>The committee of the City Council for licenses had numerous visitors at its meeting yesterday. Amongst others there was a proposal of Cullerton, that the mayor should be empowered to issue special licenses for association festivals, so that alcoholic drinks could be served in their club localities. According to the proposal such a license should cost $2.50 and should also be valid after 1 A. M. On the request of Alderman Schmidt of the 23rd Ward, Mr. Cullerton agreed to increase the charge for the special license. Alderman Cullerton also agreed that the time of the sale of alcoholic liquor should not exceed 1 A.M. Representatives of numerous clubs were present to promote the recommendation of the proposal. First, as numerously represented were the clerical and temperance associations, which were against it. The majority of the committee seemed to be against the proposal, also some members; as Alderman Scully openly declared, that in the fight against the damaging influences of the dance hall, the just must suffer with the wrong ones; the decent clubs with the clubs which consist of light-minded vagabonds who make a trade of the dance halls and the sale of alcoholic liquors. A decision on the license question has not <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0529.jpg" n="2"/>been taken as yet.</p>
   <p>In the name of the associations which favored an acceptance of the proposal, Mr. Geo. L. Pfeiffer of the "Vorwaerts" Gymnastic Club and Cervenka of the Union of the Bohemian Associations declared that the acceptance of the proposition not only was a social necessity sponsored by the majority of the population but would also keep the proprietors of all club buildings and halls from ruin.</p>
   <p>The German Citizens' Union was represented in the meeting by Mr. John Koelling, W. Urban, W. R. Michaelis, and Fritz Gloganer. The well-known members of German associations present were: President Niederegger of the Swaben Club; Justus Emme of the South Side Gymnastic Club; Lorenz Schlegel of the Mutual Aid Society; A. W. Schwane, representative of the Personal Rights League, and many others. The cause of hypocrisy was represented by W. V. Mulvihill of the Englewood Law and Order League, and Pastor Waterman of the newlyformed Law and Order League of the North Side.</p>
