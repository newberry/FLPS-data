   <p>The acceptance of the beer bill in the lower house of Congress took place with amazing rapidity. Following a six-hour battle of words on Tuesday, it was generally expected that there would be long debates about additional bills on Wednesday by friends and opponents of the bill, chiefly by the latter. But the reverse happened. After a relatively brief debate, it came to a vote, and the bill was accepted by 230 to 165 votes.</p>
   <p>The reason for the prompt dispatch of the bill is not far to seek. The congressmen wanted to go home. It seems that the speaker and the majority were determined to accept no motion for adjournment as long as the beer bill was not disposed of. Since most representatives had the understandable desire to spend Christmas at home, they gave up their aimless resistance and allowed the bill to come to a vote.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0164.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The acceptance of the bill is naturally a great victory; it is a further step in the direction of abolishing prohibition, but not more. Until this aim is reached there are still two hard hurdles to pass. First, the bill goes to the Senate. Whether it may count on acceptance there is still doubtful. Of the members of the Senate, a third must appear for reelection every two years. In the last election, the opponents of prohibition achieved great results in this division of the nation's parliament, but the victors have not yet moved into the Capitol.</p>
   <p>In the Senate the majority has been dry until now. It is not impossible that a number of senators, following the great victory at the polls by the opponents of prohibition, would move into the wet camp. On this score, however, nothing certain has become known as yet, and it is absolutely futile to draw conclusions about it. Nor must it be overlooked that the Democratic members of the Senate are not bound by the last Democratic platform to vote for abolishing the Eighteenth Amendment and for changing the Volstead Act. These senators had not been elected on that platform. They were elected two, four, or six years <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0165.jpg" n="3"/>ago, and many of them pledged themselves to their constituents at the time to put in their efforts for the retention of the dry amendment. They now have the right to draw corclusions from the outcome of the last elections and to change their attitude toward prohibition. They are by no means bound to it morally.</p>
   <p>Even if they should succeed in getting the bill through the senate, there is still the man in the White House who, with one stroke of the men, could throw the bill overboard. could throw the bill overboard. What President Hoover's attitude toward the bill is, is absolutely unknown. Until now he was not found it necessary to inform the people about it. But when one considers the fact that the platform on prohibition had been, if we may say so, dictated to the Republican national convention by President would not think of changing the Volstead law before the Eighteenth Amendment has been abolished, one must needs arrive at the conclusion that the President will veto the bill.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0166.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The chances that the present Congress is going to legalize the production and sale of beer are therefore as meager as before. Yesterday's vote was nevertheless a pleasant success, for it clearly proved that a similar bill will be accepted by the next Congress without any difficulties.</p>
