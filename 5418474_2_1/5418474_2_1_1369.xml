   <p>The Republican Senators have given up temporarily their outstanding inactivity. The father of the tariff, old Horrill from Vermont, has broken his silence and given a Republican tariff speech. He did this only because is party instructed him to express his rejection of all propositions of James G. Blaine. He did not attack the democrats, but the former leader of the Republican Party. What Morrill said confirmed the reasons of his opposition to the tariff of Blaine, as published before in this paper.</p>
   <p>He pointed cut that most South American countries themselves have a surplus of these products which according to the plan of Blaine, should be bought from our farmers. Only a few countries could sell sugar to as, while we would have to offer to other countries the cancellation of the cotton tariff or to threaten with the reintroduction of the importation tax on hides to make them give in to one's wishes. But the Republicans don't want the cotton tariff touched, so the most ardent followers of Blaine would not dare to suggest the tax-free importation of cotton from Argentine.</p>
