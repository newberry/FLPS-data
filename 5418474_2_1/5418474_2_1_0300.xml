   <p>Of 535,292 persons who revealed their stand on the prohibition issue in Chicago last Tuesday, 391,260--266,523 men and 76,325 (sic) women--voted against prohibition. Only 67,707 men and 76,325 (sic) women voted "wet". Every ward of the City voted "get." even those wards on the South Side and North Side which have been "wet" for many years. Four out of every five men declared themselves to be opposed to prohibition. And the women of whom it was thought that the great majority would favor prohibition voted "wet" by a ratio of five to three.</p>
   <p>Thus it is certain that Chicago will remain "wet" until July, 1, when "war prohibition" becomes effective, and "it has no further purpose", say the prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>It is questionable whether or not they think so. The liberals do not think so.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0301.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They believe that the "hundred thousand noes" of Chicago will be heard by, and will strongly impress the whole country; that for the time being it will fill the liberal element everywhere in the land with new hope and new courage, and presages defeat for prohibition in every state in which it is made an issue (in Michigan, on the coming Tuesday). They are convinced that so-called "war prohibition," which is to go into effect on July 1, is doomed. They expect that this clause of the law to promote and stimulate agriculture, (the "prohibition rider" of the Agricultural Extension bill) will be repealed by Congress before July 1, or that it will be declared null and void by the president, since peace is imminent and demobilization is an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the liberals and their leaders believe that Chicago's "No" vote of last Tuesday will save the country from prohibition, which was forced upon the people by an unconstitutional amendment to the Constitution. For they believe, as has been stated before, that Chicago's example will be followed by other large cities and that it will enable the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0302.jpg" n="3"/> liberals successfully to insist that prohibition be submitted to the voters for decision in accordance with state law--with the result that the amendment will be rejected, or a less stringent law enacted.</p>
   <p>Like the Merchant of Venice, the prohibitionists insist upon their pound of flesh. They are certain that their cause will prevail, even though the Eighteenth Amendment was passed only because its supporters took advantage of adverse conditions. Their faith, their confidence is not well founded. And they are aware of this. By their bold statements they are trying to deceive themselves and others concerning their own weakness.</p>
