   <p>From the report of the 195 major railroads of our country--the roads whose operating costs are $1,000,000 annually--to the Interstate Commerce Commission, it is evident that their net profit was about $718,000,000 during the year 1918; this was $250,000,000 less than that of the year 1917, and about $370,000,000 below the net profit earned during the years 1916 and 1915.</p>
   <p>The gross income increased, but expenditures increased at an even greater rate....The difference between these two increased was caused by an increase in the cost of materials and labor. Higher salaries and wages were chiefly responsible for diminishing profits, for in 1918 about 2,000,000 employees received about $2,346,000,000 in wages and salaries, which were 46 per cent higher at the end of 1918 than they were at the beginning of that year.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1324.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The builders and managers of the major railroads did not want the Government to take over the roads and operate them during the war, and they acted like "lambs that were being led to slaughter" when their more or less public protests were of no avail; they tried to create the impression that they were suffering heavy losses through the action of the Government, that they were being insulted and deprived of their constitutional rights, and that only their great patriotism and noble spirit of sacrifice enabled them to endure insult and violence.</p>
   <p>No doubt they laughed in their sleeves and congratulated themselves upon the favorable turn of affairs, for just the opposite of what they wanted the general public to believe was true. The rights of railroad companies were not violated when the Government assumed the management and operation of the lines; moreover, the owners and stockholders were greatly benefited, if not actually saved from heavy losses and perhaps bankruptcy. That was common knowledge among the officials of the various roads, and the general public has surmised it for some time.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1325.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Under private management freight rates and passenger rates could not have been increased so rapidly, and so much, as was done under Government management.</p>
   <p>Again, many consolidations and other changes in management and operation, by which the efficiency of the service was greatly increased, were effected under Government supervision in less time than would have been necessary under the supervision of the private owners. Consequently, the net profits which accrued while the Government had charge of the railroads were greater than they would have been if the owners of the roads had retained management of these systems of transportation.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the cost of operating the roads would have been the same if the railroad companies had been sufficiently sagacious to judge conditions and situations correctly, and prudent enough to act accordingly. They should have given the demands of their employees for an increase in wages the same courteous and prompt attention which the Government accorded them; <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1326.jpg" n="4"/>for a great part of the losses in former years is directly attributable to the denial of the forty-five per cent increase in wages. A probable refusal by the private owners of a requested increase in wages would have resulted in strikes, interruptions of service, losses and damages, and the railroads would have had to grant the increase eventually in order to prevent their own ruin, or the Government would have had to intervene. For the demands for an increase in wages were justified under the prevalent conditions; the employees of the railroads held the upper hand and were determined to obtain their rights and to take all steps which they deemed necessary to protect their interests. Prompt accedence to the request for more pay, in the manner of the Government, would have been the wisest and the only possible policy for the railroads to pursue; then operating costs under their supervision would have been at least as high as they were under the management of the Government, and the stockholders would have had to whistle for dividends.</p>
   <p>The Government proved to be the protecting and beneficent "angel" of the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1327.jpg" n="5"/>railroad companies, and thus it has merited the good will and gratitude of all who own railroad stock, and of all who have to do with the management of the roads and are honest with their clients. Of course, there may be some railroad officials even in our day who do not fall into these categories, but they no longer count.</p>
