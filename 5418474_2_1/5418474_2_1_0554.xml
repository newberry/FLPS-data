  <body>
   <p>If, from May until October next year, the presidency is in the hands of B. Harrison, the defenders of Sunday closing at the World's Fair will derive from this fact alone enormous encouragement. Irrespective of his otherwise splendid traits, B. Harrison is a very strict Presbyterian....</p>
   <p>Cleveland, on the other hand, announced in his letter of acceptance, the following principle: "To the people, the largest personal freedom, consistent with peace and order; therefore, no coercive laws, which unnecessarily interfere with customs and habits not conflicting with public morals." It is logical to assume that Cleveland's statement and his assurance refers also to the most absurd of all coercive laws, the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.</p>
   <p>It is a self-evident fact that as Governor, Altgeld would be a hundred times more dependable in these matters, than Governor Fifer. The Republican party of Illinois does not mention anything in its program about this affair, but the Democrats condemn coercive measures positively. Altgeld is a genuine, liberal-minded <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0555.jpg" n="2"/>cosmopolitan, but Fifer is under the influence of the fanatics and hypocrites of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>What an encouragement it would be for the Directors of the World's Fair to keep the exhibit open on Sunday, if they knew that both the President of the United States, and the Governor of the State, were opponents of those strict Sunday laws....</p>
   <p>Cleveland and Altgeld's victory would also have a definite effect upon the fifty-second Congress, although this Congress adjourns on the same day that Cleveland, if elected, would be inaugurated.</p>
   <p>Even if Congress does not repeal the objectionable resolution regarding the closing on Sunday, yet Cleveland as president, and Altgeld as governor officiating at the time of the opening of the World's Fair, would be a tremendous inducement to keep the exhibit open on Sunday. It also would assure a certain safety for a moderate use of a free Sunday during the World's Fair.</p>
