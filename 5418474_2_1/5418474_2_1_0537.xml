   <p>The demonstration of the German elements of Chicago against the new intrigues of the followers of the temperance movement suffered in its impressiveness because the meeting at the Auditorium was poorly attended and the enormous hall was only half filled. This fact was also referred to by the two speakers of the evening Geo. L. Pfeiffer and Emil Hoechster. The meeting was opened by Mr. Wilhelm Rapp with a short address. The old gentleman stressed the fact that the meeting was in no way called to further intemperance, but for the defence against the never resting dark powers of puritanism. "The meeting takes place on the eve of Abraham Lincoln's birthday and shall be held in the spirit of this most big hearted American. Lincoln always has been a friend of temperance, but an enemy of intolerance. Shortly before his inauguration as President, he wrote:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0538.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I am against everything that is intended to humble men. How glaringly would I contradict myself if I tolerated a limitation of the rights of foreign born citizens, even if their mother tongue is different than my own".</p>
   <p>The main speaker of the evening. Mr. Pfeiffer, pointed out that the meeting would have been superfluous if the Germans had done their duty and had kept alert, but the hypocrites took advantage of their indolence and gained new victories.</p>
   <p>Mr. Huechster said: "The fanatics have celebrated great triumphs in many states during the last years and even now there are presented to the Congress many petitions for the introduction of Prohibition. I do not fear the honest temperence advocates, who believe that water is the only permitted drink and who live accordingly. But I am afraid of the professional reformers, those people, who carry sin in their hearts and virtue on their lips, who secretly sneak into a side street and consume in hidden dens one drink after another.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0539.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Go out to Evanston or Hyde Park, the strongholds of the temperance fanatics and watch the grocery wagon from which are carried almost to every house funny looking bones, and what do these contain? All sorts of bottled alcoholic beverages, also a lot of beer.</p>
   <p>In our City Council reigns much hypocrisy that showed itself plainly when lately a whole number of these gentlemen became so weakkneed that they disregarded their previously given promises and hooked up with the fanatics. We Germans must stiffen the backbone of such aldermen and when we can agree on this question all other liberal minded citizens will join us and personal liberty will be preserved. But we Germans have to start the ball rolling, and I believe and hope that this meeting will be followed by more meetings in all parts of the City, because the danger is here, and it is absolutely necessary to be prepared for the coming battles."</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were read by Mr. Koelling and were accepted unanimously by the audience:</p>
   <p>"The peace of our City is again disturbed by people who usurp the right to dictate to others; whether they are permitted to hodl club festivities, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0540.jpg" n="4"/>whether they can keep inns, and whether they are allowed to visit them."</p>
   <p>"There is now a petition in circulation with the purpose of extending "Local Option" to all wards of Chicago, and by this action the public peace is anew disturbed."</p>
   <p>"The inns are the 'Clubs' of many decent people. They pay to the City Treasury about $3.500,000 yearly. The petitioners do not obligate themselves to raise this sum. They only demand that the inns be closed, and they want to take away from other people the right to visit any inns."</p>
   <p>"We enter a decided protest against this newest violation of the peace. We assume the obligation to exert all lawful means against the agitations of the fanatics, and to vote against any one, who in any way favors this newest offense by the enemies of personal liberty."</p>
   <p>These resolutions shall be printed in large quantities and shall be distributed for the collection of signatures, where upon they shall be sent to the City Council.</p>
