   <p>During the entire last week, Chicago, or at least its English speaking population, has been in a trance. Anyone who did not understand the race-track slang, or did not show any interest if one horse ran two or three inches farther than another was looked at with a sarcastic smile or a contemptible sneer...On one week day, the spectators at the races amounted to around 40,000 persons.</p>
   <p>Among them might have been quite a few Germans, but by no means in any proportion to the native born. The love for horse races is something unknown to the great mass of the German people, from which the immigration to America is derived. In Germany this sport is exclusively taken up by the nobility and also by those rich upstarts, who are imitating the nobility.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1087.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is also significant that the German language has no slang of its own for this sport, but all expressions used at the races are either of local origin, or are entirely silly and unintelligible translations from the English. The horse-races have never become a popular amusement in Germany in spite of the efforts of all horse enthusiasts.</p>
   <p>The same is true with American baseball, the Scottish Club or Quoit-play, the foot or polo games of the English. Naturally it cannot be denied that Germans, who for many years have been living among Americans and English, adopted many of their customs, as chewing tobacco and spicing a sugar melon with red pepper, and also the pleasure of playing ball, rowing, running and going to horse-races. But after all, it is only an adopted habit and not an inherited one.</p>
