   <p>The Platt-German Society of Chicago adopted at its last meeting, which was held on August 24th, the following resolution: The Platt-German Society of Chicago, although not a political organization, but in the face of threats against personal freedom, feels it to be its duty to assert that:</p>
   <p>1. The public has no right to vote on all kinds of matters, which happen to be submitted to it.</p>
   <p>2. The public has no right to ask a separation of any of the states from the Federal Government; this would be a political crime, and high treason committed against the government.</p>
   <p>3. The public has no right to proclaim one particular religion as the authoritative one. That would be a religious crime, and Treason committed against the Constitution.</p>
   <p>4. The public has no right to decide or to vote on what the citizens of the state shall eat or drink, which would be a moral crime, and an offense against the Constitution, which guarantees personal freedom to each individual.</p>
   <p>5. No nation has the right to commit a crime, whether political, religious or of a moral nature, just because a majority happens to vote for it. If the wish of the majority were predominant in all questions, we would have to sanction slavery in the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0626.jpg" n="2"/>Southern States, and acknowledge the right of the Mormons in Utah to have more than one wife.</p>
   <p>It has been decided, that the members of the Platt-German Society of Chicago, declare themselves against Prohibition and will do anything within their power to block such a nuisance from becoming law.</p>
