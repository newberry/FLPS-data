   <p>The famous writer, Karl Knortz, is thundering against tax-free church property as follows: "The churches assert for their own justification that they render the stats a distinct and reciprocal service for the granting of freedom from taxes, by maintaining a higher moral level, and by ennobling the character of men by their church services.</p>
   <p>"But this is something every private school, every railroad, every insurance company, every bank, etc., could boast of, provided, of course, these are honestly managed. All these institutions work for the welfare of the people. But if they, therefore, are declared tax free, who should finally pay the taxes? The arguments of the churches are, obviously, illogical.</p>
   <p>"It it necessary that the church be indirectly supported by everybody? Why not, then, be frank and levy direct taxes for them? In reality the state gives to the churches a certain amount by not taxing church property. This is clearly in contradiction to the constitution."</p>
   <p>It can not be denied that Knortz is right, if the services of the church can not be evaluated as higher, or superior to those of other institutions, but <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0873.jpg" n="2"/>his judgment is not in accord with history.</p>
   <p>It can not be claimed that it is a special privilege granted to the church when the law ordains that no clergyman can be compelled upon the witness stand to testify about something which was confessed to him in his official capacity. A similar ordinance exists in regard to professional secrets of doctors, lawyers, etc..... This does not constitute a privilege to the churches, because the protection granted is not for the benefit of the clergy, but for the confessants...</p>
   <p>Neither is the procedure of a marriage ceremony unimportant. Various legal proceedings have their beginnings in marriage. Every appeal to a right, obtained by a contract, presupposes the ability to prove the existence of the contract. The ceremony of marriage by a clergyman, in the presence of witnesses, the entering into a marriage register, and the issuing of a certificate furnish the best evidences...</p>
   <p>The law requires that marriages shall be officiated by public men, in order to give them public sanction. This undoubtedly, is very effectively attained, in most cases, by an ecclesiastic ceremony...</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0874.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The church may teach what it pleases in the United States; the state is unconcerned about it, as long as it does not conflict with the laws of the state. Only when it does, do the church and state become opponents.</p>
