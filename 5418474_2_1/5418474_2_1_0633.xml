  <body>
   <p>The Turn Society Vorwarts, requested of us the publication of their anti-temperance decision, which was the subject of discussion, at one of their last meetings.</p>
   <p>1. It has been decided, that we declare ourselves against the nuisance of temperance, further, that we are determined to help to keep the State Legislature, as well as that of our city, in the rightful path, and that we have urged the members of the Turn-Society Vorwarts, to induce all the other Turn Societies, to join us in our effort, to put a stop to the creeping hypocrisy and the modern pharisaism.</p>
   <p>11. We have also decided to request the Chicago Press, to work toward this goal, and express our appreciation to those newspapers, which have always been in accord with us.</p>
   <p>111. It was finally decided, that the aforementioned declarations and decisions, should be made known, to all Chicago Turn Societies, as well as to the public, through the press.</p>
