   <p>The Garfield Turnverein gave an intellectual, informal entertainment at Mueller's hall, last evening. The diversified program included several favorably accepted songs, a zither-quintet, under the leadership of Director Essler, a recitation Erlkoenig (Fairy-King) with guitar-accompaniment. The chairman then introduced Turner Max Stern as the speaker of the evening. His theme was "The Position of the Turners in Regard to the League For Personal Rights." After the speaker had submitted his proofs to show that the Turners individually, as well as in common with the association, always defended personal rights. Mr. Stern drew comparisons with the accepted platform of the league and the principles of the N. A. Turner Alliance and said, "The practical recommendations of the Turner Association are all contained in the league resolutions." Since it has been impossible for the Turners to realize these principles, heretofore, they should align themselves with the league and thereby obtain united action.</p>

   <p>Years ago we ridiculed the unsystematic attempts of the prohibitionists, but in the course of time they grew in power until the existence and continuation of the Constitution is endangered.</p>
   <p>Have our enemies taught us anything? We also intend to reach our goal by association, by organization. We are not alone. The great mass of the people, which is subjugated by "Dissenter laws"; the taxpayers who are oppressed by prohibition's tax - assessments, the liberal and progressive elements; all those, who are represented in the league for personal liberty, even the English press, which wrote an editorial in our favor recently, admonished us to affiliate ourselves with this new movement which promises to become a new anti-slave question. Since early January the cause has been promoted on the North Side by the forming of a branch league. This was followed by an address, given by Turner Chas. Bary. The association gave a unanimous decision favoring united action.</p>
