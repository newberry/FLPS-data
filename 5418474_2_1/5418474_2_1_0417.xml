   <p>It is forbidden to sell any kind of alcoholic beverages after June 30, 1919.</p>
   <p>It is forbidden to manufacture beer or wine after May 1, 1919.</p>
   <p>The President has the power immediately to proclaim Prohibition zones around munitions plants and coal mines.</p>
   <p>These measures were adopted yesterday by the United States Senate, and undoubtedly the House will vote the same way very soon, perhaps even today. Undoubtedly, too, by a viva voce vote, as did the wise and mighty Senate. For it is no less embarassing for many House members, who hope for re-election, to declare openly for or against complete prohibition throughout this country of free Americans than it is for Senators likewise seeking re-election.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It seems, then, that a problem has been settled which has bothered peoples' minds for a long time, and which has caused a hard and prolonged struggle. It is true that the measure still needs the President's signature to become law, and it is a well-known fact that the President is not in favor of Prohibition and that, at the last minute, he had asked the leader of the Prohibition forces, Senator Sheppard, to postpone Prohibition until January 1, 1920--but a veto can hardly be hoped for. To demand a veto would, under the circumstances, be asking too much of the President, since an overwhelming majority of the people of this country seems to be in favor of Prohibition, if one can judge by yesterday's Senate vote and a previous vote in the House on the original Jones amendment, which provided for Prohibition as early as January 1, 1919!</p>
   <p>It has been done! What has been done? All kinds of things--depending on the point of view one takes regarding the matter. Above all, this: that the unpleasant problem of Prohibition, which, for such a long time, had blocked urgent measures and had hampered the work of Congress, has been <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0419.jpg" n="3"/>moved out of the way--at least for quite a while. And that is an accomplishment over which everybody is happy, Congressmen as well as the people, friend as well as foe. But here the "unanimity" ceases.</p>
   <p>Senator Wadsworth of New York called Prohibition, in the form enacted, a "fake," and, if for no other reason, the respect that every good citizen should have for a United States Senator--a member of the most dignified body in the whole world,--forbids any contradiction. Similarly, this same necessary attitude of respect is enough to prevent the ordinary citizen from reprimanding Senator Penrose regarding the lack of respect for prohibition which he displayed. "Would it be possible," he asked Senator Sheppard, "under this measure, to obtain a bottle of wine by means of a physician's prescription?"--"I believe that would be possible," replied Sheppard, whereupon Penrose remarked: "Then I see a ray of hope. I know some doctors who are pretty good sports."</p>
   <p>In order that the ordinary citizen, or even the second-rate citizen, should <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0420.jpg" n="4"/>not be tempted to talk the way Senator Penrose did or even to see a "ray of hope" in Sheppard's reply, let us remind everybody that....nowadays it all depends on who says a thing, and the ordinary citizen who would be so naive as to believe he could make the same remarks that others do would soon pay for his foolishness.</p>
   <p>But that is beside the point. Let us recall the utterances of prominent people regarding the Prohibition bill: Senator Phelan of California was one of the few, who at the last minute attempted to block the measure or at least to modify it by introducing[two] amendments, one of which would have postponed the prohibition of wine and beer, the other of wine alone, until June 30, 1920. In the course of a debate, he described the prohibition of wine and beer--with special emphasis on wine, because win, is a principal principal product of his state--as ruinous and shameful, unwise and unjust, but apparently he must have been all wrong, because his amendments Were killed with a resounding "no". Many ordinary citizens may perhaps be of the opinion that he had only spoken the truth, and they themselves will judge <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0421.jpg" n="5"/>much more severely the decision of our wise and mighty Senate, which makes it impossible for the average citizen to obtain stimulating but harmless beverages, but which will not kill his desire for something stimulating with which to quench his thirst. He will satisfy this desire by drinking homemade moonshine, obtained for good money from obliging but law-breaking "friends" and "neighbors". However, this does not alter the situation.</p>
   <p>One could go on talking about the matter, but such talk would become tiresome. So let us merely see what Senator Smoot has to say about it: "I do not consider the adoption of the bill as a great victory for Prohibition," said the Prohibitionist Senator from Utah. "The day of Prohibition will only be postponed by it. Everybody is hoping that the war will be over by June 30, 1919. Then the whole thing will start all over again." The Senator apparently overlooked the fact that the bill was amended in such a way as to keep Prohibition in force until after the demobilization of our troops, so that the end of the war will not mean the end of Prohibition. Nevertheless, anything is possible in these times.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0422.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>During the last few years, fate has certainly shown us its dark side, but the success of our brave boys in France and some other hopeful signs indicate that, in the near future, the cause of justice and freedom and true democracy and the principle of the self-determination of peoples will be victorious. And it may yet happen that Prohibition, in the form decided upon yesterday by the Senate, will prove to be what Senator Wadsworth called it--a "fake" that does not mean a thing.</p>
