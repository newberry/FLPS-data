   <p>At the meeting held at Central Music Hall, attended by Germans and Scandinavians, members of Protestant Churches, the following resolutions were read and adopted:</p>
   <p>"For the abolition of Sunday-Slavery and the prevention of crimes on Sunday. Declaration of German-Americans and Scandinavians-American citizens of Chicago, assembled at the Central Music Hall, September 2, 1888.</p>
   <p>"Physicians and physiologists, workers of all classes, economists and experts, they all agree that one day of rest out of seven is very beneficial for the physical and spiritual well-being of men in all walks of life.</p>
   <p>"A very eminent physician declared, that the Sabbath should be observed as a day of rest; and that this is not merely his opinion, but a fact, which is as well founded in human nature as the other one, that man must perish, if he refuses to eat.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0597.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The freedom of rest for the individual depends upon the rest for all. It is the duty of the government to prohibit Sunday work, except in cases of emergencies and mercy. Likewise should the government try to prevent the abuses of this day of rest, which are detrimental to public order and morals.</p>
   <p>"There are thousands of men, women and children in Chicago who are forced by conditions, over which they have no control, to work seven days per week.</p>
   <p>"It is also a very lamentable fact, that the Sabbath in this city has been turned systematically into a day of vice, crime, and debauchery.</p>
   <p>"Because of these deplorable conditions we cannot remain silent any longer. We can not remain passive as long as so many innocent people and families suffer injustice and irreparable injuries;when at the same time, and from week to week, crimes committed on Sunday cry to heavens for expiation, and thousands of helpless mothers, wives and children beg with tears to remedy this situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0598.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"We must do what we can to abolish Sunday-Slavery, and to prevent crime and debauchery on this day and for this purpose we sincerely and earnestly resolve to:</p>
   <p>1. To appeal to the mayor and the police of this city respectfully but urgently to perform their duty fearlessly in the inforcement of our Sunday-laws.</p>
   <p>2. That we consider it as their duty to in force those general laws and city ordinances in reference to this matter.</p>
   <p>3. That our Sunday-laws do not restrict personal liberty, and do not interfere with our freedom of conscience, but are, on the contrary, its best guardians.</p>
   <p>4. That the keeping of Sunday is essential for Christian conduct, and, although we do not desire, nor would we have the power to force upon others our religious viewpoints and customs. We maintain that it is the duty of the government to protect our rights to undisturbed church services and to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0599.jpg" n="4"/>demand a certain regard for the Sabbath, which is required for the peace and order of the community.</p>
   <p>5. That we are prepared to cooperate with all good citizens to bring about in a reasonable way the abolition of Sunday-Slavery;- to make an end to all debaucheries and vices on Sunday and thereby achieve-happiness, peace and prosperity for all who now suffer under these deplorable conditions.</p>
   <p>6. That we approach all law-abiding citizens of Chicago without regard to party,sect, or nationality with the urgent request to join us in this noble and holy endeavor, to liberate the poor sufferers from the slavery of Sunday-work, and to let them partake of this protection which is required for the enjoyment of highest and truest liberty and finds its most eloquent presentation in our Sunday."</p>
