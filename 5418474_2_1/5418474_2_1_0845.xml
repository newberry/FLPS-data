   <p>In the "Chicago Herald" we find the confession of a woman saying that the American children are often presumptive and precocious. She compares the American methods of training with the English and German and admits freely, that the children in Germany and England are better trained than in the United States, but she also finds excuses for this fact.--</p>
   <p>She claims that the militaristic spirit in Germany makes its influence felt in family life and that England clings to very conservative training methods. "The United States, however, is applying the principles of democracy in the treatment and raising of children. Children can think and therefore must be persuaded to obey and not forced to do so. American children must by all means be more independent than the European and therefore their self-consciousness, their ego, must be aroused early."</p>
   <p>This vindication is extremely weak. Sensible parents think very little of <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0846.jpg" n="2"/>disciplining children by beating and forcing them into subserviency, no matter where they live. But if a child is obstinate, fresh and forward, it is evident that the parents failed to understand how to influence and mold his mind and character through wise counsel and sensible instructions. Children, who do not respect their parents and teachers, obstinately refuse to obey rules and regulations, behave unruly and shameless in the presence of guests, are not any more the product of our free institutions as, for instance, the Ward-Politicians or the tobacco-spitters. If democracy is made responsible for these phenomena, then injuctice is committed in doing so. why not expose the real cause instead of hiding behind excuses?</p>
   <p>In reality the lack of the democratic spirit in many families to be considered as the basic factor for the laxity in child-training. Parents fail to meet their responsibility towards society. They expect too much from the school and the government and do very little themselves. They desire that their own children as well as all the others should be trained by the paid teachers and guided in the path of virtue and moderation by the policemen's club. This is undermining their own influence in home training and they are surprised if they fail in this.</p>
   <p>Concerning the "American" husband it must be said, that they are too eager to leave the care of the children, the management of home and kitchen in the hands of the wife. By earning money they think they have justly met all reasonable demands. It is true that they are very tender often too tender and have</p>
