<title level="a">THE OLD TAVERNKEEPER'S SOCIETY</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Old Tavernkeeper's Society held a meeting yesterday afternoon in the Old Quincy No. 9 which was not well attended.</p>
   <p>A number of those who were present, left even before the meeting was opened. Joseph Miehle was elected to preside. He declared himself in favor of a uniform $150.00 license. Most of the tavernkeepers could manage to get along paying this sum, if they do not employ a bartender. Hau delivered a long speech although he did not decide the question one way or the other. Miehle spoke again, and said he protested that the German tavernkeepers should pull the coal out of the fire, Hansborough and his associates retired in a cowardly manner and he objected to having anything to do with such people.</p>
   <p>As far as he is concerned, he must obtain a $500.00 license, because he could not exist without selling wines and liquors, but can not see, why <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0615.jpg" n="2"/>the "small" Tavernkeepers who are dispensing beer exclusively, should not get along with a $150.00 license. He therefore proposed to request the license committee, to collect the $150.00 and $500.00 in three installments.</p>
   <p>John Feldkamp said the Harper law being now in effect, they should be obeyed. The city council could not do anything in the matter. Next fall, there would be an opportunity to elect the right kind of representatives to overthrow this law. Miehle's motion to request the council to permit installment payments was rejected by a vote of 7 to 6. Bander complained, that the old Tavern-keeper's Society does not receive any support from anywhere. A motion to request the city council, to prohibit the sale of bottle beer in restaurants, was carried.</p>
   <p>Upon Feldkamp's motion it was decided, to request the council's license committee to cancel the paragraph, pertaining to payment of license in installments.</p>
