   <p>The movement which has as its aim to put an end next fall to the tyranny of the temperance fanatics, started yesterday. The meeting was called to order by Mr. A. Huttinger at 8:30.</p>
   <p>He remarked that although the citizens of the 17th Ward were especially invited to the meeting, all who wished to join the movement were nevertheless welcomed. Mr. Adolph Schoninger was elected president and accepted the election with the following words: "Thank you for this token of confidence. Today's fanaticism is an outgrowth of those associations which fought against us twenty years ago. Let us all stand together, no matter if we are Republicans, Democrats, or Liberals. Mr. Karl Knobelsdorff, the first speaker said: The fight, for which we are uniting, is mostly directed against us Germans. The example given by the 17th Ward will sweep over the city like a prairie fire and bring us victory. Alone we cannot accomplish it, but we hope to win for our cause the free minded elements of all nationalities."</p>

   <p>When Mr. A. C. Hesing was called upon, he said: "The assembly of so many Germans fills me with joy." It reminds me of the time, when we had Daniel Boone for mayor. When by order of the city council the drinking of beer was forbidden, all the Germans marched to the court house and regained their rights. We must be united again, as we were united in 1856 with the free minded citizens of all nationalities. We Germans can look back with pride on our past. We have filled honorably all the positions intrusted to us. Among us there were no Colfax nor Oakes Ames, and if there were any, we did not honor them as Colfax was honored, but we threw them overboard. Mr. Franz A. Hoffmann said: "Why is it, that Germans are not as much respected as they were previously? Because bad fellows had been able to take over the leadership. If we did not have any Colfax nor Brook, we had nevertheless Fisher and Klutsche. If you, Mr. Hesing, are honest in your opinion and I have no reason to doubt it, I give you my hand as a sign of alliance."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hesing gave Mr. Hoffmann the hand, while the audience applauded.</p>
