  <body>
   <p>An American preacher made the statement that one of the chief causes of the frequent unhappy marriage in America is due to a lack of dowry. Much could be said, and justly so, about this subject without exhausting it. The cause of this mentioned unhappiness in married Life is, unquestionably, to be found on both sides. Both sexes enter marriage with the same outrageous frivolity and thoughtlessness. Neither the young girl, who plans to enter the marriage bonds.......until, not death, but the judge parts them......has seriously considered whether they are able or not to conduct a home and rear children.</p>
   <p>In the majority of cases they hope, like Micawber, that "something will turn up," or that somehow the matter will solve itself. If the young man has enough money to pay for the wedding ceremony, to buy a wedding ring for his bride, and to defray the expenses of a short honeymoon trip, or if his <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0837.jpg" n="2"/>credit is good, so that he can borrow what is needed, matters are not so bad to start with. But what happens afterwards? All is covered up until a suit for divorce, or a muderous shot permits us to behold the tragic results of many marriages which were entered so thoughtlessly and carelessly.</p>
