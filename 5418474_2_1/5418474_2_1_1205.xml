   <p>and others. These organizations have always tried to gain an influence upon the Government, and they were very successful in their attempts. It is generally known that the big industrialists have dictated the tariff policies of the country for decades. The tariff bills were prepared in the House of Representatives, and it accidentally came to light that the Ways and Means Committee, which establishes the tariff rates, has very close connections with the manufacturers. The big industrialists have, in fact, during Republican Administrations, always formed a kind of secondary government. They were not the only ones active in this sphere; in brotherly fashion they shared the government of the country with high finance and business. It was not very long ago that the former American Ambassador to Germany, James W. Gerard, made a few remarks about the actual rulers of this country. He declared that the country is ruled by about fifty men, and cited the heads of industry, commerce, and high finance as the real rulers of the country. These assertions by Gerard did not cause any great excitement. Evidently the widest circles considered it a well-known fact that these gentlemen were the real rulers of the country.</p>
   <p>People were under the general impression, however, that this rule was terminated <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1206.jpg" n="3"/>as a result of the Democratic victory in 1932 and 1934, for the rulers had shown that they were not very good at ruling. Everything went well in normal times, but when the great economic collapse came they were helpless. It is due to the work of President Roosevelt and his advisers that confindence was restored and that the economy was put on a going basis again. For this reason the Government has intervened in the economy and has taken far-reaching measures. Evidently the big industrialists have grown tired of this interference and for that reason wish to restore former conditions. As long as the present Administration is at the helm they will not have much success. It is one of the most important principles of the New Deal that the governing is done by those who were elected for that purpose. There is no room, at present, for an irresponsible secondary government.</p>
