   <p>The streetcar company has refused to comply with an order of the state commerce commission to come to terms with the elevated company with respect to the exchange of transfers, which was to become effective August 7.</p>
   <p>The state commerce commission was asked to agree on a date at which the whole affair could be argued again. It is contended that the streetcar company was incorporated under laws quite different from those in effect at the time of incorporation of the elevated company. To consolidate the two companies would involve a great many difficulties. Should the state commerce commission insist upon disregarding the law, the courts would have to be called upon to act.</p>
   <p>The efforts of the city administration to save (after more than five years) at least something that would be of advantage to the public from the ruins of the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1189.jpg" n="2"/>traction ordinance of July 1, 1930, have arrived at an impasse. If it were not possible to merge the transportation companies on the basis of a new traction ordinance, the situation would be sad indeed.</p>
   <p>Technically, the companies are undoubtedly right. In accordance with the letter of the law, they may seek justice through the courts. Besides, the companies are under the administration of receivers, who are supervised by the district court. One is reminded of the lawsuit of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company against the city administration--it will take years for the disputed questions to be settled.</p>
   <p>In whichever way the matter is decided, the public, which must use the facilities for transportation which are provided by the traction companies, foots the bill. Often double, and sometimes triple fares have to be paid, when a transfer to a bus line is necessary.</p>
   <p>During the previous negotiations concerning transfer traffic, it became clear <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1190.jpg" n="3"/>that it might not be hard to master the technical part of the business. But behind the scenes are the security holders of the companies. Each group demands first consideration, and these persons all have their legal rights, which must be respected.</p>
   <p>Better and cheaper transportation is of paramount importance at present. The public would welcome any improvement in the service. The public is used to having trouble. There is no doubt that the revenues of the companies would be increased because of the heavier traffic which would result from improved service. The state commerce commission is eager to help, of course, even to the extent of going beyond the letter of the law, but this is impossible.</p>
   <p>Many good measures have been prevented by the technicalities of the law, and many more will be in the future. There must be justice, and there must be law. without a constitution no democratic commonwealth can exist. It is unfortunate, however, if the technicalities of the law prevail over what is vital and progressive, because this leads to an uncertainty which has a paralyzing <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1191.jpg" n="4"/>effect. Many things come to a standstill, no matter how great an effort is made to give, by makeshifts, the appearance of progress.</p>
   <p>If a man had to take part in a modern war, and for this purpose donned a medieval knight's armor, everyone would laugh. Modern warfare demands extreme mobility, which modern armies achieve, and everyone finds it natural. However, it seems difficult for citizens to lay aside the armor of the knight, or perhaps the beautifully powdered wig, in their everyday lives.</p>
   <p>Let them continue to act this way if they wish to. But in that case they have no reason to complain if they have to hang on the leather strap for a few more years, and pay more for this dubious privilege than they would if there were more understanding and compromise.</p>
