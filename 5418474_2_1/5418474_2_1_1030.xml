   <p>Illinois Staats Zeitung, Feb. 1st: The notorious Camp No. 20, of the Clan-Na-Gael, in which the assassination of Cronin was concocted, mourns the death of one of its comrades. Robert Gibbons, who recently assaulted and tried to assassinate Capt. Schuettler, has died from the effects of the shot which the latter fired on him in the defense of his own life. Among all honest people there is general regret that Gibbons departed alone. They would have been glad to give him his comrade, Mccormick, for a companion to the other world. The assault on Capt. Schuettler was an infamous aftermath to the assassination of Cronin, and every participant in it deserved to be shot down like a dog. Schuettler had done valuable service in the prosecution of the murders of Cronin. For this, the companions of those murderers and sworn to be revenged on him. The wanted to remove him. His good fortune, his strength and activity enabled him to cut off the life of at least one - unfortunately but one of the infamous brood of murderers.</p>
   <p>Well, there is one less, at any rate. One should be thankful for small favors. Schuettler acted bravely and rightly. Unless the coroner's jury at the inquest on on Gibbons has been culverized by the Clan-Na-Gael horde, it will return a verdict <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1031.jpg" n="2"/>of justifiable homicide. Schuettler should not be deprived of his liberty for twenty-four hours on account of having defended himself against a murderous assault. And above all things, nothing should be done against him by the Mayor. Mr. Gregier has already caused just apprehension by transferring Capt. Schuettler from that precinct in which he was the most inconvenient to the Clan-Na-Gael horde of murderers. If he should now think of disciplining Capt. Schuettler because he has reduced the murderous Camp No. 20 by one member, this apprehension would grow into an open accusation. One would then be justified in saying: "Mr. Mayor, your innermost opinion and feeling as to the Clan-Na-Gael brood of murderers is the same as that here expressed in the Illinois Staats Zeitung, and in the close circle of your friends and acquaintances, you do not disguise these sentiments. It would be a piece of miserable cowardice if you should sacrifice a brave and faithful officer to your fear of the rage of this Irish brood.</p>
   <p>"It would be a blow in the face of public opinion - that is, the opinion of all decent and honest people - and if you should be a candidate for reelection, you would not only be beaten disgracefully, but would deserve to be."</p>
   <p>The murderous assault on Schuettler ought to have opened the eyes even of the dullest to the necessity of putting an end to the boundless impudence of the Irish clan of murderers, unless Chicago is to be turned into a new "tipperary".</p>
   <p>The English vernacular papers in cowardly tones say that Chicago is the truest <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1032.jpg" n="3"/>and most typically American city. Nonsense! It will be, like New York, an Irish city, unless Americans, Germans and Swedes stand fast together to prevent such a calamity. It is unfortunately true that the Sunday and temperance question has caused a certain coldness between Americans and Germans. The Irish professional politicians of the Clan-Na-Gael have taken advantage of this feeling, to draw the American democrats into their service. But that shall and must not go on in this way! The bonds which these fellows who, it is true, speak English but think Irish, and look upon the United States as an appendage of Ireland to be wagged by them, have woven around our political parties, must he torn by a powerful hand. It as the part of just such American democrats as Mr. Gregier to make a beginning, if they want to prove that they are men. It is their first duty to purify the police force of all the comrades of the Clan-Na-Gael. Be a man, Mr. Gregier! Don't be mouse!</p>
