   <p>At this time of the year one usually peruses the customary declarations of financial wizards, industrial magnates, and great merchants, so lavishly displayed in the press. The good and true populace reads all about the golden mountains which have been promised for the New Year. One cannot hold these men responsible for their colored views. They probably prefer to abide by the old adage: silence is golden. But the newspapers and news agencies insist upon obtaining some explanation, and since these gentlemen do not care to express pessimistic opinions, they prefer to put on rose-colored glasses before bringing their gems of wisdom to paper.</p>
   <p>When one studies the statistics, it becomes evident that industrial production has experienced a great decline. In comparison with production as of last November, the decrease, expressed in per cent, is as follows: automobiles 16, hard coal 19, soft coal 1.2, cement 7, and copper 6.5. The iron and steel industry dropped to its lowest output of the year. A similar condition prevails <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1286.jpg" n="2"/>in rubber and lead. In other branches, however, an increase over last year may be noted, but this is offset by a higher inventory.</p>
   <p>There is one conspicuous factor: this recession started in November and affects nearly everything.</p>
   <p>As the stock market crash was confined to the last days of October and the beginning of November, it hardly seems plausible to associate this debacle with the general decline, because it is unreasonable to assume that the money depression could affect fundamental industries so quickly. In this connection one must also consider the fact that productions and sales were larger during the first eleven months of this year than in the corresponding period of last year: the average shows a decided difference.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances the belief seems justified that in some industries we were confronted with overproduction even before the crash. The reaction probably would have come regardless of the failure. But the fiasco hurried <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1287.jpg" n="3"/>and aggravated the situation. However, if one intends to predict future economic conditions by consulting the records of the past, then one should realize that such predictions really lack a reliable foundation. The facts which might serve for such a foundation are contradictory.</p>
   <p>In judging events of the last eleven months by the simple expedient of comparing them with a similar period of the previous year, we perceive a steadily rising line; proceeding similarly with November of 1929 and November of 1928, we find that a downward trend is plainly indicated. This accordingly shows that statistics about large industries are not at all a reliable basis for predictions of this type.</p>
   <p>It would now be interesting to have official figures on unemployment, but such statistics have not been compiled for years. After the last national campaign <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1288.jpg" n="4"/>this lack became conspicuously evident. When the former Democratic presidential candidate, Alfred E. Smith, mentioned our four million unemployed, Washington protested vehemently. Finally it came to light that Smith's estimate was gleaned from unofficial figures given to Congress at the time.</p>
   <p>Whether the figures were reliable cannot be decided; but the episode is illuminating, since it shows why the government no longer publishes any data on unemployment. It desires to propogate the theme of our Republican prosperity, and has no intention of providing an adversary with suitable weapons for a campaign issue.</p>
   <p>In that respect England is far more straight-forward and honest. On that island, just a few days ago, J. H. Thomas, member of the present Labor cabinet, declared: "I tell you candidly, I have not yet solved this unemployment problem."</p>
   <p>Our administration might well regard this as an example worthy of emulation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1289.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After all, the public is entitled to authoritative figures on the state of the labor market. It is also very naive to assume that the unemployed will become more satisfied if the government withholds these facts.</p>
