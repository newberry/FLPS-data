   <p>The bakers met at Quincy Number Nine yesterday afternoon to organize an employers' association. Fred Voltz called the meeting to order and said that the purpose was to protect the bakers against losses and other disagreeable matters. The men were demanding higher wages and shorter working hours, not considering that material costs have risen considerably, and that products must still be sold at former prices. Mr. Voltz was elected chairman, and L. J. Kadish secretary. About fifty of the city's most prominent bakers were present, among them George A. Farnum of the firm of W. H. Aldrich and Company, Jacob Heissler, O. M. Brady, William Smith, Frank Schweinfurth, and William Burmeister.</p>
   <p>The assembly nominated two committees, one to formulate the bylaws and the other to prepare a price list. In regard to the latter the committee gave these quotations: hard rolls, doughnuts, and similar small bakery goods fried <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1478.jpg" n="2"/>in lard, ten cents a dozen wholesale, twelve cents a dozen retail; bread, an increase of one cent per loaf; and pies, twelve cents each to dealers.</p>
   <p>The report of this committee resulted in a prolonged debate, in which the increased price on bread was declared unavoidable.</p>
   <p>The bakers feared that a general strike would be called by their men next Saturday and wanted to prepare for it by forming an organization.</p>
