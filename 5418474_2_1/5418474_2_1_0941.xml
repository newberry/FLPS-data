   <p>Like any other distinguished newspaper, the Illinois Staats Zeitung keeps strictly within a certain policy, and conducts itself in a gentlemanly manner, therefore, the Illinois Staats Zeitung avoids interfering with the private affairs of the individual. It is often difficult, to draw the line between private affairs and public activities, because many times these two are so closely interwoven, that they can hardly be separated. But often, as in this case, the public activities of a man can be judged correctly only then, when we know his private life, his secret intentions and relations, which are carefully hidden from publicity. Such a man is Maximilian Harden, whose name has appeared quite often in English newspapers, under the epithet, The famous German publicist. Many of his American colleagues do not know more of him than his assumed name and the self advertisement, which is cleverly carried on by him.</p>
   <p>The harmless American public is under the impression that Maximilian Harden is one of Germany's most eminent men, one who is gifted with extraordinary knowledge and has the best connections and noble associations. Also the prominent American newspapers refer to this man continuously as The famous German publicist, and yet so little glory is due him. Let us view this famous German <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0942.jpg" n="2"/>publicist, in the interest of the American public and public opinion, in order to prevent any further misleading on the part of this man.</p>
   <p>Maximilian Harden is the descendent of a Polish-Jewish family of the name Witkowski, of not quite unobjectionable past, and he was born in Berlin. Maximilian Harden, who, originally was Isadore Witkowski, ran away from school and joined a provincial theatrical show of the lowest class, with which he remained until he discovered his journalistic ability. In 1892 he founded the renowned Zukunft with Jewish capital. Desire for profit, made him take the part of the fallen Bismark, thereby drawing attention upon himself. Attention! Only, which is far from respect. Respect, he never understood how to achieve, as well as he understood how to become popular and to turn sensation into money.</p>
   <p>Not even his own race paid him respect. Alfred Gold writes in the Frankfurter Zeitung, a one hundred per cent Jewish newspaper, the following article: "They have in the definitely practical Berlin an educational automat for the less intellectual class of people; a journalistic motor giver. Throwing a question in the slot, you will receive the answer. The secret is that this apparatus must produce soiled paper on account of its weak internal organs, its name is, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0943.jpg" n="3"/>as guessed before hand, Maximilian Harden.</p>
   <p>Alfred Kerr, the publisher of the once popular semi-monthly, Pan, calls his Jewish colleague, Harden, Hurrah Mausche, Savonarola with Koerting stock. These examples are innumerable, but the mentioned ones may suffice. They indicate that Maximilian Harden never was respected, and that he always was and is a man of dirty work.</p>
   <p>His Zukunft is overrated in the same degree as the famous German publicist, Harden-Witkowski. The Zukunft is a small format, printed on cheap paper, whose style is admired by superficial minds only, because it is nothing else, but a reception Talumd. Therefore, judgment is passed over the originality of Mr. H Harden. During its boom the Zukunft had 20,000subscribers, today it has less than half of this number, for Mr. Harden's star is sinking, especially since the public has found out, that his so called importance is nothing but gossip, This, of course, is a sensitive situation for Mr. Harden Witkowski, the greedy business journalist. We have had enough of this famous German publicist, Harden-Witkowski, so probably, have our readers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0944.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The honorable part of our English newspapers might remember this discussion when interviews on articles of Mr. Harden will be cabled again for the purpose known to every newspaper man.</p>
