   <p>[This is the fifth in a series of articles on this subject.]</p>
   <p>At this point we shall have to digress from the subject of our last essay, "Collapse and Reconstruction," because we have received a correction which seems important enough to justify such a diversion, in that it sheds a light on the typical attitude of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of workers.</p>
   <p>From a trustworthy source we obtained the following letter:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1532.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"....I have noticed that certain articles published by the Abendpost have aroused much interest among the German-speaking workers of the International Harvester Company. Already the 'Workers' Industrial Council," of which I am a delegate, has issued a statement to all the newspapers (Daily News, October 9), and it would be helpful if it were published in German, also, since many Poles, Rumanians, and Kuschuben [Germanized Slavic race, linguistically related to the Poles] read German newspapers.</p>
   <p>"But it would be of even greater assistance to as if someone representing the workers' interests would explain the system of our organization to the Industrial Conference in Washington. Gompers and his men are not concerned with the problem of the workers; they are only interested in our pennies. They promise a lot of strike assistance and after we have been out on the street for weeks we still have to shell out instead of getting something...</p>
   <p>"The system still isn't what it should be, and much work still has to be <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1533.jpg" n="3"/>done to enlighten the Serbs and Slovaks; but if we get good advice and instructions, we can do everything in an orderly manner because we elect our own delegates by ballot instead of paying job-hunting officials to represent our interests....</p>
   <p>"And we won't have peace until the agitation for the liberation of political prisoners ceases. Our last strike began with a parade on July 7, which resulted in noise and violence because the agents tried to make us come out and demonstrate on behalf of Mooney. Since many hotheads participated, the company managed to get rid of some rowdies; many actually had to beg to get their jobs back. Now some of them have become active again and are agitating for a political strike to destroy the system of direct representation by workers through 'Industrial Councils'. The worst agitators are the few highly-paid toolmakers, because these gentlemen take great pains to see that we machine workers pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them. There is a lot of talk here about the I. W.W. and other groups, just to make the Russians, Poles, and Hungarians believe that their wages will be raised to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1534.jpg" n="4"/>seventy-five cents an hour if only they will holler loudly enough. I wish I could write all this for the newspaper. I could say so many things....</p>
   <p>"(signed) E. N...Lick"</p>
   <p>In checking up on the above letter we obtained the following information: The strike in the McCormick plant was actually ordered by business agents to scuttle the workers' direct factory representation. The shutdown of all the plants was ordered by the company at the request of the Workers' Industrial Council to prevent violence and vandalism. The reopening of all plants in the Chicago area, where approximately thirty thousand men are employed, also took place after the Workers' Industrial Council had made a decision and wage rates had been established. The end of the statement is repeated, verbatim:</p>
   <p>"In regards to the Workers' Industrial Council, all we can say is that it <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1535.jpg" n="5"/>functions well, although, when the system was first suggested and even after it was inaugurated, we were more or less skeptical. whenever the employers want to give away something for nothing, we become suspicious. The workers are suspicious of all favors which are offered to them; but we talked it over and decided to give it a tryout. The general attitude of the workers was that for years they had been badly cheated, and therefore they could not warm up to this idea. But now we are convinced that this plan guarantees the workers honest and genuine representation. All complaints are taken up right at the plants and the causes are immediately eliminated. wage questions are argued and settled peacefully, and every single worker, from the lowest to the highest paid, may obtain a hearing, and is treated fairly.</p>
   <p>"During the lockout the Workers' Industrial Council was in complete charge of directing the strike. The company management left it to us to decide when it would be advisable to reopen the plants for operation."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1536.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The letter and statement quoted above led to a meeting during which opinions were exchanged and the following points which are of interest to the public, were formulated.</p>
   <p>First: The request, that this type of workers' representation be brought up for discussion at the present Industrial Conference cannot be granted, because the congress provides that only one of three official groups may decide what subject shall be brought before that body. Mr. Baruch, as representative of the Government, and Mr. McNabe, a prominent businessman of San Francisco, generally known as a friend of labor, had sharp arguments with Samuel Gompers, whom they accused of suppressing free speech because he objected to suggestions and proposals made by labor organizations other than the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>Second: The workers' representatives are not elected, but are appointed by Gompers. Without exception, they all have been holding highly paid positions <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1537.jpg" n="7"/>for many years.</p>
   <p>Third: Mr. A. Jones, general manager of the International Harvester Company, appointed by President Wilson to represent the employers at the Conference, has declined without comment to officiate. But even if he had accepted, he could not have personally endorsed the system (of direct representation), because such an action would have been interpreted as an attempt to destroy unions, just like the Rockefeller plan.</p>
   <p>Fourth: The political demagogues within the unions are not interested in eliminating the unrest and agitation caused by the imprisonment of those who oppose war and its methods, because the liberation of these prisoners would take the wind out of their sails.</p>
   <p>The two million unionists organized in the Federation, sixty per cent of whom are disgruntled, are opposed by ten million workers who have no representation <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1538.jpg" n="8"/>at the Conference. The desires and suggestions of the majority of these men can only be made known to the citizens of this country through the daily press.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the declaration of the workers of the International Harvester Company proves that thinking about the workers' problems is an activity which is not confined to that part of labor which is guided by the "business agents". An employee of the International Harvester Company has offered a plan which he says will be submitted to the Workers' Industrial Council at their next session. His proposal offers a solution to a pressing problem, but it is doubtful that his plan will reach the Washington Conference, to say nothing of being admitted to discussion, unless public pressure forces the negotiators to "an open covenant, openly arrived at". The worker's proposal reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"To halt social unrest, to check the outbreak of political conflicts, and to deprive dissatisfaction of its main source; be it <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1539.jpg" n="9"/>"Resolved, That the Industrial Conference, now in session in Washington, D.C. be asked to give consideration to the following:</p>
   <p>"1) The agitation for strikes, and the wilful destruction of the means of production to force the liberation of all men and women sentenced and imprisoned during the war because of their political and religious convictions can best be stopped by setting them free, thus eliminating any further fomenting of passions.</p>
   <p>"2) The Industrial Council shall recognize the right of the workers to organize and to bargain collectively for the adjustment of working conditions and the settlement of complaints, and we recommend as the best system, the election of plant committees, and the rejection of committees composed of persons not employed in the industry.</p>
   <p>"3) The Industrial Council recognizes the necessity of co-operation between <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1540.jpg" n="10"/>plant committees of factories and industries within a given locality, to establish uniform wages and working hours, and to settle all labor complaints; it also recognizes the right of the workers to strike, and the right of the employers to shut down factories while controversial issues are being settled.</p>
   <p>"4) The Council realizes that the efficiency of the workers can be increased by giving them greater job security, and furthermore, that protection against revengeful sabotage and malicious destruction of equipment is best guaranteed by responsible supervision by the workers' committees, duly elected by the workers.</p>
   <p>"5) The Council recommends that all employers whose employees are striking because of either the 'closed shop' agreement or the 'check-off' system, recognize the resolution, points two to four inclusive. Such recognition will guarantee the workers the right of representation to bring the strikes <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1541.jpg" n="11"/>to an immediate stop, and so will pave the way for the regulation of working conditions by these plant committees which will consist solely of workers employed at the plant."</p>
   <p>The discovery that their opinions will find an audience through the press will make many thousands of Chicago workers confident, especially those who speak only German in addition to their native Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian, or other southern Slavic language. Whether one likes the idea or not, the above-mentioned plans will eventually have to be discussed, even at the Industrial Conference.</p>
