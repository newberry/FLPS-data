<title level="a">MEETING OF GERMAN SALOONKEEPERS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday the German saloonkeepers of the city met at 23 West Madison Street to elect a delegate to serve on the Anti-Temperance Committee. All the men present were convinced that in view of the peculiar circumstances in which the saloonkeepers of Chicago find themselves today--everyone of them is prey to the whims and arbitrary acts of the police department--it is absolutely necessary to organize to protect their interests. In various parts of the city the outlawed Sunday laws are enforced more or less strictly, depending upon circumstances; some saloonkeepers are being favored and others are wronged.</p>
   <p>After the meeting had been called to order by Mr. Kuper, the chairman, of the Committee, Wilhelm Rintelmann was appointed chairman of the meeting. Wilhelm Schaefer was unanimously elected as a delegate to the Anti-Temperance Committee, and a committee of seven members was chosen to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0059.jpg" n="2"/>interview all saloonkeepers with reference to organizing an association of saloonkeepers.</p>
