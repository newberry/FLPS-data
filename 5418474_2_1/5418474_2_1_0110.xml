<title level="a">THE TRIUMPHAL MARCH OF THE TWENTY-FIRST AMENDMENT</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Twenty-first Amendment has started on a regular victory march across the country. This Amendment will be the gallows on which the Eighteenth Amendment is going to be hanged, sometime before the year of Our Lord 1933 has passed. So far twenty-one states have declared themselves overwhelmingly in favor of the repeal of the Volstead Act, and by the end of this year, thirty-seven states will have voted on the issue. Ratification by thirty-six states is sufficient to seal the fate of the Eighteenth Amendment once and for all. who will write the melodramatic story of the American bootlegger, who, by the end of the year, will have to find a new means of livelihood for himself? The number of common criminals in our country will be increased, and no longer will our criminal law have to come to a stop when it is faced with these cesspools of political protection [the former bootleggers]. Constitutional amendments are increasing in number; times are changing. It is strange that people can no longer work up any enthusiasm for truly noble experiments!</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0111.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Fifteen more states will have to vote "Yes" on the Twenty-first Amendment, and the spell which prohibition has cast over our country for thirteen years will be broken. We will again be able to enjoy good liquor, and will no longer be asked to swallow horrible booze, and then cough and say it was "excellent," while we try to look like a connoisseur. Alcohol will lose its attraction as soon as it is a legal beverage. This is especially true of the young smart alecks of both sexes. How daring those boys and girls used to feel when they refused alcoholic mixtures, and preferred their whisky "straight". The first one to get soused was the hero of the evening. Prohibition has caused an epidemic of alcoholism among the youth. The Twenty-first Amendment will put a quick stop to that. Youth is always attracted by forbidden fruit. When prohibition ceases, drinking will lose its attraction for our young people. The grown ups did not behave much better. Drinking at any time during the day or night became the great fashion, and one could not afford to ignore it without jeopardy to one's reputation as a modern and up-to-date person. It was easier to swim with the stream than against it.</p>
   <p>All this is now on the way out since beer has been legalized. We will return <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0112.jpg" n="3"/>to normal conditions when wines and liquors are permitted. That mysterious halo which has hovered over all alcoholic drinks since 1920, will vanish in the sober and daily routine of every day life as soon as large numbers of bottles with divers contents grace the windows of liquor dealers to be sold at reasonable prices. Then we will again see the type of consumer to whom alcohol is a mental and physical stimulant; one who practices moderation for his health's sake, as well as for the sake of good taste. The habitual drunk will always drink to excess. That was so before prohibition, during prohibition, and will continue to be so. But the great majority of the population will resume normal drinking habits after prohibition is repealed. For the sake of the morality and health of our people, we hope that the Twenty-first Amendment will conclude its triumphal march across the land with a splendid victory.</p>
