   <p>The investigation into the business methods of the meat barons has not yet been concluded, but they have progressed to such an extent that they afford an interesting insight into the doings of the magnates of the meat-trust. For years they have striven, striven systematically and with the firm resolve to gain their end, to devise methods which would enable them to decrease the price paid to stockmen and farmers for the animals which are butchered and, at the same time, to increase the price of meat and its by-products. One of the most powerful of the meat barons, J. Ogden Armour, had to admit that the great packing houses have contributed to a fund which is gathered and used to prevent the enactment of legislation which is contrary to the interests of the packers. It would be interesting to find out who was fed from this corruption-fund. In any event, the fact that such a fund was created and maintained indicates the means with which the large packing houses operate. And there ought to be more powerful and effective means to create a distaste for such means and methods.</p>
