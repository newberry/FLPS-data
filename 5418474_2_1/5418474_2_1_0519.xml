   <p>The committee of the recent protest meeting had a gathering last night at the Sherman House, Some collection books have not come in yet. Mr. Cervenka in the name of the Bohemian organizations paid an additional amount of $20,000. It was resolved to form a permanent organization of all associations and persons without consideration of political and religious motives to agitate against any limitations of social rights or personal freedom by town and state. The present officers are Mr. John Koelling, Chairman, Fritz Nebel, second Chairman and financial secretary. Franz Amberg, Treasurer, and G. A. von Massow, Secretary.</p>
   <p>The Chairman according to instructions will nominate a committee of five persons for working out the constitutions and by-laws and they will be assisted by the present press Committee, the Chairman, and the Secretary. The intention is to form an organization including all nationalities, which will try to get hold of all ordinances to be passed by the City council concerning the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0520.jpg" n="2"/>Associations. If the absolute power does not rest with the City Council, the organization will be extended over the whole State and the intended purpose will be followed up with the legislation. A committee of three gentlemen has been appointed to get in touch with the Aldermen, which should propose the new council names for the committees of this corporation.</p>
