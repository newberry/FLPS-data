<title level="a">PROTEST AGAUAST THE NORTH SIDE STREETCAR COMPANY</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A mass meeting was held at Ogden's Grove as a protest against the conduct of the North Side Streetcar Company. Although the crowd was not especially large, it nevertheless voiced its objections in a most energetic manner. Mr. Haussner, who was elected chairman, said that the meeting was called to formulate protests in order to compel the North Side Streetcar Company to Sprinkle the streets along its right of way, as provided for by the franchise. Through his [Haussner's] activities, the Company was cited to the police court because the clause was ignored, but the fine assessed against the Company was never collected, and the city administration did nothing in the matter. He [Haussner] asked Corporation Counsel Grinnell what the latter intends to do about it, and was told that Grinnell intends to enter two suits against the Company. One of the suits would involve all those streets on which tracks were laid since the ordinance was passed, and the other would include the streets used by the corporation prior to the enactment of the ordinance. If the citizens consider this insufficient, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1399.jpg" n="2"/>then they can institute procedures at their own expense.</p>
   <p>Linscott, former prosecuting attorney at the police court, was present at the meeting and explained matters. He showed that it is very difficult to fight a powerful corporation, and that makes it absolutely necessary to arouse general indignation, if success is to be attained. He added, that a protest to the City Council might bring results. But the most effective way of handling the affair would be to sue the Company's conduct, it is averse to being hailed to court, and experience proves that the Company did everything within its power to delay a verdict. The city officials should be watched, lest they be influenced by the corporation.</p>
   <p>Linscott did not consider it impossible to obtain legal action, if the citizens are properly organized and proceed in an energetic manner. It may be advisable <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1400.jpg" n="3"/>not to place reliance on a police court, but to bring the matter before a justice of the peace.</p>
   <p>The chairman said that he would inquire which justice of the peace will handle the suit at the least expense; then the residents on the street in question shall pay their share of the costs.</p>
   <p>Upon the motion of Knobelsdorff, it was decided also to submit a petition to the City Council. A resolution was passed to sue the company whenever Clybourn Avenue is not sprinkled, and to enter a suit every day, if necessary. Adjournment followed.</p>
