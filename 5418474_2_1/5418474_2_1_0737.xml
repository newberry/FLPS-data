   <p>The German-American, who was recently criticized by us for having had his defense of the Sunday law published in the Times, now sends us the following communication:</p>
   <p>"My dear Editor: Allow me to answer yoour article in which you call me a coward and a hypocrite. You call <gap unit="words" extent="5" reason="illegible"/> my name after an article in the Times. <gap unit="words" extent="17" reason="illegible"/>. It must be said that the <gap unit="words" extent="12" reason="illegible"/>. I did not sign my name because I did not want to expose myself to the vengeance and brutality of <gap unit="words" extent="5" reason="illegible"/> strongly represented in the "Liberty League." I have never claimed to speak in the name of all the Germans, but only in the name of decent German-Americans.</p>
   <p>No one can deny that we have too many saloons in Chicago and that many people have given up an honorable trade to become saloon-keepers, so as to indulge in laziness and often in drunkenness. Generally those saloon-keepers are Germans. When that type of person is exhorted to violate the law and after conviction <gap unit="words" extent="12" reason="illegible"/>
<pb facs="5418474_2_1_0738.jpg" n="2"/>
that the <gap unit="words" extent="22" reason="illegible"/></p>
   <p>Our <gap unit="words" extent="9" reason="illegible"/> based solely on the fact that instead of working among and with the Germans, he had to publish his views in an English newspaper, which is known for its hypocrisy and hatred for the Germans. At some other time we <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> answer the other accusations made in this letter.</p>
   <p>The Editor.</p>
