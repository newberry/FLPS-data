   <p>Our fellow citizen, the dark-skinned statesman and parliamentarian Oscar DePriest, made a speech recently on the Haiti question. Therein he proved that he is fully equal to his colleagues of lighter hue, and in more than one instance demonstrated his qualifications as a hundred percent American politician. In the latter role, his mental and political attitude may also be summed up in the stereotyped sentence: "He wants something."</p>
   <p>To quote an excerpt from Oscar DePriest's speech: "I wish this country would also manifest more interest in the black man. In my opinion, the people of my race should have the right of self-determination, here as well as in Haiti."</p>
   <p>The first part of the assertion can only be given its proper interpretation <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0897.jpg" n="2"/>if we consider it in the literal sense. In other words, the representative of the First Congressional District of Chicago believes that the white man should show more interest in the black man, and not concentrate his entire attention on the black woman.</p>
   <p>Oscar's words can hardly convey any other impression, because the Black Lady already enjoys a very considerable popularity with the Pale Face. The interest of the latter is of a rather intimate sort. It has successfully achieved its purpose. as is obviously and undeniably proven by uncounted half-breeds in the nation, ranging in color from chocolate brown to delicate olive yellow. That the pallid creatures show less concern for the masculine negroid specimen than for the feminine is really an unjust assumption. Their interest in the former is simply of a different nature, less effective perhaps and hence not so conspicuous.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the contention next expressed by Oscar DePriest is really untenable. In the second sentence he refers to the principle of self- <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0898.jpg" n="3"/>determination a phrase coined by President Wilson during the War and used unscrupulously but successfully by the Allies for propaganda purposes.</p>
   <p>In this country, at least in the North, the Negro has enjoyed the franchise for a long time. And in the South, where their position is still on a low plane, they are in no worse a plight than the poor chalk-cheeked inhabitants, whether they be preachers, sheriffs, or policemen.</p>
   <p>The economic condition of the dark-faced people is quite good. In the field of politics, there is still less reason to complain. A case in point is Oscar DePriest himself, who represents Martin B. Madden's old district in the House of Representatives. In our State Legislature we have oodles of representatives of ebony hue, and this high representation also obtains in all Northern states having a fairly large slate hued population.</p>
   <p>In cultural pursuits, the Negro has made great progress. In Harlem, New York's Black Belt, they have created an educational center for the Negroes of the world. They write novels and operas, appear with outstanding success <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0899.jpg" n="4"/>on stage and screen, and their scientific accomplishments are accorded proper recognition by the white proponents of wisdom.</p>
   <p>They dominate the American scene with their melodies; two varieties of songs, the "mammy" and the "blues," rule the legitimate stage and vaudeville, and often furnish the musical motif in the so-called talkies.</p>
   <p>Of course, the progenitors of the efficient and business-like artists who create and popularize these tunes did not originate in Africa. They lived mostly in Czernowitz or Kishinev, but nonetheless the music is predominantly negroid in character.</p>
   <p>In dancing, the plantation influence predominates. America has adopted the terpsichorean ideas of the Africans, and the whole world apes America. In fact, the earth gyrates to the fife of the dusky man.</p>
   <p>The dark-skin influence in modern culture is apparent everywhere, and not <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0900.jpg" n="5"/>only in France where racial differences and color prejudice are unknown. Even gin, favorite drink of the ebon specie, enjoys increasing esteem. In many American bars in Europe it is now regarded as the most important ingredient of the cocktail.</p>
   <p>The Negroes have no cause for complaint, and Oscar DePriest probably only resorted to a time-honored practice, fearing that his constituents and subordinates would not regard him as a true statesman and friend of the people if he acted otherwise.</p>
