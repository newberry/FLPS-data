   <p>A representative German-American meeting took place last night at Eicke's hall, on Randolph Street, at which the entire gathering voiced to support of the plan to call a German-American meeting in sympathy with the Boers. There were singing societies, turn societies, military societies, students societies, lodges, in short, German societies of all descriptions were represented. Jacob Ingenthron, first speaker of the turn society, Vorwaerts, was acting chairman and Carl Haerting was secretary. Outstanding among the many speakers of the evening was Pastor Georg Heldmann, who said that it was the duty of the German element to come to the assistance of those valiant warriors, the Boers, and to aid them morally and if necessary even financially. And then he continued: "Only last year, the Germans gave a fine exhibition of their unity. The imposing demonstration did not fail to shut up the English big months and agitators. Now we have another opportunity to show our unity, by extending <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1009.jpg" n="2"/>our support to a small but courageous nation, which so admirably defends Its home and its freedom. We must protest against this unjust war, and the attack upon the liberty of a small nation as an act which will eventually threaten the liberty of all humanity."</p>
   <p>Mr. R. M. Springer, secretary for the Liberty Alliance, reported that that organization is preparing for one of the biggest demonstrations, to be held at Tattersall's on the 22nd of this month in sympathy with the Boers. He also suggested that the Germans join his organization's demonstration, which suggestion was taken into consideration. But this fact does not alter the plans, for a German mass demonstration.</p>
