   <p>All laws are supposed to be based on intelligence, and are intended to promote the common welfare. But the law, or rather the ordinance, which provides for the midnight closing of all taverns in a city of over a half million people, is based neither on intelligence nor on the welfare of the inhabitants.</p>
   <p>The solons of our city should consider that the taxpayers of our community do not always earn their money in the daytime. There are thousands of people making an honest living by working at night.</p>
   <p>Should the printer who works in the pressroom of a newspaper at night, the baker, butcher, milkman, and many others be deprived of an invigorating drink, while a snob may imbibe champagne within the closed confines of his home or <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0648.jpg" n="2"/>some gambling den?</p>
   <p>Solons of the city council! When you passed the ordinance, were you not aware of the fact that travelers arrive at all hours, and that they crave a cool, refreshing drink?</p>
   <p>The declaration of our alderman, Mr. Cullerton, that the city would soon be a hell hole if saloons were allowed to stay open all night, is senseless, and I can understand it just as little as the king of bygone days, who was advised by his city elders to abolish all houses of ill repute [sic].</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison was right when he recommended passage of the bill. He was right--and you, city fathers, were wrong. I wish the honorable members of the city council could see a large European city--they would find many taverns which stay open all night.</p>
   <p>Let the dives and gambling dens be closed at a certain hour, but give the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0649.jpg" n="3"/>owner of a respectably conducted saloon permission to admit any decent man or laborer after closing time.</p>
   <p>We have many saloons here which are conducted in an orderly manner, and they pay their taxes with the receipts from the night and early morning trade. All of these taverns work for the coffers of the city, and the representatives of the people must take cognizance of this fact. Don't kill the goose which lays the golden egg.</p>
   <p>Alderman Wickersham apparently is not very familiar with history, if he believes that drinking after midnight strains family ties and causes divorces. The statement, as usually made, leads to this belief, but the phrase, in this instance, is only used as propaganda to pass a temperance law, and that is what the ordinance amounts to.</p>
   <p>I suggest that every prohibitionist or "water wagon advocate" consider the standing of all nations which permit intoxicating drinks: England, Germany, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0650.jpg" n="4"/>Austria, France, Italy, and so forth. These are the dominant, progressive nations of the world, while the Turks, Chinese, Mamelukes, and Hottentots lack inventive genius.</p>
   <p>Wine, and the cultivation of grapes, is of almost as ancient origin as the human race. Noah had a grape arbor. Christ used the vine as a symbol when He said, "I am the vine and ye are the grapes," and the Saviour drank wine. The Greeks and Romans, who developed culture in the days of antiquity, enjoyed wine, and even believed that their gods reveled in nectar.</p>
   <p>Only a prohibitionist or simpleton believes in water.</p>
   <p>"In aqua est vanitas,</p>
   <p>In vino est veritas."</p>
   <p>A. Soehngen, Tavern owner, 177 Blue Island Ave.</p>
