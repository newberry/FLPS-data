   <p>Hundreds of associations will take part in unison at the protest meeting. Hundreds of the German associations, lodges etc. have decided to take part in a body at the great protest meeting, which will take place next Sunday afternoon at the Armory Hall of the First Regiment.</p>
   <p>The Schwaben Club will assemble at 1:30 in the afternoon and march with music and flying flags to the Northside Gymnastic Hall. Other gymnastic clubs will march out in the same manner. The Central Union of the German military clubs to which belong twelve associations meets down town and marches from there to the Hall.</p>
   <p>The delegates of the local section of the Luxemburg Independent Club had a meeting yesterday and made the following resolution. "The local citizens of Luxemburg descendants love their freedom and independence, which is endangered by an unjust withholding of "special bar permits" <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0526.jpg" n="2"/>by the city administration. We are hampered in the constitutionally guaranteed enjoyment of our social entertainments and for this reason it is resolved, that the Luxemburg Independent club as an incorporated association protests against such a tyrannical view of the law; that the Luxemburg Independent club will participate in the protest meeting next Saturday, March 25, at the Armory Hall arranged by the other associations of Chicago and finally it will be resolved, that all citizens of Luxemburg descent are invited to assemble at the above mentioned day at 1:30 at our hall to join the parade to the "First Regiment Armory."</p>
