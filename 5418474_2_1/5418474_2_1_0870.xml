   <p>In this country great care is exerted, not to do anything which may be interpreted as religious persecution or as partiality. It is not strange, therefore, that under the pretense of religion many things are tolerated which would other-wise be strictly prosecuted? Anything having connections with religion, or is finding protection under the cover of religion, is very carefully handled. The attitude of the state towards the "faithcure" teachings is an outstanding example. For instance, Christian Science has many lives upon their conscience, and yet the state does not dare to oppose them effectionly. Any one, who understands how to give his doings a pious coating, or to call his fraud a part of a religious doctrine, can be certain to be left along.</p>
   <p>Next to the faith healers the Salvation Armies are the worse offenders. Under the cover of religion they are doing things which should be punished; and their misdemeanor would be punished, if they did not understand how to scare the public, the officials, the states attorney, the judge, and the jury with high sounding religious phrases. If any society would cause such noise on street-corners every night, as the Salvation Army does under the pretense of religious service and revival work, for any other purpose, ways and means would be discovered quickly to surpress the disorder. However, it happens occasionally <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0871.jpg" n="2"/>that the officials take courage to arrest some of the pious men and woman and summon them before a judge, but the judge, as a rule, is not inclined to hurt the brave, and dismisses the case with a dignified exortation.</p>
   <p>Judge Orlady of the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania had the courage to tear off the religious cover from some violaters and to judge the case according its true nature. The judge explained the difference between religious liberty and that, which the Salvation Army wanted to have others consider as such. He made it clear, that in this particular case an intentional violation of the law was obvious and it had nothing to do with religious liberty. "It is intirely wrong", stated the Judge, "to assume that religious liberty does include the right to commit disorderly conduct under the pretense that it is part and parcel of a religious system." This is a statement which should serve as a guide for all judges and juries of our country.</p>
