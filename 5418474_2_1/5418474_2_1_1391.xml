   <p>The trial of the financial crook Henry Greenbaum in the Federal Court will soon be at an end. Greenbaum, during the hearing was on the witness stand most of the time. His answers in is own defense were foolish and laughable. The people in the court were amused. He attacked the Staats Zeitung, declaring they always tried to blackmail the prominent German-Americans. But perhaps the Editor did not master the German language, hence all these mistakes. The most prominent men at Chicago praised Greenbaum as a very clever and careful business man. Everybody spoke well about him. The court declared that more witnesses would take the stand. Mr. Elmer Washburn, took are witness stand as a Federal witness again and explained he has audited the Bank's books and found several wrong entries had been made. Wednesday, Greenbaum will have a chance to answer the Federal Witness, Washburn, and then he can expect his verdict. He went be hanged nor will he go to the penitentiary. The Jewish financial aristocrat will have to pay a large fine and maybe a year in County jail, with all the accomodations he wishes. If he gets a verdict of not guilty, goodbye to justice.</p>
