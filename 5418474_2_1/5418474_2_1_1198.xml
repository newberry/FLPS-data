   <p>The annual convention of the National Chamber of Commerce, which met this year in Washington, received much more attention from the press than in former years. This was due to the circumstance that the meeting was outspokenly political in character. It is a remarkable but undeniable fact that the public always has much more interest in political news than in news of an economic nature. If the Chamber of Commerce had confined its discussions to purely economic themes the newspapers would probably have given them little attention. But since the meeting could easily be mistaken for a Republican National Convention the press devoted much space to it.</p>
   <p>After the Chamber of Commerce had ripped into the Administration and President Roosevelt had replied in kind, the Convention decided it would be best to conclude with a conciliatory gesture. The new president of the Chamber of <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1199.jpg" n="2"/>Commerce, Harper Sibley, was given this task. He promptly explained that the National Chamber of Commerce harbored no feelings of hostility toward the Administration but that there was, unfortunately, "an honest difference of opinion" between the Chamber and the White House on various questions. That differences of opinion exist is very plain, and there is no doubt that both sides are sincere. Some elements in the situation, however, are still rather obscure.</p>
   <p>The keynote speaker of the convention was Henry I. Allen, former Governor of Kansas and United States Senator, considered the most reactionary Hoover-Republican from the most reactionary state in the Union. Even the friendliest of critics could hardly deny that this gave the meeting an openly political complexion. Who was it, however, who stood up for the Chamber against the adverse criticism of the President? This was none other than Representative Bertrand Snell of New York, the chairman of the last Republican National Convention, who is also one of Herbert Hoover's most loyal adherents. Under these circumstances we have no choice but to characterize the convention of the Chamber of Commerce as a Republican campaign meeting.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the campaign is now going on and, although the Republicans have not <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1200.jpg" n="3"/>yet selected their candidates, their campaign is already in full swing. The next meeting will be held June 10 and 11 in Springfield, Illinois. And there was a reason for selecting this place for the meeting. They wish to conjure up the Martyr President, Abraham Lincoln, from his grave, and thus provide the affair with an imposing historical background. There is nothing wrong with that; on the contrary, it would be a good thing if in meetings for current political purposes historical events were given more attention than is in general the case.</p>
   <p>Naturally, no predictions can be made as to what will be said and done at this meeting, to which Republican leaders from nine Middlewestern states have been invited. The summons to the meeting leads us to fear the worst, however. It contains not a single constructive idea. It maintains that the Constitution and our free institutions must be preserved by a sharp struggle against the New Deal; that at the same time, however, a fight must be made against the depression. The masses are unable to work up any enthusiasm for the struggle to defend the Constitution and our free institutions, for everyone knows that it was under this Constitution and these <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1201.jpg" n="4"/>institutions that the worst economic catastrophe in American history broke upon the country.</p>
   <p>Worst of all, however, is the circumstance that the summons maintains absolute silence about the fact that the crash occurred toward the end of 1929, that is, under a Republican Administration. It treats the depression as if the present Administration were responsible for it. The voters cannot be taken in by such tricks. How can they expect the people to have confidence in a party that lies, or tells only a half truth, about a matter of this importance? The meeting is supposed to work out a constructive program for the 1936 campaign. It would be a good thing for the whole country if they did this; but in that case they would have to go at it in an entirely different way. The Democratic Administration is really open to attack at several points, but attack and criticism must be honest and must rest upon a factual basis. Secondly, the party must make positive proposals. They will never get anywhere by making vague assertions and by dissimulation.</p>
