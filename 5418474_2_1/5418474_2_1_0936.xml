   <p>Chicago is the true type of an American metropolis, and can be proud of this character. Here is the glowing oven of the melting pot of races and nationalities, of which the Jewish philosopher and poet Israel Zangwill speaks. Not the eastern metropolis, New York, whose population is probably more cosmopolitan than ours, but is looked upon in an unpolitical sense, as a foreign city, rather than American.</p>
   <p>Only a foreign born population such as ours, whose hundreds of thousands of people completely separated themselves from their old homeland, and plunged right into the midst of the whirlpool of American life, was able to organize and maintain such a society, as the United societies.</p>
   <p>The success of these form a triumph in sociology, through their effective application upon the public life of their adopted country, which only the people of Europe know, and which was brought to America. At the same time it indicates a victory of the world philosophy, of the free and tolerant, over the narrow minded and tyrannical, and is an excellent illustration of the words of truth: "In union is <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0937.jpg" n="2"/>strength". We shall not forget, that the United Societies rose out of the German citizen clubs, but these facts can only now be considered as historical reminiscense, because of the considerably expanded spheres of activities of the organization, which during the years has extended over almost all national elements of the foreign born population of Chicago. Taking into consideration, that the latter including their descendents form a full third of the entire population of our city, it must be admitted, that the uniting represents a most efficient guardian of the personal freedom of our citizenship. Of their battles and success upon the indicated spheres, which until the present have been the main field of their activities and which have made the organization an important local political factor, nothing shall be mentioned, because they are known by friend and foe alike, and require giving to the former no extra glorification, and to the latter no excuse. But it can be substantiated with satisfaction, that the apprehension that the present war would be harmful to the organization, is not fulfilled. On the contrary, the United Societies after our country had become a participant in the world's War for almost a year, were stronger than ever. The best proof of that was the splendid attendance at and progress of the 13th annual convention held in the North Side Turner Hall, and the yearly reports of the committee, which were presented on this occasion. They were eloquent testimonials.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0938.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The organization proved its enthusiastic patriotism in different ways: through its joyous and continuous participation of the worries of the financial requirements in the conducting of the war; through its avoidance of any agitation for or against, and throught its efforts for the quickest way of Americanizing the immigrants.</p>
