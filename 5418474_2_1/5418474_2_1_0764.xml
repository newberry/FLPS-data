   <p>Numerous delegates were present last evening at the meeting of the Ward representatives who had been elected for the Anti-Temperance Committee. Only the Seventh and Tenth Wards were due to a mistake by the Executive Committee, not represented.</p>
   <p>Herr Jussen, as chairman of the Executive Committee elected at the Turn Hall meeting, called the assembly to order. He proposed to hold another meeting on a later evening when the Seventh and Tenth Wards would have elected delegates.</p>
   <p>Herr Carl Sievers opposed this, saying one should strike the iron while it was hot. He desired the election of a provisory board ("Vorstand")</p>
   <p>His motion was unanimously accepted, and Herr Beiersdorff was elected provisory chairman. Major Wallis was elected temporary secretary.</p>
   <p>Herr Sievers moves for the nomination of a Committee of five that shall be charged with proposing permanent officers of the organization.</p>
   <p>The chairman thinks it is time to express the thanks of the assembly to the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0765.jpg" n="2"/>old Executive Committee that has done its duty.</p>
   <p>Herr Jussen declares that he would resign with the greatest pleasure if the opinion prevailed that his services were no longer needed, but that he did not think the assembly empowered to push him and his colleagues out of the Executive Committee. The Turnhalle, he said, had resolved to complete the Executive Committee by the Ward delegates. "It is nonsense, it is childish, and it is an insult to deny that resolution". He gives his word of honor that he had no further ambitions, did want no other office, and only meant exactly what he was saying. The speaker then became excited, and made veiled attacks on various members of the assembly and on the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>There ensues a short personal debate between Mr. Carl Sievers and Mr. Jussen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carl Haussner wants to know if he, as a member of the Executive Committee, elected in the Turn Halle, had still a right to vote here. The chairman answers in the negative. Col. Rutishauser regrets this development and declares his <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0766.jpg" n="3"/>resignation from the Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. Michaelis renounced any further collaboration, though he had worked hard and spent much money. But the fact that one questioned the vote of the former Executive Committee members he thought very boorish. He regarded it as his duty, after having been treated so rudely, to resign altogether.</p>
   <p>After a prolonged debate it was decided to regard the members of the former Executive Committee as"delegates-at-large."</p>
   <p>Then the original motion of Herr Sievers was accepted, and a committee of five named to nominate permanent officers. The chairman selected the Messrs John Stuber, Ebersold, Ernst Mattern, Blattner and Ad. Muller for the Committee, and William Vocke was proposed for President, Major Wallis, vice-president, Carl Sievers, Secretary and T. Gross, Jun., Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Carl Haussner: Herr Vocke is not in Chicago. Should there be a vacancy from the start, that will be bad business.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0767.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Major Wallis: The Legislature will adjourn on Saturday. Mr. Vocke will from then on be uninterruptedly in Chicago till fall.</p>
   <p>F. Witte, also would oppose the election of absentees, but makes an exception for Mr. Vocke, because he is a capable man, and as a member of the Legislature might be very helpful.</p>
   <p>Ch. Haussner: To start a meeting with an absent president is a farce. That has not happened in all world history.</p>
   <p>A vote of all against one established thereupon Mr. Vocke as a candidate. Then the slate of four was voted upon as a bloc, and elected, and finally the election was made unanimous. Major Wallis took over the chairmanship. Jussen moved to elect a Committee of three for legal protection, that shall assist the innkeepers if they are attacked by the temperance advocates on account of the State laws. The Committee was elected: Ed. Jussen for the North Side, Rodbertus for the South Side. T. Gross, Jum. for the West Side. After another lengthy debate it was resolved that each Ward shall hold a meeting <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0768.jpg" n="5"/>for the purpose of collecting funds. Then the meeting was adjourned until next Tuesday evening at the same place.</p>
