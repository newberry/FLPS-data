   <p>In a commonwealth in which law and order rules, we do not have to fear for our life and our bodily freedom; but only too often and persistently, the attempts are repeated to rob us of our internal freedom, or in other words, to enslave us spiritually, because these annoyances cannot be considered as anything else, to which our German cultural life is exposed. The almost violent prevention of public concerts with German songs, the encroachment against the use of the German language, which, in fact, is driven towards direct, even official suppression. To crown the work of German baiting in our own country, to which we are true and loyal citizens, is the aim to suppress German newspapers. Who surrenders himself is irretrievably lost. What is true of the single person, is also true of a whole race and its spiritual life. The German newspapers of America have fought in a manly way for their existence, but many a gap has been torn by the enemies which cannot be filled again and further sacrifices may be necessary.</p>

   <p>Especially for reasons of usefulness, the German press of this country is supported in the fight for its existence by authoritative men of the government, because it has to be admitted, that it cannot be spared in the endeavor to help Americanize the immigrants of German nationality. But now the sacred duty approaches for the politically naturalized German people to wage their own battle for their spiritual endeavor. The moment is here to convince the German press, that it can depend upon the energetic and self sacrificing assistance of the German people and not, that its rights of existence depend upon reasons of political necessity and efficacy. Because the German press is the most important factor for the maintenance of cultural life which we, as American citizens, do not have to renounce and shall not renounce, because it agrees with our views. The German newspapers carry to us, daily, the use of the German language and through their knowledge, we and our children receive in our mother tongue those treasures given by our philosophers and poets. It is the sacred duty of all German-Americans to stop the work of destruction, and preserve our cultural life in America as much as possible.</p>
   <p>To that belongs first, that the old spokesmen of the German newspapers of</p>

   <p>this country, who have represented for many years the cause of the German people, receive the full and joyous support of all those, who are esteemed as the spiritual leaders of the German population and as such enjoy their confidence. It cannot be permitted, that in a metropolis like ours, with such a large German population, a greatly esteemed newspaper, with such an honorable past as has the Illinois Staats Zeitung should succumb to the assaults of time and enemies.</p>
