<title level="a">THE HIGH RATES OF OUR UTILITIES</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Following the great crash in November, 1929, the prices of everything were reduced. This was quite understandable, for when billions are lost on the exchange, or when banks go bankrupt through the devaluation of real estate, the people no longer possess the same wherewithal to buy as they had before. The prices fell, therefore, not on all commodities at once, but on almost all of them in the course of the succeeding years. Longer to remain on their old level were the salaries of the public officials, which remained the same until the need for drastic tax reductions reduced them, too.</p>
   <p>At last there remained only the rates of the various utilities, which were established, or at least approved, by the trade commission of the state. They resisted successfully all assaults directed against them by the public because the latter, regrettable as it may be, has no weapons strong enough <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1252.jpg" n="2"/>to pierce the armor of the utilities. They sit in a stronghold well protected by charters, from where, with the aid of skillfully trained and highly paid attorneys, they can easily repulse all attacks on the part of the unorganized public. To be sure, the state, to protect the public against being overreached too much, has instituted an office to try complaints and to see to it that the structure of the utilities does not become top-heavy. This trade commission of the state performs an egg dance when it occasionally wakes from its Snow White sleep and begins to investigate.</p>
   <p>But even if the commission were more active, the success of its efforts would still be dubious. It is but a state institution, and most of the time is scarcely in a position to make its resolutions effective. For if, in an important case, it should ever decide against the streetcar company or the gas company, then the company would immediately carry its suit to the federal court, thus automatically withdrawing the case from the jurisdiction of the state, and so from the authority of the state commission. The legal advisers of the monopolies always do find grounds for such flights <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1253.jpg" n="3"/>into the federal courts. Their most favored ground is that the commission's decision is tantamount to a confiscation of property. Then, in the federal court, the suit is continued for years, while the consumers can only keep calm and continue paying the high rates. By the time a decision is finally reached, conditions have assumed such different proportions that the public interest has waned. The company is counting on that. Postponements of trials pay the companies well, exactly as in the case of one legally prosecuted in Chicago who obtains postponements through political "pull". He can have his trial adjourned from time to time, until the indicting office is no longer able to find witnesses against him, and either he is released because there is no proof against him or, if obliged to face his trial, he gets away with a much lighter sentence than he deserved.</p>
   <p>It is time someone in authority put an end to this nuisance. It has been with us much too long, and now, when so much effort is being made to bring our economic life back to normalcy, it would be in order for the powers that be once again to remember the consumers and see that they get what is <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1254.jpg" n="4"/>due them. Why should the consumers pay the old high rates for gas, electricity, streetcar and elevated transportation, when all other prices have become so much lower in recent years and their [the consumers'] incomes have been reduced in the same proportion?</p>
   <p>Of course, the utilities contend that they can introduce no cheaper rates because, if they did so, they could not pay the interest on the principal invested by them. Are the consumers to blame for that? Is it not rather the result of overcapitalization of the companies? Most utility companies founded their businesses too much upon borrowed money. As long as the earnings were good they could carry the interest charges, some times well, some times not at all. When times became bad, the surplus of the earnings over the financial obligations became increasingly smaller. Now, this condition has, in numerous instances, led to the financial collapse of many companies. It is regrettable but, as was already said, it is the result of an unsound financial policy, and therefore it is hard to understand why <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1255.jpg" n="5"/>the consumers should pay the high rates while nothing is heard of a drastic reduction of the large salaries which the companies pay to their high officials.</p>
   <p>The state legislature, the trade commission, and the federal authorities should work together to take from the defenseless consumers a load which they should not have to carry.</p>
   <p>What has been said of the utility companies is true also of the railroads, at least as far as the traffic in the suburbs is concerned. They reduced the fares for longer trips last summer, because the competition of the busses and airplanes compelled them to do so, but the monthly passes for the suburbs have not been made cheaper since the last crash. The rates are not even uniform. Quite different prices are charged for the same distances on different roads, and sometimes even of the same company. It probably depends upon whether or not the road has competition along the line in question.</p>
