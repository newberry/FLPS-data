   <p>If somebody takes a very long run in order to jump over a ditch that afterwards turns out to have been just a small furrow it can happen that he appears to himself - just a bit funny. The resolution of the City Council last week regarding the sale of liquor on Sundays has been retracted after only eight days, thanks to the German protests. The debate that led to the annulment showed on the side of the American aldermen great readliness to acknowledge the just German demands. The frankness with which native Americans accused their countrymen of hypocrisy and intolerance was highly refreshing.</p>
   <p>The ordinance regarding liquor licenses (after a fair copy has been made) (minus the Sunday Prohibition) will be voted on again and then will be presented to the Mayor for signature. Mayor Mason was elected in 1869 by the so-called People's Party and it then was regarded as a matter of fact that he had pledged himself to apply the Sunday laws strictly. That he had done this (by recall of licenses from innkeepers who held their places open on Sunday) one cannot assert; however, if he will give his consent to the formal abolition of the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0772.jpg" n="2"/>Sunday law is still doubtful. In any case the Puritanical elements will be busy trying to induce him to use his veto.</p>
   <p>It is conceivable that one of the means used to this end might consist in sending Irish or American louts into German inns and to have them stage brawls there, so one could say afterwards: "Look, whereto Sunday freedom leads." In the face of this possibility all good Germans will regard it as their duty to reassure the reputation for love of order and decency for which the German element justifiably stands.....</p>
   <p>The arrogant idea of making us Germans happy according to their "facon", the pious Americans must abandon; but the Germans, too, must (and will) not ask of them to adopt German manners.</p>
   <p>If so, both parts of the people go quietly and peacefully side by side, then there remains, of course, little room for a third party that was designed to <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0773.jpg" n="3"/>convert the Americans high-handedly to German views. Of course, there still exists the State Sunday Laws, but as the State has no special police to enforce them, and as they never have bothered anybody......it will be hard work to create an effective agitation against them. Especially as a purely German agitation makes no impression whatsoever on the representatives of the country districts - and never will make any. Besides, behind the State Laws there still stands the common law that could not be affected by a simple abolition of the State laws.</p>
   <p>A special party to fight the Sunday laws in the whole State will never be anything but a ridiculous absurdity, - a special party in Chicago would either, if it restricts itself exclusively to the Sunday question, receive hardly one-third of the vote, or if it drew up a large program, like the People's Party in 1869, it would attract just those elements of the American population which are hostile to the German point of view (i. e. in the liquor question. The transl.) To be successful the agitation must be carried on by the Germans inside both parties. Meanwhile, thanks to the attitude the City Council has taken, the Sunday will be celebrated in Chicago, exactly as heretofore.</p>
