   <p>The next Congress will probably have to give some attention to the lowering of the liquor tax for, as things have turned out, the present taxes on beer and spirits, which are collected not only by the Federal Government, but also by individual state and city administrations, have raised the price of spirits so high that the public either must go without or must turn to the bootlegger for a cheaper supply.</p>
   <p>Such an effect of the repeal of Prohibition is not at all to the advantage of those responsible for repeal. Hence pressure is coming from these people, especially, for the modification of the present system of taxation, in order that a deathblow may be dealt to bootlegging, once and for all.</p>
   <p>Secretary Morgenthau, according to reports from Washington, does not want to listen to a reduction of the liquor tax and, at the same time, denies that <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0080.jpg" n="2"/>bootlegging is again rampant. He says that the Government is taking vigorous action against the bootleggers, and is rapidly putting an end to their business.</p>
   <p>We can easily understand Morgenthau's point of view. As the official in charge of Government finances, he is naturally interested in keeping the income as high as possible because he, more than any other citizen, knows that Uncle Sam's expenses will remain extraordinarily high for an indefinite period. But he is making a serious mistake in defending the false principle: "The higher the taxes, the larger the income." This should have been clear to him from the fact that the income from liquor taxes in the first six months of this year was about one hundred million dollars less than the $150,000,000 upon which Government circles had figured, Why this deficit? In the first place, taxes were too high and in the second, it should not be forgotten that liquors can still be smuggled with relative ease, even if Secretary Morgenthau does have a different opinion, As long as bootleggers are able to sell liquor at a definitely lower price than the legitimate dealer who pays his taxes, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0081.jpg" n="3"/>bootlegging is bound to flourish. The bootlegger will not give up his business until he is unable to compete successfully with the regular dealer. He is not running the risk of going to prison simply for the sake of doing business. He wants to make money and he is well aware that, even though his prices are lower, his profit is always larger than that of dealers who do not have his ability to avoid the payment of high taxes.</p>
   <p>Joseph H. Choate, president of the Federal Alcohol Control Commission, has come to the conclusion that more liquor taxes are evaded than are paid to the Government. James M. Doran, former Prohibition Administrator, seems to be of the same opinion, for he, too, is one of those who advocate the reduction of these taxes.</p>
   <p>We may hear some interesting debates when this question is discussed in Congress. Whether anything sensible will result it still to be seen.</p>
