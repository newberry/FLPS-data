  <body>
   <p>The Fourth annual convention of the United Societies for Local Self Government took place yesterday afternoon at the North side Turner Hall. Mr. George L. Pfeiffer the president of the executive committee, opened the meeting at 3 o'clock and read the annual report, which was unanimously accepted with a vote of thanks.</p>
   <p>A review of last year's activities of the organization revealed that 131 new assocations joined the Union. The present strength of the Union consists of 334 German, 167 Bohemian, 84 Polish, 27 Italian and 19 miscellaneous nationalities and associations, altogether consisting of 631 clubs, which are entitled to send 944 delegates. The total membership is 183,000, of which 155,000 have the right to vote. The members have been organized in four district unions; North, Northwest, South and Southwest.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were passed at the third convention, that members can be accepted <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0481.jpg" n="2"/>to the League, who do not belong to any union. For this purpose the Liberty League was formed July 9, 1908, a political non-partisan organization of voters. The League has 45,000 members, who have been organized in their resepctive wards. The United Society participated in the following elections:</p>
   <p>1. Primary, August 8, for State and County orfices.</p>
   <p>2. States and Legislation offices, and Municipal Judges.</p>
   <p>3. Regular election for these offices, November 8.</p>
   <p>4. Election of Council members, April 6, 1909.</p>
   <p>The League fought the re-election of Mr. Healy as States Attorney. a promoter <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0482.jpg" n="3"/>of the Prohibition, and supported his opponent, Mr. Wutzman, a Republican, with success. In the fall election 49 candidates of 57 endorsed by the League, were elected. The result of the last elections and the activity of the League, is, that in the City Council we have 47 members of 69, which have endorsed our principles.</p>
   <p>For the coming election of judges, an executive committee has been instructed to investigate the abilities and trustworthiness of the various candidates. The position of the English press towards the League has improved considerably lately on account of the political success of same. Mr. A. C. Cermack declared that he values his membership in Congress, and in the City Council, but that he is very proud to be the Secretary of the League. He made a full report of his political activity about individual liberty in the legislation.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the convention it was resolved to hold the next convention <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0483.jpg" n="4"/>on the Southwest side, as the previous conventions have all been held on the North side.</p>
