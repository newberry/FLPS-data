   <p>In its last session the City Council has decided by 20 votes against 13 that all saloons shall be closed on Sunday from midnight to midnight. A single German was among the 20, and he was a Democrat.</p>
   <p>This is not a new Sunday law, but the reinforcement of the old ones. These have had no practical validity here for years. It would be hard to name a second city in the U. S. where life on Sundays was so quiet and decent as in Chicago. Heaven knows what evil demon has taken possession of the 20 Aldermen that they suddenly want to disturb a state of things satisfactory to all.. If the gentlemen want a fight, they shall have it!</p>
   <p>The German citizens of Chicago are conscious of having respected the good rights of their American fellow citizens, but they are never going to concede that it is one of these good tights to treat the German citizens as an inferior genius of human beings whose morals and opinions must be put in order by the police.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0782.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To anybody who declares that the old Jewish Sunday celebration is the law of the country, we will answer that the U. S. Has neither a state church nor a State religion...If this leads to disagreeable conflicts and to confusion of the existing party system, in which the originators of this crusade against the "infidels" lose their breath, they may put the blame on nobody but themselves. If they try to curry favor with the Germans next fall, attesting wholly their friendship with Germany they will be received with scornful laughter.</p>
