   <p>Although it cannot be denied that the vigorous efforts of the President and his Administration to further the economic reconstruction of the country have been successful to a certain extent, there is still much to be done before we can speak of the American economy as healthy. It appears to many as if the economic measures and reforms which emanate from Washington are the direct cause of the slow pace at which the general economic situation improves. Their opinion does not lack justification, for it is an open secret that private capital has not yet been persuaded into new investments in industry and trade.</p>
   <p>Attempts are now being made, by artificial measures like the reduction of the rate of interest on bank deposits, to induce private capital into active participation in the economy. The result will scarcely come up to expectations. As long as the dollar is not stabilized, private capital will scarcely be <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1203.jpg" n="2"/>available to larger amounts for investment in business enterprise, because a general uncertainty exists about the economic future, as also about the future financial condition of the country. As long as the Government conjures up billions for its economic measures there is danger of inflation, for, in the last analysis, all the measures adopted seem to the economist mere experiments whose success is hoped, but not prophesied with absolute certainty. A further circumstance is the harsh interference of the Government in business, and the possibility that business which had hitherto been reserved to private enterprise would be taken over by the Government itself. All this causes the capitalists to feel depressed and uncertain and cripples their initiative. The Government is also toying with the idea of a far-reaching regulation of many sorts of business undertakings, and this furthers neither the establishment of new businesses nor the reorganization of the old ones.</p>
   <p>Capital is going to wait until after the enactment of all the economic laws that have been planned, and until the dollar is stabilized. This caution and holding back should not surprise anyone. A radical change in their <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1204.jpg" n="3"/>attitude is not to be expected until after the adjournment of the first session of the new Congress, when the future course of the Government can clearly be seen. This is the reason for the slowness with which business revives. It would be wrong, however, to conclude from this that Roosevelt's efforts to improve business conditions are a failure. Their effect will not fail to appear as soon as the grape juice clears up and becomes a pure wine. It is already certain that the initiative of Roosevelt and his advisers is bound to give a powerful stimulus to the American economy, and some effects of this can already be seen. A definite upswing in business has been noticeable for months. Business conditions will gradually improve as the outlines of the future economic structure emerge from the darkness which still prevails.</p>
