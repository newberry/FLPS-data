   <p>Next to alcohol, it is tobacco which arouses the ire of most reformers. In all but a few states and cities there are laws and ordinances which in some way or another forbid or at least restrict the use of the odoriferous weed. Here in Chicago there is, for instance, an ordinance forbidding the sale of cigarettes by stores doing business close to schools. But our precious children then simply repair to the next street corner to buy their Camels. It seems that their enjoyment is thereby not materially impaired.</p>
   <p>The Christian Temperance women, at all their state and national conventions, have for years been adopting fiery resolutions against tobacco. They have unconditionally condemned its use in any form. There is also a national Anti-Nicotine League, patterned after the Anti=Saloon League, which is <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0225.jpg" n="2"/>striving to bring about national prohibition of tobacco, just as the Anti-Saloon League is energetically but futilely attempting to put over a national Alkoholverbot. [Since Prohibition was in effect at this time (1925), the Abendpost editor is probably referring to the attempts to make the prohibition of alcohol absolute, forbidding its use even for sacramental or medicinal purposes.]</p>
   <p>It is no secret that these reform movements find most of their adherents in certain church circles. From these circles is recruited the great, wellorganized, and over-ready army which supports these reform measures at the ballot box. In these circles, the hat is being constantly passed around in order to fill the war-coffers for the [reform] campaigns. Nevertheless, they have not yet succeeded in doing any appreciable harm to the tobacco industry. On the contrary, the latter thrives and prospers, and the leading men of the industry are becoming enormously wealthy.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0226.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>One of these tobacco magnates was James B. Duke, president of the American Tobacco Company, who died recently. A few years ago, Mr. Duke created an endowment fund of forty million dollars, of which the lion's share went to Trinity University in Durham, North Carolina. In his will, Duke stipulated that an additional seventeen millions should be turned over to this university, with the one proviso that the name of the institution should be changed to Duke University.</p>
   <p>The trustees of the institution complied with this stipulation. It is a university which expressly emphasizes its religious character. This is also evident from the very name "Trinity University". But the millions of the tobacco king are dearer to its heart than the Holy Trinity; hence the latter has been thrown overboard, and the school will henceforth bear the name of the man who owed his wealth to the manufacture of tobacco, the highly reviled weed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0227.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This incident is very characteristic of the innate mendacity and lack of character of the reform element. If these persons had wanted to be honest and consistent, they should have disdainfully refused to accept the money. But they would not think of such a thing. They just simply pocketed the money and glorified the memory of the tobacco magnate by naming their institutions of learning after him.</p>
