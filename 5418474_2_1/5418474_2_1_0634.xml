<title level="a">THE TAVERNKEEPERS' SOCIETY</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>The Tavernkeepers' Society held a meeting yesterday at Miehle's Hall. Mr. Feldkamp, president of the Society, acted as chairman....The secretary of the Society read the president's public appeal on the subject of the temperance devotees' intensive propaganda. This appeal, which is directed to all innkeepers, has also appeared in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>"It is sad, but true," said the president, "that, in the face of the temperance movement's relentless propaganda, tavernkeepers do not regard this agitation as serious, but have ignored these activities so far. The dangerous effects of this campaign are far greater than they are generally believed to be, and immediate action to curb the progress of this pernicious agitation is an all-important issue at this time. The tavernkeepers' indifference is further emphasized by their apathetic response to the call of this meeting."</p>
   <p>Mr. [Harry] Rubens, the next speaker said that he had never seen as much effort and energy wasted in any movement as in the agitation of these temperance fanatics. He also explained the strategy of their campaign plan, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0635.jpg" n="2"/>and told of the subscription lists which were sent to the farthest corners of the state.</p>
   <p>"Moreover," he said, "of great importance is the fact that the temperance advocates will appear before the state legislature with a document which has been signed by a multitude of persons whom they have won over to their cause. Also, Chicago's innkeepers have to face still another battle, namely, the battle against the Women's Temperance Union. This organization is determined that only persons who would pledge themselves to become tools in the service of their temperance bosses are to be elected as members of the city administration. And this will undoubtedly happen if the innkeepers repeat their policy of the last election."</p>
   <p>"The temperance fanatics," said Mr. Rubens, "endeavor to gain ground on the pretext that every crime and every accident can be laid to overindulgence in liquor. Furthermore, in small towns, association with the temperance organization is looked upon as a badge of distinction. However, the growth of this opinion is largely due to the apathy displayed by the tavernkeepers <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0636.jpg" n="3"/>themselves. To end this intolerance the innkeepers must unite and work together!"</p>
   <p>The committee for justice submitted a plan to collect signatures of those in favor of tavern owners and to submit this petition to the legislative body. A lengthy debate followed, which resulted in the acceptance of the recommendation. Then a committee of five was appointed to prepare the petition with the assistance of Attorney Rubens.</p>
