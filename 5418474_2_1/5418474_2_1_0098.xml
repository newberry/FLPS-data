   <p>After the last vote on the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment there can no longer be any doubt that prohibition will be done way with in a few months. So far thirty-one states have voted, and these thirty-one states have all voted for repeal. Only five more states are necessary for the ratification of the Repeal Amendment and, as far as a human being can predict, it does not seen likely that one of these states will interrupt the "wet" parade, That does not mean, however, that the fight against prohibition is over, for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment is really only the negative side of question. It also has a positive side, and this consists in the enactment of reasonable and enforceable laws to regulate the liquor traffic.</p>
   <p>Hitherto it has been generally supposed that after the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment the regulation of drinking would be handed over to the states again.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0099.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The leaders of the "drys" are clearly of a different opinion, however. They know that they will not be able to prevent the ratification of the repeal, but they are already making preparations to sabotage its effects. For this reason they want the taxing of spirituous liquors to be in the hands of the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>The "dry" lobby in Washington has already prepared an amendment to the tax bill in accordance with which casks or bottles which contain distilled liquors and which bear Federal revenue stamps, cannot be opened in the place in which they are sold. This bill means simply that the public cannot buy and use distilled liquors by the glass. The "dry" leaders declare that by this law they wish to prevent the return of the much reviled saloon.</p>
   <p>It is quite clear that this bill conflicts sharply with the [Repeal] Amendment. The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment means simply that the Federal Government renounces all control over the liquor traffic. It reserves, as before, <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0100.jpg" n="3"/>the right to tax these liquors, but taxation has not the slightest connection with the regulation of commerce and consumption. Taxation and regulation are two completely different functions, and to introduce regulation indirectly by the use of taxation is nothing but an unethical trick. So much for the constitutional and legal side of this question.</p>
   <p>It also has, however, a practical and social side. First of all, there is the fight against the saloon. Here generalizations are completely out of place. It may be a model place or a wretched hole. It is the duty of the authorities properly to regulate these places, but they by no means have the duty or the right to dictate to the tavern owners what drinks they are to serve their guests, or how their patrons are to take these drinks. The leaders of the "drys" will probably also make out that by their plan they are working against the misuse of alcohol. The argument is of extremely dubious merit, for moderation surely will not be served if the public is prevented from buying and enjoying liquor <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0101.jpg" n="4"/>by the glass, but is forced to buy this liquor in whole bottles or even casks.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless it is by no means certain that the "drys" will fail in this attempt, for a few days ago the former czar of Prohibition, speaking at the annual convention of the druggists in Chicago, assured then that they would sell distilled liquors and wines in the future for medicinal purposes and also as beverages. There is no objection to that, but there is also no reason for forbidding tavern keepers from retailing distilled liquor.</p>
