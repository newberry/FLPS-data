   <p>The Chicago Surface Lines have been in receivership for many years. The situation seems destined to become perpetual. For some years the lines have been operated without any permit whatever. The old permit expired long ago, and is renewed only at brief intervals for short periods--quite a remarkable situation for the transportation system of a city with millions of inhabitants.</p>
   <p>For decades the people of this city have been promised modern subways. One mayor, who is no more, once promised his loyal voters that the "rubbish" to be dug up by the first spade would fly in the autumn of that year. This was long ago. The children who at that time went to school have since then become fathers and mothers. Later on the good citizens were promised a <pb facs="5418474_2_1_1193.jpg" n="2"/>consolidation of the street car with the elevated. There is no mention of this plan any more. Recently we were made to anticipate a universal transfer service for the near future. But that is no longer talked about and the dear public curses, of course, about the miserable transportation conditions of the city, but they never yet protested emphatic enough for the city administration to do something toward improving the bad traffic conditions. All they could make them do was install some so-called feeder buses(by the street car lines), and that was against the greatest possible resistance on the part of the latter.</p>
   <p>With much more joy is the news now received that the street car lines now intend to order a hundred new cars, which will not only make less noise than the ones now in use, but will even otherwise be the latest in the field of car construction. [Editor's note: These are the (Madison Street) P.C.C. cars] It is to be hoped that the city council, the traffic commission and the receiver will say something against it, lest this modest outlook for better times for street car riders become a mirage, as most of the other courageous plans were.</p>
