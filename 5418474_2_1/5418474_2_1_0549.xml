   <p>p. 4.. Our Chicago Superior Judge Philipp Stein follows the Mosaic precept for judges: Thou shalt judge thy neighbor fairly. He does not consider the social standing of a person. Whosoever acts against his just decision, is dealt with severely, regardless of the culprit's eminence and influence.</p>
   <p>The verdict of this German-American judge is of special significance. -Philipp Stein is probably the first American judge to meet out punishment for the disregard of free and open Sunday ordinances; rather unusual, as We are accustomed to the countless fines which have been levied to uphold the blue laws.</p>
   <p>It is just this contrast which is so significant in Stein's decision. It is the first decisive support of Sunday freedom given by one of the higher American courts. Superior Judge Stein is correct, even from a technical standpoint. He applied the proper legal measures to prohibit the closing of the Exposition on Sundays.</p>
   <p>The directors, however, disregarded the judicial decision and closed the <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0550.jpg" n="2"/>grounds on Sunday, July 23, which is a grave disregard of the judiciary. Humor is to be found in the circumstance that among the condemned, is a man who for years was a staunch advocate of prohibition and who used word and pen to further its ends and shape its destiny. We refer to the World Exposition Director, Mr. Lawson, publisher of the Sunday prohibition paper, the Chicago Record.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the eventual outcome, Judge Stein's sentence will always remain as the symbol of a splendid legal victory for the liberals. And the fact that this opinion was expressed by a judge whose ancestry is Jewish, makes it doubly valuable because, after all, the old Jewish Sabath is not recognized in this land.</p>
