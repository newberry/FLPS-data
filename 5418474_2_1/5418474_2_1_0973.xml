     <title level="a">AN APPEAL TO THE GERMAN - AMERICANS</title>
    </bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Many times an appeal has been made by the German-American National Alliance to the Germans in this country. We do not underestimate the value of these efforts by the Alliance, although we think it unwise to spend all of their energies against prohibition alone. Prohibition is only a side-issue of that uncontrolable flood which threatens to engulf our country and to spread devastation over everything which has made the United States great, and living here most desirable. These reasons, being personal and general as they are, ought to compel every German, not to exhaust his energies any longer with the beer question. The personal reason is that the Germans, the torch bearer of culture, can not afford to be solely responsible, if others judge them according to a national peculiarity, the drinking of beer. Other nations do not despise beer, and yet one can hear everywhere that only the Germans cleave to it, and that he is interested in public affairs only, when his idol is endangered. These conditions can not continue; we must make an end to them!</p>
   <p>If we desire to regain and hold the respect, which we have inherited but lost, we must consider the drink-question as secondary, and arouse ourselves to fight <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0974.jpg" n="2"/>the main issue, out of which prohibition originates.</p>
   <p>The general reasons, why we must cease to make the beer question the apparent motivating political power, are to be found in the fact, that we can not expect any support from other nationalities, unless we do so. We must purge ourselves from the reproach that we are interested in public affairs only then, when our customs and habits must be defended. We must evidence concern about the destiny of all, and that we take sides regarding prohibition, because of our belief, that prohibition is unconstitutional, and is an attack upon the rights of all, guaranteed by the constitution.</p>
   <p>Nativism has its far-reaching aims, and must be destroyed, not only its branches, but by uprooting it. It is a danger to the ideals of this country, to our ideals, and to the ideals of all nations, who likewise have a culture of a thousand years duration as their background. We dare not sacrifice those ideals and that culture to those arrogant, anti-cultural interests. We must join, shoulder to shoulder, and form a wall, which will defy all attacks of nativism <pb facs="5418474_2_1_0975.jpg" n="3"/>successfully, and which will defeat the enemy of culture and the haters of strangers.</p>
   <p>The enemies of Germanism use the beer-glass only for the purpose, of making us appear absurd and our merits insignificent. They are aiming at something more vital. They want to push away, where-ever we have been successfully engaged, and force us to play an inferior part.</p>
   <p>Against these nefarious agitations we must fight unitedly. But this can not be done with beer-glasses, but with the torches of culture, which have been ignited by German thinkers and sages to give light to a whole world.</p>
