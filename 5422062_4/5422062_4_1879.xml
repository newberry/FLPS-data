   <p>p. 1.- Since last Friday, representatives from all parts of the country have been thronging our city to attend the Gapa convention. They were graciously received by Chicagoans who entertained them in various ways till Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>The first big day of the convention started on Monday at the Medinah Athletic Club with a huge crowd attending. When the Ambassador of Greece made his entrance everybody stood and Nick Varzos' orchestra played our national anthem.</p>
   <p>Pres. George Gavaris requested Archrev. D. Golemis, D. Gambrilis and N. Kesses to open the convention with a prayer. Following this, Dr. Gavaris welcomed the visitors and explained the purpose of the convention. A telegram from Mr. Hoover, president of the United States, was read, and another from the Metropolitan Corinthias, expressing deep regrets at not <pb facs="5422062_4_1880.jpg" n="2"/>being able to be present at the opening at the convention.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Mr. Saltiel, representing the mayor of the city of Chicago. He was followed by the Governor of this district, A. Kapsopoulos, and Supreme President B. Idannis. Amid much applause, Ambassador Simopoulos also spoke. The American anthem was played and the first day of the convention was over.</p>
