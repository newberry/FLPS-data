   <p>p. 1 Greeks in Chicago are preparing this week and the succeeding week for the celebration of the centennial of the London protocol by which the powers of Europe formally recognized Greek independence. Indeed a considerable number of Chicago citizens of Greek nativity are returning to the mother country to join in the celebration there.</p>
   <p>Evidence of the sympathy felt for Greeks in this country, during their struggle for liberation from Turkish rule is found in American place names. Not only are sixteen towns named Athens, fifteen towns named Sparta, eight towns Attica, six towns Ionia, but hundreds more testify to American respect for Greek culture. Ypsilanti, Michigan bears the name of a heroic leader in the struggle of modern Greece for independence. Strong as was American sympathy for Greece in 1830 and the preceding years when she fought for freedom, Greece and the United States have more in common, at this moment, than they had then or have had at any subsequent time in the past hundred years. Greece, which after 1830 accepted Kings of alien blood, is now a Republic led by a native statesman, Eleutherios Venizelos.</p>
