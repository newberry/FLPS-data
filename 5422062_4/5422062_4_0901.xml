<title level="a">WHAT AMERICAN PHILELLENES THINK OF THE FUTURE OF GREEKS IN AMERICA. WILL THE GREEK ASSIMILATE?</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Professor J. M. Rife</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>To me, as an American philellene, few, if any articles seen in periodicals have ever been as touching as the one in the last issue of the Greek Press entitled "Ta Ellinopoula tou Mellontos" (The young Greeks of the future). It brings up the whole question of assimilation poignantly and in a way to remind me that even I, whose eight great-grandparents were all born in Pennsylvania, have a sometimes acute assimilation problem; for my own social group has never quite accepted the tribe advice that when in Rome we should do as Romans.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0902.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I'm told that Einstein, in his book, Zionism, expresses the opinion that the assimilationist pays too dear a price for the comfort acquired, and yet, tho inclined to agree, I realize there are two sides to the question.</p>
   <p>The Greek, or any other person, who refuses to become a part of American life is more or less handicapped in the struggle for individual success, when success is judged by prevalent standards. Someone has said that if the ancestors of Theodore Roosevelt were to be Dutch in New York, Theodore Roosevelt, who refused to become a part Dutch, would have been a Dutch farmer instead of president.</p>
   <p>I believe there is a great deal of truth in that statement.</p>
   <p>Tho I have six or seven other strains of ancestry, I belong to that social group known as Scotch-Irish Presbyterians.</p>
   <p>There are several separate denominations of these in America, but together <pb facs="5422062_4_0903.jpg" n="3"/>they represent the unassimilated Scotch-Irish.</p>
   <p>For generations they did not intermarry, except with proselytes, of whom my paternal grandfather was one.</p>
   <p>One or two groups still intermarry very rarely, My wife, whose ancestors have been in America as long, or longer than mine, has not a drop of any other blood.</p>
   <p>This type of Presbyterian has a number of unassimilated beliefs and practices grouped about his religion; and his church rolls abound in Macs; but assimilation is looming very close now and many an old father in Israel has gone sorrowing to his grave because of it.</p>
   <p>The Greek problem is much more serious than ours, for it involves change of language, whose glories only brighten the pain; it involves parting with <pb facs="5422062_4_0904.jpg" n="4"/>the lastremnants of the mighty Byzantine world culture; if assimilation is carried to its base completeness it involves parting with Orthodoxy, that golden mean of Christendom; often most tragic of all, is the perilous shift from Mediterranean courtship and marriage customs to those of the Germanic peoples.</p>
   <p>The mixed marriage is of course an increasing problem.</p>
   <p>"Abie's Irish Rose" has it comic situation; but in actual life it is one of the most genuine of tragedies. The Greek kitchen can be given up gradually but it is none the less a sacrifice.</p>
   <p>But assimilation will come in America, not absolute perhaps, for several generations; but it will make great strides with each generation. Even the Hebrew, most unassimilable of culture, is having the fight of its life in the United States. Only immigration can check the tidal wave of <pb facs="5422062_4_0905.jpg" n="5"/>assimilation, and even immigration cannot stop it.</p>
   <p>It is the experience of those strains of us who represent the older immigrations, and there is no reason to believe the Greek will be an exception. What consolation may be offered the Greek-American and the Philellene? First, there is much that is Hellenic in American culture, and second, assimilation need not be absolute.</p>
   <p>According to Lane Cooper, there can be little question that the two most decisive centuries in our stream of civilization were the First Century of our era and the Fifth Century B. C.</p>
   <p>The literature of these centuries is Greek. The greatest literary collection in the world, the New Testament, was written in Greek.</p>
   <p>Hanrack said Christianity remained a Greek movement until the end of the Second Century. "Christianity," "philosophy", and even "idea" are Greek <pb facs="5422062_4_0906.jpg" n="6"/>words. The age of Pericles and the age of Paul are with us to remind us that assimilation cannot be all away from Hellenism, but what of the glories of Byzantium?</p>
   <p>We have some of the symbols of the proud days of Greek Constantinople with us in America in the beautiful Byzantine architecture of such churches as the one at Lowell, Massachusetts; Providence, R. I., St. Constantine's in Chicago; and the beautiful little church of St. Spyridon at Pullman, Illinois and others of which I am not able to speak.</p>
   <p>One Roman Catholic priest in Chicago has built a church after the style of the great church of Holy Wisdon, having studied the structure of the original in Constantinople.</p>
   <p>This Church of St. Basil is sometimes facetiously called the "Irish Synagogue," but it is a beautiful bit of Constantinople near the Stock Yards.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0907.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>I see no reason why the beauties of the Byzantine liturgies may not flourish infinitely in America, yet I suspect the fathers should make haste to celebrate them in English, though I prefer the Greek myself. But the "nea genea" (New generation) is going to forget the language.</p>
