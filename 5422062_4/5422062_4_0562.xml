   <p>p. 2- An urgent appeal has been sent by the Greek community of San Francisco to the Chicago Greek community for funds to rebuild their church, which was destroyed by fire in the San Francisco earthquake.</p>
   <p>We must come at once to the assistance of our fellow-Greeks in San Francisco. Let the Chicago Greeks win the honor of being the first to assist the community of the Pacific coast to rebuild their house of worship. Let us do it whole-heartedly and very generously. Let us avoid delay and factional rivalry.</p>
   <p>In order to make a good clean job of it we suggest that the Chicago Greek consul, the Honorable Dr. Salopoulos, take the lead and invite all the committees to report their activities and bring their collections directly to him. This will prevent confusion, delay, and the everpresent <pb facs="5422062_4_0563.jpg" n="2"/>desire for leadership. The Greek consul because of his position is best fitted to represent the affairs of the two communities in this respect.</p>
