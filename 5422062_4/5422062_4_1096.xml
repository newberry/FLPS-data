   <p>There are many reasons why Greeks should and will support Roosevelt for President. In the first place the Republican administration has done nothing to alleviate the ills to which we of the post-depression period have fallen heir. In fact, if anything, Hoover methods and Hoover policies have accentuated them. Impartial observers are unanimous in their condemnation of the present administration at Washington.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the Democratic party has come before the people with a national ticket which is not only dedicated to the service of the people but is also in a position to render service. Governor Roosevelt has all the qualities required to make a great President, and there is no doubt that upon his inauguration to that exalted office next March the country will enter a period of sane government under able leadership devoted to public service.</p>
