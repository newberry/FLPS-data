   <p>Last Sunday at 2:30 P.M., during a general assembly of the Liberal Society, the newly elected governing council was introduced to the members.</p>
   <p>At about two o'clock the members began to arrive, and by two-thirty Bowen Hall was filled with the members who, by the way, are some of the finest members of the community</p>
   <p>Then Mr. C. Paleologos, president of the Society, Mr. K. Tsolainos of New York, and Paul Demos, arrived at the meeting. Their appearance caused the audience to cheer enthusiastically. They ascended the platform, where there were already gathered the governing council and the former president, Mr. Kontaxopoulos, and vice-president, Mr. Salopoulos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paleologos gave a welcoming speech and then Mr. Tsolainos spoke. He <pb facs="5422062_4_1319.jpg" n="2"/>unfolded and explained the ideals, aims, and programs of the Liberals.</p>
   <p>The very worth-while words of Mr. Tsolainos were eagerly heard by the audience. He stressed the need for financial aid, in order that the Liberator of Greece, Venizelos, could sway the people.</p>
   <p>The profits of the meeting amounted to $484.50.</p>
