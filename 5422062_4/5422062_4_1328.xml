   <p>As is known to a great portion of the Greeks of Chicago, the newly constituted league under the name of Union, has as its aims: Education, political education, and development of solidarity between its members. These aims it will try to achieve by means of a series of lectures, and the development of the feeling of solidarity and fraternity among its members.</p>
   <p>The ones who compose this Union, however, mindful of the doctrines of the Great Men of this Great Country, think that they do not alienate themselves from the purpose of the Union if they show an interest in events elsewhere in the world. As a natural consequence, they think they should watch the struggles of (barbarophagus) Greece. The Union members think that now, when Greece delivers the final blows against the sinister Turk, that Greeks, everywhere, should strengthen by all possible means the National Greek Government, that Government which, by the free will of the Greek people, guides its destinies. Furthermore, members think that, if in the future the Greek people <pb facs="5422062_4_1329.jpg" n="2"/>decide otherwise, the ones outside of Greece who are sincerely interested, should find themselves on her side.</p>
   <p>The Executive Council of the National Union of the Greeks of Chicago invites all members, and those desiring to become members, to attend a general meeting, Sunday, Oct. 9, 1921, 4 P.M. at Bowen Hall, Hull House.</p>
   <p>In having to promote discussion at this meeting relating to the growth of our Union to an extent worthy of our Community, the presence of all interested is most necessary.</p>
   <p>National Union of the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
