   <p>Last Monday night the much heralded dinner and dance of the Greek Ladies society St. Helen took place at the Morrison Hotel and many prominent fellow-Greeks participated.</p>
   <p>The affair, which was given, exclusively, for the benefit of the fifty-four Orphanages in Greece, at which 35,000 orphans of the Asia Minor disaster are sheltered, was a grand success.</p>
   <p>The dinner was honored by the presence of Hon. G. Depastas, consul-general of Greece, and The Right Rev. Philaretos, bishop of the Greek church in Chicago. Both personages addressed the participants who were crowding the three great halls of the Hotel.</p>
   <p>Bishop Philaretos opened the dinner with a prayer which was followed by the playing of the hymns of the two countries. Mr. Depastas read a telegram from the Greek Ambassador who was incapacitated by a sudden illness and unable to attend the affair, as it was promised.</p>
   <p>Over 3,000 participated. The price for the event was $3.00. The success of it was anticipated.</p>
