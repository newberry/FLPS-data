   <p>On Sunday, March 25, 1934, at the Grand Ball Room of the Sherman Hotel, one of the most beautiful rooms in the city of Chicago, at three o'clock in the afternoon, more than 3,000 people gathered to celebrate the Day of Greek Independence. The celebration was under the auspices of the Order of Ahepa, the Order of Gapa and the Right Reverend George Kallistos, who represented all of the Greek Churches of our city. Right Reverend Kallistos acted as Master of Ceremonies and performed his duties excellently.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Dritsas, the acting consul general in our city, delivered the key-note speech of the day and was enthusiastically received. Demosthenes Chiagouris spoke on behalf of the Churches. Dr. Constantine Theodore spoke on behalf of the Order of Gapa and D. Parry on behalf of the Order of Ahepa. The musical program was under the direction of George Gretsis and the Women's Auxiliary of the Order of Gapa arranged a number of Greek dances that were danced by members of that organization.</p>

   <p>The details of arranging and carrying out the execution of the details fell on the shoulders of Spiro Kotakis who acted as secretary of the committee, Peter Bougas, the treasurer and Right Reverend Callistos, who was the chairman. Tom Paganis, together with the assistance and cooperation of the various Women's Auxiliaries of the Order of Gapa, assisted in seating the people and was primarily responsible for the excellent conduct of the people who attended. Order and enthusiasm prevailed. The consenus of opinion was that this was the most solemn celebration that was ever held in the city of Chicago.</p>
