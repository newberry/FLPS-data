   <p>p. 2.- After spending a week at the Boston Convention, the Ahepans returned to their work, refreshed, enthusiastic and happy. At this convention, the strength of the organization was manifested. Other conventions merely served as meeting places for friends to see one another. This years convention, in the heart of American Hellenism, held a much greater significance.</p>
   <p>No other Greek organization has shown such progress by the Ahepa. In eight short years it has risen to 30,000 membership. With such purposes and aims as they possess, they will continue to flourish and grow stronger as the years go by.</p>
   <p>As all organizations, Ahepa has had many difficulties and serious problems but we are confident she will weather storms as she has done in the past. Ahepa is very necessary! It has done much and is in a position to do more towards preserving Hellenism in America and giving our children a Greek education.</p>
