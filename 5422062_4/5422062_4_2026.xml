   <p>Hundreds of mourners filled the church of "Evangellismos" last Thursday to witness the last military rites for the late Greek Consul the Hon. Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos, who died March 1, following an appendectomy operation.</p>
   <p>The pall-bearers included one member of each of the organizations of the Ahepa and Gapa, a member of the American Legion and a member of the Greek Men's Professional club.</p>
   <p>The speakers at the funeral were the Greek Ambassador, Harry Simopoulos and Bishop Kallistos, who also officiated. He was assisted by all the Greek Priests of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The remains will be shipped to Greece according to Greek Law, which states that the body of any Greek official, such as Consul or Ambassador, who dies in the performance of his duty is to be shipped to Greece at the Greek government's expense.</p>
