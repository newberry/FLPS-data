   <p>Rev. Constas H. Demetry, pastor of Toledo's Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, has been in this city only three years, but in that short time has made a host of friends and is held in high regard by the Greek people in this city.</p>
   <p>Father Demetry was born in 1873, on the island of Samos, the home of Pythagoras, where he received his early education. He continued his studies at the Theological Seminary and College of Halki, near Constantinople, and was graduated in 1898. He was ordained the following year.</p>
   <p>For the next six years, Father Demetry taught and preached in Constantinople schools and churches and in 1905 came to Atlanta, Ga., as rector and organizer of the Greek Orthodox Community there.</p>

   <p>Four years later he went to Lowell, Mass., then to Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and finally to Toledo in 1935.</p>
   <p>Father Demetry was the editor in Chicago of "The Religious Echo" and the author of several religious works.</p>
   <p>He received the title of Doctor of the Ecoumenical Throne and has been decorated with the Great Golden Cross of the Savior by the Greek government.</p>
