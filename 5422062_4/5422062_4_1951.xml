  <body>
   <p>Rev. Marcos E. Petrakis was born, July 26, 1885, on the Island of Crete, the scion of a priestly family.</p>
   <p>He received his preliminary education in his own town and in 1902 was graduated from the Sacerdotal School at the age of twenty. After graduation, he taught public school for about a year and a half.</p>
   <p>He was ordained deacon in 1908 and got married the same year. On March 7, 1908, he organized the first night school, which until today functions splendidly. In 1910 he was elevated to the priesthood, and was appointed controller of all the Church properties of the county. That position he held until he emigrated to America. He performed his religious duties as priest in Utah; Savannah Georgia; St. Louis and Chicago. He has been in Chicago since 1923.</p>
