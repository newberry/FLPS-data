   <p>P. 2 - C. McCloud made a mistake in choosing a Greek apartment to rob. Three Greeks, Papadopoulos, Papagiannopoulos, and Bouleukos, were aroused from slumber yesterday by a would-be robber who was breaking into their apartment at 175 W. Van Buren Street.</p>
   <p>The three wily Greeks, who did not want to be robbed by C. McCloud, as they afterwards learned that he was named, waited in the darkness until the unwelcome guest succeeded in breaking the window. They then fell upon him, took his gun away, and tied him to their bed. When the authorities arrived, Mr. McCloud was glad to accompany them to the station, and he took an oath that he would never again practice his profession among Greeks. He said, "Those blasted Greeks are sneaky. They were waiting like cats in the dark and fell upon me unawares."</p>
