   <p>President Wilson and the leaders of the Allies were petitioned to support Greece at the peace conference in her plea for the return from Turkey of territory taken in prior wars in a resolution adopted yesterday by a mass-meeting of Chicago Greeks in the Garrick Theater.</p>
   <p>Greece was declared to have indisputable right to Thrace, Greek Macedonia, Asia Minor, the Aegean Islands, and North Epirus in speeches made by former Governor Dunne, chairman of the meeting, by Peter S. Lambros, publisher, and by N. G. Kyriakides of Athens, sent to the United States to arouse sentiment in favor of the demands of Greece.</p>
   <p>Plea for Unredeemed Greeks</p>
   <p>"The unredeemed Greeks living in territory formerly Greek but now under Ottoman <pb facs="5422062_4_1126.jpg" n="2"/>rule should be restored to their mother-country for many reasons," said Mr. Kyriakides. "First, they are racially, politically, and socially Greek. Second, 60,000 of them aided the cause of the Allies in the Greek army, and 50,000 of them served in France.</p>
   <p>"Third, over 700,000 of them have been massacred and starved by the Turks during the war. Fourth, Greece deserves this because of her support of the cause of the Allies."</p>
   <p>Audience Shouts Approval</p>
   <p>The audience, which filled every seat in the theater, rose and shouted its approval of the resolution proposed after Mr. Kyriakides' address. The resolution follows:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that no Turkish Government be allowed to rule the subject races, including the Greeks, in the Ottoman Empire; that our native countries, Thrace, Greek Macedonia, Asia Minor, the Aegean Islands, and North Epirus, regions <pb facs="5422062_4_1127.jpg" n="3"/>historically Greek, be united with the mother-country; that restoration and rehabilitation be provided for Greeks deported and despoiled by Turks and Bulgarians; and that President Wilson and the heads of the Allied Governments be requested to support in the coming peace conference our sacred national rights."</p>
