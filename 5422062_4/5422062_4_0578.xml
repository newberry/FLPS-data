   <p>This is the name which a hotel on Halsted Street should have. A Greek, Bill Laskaris, was found dead in this hotel one morning from a bullet which was fired through his mouth.</p>
   <p>This is not the first or even the fifth victim of this cursed hotel. Up to the present time, more than ten Greeks have been found dead or murdered in this very same hotel. In one case, six Greeks were found dead, the victims of gas. Is this perchance a coincidence or is it the work of a mysterious murderous hand?</p>
   <p>Both probabilities must be examined by the entire Greek community, and if it is found that these deaths are merely a matter of coincidence, let there be a sign in the entrance announcing "The Death Hotel," so that no more of our fellow countrymen will fall in that death trap.</p>
   <p>The people who are living in the Greek quarter should certainly have some <pb facs="5422062_4_0579.jpg" n="2"/>protection. Why haven't the police investigated these deaths thoroughly and closed this haunted hotel?</p>
