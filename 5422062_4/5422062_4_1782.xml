   <p>Next Sunday begins the convention of the great Greek organization Ahepa. This is not the first time that the organization chose Chicago for its convention, for we all can remember its convention in the Drexel Hotel of Chicago, that was held twelve years ago. Its decisions at that time placed Ahepa on a new basis and marked its national career. For, up to that time its purposes had not been defined and had been in a dubious position between Hellenism and Americanism.</p>
   <p>The "hundred per cent American" was then the topic of the day and the trend towards Americanization was, as yet, strong among its members. But during that convention the scale turned towards the natural direction and the Greek sentiment predominated in the decisions taken by its members.</p>
   <p>Ever since, we can say that Ahepa became a real Greek organization and there can be not the least bit of a doubt regarding its pure Greek sentiments. With the facts, regarding the organization of Ahepa, we shall deal again in our next issue. Now we limit ourselves to extending our greetings to the representatives <pb facs="5422062_4_1783.jpg" n="2"/>in the convention....wishing that they again take such decisions that will lead to the further progress of Ahepa and Hellenism, as a whole, in America.</p>
