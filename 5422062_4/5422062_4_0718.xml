   <p>P. 2- A lion by reason of age and misfortune may lose his strength, force, vigor, and vitality, but he is still a lion, the king of the animal world, and he is still distinguished for his kingly qualities and his fallen greatness. So fair Greece! Sad relic of departed worth! Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great; and nothing can cover her high fame but heaven.</p>
   <p>So mused a Greek, Phocion Makris, beside Giuseppe Orano, his Italian friend, over the bar of a West Side saloon. Beer after beer was quaffed by the two bosom friends, and at last the Italian, angered by the eulogistic utterances of the Greek, told him that Greece might have been great, though he knew nothing about it, but that life in Italy because of the sound political system which prevails in that country is much better and freer than life in Greece. A political discussion followed, accompanied by more beer.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0719.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Orano was not in a mood to be outtalked by the smooth-speaking Greek, and he gave vent to his feelings in a tirade in Italian against Greece and his Greek friend. The Greek speaks Italian fluently although he had never, for reasons of his own, conversed in Italian with his friend. Stunned by Orano's gross expression and assisted by the alcohol in his brain, Makris slapped the Italian's face, who in the twinkling of an eye pulled out a razor and attacked the Greek. The latter, according to testimony in court, mumbled something in Greek or Italian, drew his gun, and mortally wounded his attacker. The saloonkeeper and Makris are held to await the result of the wound inflicted on Orano, who, doctors say, will die.</p>
