   <p>p. 1- Today Hellenism celebrates the one hundred and sixth anniversary of Greece's declaration of independence, and that day, the day on which independence was declared, will always remain great and glorious in the memory of the Greek nation. It is the duty of the Greeks in America to celebrate this great event in a style befitting its importance, to recall to their memories the great figures of those heroes who fought for our freedom, and to bless their names for the great sacrifices which they made. Other nations, to be sure, have struggled to gain their national independence, but the struggles of the Greek people, in their intensity and in their long duration, have no parallel in history; they serve as the most signal example of a race's fight for liberty.</p>
   <p>The study of the glorious story of the Greek revolution of 1821 and of the heroic achievements of that great generation of Greeks has elicited and continues to elicit the admiration of the civilized world. As for us, <pb facs="5422062_4_1601.jpg" n="2"/>we feel proud to have as forefathers those who earned new tokens of respect and new titles of honor among all the peoples of the earth to add to those won long ago by our ancient classic predecessors.</p>
   <p>None but the scions of ancient Greece could have achieved what the fighters of 1821 achieved; only the confidence inherited from their illustrious classic ancestors enabled these immortal heroes to sever the iron chains in which a tyrant had held the Greek nation bound for five hundred years. In view of all this, every Greek today should hold spiritual communion with those great men, recalling their fierce and prolonged struggle and their awful sacrifices, and should cry: "Eternal shall their memory be!"</p>
