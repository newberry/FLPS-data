   <p>Representatives of twenty different philanthropic organizations from fourteen nations of America, Australia, and other regions, being interested in the fate of the victims of the Near-East war, assembled in Geneva, Switzerland, last September to confer on the support, the education, and the future of thousands of orphans in Greece and other parts of the Near-East.</p>
   <p>The result of these deliberations was the organization of the International Near-East Association, of which the purpose is to cultivate an interest for the orphans of the Near-East.</p>
   <p>One of the projects of this Association is to dedicate Sunday, December 2, 1923, as an International Sunday of the Golden Rule, which enjoins mutual love and help. The things that we should like others to do for us, we should do for others.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0383.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This Golden Rule, or High Rule of Life, can be applied to the support of the orphans as follows. We all know that these orphans are innocent victims of war without having had anything to do with it; they find themselves out on the streets, unsheltered, naked, and facing starvation. If we were the parents or the guardians of these children, should we not expect our countrymen and people of the same religion to assist them? Should we not hope to find philanthropic and merciful people to help, protect, and treat well these helpless children?</p>
   <p>We advise all to make a small sacrifice on Sunday, December 2, 1923. Instead of our regular Sunday dinner, let us all eat something simpler, offering what we save for the nourishment and the support of the above-mentioned orphans. If we ate a meal once a year like that which the orphans regularly eat, we should still have a thousand and ninety-four meals at which to eat whatever we liked, while the destitute orphans have the same meals every day for three hundred and sixty-five days and that much can be secured for them if there are still some merciful people who are willing to help.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0384.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Sunday of the Golden Rule will be celebrated in many parts of Europe, Australia, and America. Through a special letter President Coolidge approved of this movement and urges all his countrymen to exercise a spirit of sacrifice and self-denial on December 2, 1923, for the sake of these orphans.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Lloyd George, Charles E. Hughes, F. Nansen, and many other eminent personalities have promised to save that Sunday for the Golden Rule.</p>
   <p>We believe that we shall not find a single Greek unwilling upon this occasion to sacrifice one meal for the sake of thousands of Greek orphans.</p>
