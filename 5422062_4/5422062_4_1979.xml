<title level="a">CHURCH DISUNION IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>p.1- The revolutionary movement of Mr. Kontogeorge against the administration of Archbishop Athenagoras has at last reached the Greek community of Chicago. Since Mr. Kontogeorge's activities are now so far extended that one of his churches has been established here, it is about time for us to stop thinking that they will be suppressed merely by our silence and indifference; and we must take steps to check this movement, the aim of which is to disrupt Archbishop Athenagoras's Church.</p>
   <p>The policy of Kontogeorge does not by any means promote the unity of our Church, and we should be of great service to this institution if we were to combat the evil of disunion at its inception and at the same time set to work to discover the causes which prompted this new division of the Greek Church.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1980.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During this despotic regime by which our Church is now oppressed we have sounded the warning of the danger which has been apparent, and in a series of articles we have proved that the division of the Church is caused by Mr. Athenagoras.</p>
   <p>We again take the opportunity of repeating to the public that the continued stay of Mr. Athenagoras in America will strengthen and extend the revolutionary movement of Kontogeorge to such proportions that it will soon be too late to suppress it.</p>
