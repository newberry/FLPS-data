   <p>Aside from the Clerical Association, which seems to co-operate only so that disagreement among its members will not arise and cause its downfall, we can-not find any community group in which there is a spirit of harmony or co-operation. One church is entirely separated from another; and the only time one enters the boundaries of a church not his own, is when it involves the selling of dance tickets. The decentralized system is flowering in all its glory, and is in the full bloom of its development. As to the results? It is enough to say that our churches are kept open only through all kinds of sleight-of-hand tricks.</p>
   <p>How can we help but worry about our future in America? Worth-while Greek schools are non-existent. Orphan asylums, homes for the aged, and hospitals are also unrealized dreams of the Chicago Greek community. Just because we barely manage to keep our nine churches open, we are satisfied with our <pb facs="5422062_4_2022.jpg" n="2"/>accomplishments. Either the community leaders are overlooking these facts or they are deliberately and destructively blinding themselves to them.</p>
