  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, at the tomb of Abraham Lincoln, the Greek flag was delivered to the Governor of Illinois with great ceremony.</p>
   <p>The delivery of the flag was presented by A. A. Pantelis,attorney former Commander of the Greek chapter of the American Legion, in an eloquent speech he exalted the significance of the event, as enhancing the amicable relations existing between United States and Greece. Mr. Pantelis, who was chosen as representative of the Greek Government, also acted as Master of Ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Governor Emerson, on receiving the Greek flag, expressed his delight at the honor given him as an individual and as Governor of this sovereign state, and said, "Humanity should render a sacred obligation to the civilization of Greece, which first established the democratic form of government and under whose influence science, and the fine arts, have flourished to such a degree that we, today, receive knowledge from that civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1510.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This flag, remaining in the capital of the State, will symbolize the friendliness of the two democratic nations. The Governor in finishing his speech, thanked the Legionnaires and the thousands of Greeks who flocked from various cities to Springfield for the presentation.</p>
   <p>The program began at 2 P.M. immediately after the arrival of Archbishop Athenagoras and three hundred Greeks who came by special train from Chicago. The prelate was received at the station by thousands of Greeks and Americans who gathered there for the purpose. The throngs then went to the Episcopalian Church where the Greek prelate officiated in a holy liturgy, accompanied by Byzantine music, to the fascination of all present the Americans not excluded.</p>
   <p>At 4 P. M. the crowd waited at the tomb of Abraham Lincoln, for the arrival of Governor Emerson, who arrived heading a great motor parade. The Governor took his place on the platform where many Greek and American personages were present, as well as the famous Greek choir of the Church Evangelismos, in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1511.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The American Anthem was played by the many-pieced orchestra accompanied by the choir. A prayer was offered by Dr. John T. Thomas, rector of the First Presbyterian church of Springfield, and the ceremony of the flag had begun.</p>
   <p>As the delivery of the flag began the Greek anthem was played accompanied by the choir.</p>
   <p>The youthful President of the chapter, "Greek-Center", Basil Mavromatis, in the name of the "Sons of Pericles" laid a wreath on the tomb of Abraham Lincoln. The youthful pupils of the Moline, Greek school played an important part in the program.</p>
   <p>The ten year old girl pupil, Theofane Papaioannou, of the school, offered a beautiful bouquet to the Governor, addressing him first in Greek, then im English. The head of the State in accepting the flowers, eloquently eulogized the Greek-American girl.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1512.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Miss Helen Demos, Georgia Karabelas and Maria Tzikos, Class mates of Miss Papaion Hou, presented a dialogue of questions and answers, titled "Devotion to Greek-American Idealism." The performance of the dialogue astonished the distinguished assembly.</p>
   <p>The eight year old Olga, daughter of N. Kokores of moline, stole the attention of the audience by delivery an excellent speech, using, in turn, English and Greek, with exceptional fluency. The audience could not believe there ears that such a speech could emanate from such a little girl.</p>
   <p>At 5:30 P.M. after holding a commemoration prayer for the soul of Abraham Lincoln, Archbishop Athenagoras, in his usual impressive manner and in at hundering but melodious voice, delivered a profound speech "The Life of Abraham Lincoln."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1513.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A sumptuous banquet at the Lincoln Hotel terminated the ceremonies of the delivery of the Greek flag.</p>
   <p>P.S. Each and every state of the Union, as sovereign States of America, dispatched (separately), to the Greek nation, the American flag, as a friendly gesture on the celebration of centennial anniversary of Greece's independence. The Greek Government, in exchange, dispatched forty eight Greek flags to be delivered to the forty eight States of the Union, thus perpetuating the amiable ties of the two nations.</p>
