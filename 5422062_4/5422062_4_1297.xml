   <p>p. 2.- It couldn't happen any other way. Ahepa had to have nightmares just as everything else must have nightmares. Because certain forces were concerned about Hellenism in America and because they wanted to look after Greek interests, the first chapter of the Order of Ahepa was organized.</p>
   <p>There have been many articles written in many newspapers critizing the Ahepa, but they have always been signed with a pseudonym so their true identity will be unknown.</p>
   <p>These "Judases" have sprung up from the Ahepans, breaking their oaths and forgetting their duties. We believe the loyal Ahepans should take means to silence these traitors forever in order to save the great work the Ahepans are doing for the cause of Hellenism.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1298.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These men are the same people who ruined the Panhellenic Union and are trying to do the same to the Ahepa. They succeeded once, but they must not do it again. Ahepans, don't let a few malicious and untrue words weaken you. You must preserve your organization for bigger and better things.</p>
   <p>Sometimes there are organizations that have members belonging to it. There are also organizations that belong to their members. The Ahepa is one of these. But that is no reason for some of the members to abuse the privilege given them.</p>
   <p>Ahepa does not write these things for pity or sympathy. Ahepa doesn't need pity or sympathy. Ahepa was born to live and live it will. This is just a statement we would like certain anonymous people to read, remember, and think about.</p>
