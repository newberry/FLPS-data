   <p>After the election, an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of a town in Greece received the following comforting message from his son in America: "Father, do not feel very badly because of your failure to become the mayor of our town, for I have been elected president of our sectional lodge here in America."</p>
   <p>This is the attitude that is mainly responsible for the multitude of Greek sectional societies. Each little village and every minute parish of the old country is represented here by an impressive group of banners, a lengthy constitution, and an impressive, but often meaningless, name.</p>
   <p>The majority of these lodges are composed of from fifteen to fifty members. They are governed by a council composed of from twelve to fifteen individuals. Gold tassels and buttons adorn their uniforms, which are donned at every possible opportunity. One of their essentials for success is the seal <pb facs="5422062_4_1033.jpg" n="2"/>which is used only by the president and the secretary. The constitution explains in detail the rights and duties of each member. It is probable that every Greek in America has at one time or another been an officer in a church council or a sectional lodge. In other words, although all profess to be captains we still have no captain to govern us. In fact, this condition has reached the point that, in order to present even the most recent immigrant with the privilege of becoming a president or a councilor, some of the "saviors of Hellenism" rake through the ashes to find some speck of Greece that is not already represented by a lodge.</p>
   <p>The social contributions of these sectional societies are of a more or less religious nature. They build large churches and dedicate cemeteries in long deserted towns. They also contribute icons and candelebra for these places.</p>
   <p>At first, we were in favor of these sectional lodges, because they helped the Greek people and kept American Greeks from becoming enstranged from <pb facs="5422062_4_1034.jpg" n="3"/>their language and customs. But now that these organizations are in existence merely because some egotists desire to write President of--after their names, we are protesting their existence. In fact these organizations have become a decided detriment to Greeks of America. They serve to keep us divided and non-co-operative. They breed hatred and antagonism among us. They are the greatest hindrance to the great plan of unification and co-operation.....</p>
   <p>The sectional society served a useful purpose twenty or thirty years ago when a group of laborers who had come from....had nothing else to do but form a lodge. At that time it had a tremendous social importance. Today, with families thriving and businesses expanding, we no longer need sectional lodges. We are in immediate need of large unified parishes, commercial clubs, and national organizations which will band the Greek people together as a strong unit.</p>
