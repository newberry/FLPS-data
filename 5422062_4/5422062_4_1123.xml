   <p>p. 3- Only a myriad-mouthed cry of protest out of the hearts of the Greek people of Chicago, as a whole, could make known to the world the horrible crimes and abominable atrocities committed again by the Turks against thousands of Greeks and other Christians in Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago must utter a cry of protest so loud and so impressive that all America will hear it, and even the hardest heart will be touched - a cry that will provoke indignation and abhorrence for these inhuman monsters who still, unfortunately, find protectors among civilized nations.</p>
   <p>It has fallen to the lot of the Greek people of Chicago at this time to perform a deed not only national and patriotic but philanthropic as well by revealing to the American public the orgies and the crimes of the Turks, for many people do not yet know the whole story of their cruelty.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1124.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The following official communication gives only a faint picture of the dreadful tragedy that has been developing for years in that unfortunate land. It is heart-rending, and it touches every one who reads.</p>
   <p>It is about time to let the American people know of these brutalities. A mass-meeting is to be held for this purpose next Sunday, June 18, at 3 P.M. in the Coliseum, where prominent American speakers will be heard, and resolutions of protest will be sent to the President of the United States, to Congress, and to the American people in general.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago and its suburbs must show their strength, their numbers, and their influence next Sunday, at the Coliseum, which should be filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday must be a date recorded in the annals of our community. THE VICTIMS OF TURKISH BRUTALITIES DEMAND VENGEANCE. Where is the Greek who would refuse to perform his patriotic duty?</p>
