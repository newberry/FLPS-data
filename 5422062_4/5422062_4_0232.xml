   <p>p. 1.- If the phrase "working feverishly" has lost any of its significance it is being greatly revived in describing the Ahepans who are arranging the benefit ball to be given on December 30, at the Trianon.</p>
   <p>Our district governor, A. George N. Spannon and the secretary, Arthur Peponis can be found day and night thinking of new ways to boost ticket sales.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows that Aliki Diplarakou, our European beauty, will be present. All clubs and organizations are cooperating in the characteristic Greek way.</p>
   <p>"Miss Europe" surpassed the wildest expectations of everyone present at the St. Andrew's dance. She has graciously consented to appear at the Ahepan dance whose proceeds are to go towards the needy Greek families <pb facs="5422062_4_0233.jpg" n="2"/>in our city. Not only is she going to appear, but she is going to speak as well. Her subject will be "The Delphian Holidays," which took place last spring in Greece. Miss Diplarakou took part in some of the performances at that time.</p>
   <p>Her lecture, which begins at 7: 30 sharp, will be followed by nine Greek girls, impersonating the Muses. They will also accompany Miss Diplarakou in several dances. Dancing to the Trianon's well-known orchestra will afford pleasure to more than ten thousand of our countrymen who will be gathered there.</p>
   <p>The European beauty will remain the entire evening, meeting and chatting with those present. The Chicago Greeks do not often have such an opportunity, so we should make the most of this one.</p>
