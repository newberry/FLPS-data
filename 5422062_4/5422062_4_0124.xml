   <p>The plans made for the first Greek hospital have been disclosed. There will be a personnel of 330 members. There will be 40 doctors, 60 nurses, 15 cooks, 35 dishwashers, 5 janitors, 5 veterinarians, 25 ambulance drivers, 10 embalmers, 25 undertakers, 5 priests and 125 horses for the ambulances.</p>
   <p>Can you imagine such a hospital? The treasury hasn't money for stamps and it wants to build a hospital,--not a little one, but with a personnel of 330 people. So far in our treasury we have a $1,757.77 expense unpaid. This includes $1,625 for the three lawyers and $132.77 for the receiver.</p>
   <p>The report of April 30 showed that we had $769 in the treasury, but today is June 9. April 30 we've had to pay priests, choirmasters, secretaries, coal bills, etc. How much of the $769 is left, if any?</p>

   <p>The president of the community, Ch. Petroulas, promised to abide by the laws of our constitution. One of these laws says that a monthly report must be presented to the people saying where the money has gone and for what purpose. We hope Dr. Petroulas does not disappoint us in this.</p>
   <p>We have recently learned something about the church lease made by Rev. Kyrillos Georgiadis that displeased us very much. The lease, in the name of the priest, is only for five years. In other words, as soon as our church is established and organized, there will be danger of losing it altogether. We do not like this.</p>
   <p>We still want to know what happened to the money from the furniture of the Macedonian Society.</p>
