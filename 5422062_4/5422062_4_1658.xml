   <p>Never in the annals of Greek life in Chicago has the anniversary of the Fourth of July been celebrated with so much enthusiasm and dignity. Two factors contributed greatly to the success of the celebration. The first was the extraordinary international situation in which all nations, including the United States, find themselves. Another factor is the rivalry among the various nationality groups living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It can be said boldly and with conviction that our Greek nationality excelled all other nationalities in splendor and discipline. A distinguished place and exceptional honor were given by the Americans to our people who participated in the festivities. The honor given us was comparable to that given to the French group, for it, too, held its celebration in our unexcelled Grant Park.</p>
   <p>Briefly, here are the high lights of the celebration. A huge crowd of Greeks <pb facs="5422062_4_1659.jpg" n="2"/>and their various organizations, together with local Greek nationalistic societies, gathered in front of Hull House, where a trumpet corps and bands led the way to Grant Park. The veterans of Greek Balkan wars followed. The procession started at about 1:30 P. M. and paraded through Halsted Street to Jackson and Michigan Boulevards on its way to the park.</p>
   <p>Our popular and well-known Greek patriot, Mr. John Agriostathis, who was an officer in the Greek army, was on horseback in his uniform, leading the procession and surrounded by soldiers on horseback. A company of Greeks dressed in attractive and striking Greek national uniforms with their fezzes, tassels, white shirts, and gold-embroidered vests (Foustaneles) attracted much attention. Then followed the American and Greek flags with honorary escorts, and the banners of the organizations.</p>
   <p>The float--a beautifully decorated chariot--of the Messinia Fraternity was the most attractive feature of the parade. Mrs. Nicholas Salopoulos, the wife of Dr. Nicholas Salopoulos, was dressed in beautiful blue and white flowing <pb facs="5422062_4_1660.jpg" n="3"/>Grecian robes personifying and representing Hellas, Greece; Miss Ethel Martin, financee of Mr. Geo. Bambacaris, was also exquisitely dressed, representing America in a robe of red, white, and blue.</p>
   <p>In front and behind the float, cavalry units were placed as guards. Detachments of Foustanelophopoi, sturdy men dressed in the beautiful Greek national military costumes, marched in perfect step under the command of Alexios Basilopoulos.</p>
   <p>Theodore Deligianis, the large and progressive Gortynian Society, the well-known Tanias Society, and our Greek athletic team, among many other organizations, are worthy of special mention for contributing to the brilliance and magnificence of the procession. Hundreds of private automobiles belonging to Greeks followed the procession of thousands of celebrants.</p>
   <p>An excellent program was presented at the park with great success, amidst the orations of a huge crowd.</p>
   <p>Many inspiring speeches were delivered by both American and Greek dignitaries.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1661.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Patriotic Greek and American numbers were played by the band.</p>
   <p>The ceremony honoring the American and Greek flags was appropriately performed. Then the soul-stirring proclamation of President Wilson was read before many thousands. (The President's proclamation is given in this issue.)</p>
   <p>The American people were greatly impressed by the grand and colorful procession, and the Chicago press gave an extensive description of the celebration, praising the Greeks of Chicago for their magnificent response on America's greatest national holiday, the Fourth of July. It is evident that the Greeks of Chicago are a people of great energy and can do big things if they want to.</p>
   <p>Along with the address of President Wilson we are publishing the text of the greeting to our adopted country delivered by Mr. Constantine Palaeologos on behalf of the Greek people of Chicago.</p>
