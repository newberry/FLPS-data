   <p>When a single Greek goes astray and violates a law of the land, the whole community and the entire race are condemned, and the populace raises a hue and cry against Greeks in general, innocent and guilty alike. Unfortunately, not only are these unjust and loudly uttered accusations against all Greeks promulgated by ignorant and misinformed people, who may be pardoned because they do not know any better, but some educated people, some judges, and practically the entire press also participate in the outcry.</p>
   <p>It is really a paradoxical situation.</p>
   <p>Race hatred and other destructive emotions are natural to the ignorant, the uncultivated, and the unenlightened.</p>
   <p>Does such an attitude against Greeks or against those of any other race <pb facs="5422062_4_0705.jpg" n="2"/>conform to the spirit of Americanism?</p>
   <p>Because of one or two rotten apples shall we condemn the whole crop and the tree which has produced for us an abundance of good fruit?</p>
   <p>Justice, logic, and the spirit of America blush with shame at such actions. Righteousness and the slow upward movement of humanity are imperiled by outbursts of fanaticism, which are the relics of the age of barbarism.</p>
   <p>Is it so shocking that once in a while a Greek should go wrong? Are Greeks supposed to be angels immune to evil impulses? When one of them happens to entertain unangelic desires and displays the weakness of a human being, popular clamor demands that the Greeks be burned lest they contaminate the purity of others.</p>
   <p>Our courts of justice and other law-enforcing agencies lose their significance when the mind of the populace reverts to mob-violence, which is kindled by ignorance and barbarism.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0706.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Were not the courts created to punish culprits and to protect the innocent? Why then are innocent Greeks in the present case accused and condemned, especially by a judge on the bench?</p>
   <p>The city press in big letters took up the hue and cry against the Greeks and aggravated the evil.</p>
   <p>The guilty Greek confectioner who forced his attentions upon a young woman in his employ has been sent to prison to pay the penalty of his wrong-doing, but the accusation delivered from the bench that "all you Greek confectioners lead our girls astray" has left its stigma upon innocent Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Star, which like Cerberus guards the good name of Greeks in America, entered the battle and with practical common sense protested that the spirit of Americanism is grossly violated and offended by unjust accusations against all Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0707.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A mass-meeting of Greek confectioners was assembled last week at which eighteen hundred businessmen were present. A resolution was passed condemning the actions of the convicted Greek, and a committee was appointed to use all legitimate means to dispel the clouds of prejudice and restore the light of common sense.</p>
   <p>A common-sense talk was delivered by the publisher and editor of the Star; the president of the Greek Confectioners' Association and the president of the Greek community also addressed the mass-meeting,at which by prearrangement many prominent Americans and the representatives of the city press were also present.</p>
   <p>The result of this agitation is that the honorable judge who set this fire blazing has beautifully retracted his utterances against Greeks, and the city press in flattering terms has covered up the black paint with which it had daubed us.</p>
   <p>In order to avoid a repetition of this incident, the Star urgently appeals <pb facs="5422062_4_0708.jpg" n="5"/>to all Greek confectioners, restaurant-keepers, and others who employ young women to bear in mind for their own interest and for the interest of the entire Greek community that if any one is known to be indecently inclined, as the convicted Greek was, he should immediately be reported to the authorities. By so doing we shall not only protect society in general against creatures of this kind; we shall also protect our own good name.</p>
