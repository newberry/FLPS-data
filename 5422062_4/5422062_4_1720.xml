   <p>A dignified ceremony occurred last Sunday in Holy Trinity Church. The Greek School Socrates celebrated the feast of the "Three Hierarchs." It is the tribute of gratitude of the Greek schools to their three holy commanders, and the respectful recognition of the indefatigable labor to which the three great stars of Christianity submitted for the fortification of our religion and language. It was an inspiring affair.</p>
   <p>Church and school, religion and fatherland, Greek and Christian appeared united in harmonious pairs. The church was packed by parents and other festival-lovers. Five hundred Greek children occupied the sanctuary altar according to grades. Clean and handsome, with their sparkling eyes, they were like lilies of the field which had been transplanted all of a sudden into that sacred space.</p>
   <p>To the right, and on the amphitheatrical pedestal, about forty boys and girls, pupils of the higher grades, in their striking church uniforms, sang the holy mass under the able direction of their teacher, Mr. N. Lamprinides, <pb facs="5422062_4_1721.jpg" n="2"/>and the melodious voices of these cherubs raised a harmonious hymn to the Creator and filled the soul with a feeling of piety and devotion. Never anywhere could anybody feel more deeply the meaning of the verses:</p>
   <p>Lips of little ones dare to praise thee in hymns.</p>
   <p>Tender, O Almighty, a benign ear.</p>
   <p>Weak though their voices be,</p>
   <p>They are voices nevertheless of the soul.</p>
   <p>After the holy mass the principal (or director-translator) of the school, Mr. G. Drosos, briefly and beautifully rendered his report about the work accomplished during the last six months and then introduced the speaker of the day, a Teacher, Miss Iph. Chrysanthacopoulos, who spoke about the three Hierarchs.</p>
   <p>Then, the surprises, selected poems, dialogues, and beautiful songs successively followed one another with prolonged applause of the spectators. (The names of some of the pupils follow - Translator.)</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1722.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The whole program was admirable. It was a National initiation. The Greek creator Socrates had created a living Greece in the midst of America. In this pure Greek environment the soul of the audience was re-baptized in the sacred springs of the beautiful, the eternal Grecian race. Only incurable pessimists, only the mentally maimed and the spiritually imprisoned can still doubt the sacred mission of the Greek schools in America.</p>
   <p>.....The school is the miraculous laboratory of nations. Teachers are the creators of national consciences. Support the school, and you have the Greeks of the future. Abandon it, and you doom them to vanish.</p>
   <p>....Many of the graduates have already registered in the High Schools of the city.</p>
