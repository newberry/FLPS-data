   <p>P.3--On Sunday, August 6, the Pan-Hellenic Society of Chicago will hold its annual picnic at Fifty-ninth Street and Western Avenue. All the Greeks in Chicago and its environs are invited to attend.</p>
   <p>Devotees of nature, of conviviality, and of jollity, and epicures as well, will find their hearts' desires satisfied. Men, women, and children, girls and boys, lovers of beauty and rhythm will be there to enjoy themselves and to give enjoyment to others. The music, the singing, and the dancing will charm every heart, young and old. And as for the gourmands, there will be a variety of viands and beverages to supply their gastronomic needs, and they may eat and drink at will and as much as they will. Everything is included in the $1 ticket. Buy your tickets early.</p>
   <p>Pan-Hellenic Society.</p>
