   <p>All those who are following with interest the progress of the Greek Community of Chicago are beginning to think that the day of the unification and centralization of our churches is at hand. Due to our repetitive and frequent editorials on this subject, printed religiously since the founding of the Greek Press, there are finally signs that something concerning the matter will be done. People are beginning to understand the need for an undivided Greek community.</p>
   <p>Every Chicago Greek cannot be given the opportunity to express his opinion publicly, as did the common people of ancient Athens. Modern times have brought a new medium of public expression, however, in the form of the newspaper--a powerful and influential instrument. Although the American press is controlled by private enterprise, it is the only criterion by which to judge the desires and opinions of a community.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0861.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The reason for this article is the recent addition of Archimandrite Daniel Golemis to our ranks and also because of the thoughtful and intelligent article written by Doctor [Charal] Haral Ambides. The two articles written by the pastor of the St. George Church and by the doctor aroused the interest of all the Greek people Reverend Golemis, one of our most capable and educated priests, opened a serious and important discussion, which must be participated in by the entire Community of Chicago,laymen and clerics alike. He made a beginning for the clergy by publishing his views and beliefs on the subject, without resorting to any subterfuge or repression of thought, a common practice of social leaders. The article written by the doctor clearly reveals that he has scientifically and objectively analyzed the entire situation.</p>
   <p>Because of the situation in which our parishes find themselves, it is the duty of every person--especially those who in one way or another are social leaders--to express his opinion and defend it publicly. Only then can we achieve success <pb facs="5422062_4_0862.jpg" n="3"/>and obtain a solution to our social problems. Then the Greek Press can really be the voice of the Greek Community and represent and fight for the people's wishes. All individuals are required to take a certain stand on various matters, personal and communal, during their lifetime. Now, is the time for the Greek people of Chicago to take a stand on the matter of Church unification. Each one must decide which side he is on and then stay there. A constantly changing substance can not be weighed or measured with any degree of accuracy. We must acquire stability if our community is to make any notable progress in the future. Unless it does, we shall be unworthy of being considered Greek patriots, because we shall have contributed to the obliteration of the Greek language and religion in the forthcoming generations.</p>
