   <p>p. 8-The committee for the rehabilitation of Greek refugees has just compiled its report, which will be submitted to the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>According to this report the committee has spent of the first installment of the loan the sum of £302,415 for settlements in rural districts, £182,239 for settlements in cities, and £5,424 for rent and salaries of the central office force. The sum of £160,000 was also paid over to the relief treasury for expenditures made prior to the organization of this committee.</p>
   <p>On May 15 the sum of £349,921 was still left of the first installment of the loan, and the second installment had not been touched.</p>
   <p>With the funds already spent, £644,654, 97,000 of 140,000 rural refugees had been settled in the country, and about 18,000 of 65,000 urban refugees had been accommodated in cities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0363.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To the rural settlers seed, plows, cattle, medicines, and other commodities were given according to their needs. To the urban settlers also medicines and other necessities were furnished.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago who have relatives among the refugees, or who for any reason desire information as to the survival and the whereabouts of any persons there, are requested to write to the central offices of the committee.</p>
