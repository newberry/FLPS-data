   <p>p. 1 -- The Mayor of Chicago, in compliance with the federal proclamation, has issued the program of the celebration of the Fourth of July, and all foreign nationalities are requested to take part in this national celebration.</p>
   <p>Of course the Greeks received a special invitation, due to the fact that Greek patriotism is not merely empty words but a demonstrated fact, and Mr. Paul Demos was appointed chairman of the Greek celebration committee. The celebration of the Fourth of July is not strictly an American holiday; it is just as much Greek as it is American because the American Democracy, since the event of 1776, is called the daughter of ancient Greece.</p>
   <p>The Celebration Committee, complying with the established rule, will have ready a huge silk flag with golden stars denoting the number of Chicago <pb facs="5422062_4_1669.jpg" n="2"/>Greeks serving in the United States Army. And that number will be (according to latest reports) 7,467. This flag will fly at the head of all organizations and societies.</p>
   <p>All the Greeks of Chicago and the suburbs are urgently invited to publicly express our interest in the celebration of American Independence. No one must be absent. Business and other things are secondary. Our country is above all things.</p>
   <p>The program for the celebration, which will take place at Grant Park, is as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Cannonade will open the celebration.</p>
   <p>2. The raising of the flag at 3 o'clock sharp.</p>
   <p>3. National American hymns.</p>
   <p>4. Reading the President's proclamation.</p>
   <p>5. Reading the Governor's proclamation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1670.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>6. Patriotic speech in English</p>
   <p>7. Reception of the new citizens</p>
   <p>8. Patriotic speech in Greek</p>
   <p>Aeroplanes will fly over Grant Park throughout the celebration.</p>
   <p>A Greek war-chariot will beautify our participation in the celebration.</p>
   <p>There will be various dances and fire works.</p>
   <p>The government through special preparation will take pictures of the Greek contingent and others.</p>
   <p>All the veterans of the Balkan wars are requested to be present so they may lead the procession.</p>
   <p>The Fourth of July is our holiday; America is our country. Let us make this a great celebration.</p>
   <p>The Organization Committee.</p>
