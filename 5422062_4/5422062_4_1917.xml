  <body>
   <p>p. 3- Greeks who reside on the South Side have begun to realize the need of another Greek church there, for on account of their increased numbers a second church can be supported without detriment to the other church. The idea has so far matured that prominent South Side Greeks have called a meeting for that purpose. A committee has been appointed and has resolved to announce its intention to found a new church.</p>
   <p>Therefore all South Side Greeks and all Greeks in Chicago in general are invited to attend a meeting which will take place on April 7 at 1:00 P.M. at 4300 South State street. At this meeting all the details of the new church will be announced by the temporary committee.</p>
   <p>Star's notation:</p>
   <p>The Greeks of the South Side are to be congratulated for taking the initiative in building another Greek church in Chicago. The population of the South Side is large enough to support the anticipated church without any difficulty whatever. We sincerely wish and hope to see the new church built as quickly as possible.</p>
