   <p>The Community of St. Constantine at the beginning was administered by its own by-laws, politically by the state, ecclesiastically by the Holy Synod of Greece, and from the year of 1921 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.</p>
   <p>Every two years the conventions elect the church council and the presidents, who are men of sincerity, integrity, religious devotion, and distinguished for their love of Greece and the New generation. The First President was Mr. H. Koumountzis, a native of Sparta, and a great patriot. Mr. H. Vrettos, was Vice President; Mr. M. Petropoulos, General Secretary; Mr. P. Tzovanis, General Treasurer. Members of the Council were A. Apalodemas, George Skoularinos, D. Vournazos, S. Lampardakis, G. Katsoulis, G. Mpouzanis, G. Spyridakos, B. Rekas, L. Paulacos, N. Rousopoulos and P. Ladas.
