   <p>The sixth national convention of the Sons of Pericles took place last week. A church mass was held, last Sunday, at the church of the Annunciation by the Most Rev. Kallistos, officially starting the convention. At this mass about ninety representatives of the different chapters of the organization, from various cities of the United States, were present.</p>
   <p>On Monday, there was an election of temporary officers for supervising the convention. New business and the election of new officers of the Supreme Council, will be dealt with by the regular convention on Thursday. On Monday night, a banquet was given in honor of the representatives at Hotel LaSalle, where 300 persons were seated. Wednesday night, a grand dance was given at the Trianon, in ratification of the convention. The next convention will be held in Albany, N.Y., Aug. 1936.</p>
   <p>Among other matters voted upon was the excursion to Greece, as favorable for tightening up more closely the bond between the senior members of Ahepa and the Sons of Pericles.</p>

   <p>We wish the dear Greek youth of the Sons of Pericles to surpass our expectations.</p>
