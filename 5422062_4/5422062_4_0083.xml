   <p>p. 2.- "Let's go to the show, Nick. I have two tickets for the second row. An American friend of mine gave them to me. Let's go, Faust is playing tonight.."</p>
   <p>"Don't talk to me about Faust, brother. I don't like theaters. When I want enjoyment, I dance Greek, I eat hearty, I sing and remember my youth in the old country. I don't like theaters and European dances. I am a married man and refuse to let my wife be seen in dance halls, rubbing her skirts with the skirts of the common rabble. Let's go to the Kosmitan dance on February 11 at Sivores Hall, 4300 S. State St. We will meet all the prominent Greeks of our city."</p>
   <p>"But, my friend, must we pay for more tickets to go there?"</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0084.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Don't be so dumb, brother. If you are not a member, admission is free. You can eat and drink to your heart's content; only Kosmitans pay."</p>
   <p>"Why didn't you say so in the first place. Let's go!"</p>
   <p>They go.</p>
   <p>On the way, they meet some Greek people and are asked the way to 4300 State St. Everyone seems to be headed for the Kosmitan dance.</p>
