   <p>The foreign language accounts department of the Central Trust Company of which Mr. Constantine Paleologos is in charge, has received the following letters and has begun the collection of funds to help Tripolis and the Arcadians in their present misfortune.</p>
   <p>We request not only that the Arcadians will offer a helping hand, but that all our countrymen who can do so will send their contributions to the Central Trust Company of Illinois in care of the Foreign Language Accounts Department, 125 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0395.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A committee consisting of Mr. Constantine Salopoulos, John Agriostathes, John Papanastasios, G. Lazaropoulos, James Papantonios, Andreas Vlachos, G. Tankalakis, G. Tsarochas, V. Doukas, A. Bouras, S. Bouri, S. Mouzakiotes, G. Karkazis, N. Kokkinis, James Tsampas, G. Pitsaras, and C. Carides has been authorized to receive contributions.</p>
   <p>The names of the contributors will be published weekly in Saloniki so as to keep the public informed.</p>
   <p>Fellow-countrymen, let us not fail our brothers who are in desperate case, and may the Lord be gracious to us in return for our good deeds! Whatever you decide to do, act promptly, for the epidemic is decimating the population, and the acropolis of the famous Peloponnesus is being destroyed.</p>

   <p>Central Trust Company of Illinois,</p>
   <p>Chicago, United States of America.</p>
   <p>Dear Sirs,</p>
   <p>As we are informed, our countrymen who reside in Chicago prefer to deal with your Bank.</p>
   <p>They come in contact with you daily, and we therefore take the liberty of seeking your invaluable aid and cooperation at this critical moment when our unfortunate city is afflicted with a dreadful plague.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0397.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We inclose an appeal to the Chicago Arcadians, and we request that you will take whatever action to you seems best to persuade them to collect money and send it to the Greek Red Cross of Tripolis.</p>
   <p>We thank you in advance; we are under very great obligations to you.</p>
   <p>The Greek Red Cross of Tripolis,</p>
   <p>By Iatridis.</p>
   <p>Tripolis, Greece,</p>
   <p>March 1, 1923.</p>
   <p>To the Arcadians of Chicago,</p>
   <p>Countrymen,</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0398.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Our beloved country to-day, finds itself facing a great danger; the plague of typhus has attacked our city and menaces the entire state. Day by day new victims are marked; five doctors have already lost their lives, and another is in great danger.</p>
   <p>In order to disinfect our city and eheck this rapid destruction, we are appealing for generous contributions from our countrymen scattered abroad.</p>
   <p>We hope that in the present circumstances you will all show your generous and philanthropic feelings.</p>
   <p>We and our entire city wish to thank you all in advance.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>The Greek Red Cross of Tripolis</p>
   <p>By Iatridis</p>
