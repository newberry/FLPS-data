   <p>p. 1.- Leaders of all the foreign language groups, comprising the various communities of Chicago, are organizing their forces to give festivals with the object of raising funds for the poor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>These activities and the dances which will be given, are under the auspices of The Chicago Daily News.</p>
   <p>Attorney Paul Demos, prominent social leader, and President of the Greek committee, utilizing his Corithian diplomacy and eloquence, succeeded in persuading the leaders of the other nationalities, that the Greek community should lead in the forthcoming festivals, and examplify the beginning of the philanthropic balls.</p>
   <p>The Greeks, in taking the lead, decided to present a brilliant event that would be worth-while. They put their heads together and the result was crowned by tremendous success.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0196.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Under the scrutinizing eye of that shrewd observer of beauty, Paul Demos, Greek maidens of classic appearance were recruited and began to rehearse the dances of the ancients. But the aesthetic eye of the observer was not satisfied, so more beauties were recruited for American dances. The program being completed, the committee paid a visit to Andrew Karzas, who after learning the philanthropic object of the dance, offered them the Aragon. Of course Mr. Karzas offered the use of the Aragon, gratis, and also two orchestras. Indeed, a noble deed.</p>
   <p>Time and space do not permit us to give details of the magnificent ball, but here are a few excerpts of The Chicago Daily News reporter. Mr. Karzas said, "It was a wonderful idea for you to create the opportunity for those who can contribute to the general funds. I am glad in knowing that I was able to offer the Aragon and the services of the two orchestras gratis." John Raklios said, "I am grateful to Chicago, and with delight I do my duty for the benefit of this philanthropic purpose." C. Johnson, president of the firm, De Mets, expressed the same gratitude.</p>
   <p>The Greek committee which contributed to the success of the ball is as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0197.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Paul Demos, A. Karzas, John Raklios, C. Johnson, T. Chamalis, N. Salopoulos, K. Tzovanis, B. Tsourapas, J. Papanastasiou, K. Theodorou, Geo. Becharas, E. Tsirigos, N. Palivos, Geo. Chiagouris, N. Nomicos, P. Bougas, A. Tsikouris, Peter Lambros, Geo. Kyriakopoulos, S. Kotakis, P. Gavaras, P. Sikokis, G. Spanon, J. Alex, J. Mantas, Geo. Annes, D. Nichols, N. Vasels, K. Terzakis, T. Valos, J. Volicos, J. Koliopoulos, A. Flambouras, and P. Bouras.</p>
   <p>Over five thousand Greeks participated in this festival, and every penny of the proceeds will be given to the general fund committee of The Chicago Daily News.</p>
