   <p>Chicago, Oct. 28. - (Editor of the Tribune)- I take a great pleasure in addressing you this letter in order to express my enthusiasm over the good work you are doing against the medical advertisers, and I feel confident the public, and especially the poor victims, will give due credit to your estimable paper and will appreciate your beneficial efforts to clean the atmosphere of Chicago from such injurious fakers.</p>
   <p>If Hippocrates, the father of medicine, and most famous of the Greek physicians, were alive today and were to witness existing conditions among the so-called doctors he would have felt ashamed of this profession.</p>
   <p>In coming in contact with some of the medical advertisers I have learned there was a $20 fee charged to every patient that visited their offices <pb facs="5422062_4_0758.jpg" n="2"/>in order to cover the advertising expenditures, and anything over that was an asset. In making further investigations I have found that some of the poor foreigners, who were led to the offices of these schemers, came out robbed and their health ruined.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Publisher of the Greek Star.</p>
   <p>Editor's note. - The Greek Star has not printed any quack medical ads since September 1912.</p>
