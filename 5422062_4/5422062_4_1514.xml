   <p>p. 1.- No truer statement was ever uttered. Believe it or not, that is something that the Greek nation has been lacking for some thousand years or so. Unite the Greeks and they will conquer the world. Now do not think that I am moralizing. I am not writing what I am going to write because I cannot think of anything else. On the contrary, my poor mind is fertile enough to talk about a lot of subjects, (I left my Christian humility on the elevator coming up). Living in Chicago is sufficient for anyone to find enough to write about. Remember this, a city like Chicago--100 percent American, 100 percent corrupt--is sufficient inspiration for anyone to receive abundance of material. But last Sunday something happened. The Greeks of Chicago, for the first time in their history, united for a common purpose. That is an accomplishment.</p>
   <p>With his Excellency, the General Consul of Greece, George Depasta, leading the way, representatives from all the important societies in <pb facs="5422062_4_1515.jpg" n="2"/>Chicago, met at the Parlor Room of the Morrison Hotel last Sunday afternoon and there elected the executive committee of the Pan-Hellenic Celebration of Greek Independence, to take place in Chicago. A whole week of hard work is being prepared with the curtain to fall on the 25th of March.</p>
   <p>"The grandest of the grandest," would have been the words of some if I were to ask an opinion about the coming events that are scheduled for the anniversary celebration.</p>
   <p>On Tuesday night the executive committee, consisting of the Consul General Depasta, representing the local societies; George A. Spannon, representing Ahepa; C. Soter, Supreme Governor of the G.A.P.A. and the presidents of the Greek communities of Chicago, prepared a most elaborate plan for the celebration. Now stand by closely! You will hear great news within the next few days.</p>

   <p>You probably have seen the story in the Daily News about the valuable icon that I happened to discover in the modest home of the Galineas family. If you haven't, then look through the Greek Press you will find a reprint. It is a good yarn and ought to interest many of the mothers. There are many icons in our Chicago iconostasia that ought to be looked over. They might be worth a lot of money to some of you, and one dance follows the other.</p>
   <p>Goddess Terpsichore has certainly blessed us Greeks with her graces. Here we have The Young Ladies Philomusical (?) Society giving a dance, April 19th, 1931, at the Knickerbocker Hotel. Well! Well! Of all places. Greeks will be dragged into the heart of the Gold Coast whether they like it or not. Miss Vournazos has sent me a letter in which she emphasises the fact that this hotel is opposite the Drake. We believe her!</p>
