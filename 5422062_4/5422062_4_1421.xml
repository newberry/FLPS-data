   <p>Last week, twelve representatives of several local Greek nationalistic societies met in Chicago as "a new important Hague conference" in which many "important" subjects were discussed and passed upon regarding the rights of the Greeks in America and especially in connection with recent illegal violations of these rights.</p>
   <p>In addition, this so-called conference of "Greek leaders" took it upon itself to determine whether or not the new nation-wide movement under the sponsorship of Ambassador Koromilas has the proper leaders. In the first place, the meeting of these twelve Greek representatives and chairmen of organizations remained almost completely unnoticed because they were too few in comparison with the huge numbers of Greeks whose motives and opinions are different than theirs.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1422.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nevertheless, in spite of the insignificance of the meeting, numerically, opportunity was presented to express opinions against the program of His Excellency, the Greek Ambassador, in whose person the Greek King, the Greek Government, the Greek nation, and the thousands of Greeks in America are represented.</p>
   <p>We now find ourselves in the unpleasant position of observing that most opposing leaders acted against the principles and true wishes of their organizations. They have failed to do their duty and act in accordance with our national ideology. So, they dared to fight against the proposals of the Greek Ambassador, who has spared no effort thus far to unite the Greek people of America in a great nationwide organization or league with a unity of purpose, with the same ideals, and under the same flag.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, however, a few outstanding patriotic leaders like Messrs. Serafim Kanoutas, Gregory Papaeliou, and James Eutaxias made suitable and forceful <pb facs="5422062_4_1423.jpg" n="3"/>recommendations that the work of Mr. Koromilas should not be impeded. With brilliant and convincing arguments these men urged the acceptance of the Ambassador's leadership for, they argued, he is not only the official representative of the Greek Government and therefore the natural leader of the Greeks of America in all major activities and undertakings, but he is also an extraordinary and accomplished administrator and organizer. These men even threatened to resign and stop attending meetings of the general council if their proposals were not heeded. In this way, thanks to the wise advice and expert guidance of men of vision and clear thinking, the Panhellenic League espoused the program of Mr. Koromilas, which will be put into practice as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to cast any reflection upon the patriotic sentiments of a number of gentlemen who took part in the meeting of the representatives of our local societies last week. May we point out, however, that Mr. Nicholaou, the boisterous chairman of the meeting, and a man who is bitterly opposed to the policies of Mr. Koromilas, should not be allowed to impress the members with his <pb facs="5422062_4_1424.jpg" n="4"/>false arguments. If the Panhellenic League is to contribute to the unity and welfare of the Greeks of America, it must be reconstructed and revitalized.</p>
   <p>For one whole year this organization had the opportunity to show whether it could function beneficially or not. Unfortunately, it has been proven that it was conceived by many selfish interests. As a result, it could not possibly rally the Greeks to its support. If new ideas are not infused in the Panhellenic League, it must necessarily be disbanded. The policies of Mr. Koromilas involve the unification of all the local, independent, nationalistic organizations. All those who are opposing the program of the inspired Ambassador are committing an unpatriotic act. The supporters of the ineffective program of the Panhellenic League must not put any obstacles in the path of the Ambassador and his supporters.</p>
   <p>The interests of our people, especially in Chicago, demand that we either reform the Panhellenic League or follow the lead of Mr. Koromilas in a spirit of obedience, co-operation, and unity.</p>
