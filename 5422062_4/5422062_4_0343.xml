   <p>Dear Countrymen:</p>
   <p>With the courage of a young immigrant I came to America. I have come to the most civilized country in the world from Greece, the country that first introduced civilization.</p>
   <p>I have come to find my countrymen, to interest them in the humane work which is being done for their brothers.</p>
   <p>On my long trip I met many people, some of them from Chicago, some from other parts of the United States. I must say, they did not discourage me. They led me to have hopes of much help from the various organizations. I could have pressed this privilege, but I decided to start my plea through the press. When the National Herald (New York newspaper) said to me, "We will help you heart and soul," I felt very much satisfied and very glad <pb facs="5422062_4_0344.jpg" n="2"/>I had come. My thanks cannot be expressed by means of the pen. This cause is so close to my heart that I feel I must succeed. Now I will tell all eager listeners why I am here, and why, at my age, I have made this long trip.</p>
   <p>Since last August I have been building a sanitarium,at Korfoxilia, Arcadia. It is an ideal spot for recuperation. We have made three hundred cots of fir boughs. The building which will be completed in November, will cost 2,500,000 drachmas. I have already gathered from Greece and the Greek communities of Egypt about 3,500,000 drachmas. That means I have 1,000,000 drachmas left over. Luckily the Spetseropoulos Brotherhood of Tripoli which has donated 1,200,000 drachmas, will completely furnish the left wing.</p>
   <p>My trip to America deals with such things as heat, light, cooking, nurses, helpers, etc. I am not asking you for much and I am not naming any special sum. Give what you want to give and what you feel you can give.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0345.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I am confident that the Greeks of America are kindhearted and generous. I know you will listen to my plea and help me, else I would not have come.</p>
   <p>All contributions should be sent to the Athenian Bank, 25 Pine Street, New York. From there, they will be sent directly to Greece and the sanitarium which I have named "H Manna."</p>
   <p>I am sure you all will be rewarded in the years to come because in helping this cause you are helping humanity.</p>
   <p>I thank you.</p>
   <p>Anna Papadopoulou</p>
