   <p>The twenty-first District of our Order reconvened in hospitable Chicago Heights for its second annual District Convention. With the hundreds of incoming delegates, alternates, families and friends the Convention opened under the most favorable of auspices.</p>
   <p>Sunday was full of activity. In the morning church services were held at the Holy Trinity Church with many of the church dignitaries taking part in the services. The church was packed to capacity, and hundreds were compelled to remain out-of-doors. During the afternoon two base-ball games were played by the members of the Sons of Pericles. The Lord Byron Chapter which is ably coached by Brother John Brown won the coveted cup which was donated by our esteemed Brother Arthur H. Peponis. Ypsilanti Chapter of the Sons of Pericles won the other game from the Pindaros Chapter but the winner of this game lost to Lord Byron.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1797.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>While the junior members were enjoying themselves in the field of sports the senior Order members were initiating a class of candidates. More than twenty-five members were initiated into the ranks of the Order. This class of newly initiated members is to be known as the "Arthur H. Peponis Class."</p>
   <p>Following the initiation and the baseball game we all gathered at the outdoor pavilion where dinner was set for more than four hundred persons. By eight o'clock the pavilion was filled. The speaker's table was adorned by such distinguished citizens as our Rt. Rev. Kallistos, Hon. F. W. Bruggemann, Mayor of the city of Harvey, Ill., Hon. A. I. Zeller, Police Magistrate of the city of Chicago Heights; Brother A. A. Pantelis; District Governor Arthur A. Peponis and many others. Brother Chris Gregory, past president of Chicago Heights and the present secretary acted as chairman of the evening. He was introduced to the gathering by the hard-working president of the same chapter, Brother <pb facs="5422062_4_1798.jpg" n="3"/>George Callas. Dancing followed the excellent dinner and very inspiring speeches were delivered by those occupying the speaker's table.</p>
   <p>The Monday session was set aside for the business of the Convention. As it is customary, the session convened with an invocation by our beloved Bishop Kallistos.</p>
   <p>Brother Chris Gregory was then unanimously elected chairman of the Convention and performed his duty ably and with speed. Brother James Geroulis was elected Vice-chairman, and Brother Mark Mamalakis was re-elected secretary. All the officers of the Convention performed their duties admirably well.</p>
   <p>................The following are some of the important resolutions that were adopted by the Convention during the afternoon session. The Ahepa Herald was made the official organ of the District; the National Recovery <pb facs="5422062_4_1799.jpg" n="4"/>Act (NRA) was endorsed and that the members were to be called upon to give our Brother Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President, their wholehearted support and cooperation to make this movement a success; that a District Educational Committee was recommended to promote a comprehensive educational program for the entire District; a Juvenile Protective Committee to be organized and look after the delinquent juveniles of our city; the founding of an Ahepa Home and ways and means must be found to establish a Death Benefit Fund were also recommended. Woodlawn Chapter No. 93 has been selected as the place for the next year's Convention.</p>
   <p>The election of the District Lodge officers was then in order and the following were elected: D. Parry, District Governor, George Ganas, Lieutenant Governor, Basil Lambros, District Treasurer, Peter Alferes, District Secretary, George Polales, District Marshall.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1800.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Brother Arthur H. Peponis conducted the installation of the newly elected District Lodge Officers. Short addresses of thanks were made by all of them and the Convention was adjourned.</p>
