  <body>
   <p>The great misfortune which has again befallen Greece has not left the Greeks of America indifferent and unaffected. Their patriotic and philanthropic sentiments have been aroused, and the slogan, "Let us hasten to the aid of the unfortunate victims of the great calamity", resound wherever Greeks are to be found in America.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the tender hearts of the Greek girls of our community were first affected and gave the signal for action for the collection of funds.</p>
   <p>The information has reached us from the Society of the Greek Young Women of the North Side, that they have arranged that three-fourths of the proceeds of their annual dance shall go to the victims of the earthquakes; and only one-fourth to the needy of our community.</p>
   <p>This dance will be held at the Aragon on May 28th, with an artistic program. In addition to the dance, "Orpheus and Eurydice" from ancient Greek mythology, will be presented by the young ladies of the Society.</p>
   <p>The Greek community of Chicago which has carried away delightful impressions from the affairs of the Society in the past, will undoubtedly support this <pb facs="5422062_4_0312.jpg" n="2"/>affair exceptionally well; since it is known that the greater portion of the proceeds will go to the victims of the earthquakes.</p>
   <p>The needs of the Corinth earthquake victims are great, and this dance is timely. All of us ought to hasten to their aid and relief. The affair must be a complete success, because the purpose is noble and urgent.</p>
   <p>Under such circumstances, it is needless to urge the community to be present, since it is our duty to express our sympathy for the earthquake victims of Greece.</p>
