   <p>Mr. Fred C. Wolffs, president of the New City Packing and Provision Co., 942 W. Fulton St. has sold to Harry A. Reckas, Stylianos J. Reckas and Aristides A. Reckas, the property located at 3508-18 South Halsted St. for $100,000. This property has a frontage of 130 ft. on Halsted St. with a depth of 150 ft. and is improved with five one story brick stores and a two story building adjoining.</p>
   <p>The Halsted and 69th Street Building Corporation has sold the Southwest corner of 69th and Halsted Streets, to Theodore Maropoulos, Gust J. Constan and George Stavropoulos, at a price of $177,500. The lot is 100x125 sq. ft. and is improved with a terra cotta building containing nine stores twenty offices and a large lodge hall.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0789.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Giacomo Manachino has sold to George Stavropoulos the Northeast corner of 78th St. and Cottage Grove Ave. for $52,500,000 Tutules and Dignan recently also sold to Mr. Stavropoulos the vacant property adjoining, so that now his holdings having been increased, he expects soon to erect a building suitable for this very active and promising district.</p>
   <p>About eight to ten months ago Peter Tutules acquired over 600 ft. of business frontage in the district surrounding 59th St. and Kedzie Ave. He has sold within the last two months in cooperation with O'Connor Burk &amp; McDonnell and others, about $100,000. worth of this property at three times the price he paid for it.</p>
   <p>He has retained however a number of corners in this district which he intends improving in the same manner that he improved the Northeast corner of 59th and Troy where there is now being erected a building to contain fifteen apartments and three stores.</p>
   <p>Tutules and Dignan represented both parties in the above transactions.</p>
