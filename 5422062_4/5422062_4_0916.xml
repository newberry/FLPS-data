   <p>p. 3.- The Ahepa Excursion to Greece gave many of our Greek women, who had immigrated to the United States when they were very young, the opportunity to visit their homeland. The women of Greece were very curious to hear their impressions so Mrs. J. Sotirakos, wife of the doctor, graciously consented to answer the questions put to her. She is a graduate of the University of Ohio, majoring in literature. Born in Kranidi she left Greece at the age of 5, married a Greek and so is qualified to tell her impressions of the Greeks in the United States as compared to Greece.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks of America," she said, "have adopted many American customs and have retained many of the Greeks so that they resemble neither Americans nor Greeks in this respect."</p>
   <p>What are the differences between the American and the Greek women of America?" she is asked.</p>
   <p>"The Americans are divided into classes," she said. "They are very class-conscious and recognize their own position. The Greeks live in one class as Greeks. They have not as yet developed a higher and lower class..</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0917.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Naturally, in this way they retain many of their Greek ideals and customs."</p>
   <p>She was asked what sort of work Greek women in America do and their attitude towards it.</p>
   <p>The answer was that they work just as American women do, as stenographers, bookkeepers, typists, etc. In New York, a stenographer makes from 25 to 33 dollars a week. In other cities the amount varies, but there is always enough to live on. She has learned more about economic value than the women of Greece know.</p>
   <p>She was then asked to compare the Greek woman of Greece with that of America.</p>
   <p>"In America," she replies, "Greek women as well as the Americans, dress much simpler than those of Greece or Europe. They aren't as "coquettish"; they don't "paint up" as much, nor do they smoke as much. They are not as curious about their neighbors. Those in Greece watch every move another woman makes, her clothes, what she says, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0918.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"It is in this respect that the Greek women of America have become Americanized. It is noted that a woman arriving from Greece loses this habit in a few years and adopts the American's policy of indifference."</p>
   <p>She was then asked, "What do you think of the men of Greece?"</p>
   <p>She didn't want to answer at first but this is what she said, "To tell the truth, the men of Greece are a little too conscious of the ladies. They flirt too much. When they see a woman they look her over from head to toe and farther. We prefer men from America."</p>
   <p>"Would Greek women of America rather marry Americans or Greeks?"</p>
   <p>"Greeks, because the customs of a Greek woman and an American man are too different for them to get along."</p>
   <p>She closed by saying that the Greeks of America preferred America to Greece because, although they work as hard and sometimes harder in America, there are more conveniences and advantages here than can be found in Greece.</p>
