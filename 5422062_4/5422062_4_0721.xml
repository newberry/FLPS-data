   <p>P.3--A subpoena-server named B. Mourche recently went to a Greek saloon at 4910 Wentworth Avenue in compliance with his judicial duty to serve some papers. He was attacked and so badly beaten that when he was taken away by the police, who came in response to a call, he became unconscious.</p>
   <p>This was a dastardly act, and whoever committed it deserves to be punished. It was not only cowardly but absolutely unwarranted. Undoubtedly the perpetrators of the attack were Greeks (there may also have been others), and they ought to be severly punished as an example. A subpoena-server is compelled by the requirements of his office to serve papers. Greeks, Mongols, Americans or persons of any other race are all the same to him in executing the court's orders. John Doe warrants by the dozen were issued for the arrest of the culprits.</p>
