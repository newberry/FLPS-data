  <body>
   <p>p. 1- The word success is not suitable in this case, to characterize yesterday's awakening in Chicago. Triumph from one end to the other is the only expression by which those not present can get an idea of the crowd which filled the Coliseum.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago, men, women, and children, came there by thousands to raise to the people of America a voice of protest against the unholy and horrible crimes of the Turks.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's protest mass-meeting was really imposing and grand, such as only the united Greeks of Chicago could achieve with common voice and impulse.</p>
   <p>It was inevitable that the Greeks of Chicago should form this national assembly not only in protest but also in prayer to commemorate and lament the innocent victims of Turkish barbarity and ferocity.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1118.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There were without exaggeration 7,000 persons present. No other such mass-meeting had ever before been assembled. Greeks, Americans, Armenians, Serbians, and Russians came with flags and banners to protest and express their indignation at the abominable crimes committed by the Turks.</p>
   <p>At the appointed hour the various societies gathered outside the Greek Daily's office with their banners. Mr. Nickolopoulos, leader of the Greek-American Legion, headed the procession and after him marched Mr. P. Mapsoukas, president of the Messinia society, the Annunciation community of the North Side, St. Constantine's community of the South Side, and the Russian and Armenian communities, all with their banners. They proceeded through Halsted, Madison, and State streets to the Coliseum.</p>
   <p>At four o'clock the meeting was opened and Mr. Mich. Tatrou, manager of the journal Patris, made the introductory speech. The Right Reverend Mr. Hopkins, an Episcopal Clergyman, pronounced the invocation, after which the floor was given to Miss Jane Addams, well known as one of the world's <pb facs="5422062_4_1119.jpg" n="3"/>intellectual women, who had promptly accepted the invitation to unite her voice with ours in protest.</p>
   <p>Miss Addams' speech, which was frequently interrupted by applause, will be published with other speeches in tomorrow's issue.</p>
   <p>Miss Anna McIntyre of the Red Cross, who recently returned from Asia Minor, and who has witnessed barbarities of the Turks, said:</p>
   <p>"We need not send a committee to investigate the truth of the accusations. The documents and affidavits about the massacres and the crimes of the Turks against the Christian population of Asia Minor are in the hands of the Government, and they are held without investigation for political reasons. There are the proofs, and only action and protest are needed to get results."</p>
   <p>Aldermen Apel and Lyle were present. The latter in particular inspired all with his Hellenic sentiments, and it was due to his action that a resolution was passed by the city council to send a memorial to President <pb facs="5422062_4_1120.jpg" n="4"/>Harding and the Senate about the inhuman and abominable atrocities of the Turks.</p>
   <p>Dr. Johnson, the pro-Hellenic president of the federation of churches in Chicago, who in a circular has urged that these atrocities be made known in all churches, spoke very ardently for the rights of Greeks.</p>
   <p>Professor Manousian, an Armenian, expressed the pain and sorrow which can be felt only by those who have learned by their own experience what Turks are. He described the Turkish atrocities in vivid colors, and criticized in caustic terms the attitude of the allies to the Armenian question.</p>
   <p>"They," said he, "have undertaken to solve the Armenian question, and they have solved it by allowing the Turks to exterminate the Armenians. Now they have decided to solve the Greek question and have strengthened the arm of Kemal so that he may exterminate the Greeks."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1121.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The speech of Professor Manousian made a deep impression and was enthusiastically applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Gjekas, the eminent Greek lawyer, who had worked very hard for the success of this gathering, thanked on behalf of the committee those persons who, though not Greeks, had made addresses, and after this Mr. Kotakis, manager of the Greek Daily, spoke, deeply stirring the emotions of the audience.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the meeting the following resolution was read, which was endorsed and sent by wire to President Harding, to Secretary of State Hughes, and to Mr. Lodge, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
   <p>Resolution</p>
   <p>Having gathered to-day, June 18, in a public meeting representing all religious denominations, we have resolved:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1122.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>(1) That we, 12,000 citizens of Chicago, do most emphatically protest against the Turkish atrocities;</p>
   <p>(2) That we are in accord with the decision of our Government to investigate these atrocities;</p>
   <p>(3) That we appeal to our President to take whatever action may be necessary to stop these atrocities and to save the remnants of these unfortunate peoples; and</p>
   <p>(4) That we express the hope that the President will so concern himself as to prevent the liberated Christians from going back under the Turkish yoke.</p>
   <p>Then, while the band played the Greek and American national hymns, this memorable gathering adjourned.</p>
