   <p>A ceremony dedicating the Liberal club was held with great impressiveness last Sunday afternoon in the presence of a large select group of people. Fathers Leon Pygeas and D. Hadzidimitriou officiated at the ceremony in honor of those who began the movement [anti-royalist movement in Greece]. The audience listened to the prayers for the leaders of Greece with interest and reverence. After the ceremony, Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos gave a speech concerning the movement in Thessaloniki, which "had taken the reins of government from the traitorous hands of the king, and led the country on the glorious path of its ancestors and effected the expansion of Greece to her former large boundaries."</p>
   <p>Mr. Kyriakopoulos was followed by Mr. N. Salopoulos, who gave an impromptu speech on various problems and conditions in Greece. By this speech he painted a picture of dark colors concerning the presence of the Germanophile (friend of Germans) in Athens, who has succeeded in killing 30,000 Greeks, <pb facs="5422062_4_1326.jpg" n="2"/>whose blood has not been shed to keep the "Tree of Liberty" alive, but to foster the worm-eaten tree of a Dynasty. Epiros and the Dodekanisa (12 islands) towns, which had been given to Greece by treaty, sent 10,000 Greeks to the Pontus where they were slaughtered by the savage troops of Kemal Pasha, and were prevented from entering the City of Constantinople. This slaughter was unnecessary as the troops were not sufficient in number to conquer Kemal, and the leaders knew it.</p>
   <p>After the speeches, refreshments were served, and so ended this quiet and patriotic gathering. The headquarters of this club, are getting to be the center of all the city's cultural and progressive activities.</p>
