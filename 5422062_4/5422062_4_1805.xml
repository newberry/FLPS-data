   <p>An audience of four hundred or more Ahepans and their friends had the distinctive privilege and pleasure to hear Miss Jane Addams lecture to them on the subject of "Some Social Results of the Depression." The lecture was sponsored by the Chicago Chapter 46. The announcement that such an internationally known figure was to speak to the members of Chapter 46 brought out many prominent members of our community. Although the famous Hull House is situated in the midst of the Greek Community of Chicago and although Miss Jane Addams fame is known by every Greek of Chicago, since most of them have received beneifts from this social settlement, and although there is hardly a Greek who has lived on the West Side of our city who has not seen and heard Miss Jane Addams speak many a time, still the mere mention that she is to speak is sufficient to bring in an overflow crowd to the lecture hall.</p>
   <p>........It was, indeed, a signal honor for Chicago Chapter 46 in having had the opportunity to act as her host.</p>
