   <p>p. 3- The victorious wars of 1912-1913 and the recent glorious struggles of our race sacrificed the lives of many heroes and caused rivers of blood to flow. They extended the boundaries of Greece, but at the same time they opened wounds in the bosoms of the families to which these heroes belonged, for most of them left behind them, besides the glory proper to those who have served their country, orphans or other dependents.</p>
   <p>Conscious of its heavy responsibility for those who have created its grandeur, the fatherland did not content itself with moral rewards to the families of these glorious heroes, to whom we bow our heads in reverence as do our liberated brothers, and as future generations will do hereafter, but it has tried and is now trying to afford them material relief according to the economic resources available.</p>
   <p>The duty foremost among its obligations was to take care of the minors who had been deprived of support, and to this end the Ministry of Welfare has provided orphanages and shelter-houses.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0417.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The maintenance of these institutions will be undertaken by the State. Now, however, because of economic difficulties through which the State is passing private contributions also are imperative for the realization of this great object of the Ministry of Welfare in order to meet the expense of the first settlement.</p>
   <p>In making an urgent appeal on behalf of the fatherland to the patriotic and philanthropic feelings of our compatriots, which they have already repeatedly and excellently displayed, we have great confidence that large sums will be collected to facilitate the success of this extraordinarily sacred and patriotic object.</p>
   <p>To this end we appeal to the executive councils, to the community committees, to organizations, and, specifically, to the individual initiative of every Greek to come forth and prove that he is above any partisan passion or interest. Send all contributions to the Minister of Public Welfare, Athens, Greece, or to the General Consulate.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0418.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Contributors must state their names and the place, in Greece, from which they come in order that their names may be published in the local papers of their native land. They may also state to which orphanage they prefer to have their contributions sent.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill., May 14, 1922.</p>
   <p>The Consul of Greece,</p>
   <p>P. Armyriotis.</p>
