   <p>Last Sunday afternoon the long-awaited benefit program was gievn to aid the work of the Greek Women's Philanthropic Society. The hall of St. Andrew's Church was entirely filled with the finest people of our community.Even before the program began, only standing room was left because the Greek women had spared neither time nor effort to sell tickets for this benefit entertainment.</p>
   <p>The artistic program began promptly at three o'clock. The program started with an introductory speech by the club's president, Mrs. M. Hatsos. Then Miss Virginia Petzing performed two aesthetic dances which betrayed her love for Greek culture. She was followed by the well-known Greek soprano, Miss Bertha Flaros, who sang three selections, accompanied on the piano by Catherine Varzos. Then a rising young pianist, Mr. Nick Sotiras, played the "Norwegian Dance" by Olson, and the "Hopak" by Rachmaninoff. Miss D. Argiris, a classical dancer, recited a famous epic poem, proving her versatility.</p>

   <p>The program continued until eight o'clock; but, of course, there were dancing and refreshments during the intermissions. Music was provided by Nick Varzos and his fine ensemble.</p>
