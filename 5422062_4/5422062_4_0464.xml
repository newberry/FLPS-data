   <p>Victims of the great war tragedy, of Bulgarian atrocities, and Turkish tyranny, our nationals of Macedonia and Asia Minor, starving and naked, invoke the aid of their Greek fellow-citizens everywhere.</p>
   <p>Because of the sufferings of these nationals of ours, after the publication of official reports in the Greek and American press, the members of the Greek Independent Political Club, working six years now by permission of the government, and having convened in a general meeting, decided to organize a grand ball for Saturday evening, February 2, in the ballroom of the North Side Turner Hall. The proceeds from this ball will be put at the disposal of the special committee to aid our suffering nationals.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Stamatios Pezas, Consul General of Greece, under whose <pb facs="5422062_4_0465.jpg" n="2"/>auspices and with whose approval this ball is taking place, stated that he and his entire family will be present. Two members of the Chicago Municipal Council will honor the occasion by their presence as well as other prominent political personages, members of the Independent Political Club.</p>
   <p>It is needless to suggest that our nationals should not fail to attend this ball, since the receipts are intended for such a sacred purpose.</p>
