   <p>In the Kathimerinin [Daily] of October 21, edited by my good friend, Spero Kotakis, there appeared an article which was written by one who titles himself "Contradictor". Truthfully, I must admit that my joy was very great in that my two articles published recently in the Greek Press had been considered sufficiently important to arouse the interest of Mr. "Contradictor" of the Daily, even though he considers the unification of our parishes possible only in Utopia.</p>
   <p>Mr. "Contradictor" asks that an outline of the details for this unification be published. So far we have not considered it necessary to include such an outline in articles appealing for a unified community. Besides that, we are certain that Mr. Kotakis is cognizant of all such plans because he is the representative of the St. Nicholas Parish; if he has not learned of them, it is because he has been too busy creating opposition to them.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1992.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If the plan did not succeed it was because he fought for opposing systems of unifying the Greek community; it was not because my plan was unworthy, but because Mr. Kotakis is just as he titles himself--a "contradictor" or opposer.</p>
   <p>We desire to believe, and shall allow nothing to alter this belief, that as soon as the importance and seriousness of the situation is realized by the Greek people of Chicago, egotistic and selfish interests will be overcome and unity will result. As Hellenes and Christians--who uphold the high ideals of nationality and religion, and who look upon our communities as national achievements--it is our duty to rise above personal prejudices and selfish desires and start to think in terms of general benefit. If the proposed plan is not considered ideal, I am certain that another can be formulated by means of an intelligent and unbiased discussion on the part of all who are interested. The main point is to unify and stabilize the Greek parishes of Chicago, regardless of whose plan is the best.</p>
   <p>As for the strength which Mr. "Contradictor" seeks in order to make this <pb facs="5422062_4_1993.jpg" n="3"/>unification possible, we say that it does not have to be sought from outside sources. It is unnecessary for any divine power to intercede for our community unification; we have the necessary prerequisites within ourselves--Helenic honor. If it has been lying dormant, it should be awakened to rekindle the Greek glory which once was ours. If, on the other hand, we desire to bury our Greek spirit so that it will not interfere with our personal successes, then we shall pass the rest of our lives in a semidead state; that is, as far as our communal growth is concerned. New generations will come and find nothing that will hold their interest and respect as far as their Greek heritage is concerned. There will be no more Greeks of America, and we shall be the ones responsible for that.</p>
   <p>It is an undeniable fact that the Greeks as individual immigrants have accomplished many things in all walks of life. As a national group, our accomplishments are practically nil. The examples set by other national groups are calmly overlooked, and we continue upon our way which can only be termed a <pb facs="5422062_4_1994.jpg" n="4"/>"dead-end" road.</p>
   <p>If, Mr. Kotakis, there is, as yet, no public awakening it is our duty to cry so loudly that even the deaf shall hear. This must be done, without egotism and without bias, if we as true Hellenes and Christians really have the interest of our people at hear. I wish to insist that the unification of the Greek community is not only necessary, but very possible--contrary to the firm opinion of Mr. "Contradictor".</p>
