   <p>The Valtetsiotaes Society, composed of natives of the historic Valtetsi held last Sunday their national celebration, at the country estate of Mr. Andrews.</p>
   <p>Not only Valtetsiotaes, but also many other Greeks took part in the celebration of the historic battle of Valtetsi. The battle of Valtetsi remains immortal to the Greeks the world over. Gretsis band played various marches and songs, stirring the patriotic sentiments of the crowd, while the smell of barbecue lamb (in the making) affected the olfactory organs. The dancing nymphs attired in graphic national costumes, aroused in all a spirit of hilarious joy and abandon. Indeed the Greeks know how to celebrate. They forget their business and worries, and in their celebrations stimulate the mind and body with appropriate nourishments. Music, speeches, dances, merriment, good eats, Bacchical respects, and pleasing things for the eye, beauty, constitute a Greek celebration. They know and practice, "variation is the soul of nature."</p>

   <p>Dr. Salopoulos, the orator of the day, in his brilliant Greek, described the immortal Polemarchs who fought bravely in the historic battle of Valtetsi, on whose soil nothing but bay-trees grow, in order to perpetuate the laurel-crowning of those immortal Polemarchs who are the rocks of heroism and patriotism.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was Mr. K. Tsapralis, a civil engineer and a former officer of the Greek army, who fought in the late wars of Greece against Turkey and Bulgaria Mr. D. Kallimachos, editor of New York's National Herald spoke next, immortalizing the warriors of Valtetsi.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrew J. Vlachos, Assistant States' Attorney of Cook County, a poet and dramatist vividly portrayed the historical event of 2,500 Greeks, at the battle of Valtetsi, slaughtering 7,000 Turks and capturing the remaining 5,000.</p>

   <p>Mr. Vlachos, who brought tears to the eyes of all, described the event with brief songs, which were sung by the 2,100 returning victorious Greeks from the battle of Valtetsi. (Four hundred Greeks lost their lives in the battle.)</p>
   <p>Eats, Music, dances and joviality followed the speeches. The celebration continued till a late hour.</p>
