   <p>p. 1.- The eleven Greek societies named their central organization in America the Panhellenic Union. By giving a names to an organization does not insure it against trouble, strife and jealousy. Many of the members say there is nothing but perfect harmony among themselves. Whether this is true or not, we cannot say. As our representative from Chicago entered the White House during the recent convention of the organization, he felt that this unison was a great and marvelous thing. Now he is not so sure.</p>
   <p>Those who previously laughed at the organizers are being laughed at now by others. And so the story goes. We sincerely hope the Panhellenic Union will be a great success, but we thing it will be short-lived, if the officers do nothing but pass the tray for contributions.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1417.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The purpose and ideals of this organization are praiseworthy but we beg the officers and members to refrain from getting heated up over mere trifles and pull together for this glorious goal.</p>
