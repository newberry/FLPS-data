   <p>Dedication of the largest Greek Orthodox church in America will take place in Chicago tomorrow with elaborate ceremonies, participated in by the primate of the church in America, thirty other bishops and priests from the middle west and thousands of visitors here for the twelfth annual convention of the Order of Ahepa, Greek educational and cultural organization.</p>
   <p>The church to be consecrated is St. Demetrios and is located at Winona and California Avenues. The service will start at 11 A.M. Presiding will be the Rt. Rev. Callistos, bishop of Chicago, with the consecration ceremonies in charge of Archbishop Athenagoras of Astoria, N. Y., primate of the Greek Orthodox church in America.</p>
   <p>Elaborate Procession Planned <pb facs="5422062_4_1964.jpg" n="2"/>Preceding the dedication will be an elaborate procession, participated in by church dignitaries, including many priests from surrounding cities and Episcopal leaders from a distance, and witnessed by a thousand of delegates to the Ahepa convention. The dedication of the church is heralded as one of the outstanding events in connection with the assemblage of Greeks here.</p>
   <p>High officials of the Order of Ahepa, in full uniform, will participate in the consecration. Ceremonies will be colorful and replete with the ancient symbolism of the Greek Church.</p>
   <p>The church, which is expected to be the center of national Greek events of a religious nature for a generation to come, is named for Demetrios, the "Soldier-Saint" of the Greek Orthodox faith.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1965.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Story of Saint Demetrios</p>
   <p>Arthur H. Peponis, supreme governor of the Order of Ahepa, today told the story of St. Demetrios.</p>
   <p>"There is an age-old tradition of the Greeks that during the time of the Byzantine Empire," he said, "St. Demetrios was always to be seen, transfigured in the sky, in advance of Grecian troops.</p>
   <p>"He is usually portrayed upon a fiery horse of red, with a gleaming gold spear, mounted with a cross.</p>
   <p>"For centuries he has been enshrined in the hearts of the devout Greeks as a symbol of their ancient greatness."</p>
