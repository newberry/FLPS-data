   <p>Last Wednesday night the dance given by the Koimisis Tis Theotokou Church took place in Guyon's Paradise Ballroom. This large West Side parish chose this way of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the building of its church.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the dance are for the fund being raised to pay for the erection of a new and beautiful cathedral. This new church is being designed by a famous Greek architect and will doubtless, be one of the most beautiful Greek churches in this section of the country.</p>
   <p>A picture of the architect's conception of the proposed building was printed in the previous issue of this paper. The committee which fostered this dance certainly used many clever devices.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1972.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among other things it published a souvenir booklet showing the progress of the community and other things of interest and appeal. Naturally a large amount of money was received from the sale of copies of this booklet...........</p>
   <p>During the dance intermissions Mr. Desfis sang a few numbers and the ecclesiastical choir of the Church sang various demotic and patriotic numbers.......</p>
   <p>A raffle .... was held and many won valuable prizes.</p>
   <p>..... Various speeches were made, setting forth the development of the community and outlining plans for its future growth and success.</p>
   <p>The organization of a fine parish school, to be located in the new church, was said to be planned.</p>
