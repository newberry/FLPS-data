   <p>P. 2 - Last Thursday more than three hundred members of the Pan-Hellenic Association and their families held a grand picnic, at which dancing, singing, dining and wining, were indulged in with distinguished moderation. The affair was so marvelously well conducted that an impartial observer would have thought that all this crowd belonged to one family. Their return to the city was also distinguished by correct behavior. Decorum, order, beauty, and harmony were displayed by men, women, and children in their parade through the downtown district.</p>
   <p>Their example should be copied by other associations and groups which in their hilarity forget that the city is inhabited by other people besides themselves. Such parades are satisfying to the mind, pleasant to the eye, and a credit to the associations and to us all.</p>
