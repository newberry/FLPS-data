  <body>
   <p>On the occasion of the Greek Women's Philanthropic Association's dance, which was held a month ago for the benefit of Greek charities, invitations were sent to many prominent Americans in civic and professional life. Among them was Dr. Casimir Wolpers, a well-known dentist in the Greek quarter, whose office is located at the corner of Halsted and Adams Streets. Dr. Wolpers sent a letter and a check for ten dollars to Mrs. P. S. Lambrou, expressing his regret that he was unable to attend the Association's dance. In his letter he praised the Greek women for their initiative and requested them to accept his donation toward their charitable cause.</p>
   <p>The Greek Women's Philanthropic Association thanked all those who supported their annual benefit dance and assured them of its continued efforts to serve the Community faithfully.</p>
