   <p>p. 1.- Because it is customary among newspapermen, especially new ones, to devote their first page to our great problem concerning Hellenism in America, writing long articles how we are losing our nationality and becoming Americans, let me state that, if this were true, we would not have the need of another newspaper. We have foreseen the demand of this newspaper in Chicago and we are supplying the Greeks with it.</p>
   <p>We pledge ourselves to write the truth about Hellenism in America, to write that we are not below but above the river's edge.</p>
   <p>Journalists write that the Greeks cannot easily assimilate the principles of American citizenship. They write that Greeks are not satisfied here. They want to return to their native land. These statements are false.</p>
   <p>Our Greeks in America need not be told what to do. First of all, they easily adjust themselves to their new environment. Secondly, they learn <pb facs="5422062_4_1060.jpg" n="2"/>the laws and regulations of this country, and thirdly, they decide on their chosen profession and go about their business.</p>
   <p>We must give the Greeks credit for this brave venture of theirs. Without friends, without relatives, they have come into a strange land. The Greek, patriotic, poor, illiterate, has come to make a future for himself and his family.</p>
   <p>If, from the beginning, we Greeks had come together, helping one another as best we could, our progress in this foreign land would have been much more rapid. Yet we have not started too late. "Where there is union, there is strength," applies also to the Greeks.</p>
   <p>Some say the Greeks in America have drawn away from their mother country and have lost interest in her. If this were true, why are they all eager <pb facs="5422062_4_1061.jpg" n="3"/>to lay hands on a Greek newspaper? Why do they read it word for word, from cover to cover? That is why we are publishing this Greek newspaper about Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>Every newspaper has two purposes for existing. The first is the financial gain. That can be found in subscriptions and the second is to give to its readers the current news and ideas of the day.</p>
   <p>This places the newspaper in an embarrassing position. In order to maintain and add to the subscriptions, every one must be pleased and all human nature is not governed by the same principles. Care must be taken that a party or faction will not feel offended at anything, no matter how trivial. But sometimes something must be forsaken. The truth will have to be camouflaged a little in order to retain subscriptions, because the financial side of a newspaper is equally as <pb facs="5422062_4_1062.jpg" n="4"/>important as the truthful side. A successful paper is one that can take care of the two purposes adequately.</p>
   <p>We want it to be known to our readers here that our paper is going to deal with news of interest to Hellenism in America. We are going to be truthful and unbiased in our opinions. We are going to explain what is going on in the world around us, so that the Greeks can broaden their vision and outlook on life in this foreign land.</p>
   <p>Maybe we will be sorry some day for all that we have said in this column. That is a chance that we, and our readers, must take.</p>
