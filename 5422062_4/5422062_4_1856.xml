   <p>As much as I knew about the benevolent order of Ahepa and the great work it performs among our people, I never for a moment dreamed of its magnitude, when leaving for the Boston Convention with my friends George Gatsis, and George Neros, the coming heavy-weight prize-fighter.</p>
   <p>Traveling at a high rate of speed in Mr. Gatsis' automobile, we hardly paid any attention to the variety of scenery, along the beautiful roads of the eastern states. Our minds and our hearts were focused on the Convention in Boston, where the elite of the Greek-American commonwealth were to meet and discuss ways and means for the betterment of the Order, and the uplifting of every Greek in the United States.</p>
   <p>The first impression that one receives, when the roll call of the delegates is called, is something like that of a parliament at the opening of a new session. The same solemnity, the same grandeur, and the same seriousness that accompanies the opening <pb facs="5422062_4_1857.jpg" n="2"/>of a parliamentary session was noticed in the proceedings during the first day of the convention.</p>
   <p>The order that prevailed during the entire week of the Convention could well serve as an example for many parliaments of the world. The chairman of the Convention, as well as the committees that were appointed to draft resolutions and present their findings, were acting as past masters of parliamentary rules. It was indeed inspiring to be present to consult and deliberate with a body of people of the caliber of the delegates to the Ahepa Convention.</p>
   <p>Only in Greece proper could any one witness such a display of Greek strength, vitality, and genius. And only the Ahepa could muster such an array of talent that proved itself to be truly a revelation to the official Americans, who had the opportunity to judge and appreciate the progress made by the Greeks of America in the short period of twenty-five years.</p>
   <p>There were, as is natural, many disappointments, but all cannot be pleased and satisfied by the proceedings of any deliberative and elective body. Many are called and few are chosen. The best, as a rule, generally win and the fittest <pb facs="5422062_4_1858.jpg" n="3"/>survive. Many were there who sought to climb the ladder of officialdom and reach the pinnacle. Others were seeking to be the lesser lights of the ruling element in the Order, but notwithstanding all the friction that is a necessary commitant to every elective body in its final deliberations. The delegates exerted themselves to elect as officers for the ensuing year men, who have proved themselves to be able leaders and capable men.</p>
   <p>The order of Ahepa serves as a forum for those who have a message to deliver. The delegates are there to listen and to judge, and when the time is at hand for the nomination of candidates for office, only the best are considered, and out of the best group, the elite is chosen to guide the destinies of the Order. The method of electing the officials is as democratic as can be desired, and when all is said and done, the outcome of the election of the high officers of the Order is always pleasing and highly satisfying.</p>
   <p>What the order of Ahepa has done towards the enrichment of the life of the Greeks of America, is common knowledge to every Ahepan and non-Ahepan. It has fostered <pb facs="5422062_4_1859.jpg" n="4"/>good citizenship, and it has exerted such an influence upon the conduct of its members, as to be accepted and recognized as of equal value to the education received in the country's schools.</p>
   <p>The very act alone of gathering together 30,000 Greeks, whose hearts--in the most vexing problems--beat as one, is an accomplishment of the highest magnitude. The results of this grouping together are beginning to be felt by the entire Greek element of America. The Greeks all look to Ahepa for guidance and begin to recognize its high mission in the destiny of the Greeks. Out of such power and unity will spring lasting edifices to be used as halls of learning and progress for the sons of the Greeks of America. The order of Ahepa is centering all its efforts to establish such institutions that will be of credit to the Greek spirit of America, and a credit to the land that gave us birth.</p>
   <p>In this great and noble work, the Order seeks the cooperation of every blossoming Greek soul in the land of Jefferson, Webster, and Emerson. Strong as the Ahepa has become, it still seeks to enroll within its folds the hundreds of thousands of <pb facs="5422062_4_1860.jpg" n="5"/>the Greeks of America; for it believes that only through a powerful union can the soul of the Greeks of America survive the vicissitudes of social evolution. To visualize the great day, when the host of the Greeks of America will marshall its great number to the attainment of a complete and solid union, is a consummation to be fervently desired. Let us exert all our efforts for the accomplishment of this gigantic task, which will stand out as an achievement in the annals of Hellenism.</p>
