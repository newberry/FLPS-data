   <p>Immediately upon receipt of the first news of the Corinthian earthquake, the Executive Committee of the American Friends of Greece, Inc., authorized the Near East Relief to transmit to Greece $1,000. of the funds of the organization, to be used in whatever manner that was most desirable under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>An appeal was sent out over the signatures of the officers and members of the Executive Committee of the American Friends of Greece, and the Relief for Fatherless Children of Greece, detailing the need and asking for prompt assistance. Up to the present $4,176. has been received, of which $4,000. has been wired to the Greek Red Cross. The total amount transferred to date is $5,000. leaving a balance on hand of $176. to be included in future remittances with such other donations as may be received later.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0306.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The complete list of contributors contains the names of many well-known American Philhellenes who have been consistent supporters of Greece during the difficulties in recent years.</p>
   <p>The Greek Minister in Washington, His Excellency, Ch. Simopoulos, has written a letter to the Committee expressing his appreciation of its efforts and asking that his warm thanks be conveyed to the individual contributors.</p>
