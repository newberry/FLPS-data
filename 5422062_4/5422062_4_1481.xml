   <p>The Tripolitan Club, Theodore Kolokotronis, had a double success last Sunday. The long-heralded service which was held in the Holy Trinity church on Sunday morning was, in reality, a national celebration. It seems that the Tripolitan's idea of honoring Greek national independence by means of a religious ceremony, was so favorably received by the Greek community, that the church was filled to overflowing. The doxology was chanted by Bishop Callistos, who was ably supported by the Byzantine choir and cantors.</p>
   <p>The program began as soon as the regular service was finished. Bishop Callistos, John Dritsas and A. Vlahos gave patriotic speeches.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlahos related the heroism of the Kolokotronis family during the <pb facs="5422062_4_1482.jpg" n="2"/>fight for Greek liberty. He....enthused his audience by describing the gallantry and bravery of all the Tripolitans during that period.</p>
   <p>Many who could not attend the morning services, were present at the big dance held in the evening, at the beautiful ballroom of the Amalgamated Center. A buffet supper and dancing were the order of the evening. During the evening, prizes were given to the ladies who led the Greek circle dance best. The affair was a tremendous success.</p>
