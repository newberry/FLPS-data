   <p>Last Sunday the excellent and most influential Phoenix Society held its annual election of officers in an atmosphere of concord, harmony, and mutual co-operation. With a very few changes the board of officers is the same as last year's. All of us acknowledge the excellent work of the leaders who have bent all efforts to cut expenditures and support many worthy community and patriotic causes. They, as well as the members, were mainly responsible for many public improvements in the Greek quarter. Our church and school institutions have had the good fortune to receive the wholehearted support of these progressive and social-minded men.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nicholas Kyriakopoulos, a prominent attorney in the Federal courts, was elected president by a unanimous vote; John D. Voumbakis, vice-president; Starros Katevanides, secretary general; and Epaminandos Petropoulos, treasurer. Messrs. James Petrothanasopoulos, Elia Kaloulis, A. Lymperopoulos were elected chairmen of various committees.</p>
