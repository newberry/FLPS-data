   <p>p. 3- Shame and double shame have been inflicted upon all respectable families and upon society by those involved in the following episode.</p>
   <p>Gustavos Gioroukos, aged 27, married a girl named Elizabeth, aged 23, in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. However, they did not get along well. An evil influence invaded their happiness, and this evil influence was none other than Gioroukos's own brother. Husband and wife, therefore, decided to separate to try to find happiness alone. They came to an agreement, that in order to avoid legal procedure, they would separate voluntarily, and this agreement was adhered to by both. After the lapse of some time the husband was informed that his wife was living illicitly with his younger brother Demetrios at 748 Cornelia Avenue, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Without losing any time Gustavos bought a ticket and came to Chicago. Upon his arrival, he visited the couple's retreat and ordered his brother <pb facs="5422062_4_0643.jpg" n="2"/>to withdraw from the apartment and let his wife alone. Demetrios refused, and Gustavos went to the police station and swore out a warrant against his brother for living illegally with his wife. Demetrios was arrested and imprisoned but released upon bond. He returned to his apartment and with a revolver in his hand ordered Gustavos to leave. He also obtained a warrant for the arrest of his brother, Gustavos, on the ground that he was living illegally with his wife. Gustavos was released and again had his brother arrested, who is now behind the bars waiting for the court to bring about a solution.</p>
   <p>If the above episode is true, as it appears to be, since it is so recorded in the American newspapers, any one can imagine the reflection which it casts upon our race.</p>
