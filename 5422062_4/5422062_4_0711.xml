   <p>p. 3- The Star, has often cautioned its fellow Greeks not to carry large sums of money on their persons and to avoid dark streets of dubious reputation. That this advice has been disregarded is shown by what happened to one of our compatriots according to the Chicago Chronicle.</p>
   <p>"A Greek named Thomas Kostopoulos, twenty four years old, a fruitpeddler, fell into the hands of robbers at Ashland Boulevard and Warren Avenue. The leader of the group slugged the victim with the butt of his gun. The bandits took his watch, $345, in currency and $10, in silver. In departing the highwaymen riddled with bullets the victim's hat which was lying on the sidewalk."</p>
   <p>It is the duty of this newspaper to din into the ears of its fellow Greeks the danger demonstrated by the report of this heinous crime and to warn them again as it has done many times before not to carry and by all means not to display a roll of money, which some of us are apt to do when we are afflicted with a spell of swaggering and swashbuckling. Money should be kept in the bank and not in pants-pockets.</p>
