   <p>At a recent meeting of the splendid Greek Panhellenic Club of Chicago, it was decided that the members discontinue paying the monthly dues of twenty-five cents, which were to go into the treasury of a certain Greek company known as the "Hellenism Company". As a result, Mr. S. Georgiadis, the president of the club, has resigned his position because he did not approve of this action. Many of the members appealed to Mr. Georgiadis to withdraw his resignation, but their request was not heeded. So, the members of the club will have to elect a new chairman very soon.</p>
   <p>It is well known that Mr. Georgiadis was the founder of the Greek Panhellenic Club, as well as its first president. He has done outstanding work in formulating the club's objectives and in furthering the general welfare of the members.</p>
