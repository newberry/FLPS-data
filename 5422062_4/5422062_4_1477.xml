   <p>The Morrison Hotel was the scene of the Greek Independence Day Celebration on March 25. It was a gathering of both political and national significance. It was sponsored by the Greek-American Democratic party under the leadership of Michael Krokidas.</p>
   <p>It was estimated that more than two thousand people attended this affair. The first part of the evening was devoted to dancing to the music of Eddie Varzos. Other artists contributed their services in the pause between dances.....Mr. and Mrs. Minas Booras, known to every Greek in Chicago, sang the gay and well-loved songs of Athens.</p>
   <p>As soon as the Mayor made his appearance the patriotic program began. Z. Ritsos was the master of ceremonies. The panegyric of the day was delivered by Mr. Constantine Mammon Paleologos. He was followed by Mr. Krokidas; and, finally, the Mayor of Chicago was given the floor.....He congratulated the <pb facs="5422062_4_1478.jpg" n="2"/>Greek people for....maintaining love for their natal country and retaining their democratic inheritance.</p>
