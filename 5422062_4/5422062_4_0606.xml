   <p>As a protest against the sufferings of their people in Asia Minor forty-seven representative Chicago Greeks pledged to adopt fifty unseen orphans from their native land at a dinner at the Hamilton Club last night. Rufus C. Dawes acted as chairman of the meeting and in an introductory address paid tribute to Greece both for its ancient glory and for its conduct in the recent war.</p>
   <p>Other speakers told of the need and suffering among widows and orphans in Asia Minor, whose condition, they stated, is an appeal to the generosity of Americans.</p>
   <p>America, the speakers asserted, is the only country able to go into Asia Minor at present without an armed force.</p>

   <p>Peter S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star, organized the assembled Greeks into a committee to gain the support of the 30,000 Greeks in Chicago for an organized effort to send relief to their own people. This relief project would be conducted by an auxiliary committee working under the Committee for Near East Relief.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers at the dinner were Wyllys W. Baird, Chicago chairman of the Near East Relief, Professor J. J. Manis, former instructor in the Christian college at Marsovan, C. F. Jacman, Stylianos S. Vaphrides, former professor in the American college in Smyrna, Mr. Lambros, the Reverend Father Mendelaris, and Miss Harriet Vittum.</p>
