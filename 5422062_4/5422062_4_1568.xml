   <p>p. 2.- Yesterday was a day of rejoicing wherever Hellenism prevailed. Every corner of Greece and every Greek not in his native land was filled with pride on this great day. As the years go by, the twenty-fifth of March will mean more and more to our country-men.</p>
   <p>The conquerors of Greece tried, for four hundred years, to kill the pride and the glory of Greece, but they failed. The Greek spirit enabled us to throw off the tyrannical yoke and become free men again. We are joyous today because of the glorious deeds of our ancestors in their fight for liberty.</p>
   <p>Their battle cry was "Liberty or death." With this faith they fought seven whole years till they gained their freedom. When we think of these brave people, how can we help being proud that we are Greeks?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1569.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Greeks of today don't have to fight for freedom. We must fight for Greek ideals, traditions, glories, and to preserve the Greek tongue. We must observe our religious holidays and celebrate as true Greeks should.</p>
   <p>During these days the hearts of all Greeks are beating valiantly with the spirit of our forefathers. Let us not stop now, let us keep on!</p>
