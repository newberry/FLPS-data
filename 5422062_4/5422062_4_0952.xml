   <p>To all the Greeks of America and the world over, I appeal that they should learn and speak the Greek language, besides the English language of our adopted country, America. The knowledge of the Greek tongue will raise the speaker to a higher level of culture. The Greek language is the mother language of present civilization, it is the cardinal stone of culture, letters, dramma, the fine arts, and all that contributes to present enlightment.</p>
   <p>The Gospel is written by the Apostles in the Greek tongue. Why? Because it was the only language through which the profound thoughts of the Fathers of Christianity could be known. No other language could depict the infinite grandeur of divinity, no other language could convey the sublime and subtle relations of the Diety. The Greek tongue is the connecting link of the Infinite with the finite. That is why the disciples, apostles, and the Fathers of Christendom preferred the Greek language.</p>
   <p>The learning and speaking of the Greek language would be an asset to the present generation, and the generations to come. Every father and mother of Greek extraction is urged to teach their children the Greek language.</p>
