   <p>The touching appeal of Mr. Doxiades for the refugee orphans encourages us to remind not only the Greeks within Greece, but also the Greeks that are found living in America, England, France, Egypt and Africa, who helped us support these unfortunate children last year, to help us do the same this year.</p>
   <p>Just stop and think that winter is approaching and most of the refugees are still unemployed, while many of them who had never worked a day in their life, have learned to work in order to live.</p>
   <p>Our nation is not self-sufficient, and these unfortunates have been added, with whom we must share our daily bread. It has cost us plenty so far to relieve and support our brothers, who are found to be in distress. We request those who are charitable to be merciful to these people.</p>
   <p>The national establishment will be very glad to distribute whatever is sent by the Greeks of the foreign nations. The old place will be glad to see <pb facs="5422062_4_0379.jpg" n="2"/>its store-rooms filled again with cotton, so that the refugee laborers may go to work and make quilts and blankets. The cold weather is coming and you cannot hide hunger; those are the things that torment and have tormented the soul of Plastiras.</p>
   <p>Those of you who are decent Greeks, try to follow the Americans who have not failed us in the past and will not fail us in the future.</p>
