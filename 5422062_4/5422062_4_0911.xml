   <p>As I entered the Willoughby Tower building, I cast a glance at the directory board and saw the Greek name Antonopoulos as it is, in Latin characters, not mutilated. That gave me a pleasant impression of the logic and true sense of the owner of the name. He did not do what others do who mutilate their names, a fact which, reflected in my mind, made me draw this conclusion: that future historians will find themselves in the dark regarding the descent of the prominent Greek-Americans on account of the changing of their names.</p>
   <p>When I had ascended to the office of Dr. Christ Antonopoulos, equipped with the most up-to-date mechanical instruments of dentistry.....and had stated the purpose of my visit, he, although busy, politely welcomed me and said:</p>
   <p>"I have read in the Chicago Greek Daily the fine opinions of our fellow-countrymen and was very much pleased with the constructive material in it. The environment is immense, and the activities multifarious! But each one of us must apply himself to that particular line to which he belongs; ..... in other words, he must abstain from interfering in spheres of activity <pb facs="5422062_4_0912.jpg" n="2"/>other than his own, calling hinself Allwise.</p>
   <p>"Yes, If everyone devotes his time with sublime zeal to his work, cooperating with his fellows sincerely in their various occupations, I can assure you that the Greek-America will accomplish great things most affectively!</p>
   <p>"As a dentist self-advertised I do not want to say anything for my profession. But I want to say something which relates to my profession, and I hope that it will be of use. That is: 'To be healthy is best,' and 'A sound mind lives in a healthy body.' That is what those giants, the founders of the present civilization,used to say twenty-five centuries ago, our ancient ancestors.</p>
   <p>....."Well, you publishers, proclaim this through the press. It is the foundation of all progress and of every ideal principle! .... I repeat, divulge this through the press - avoid polluted quarters and crowded hovels where the mankilling microbe of asphyxiating air has made its nest!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0913.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>..."Concerning the Greeks of the new generation and the Greek language? This question does not require much philosophy for its answer. It depends on the mature living generation. If it rears Greek youth as is becoming to Greeks, saturating their souls with the springs of the Greek tongue, then for this wonderful and humanizing task this parent vanguard generation shall be honored everlastingly and brilliantly! Or else their work - of Greek substance - will be swept by storms and typhoons ... and the whole thing will be transformed into an unrecognizable mass, where weeds will grow and dust will lie."</p>
   <p>Christ Antonopoulos, from Pelasso of Pylea in Messinia, is very well trained in Greek culture and has studied the English language assiduously. He graduated from an American college, having studied electro-mechanics for two years. His ambition changed, however, and he took the course of dentistry at the University of Chicago for four years, graduating with honors.</p>
