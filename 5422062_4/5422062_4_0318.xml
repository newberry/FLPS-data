   <p>The much publicized masquerade festival of the Nea Genea took place last Monday at the Trianon Ball Room and, as usual, it was a big success. Owing to the organized efforts of Miss Helen Komianou, president of the society, and the executive committee, the affair exceeded all expectations. The Greek colony of Chicago displayed all its willingness to cooperate in the dance of the young girls. It will remain unforgettable with those thousands who participated. Ticket receipts showed 7,000 people paid admission.</p>
   <p>The young girls always spring surprises in their social events, but this time it was "Unique" and their cunning maneuvering made the crowds stand expectantly. The girls in melodious voices sang the hymn of Nea Genea, composed by attorney Andrew Vlachos poet and dramatist, to the delight of the jammed crowd, electrified by their singing.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0319.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Twenty awards were given to the best masqueraders who were able to attract attention, laughter, and applause from the crowds. The names of the executive board who worked so hard to make the event a magnificent success are as follows:</p>
   <p>Miss Evagelia Metou, Honorary President</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Komianou, President</p>
   <p>Miss Tasia Tsamis, Vice President.</p>
   <p>Miss Constantina Soulantzee, Secretary</p>
   <p>Miss Nicoleta Delberakis, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Proceeds of the dance go to the fund that takes care of poor and needy Greek families in Chicago. The board and all the members of Nea Genea are congratulated for their self-denial in making the ball a huge success. Plenty of money was raised to continue their philanthropic work. The Greek community sincerely appreciates the noble work of the girls of the new generation.</p>
