   <p>Excellent and brilliant services were extended to the career of St. Constantine Church, by the societies of Greek ladies who are composed of the best, noble, and most religious elements of our community ladies. Their cardinal stone and fundamental aim is philanthropy. They appear and function and do service, to everything that tends to the needs of the Chicago Greeks. For charitable, religious educational and national purposes, the societies of the Greek ladies were, and are, shining everywhere in the horizon.</p>
   <p>The Society of "New Generation"was formed at the beginning of 1922 and flourished like a flower in the spring. The zeal, enthusiasm and devotion of those noble ladies, became the by-word of the Greeks. Shining stars of this Society were Miss Evagelia Metou, Panagiota Roumpa, Stavroula Flouda, Helen Komninos, and later, Miss Hariklia Mitsoula and Polytimi Mazarakos.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0151.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>None of our community will forget the dance banquets given at the Trianon, sponsored by the "New Generation" for the purposes above mentioned.</p>
   <p>When the cornerstone of the church was laid, the society turned over to the church authorities the sum of $6,151. Later, the same society, turned over $17,782 for poor and needy families, for the Church and School.</p>
   <p>But they did not stop their activities of mercy with the institutions of their community, money was raised also for the Greek School, "Socrates", and for needy students of Manna's Sanatorium in the old country.</p>
   <p>The Society of "St. Helen" differs from its sister society on one point. Instead of the poor and needy coming to knock at the door of the society, "St. Helen Society" goes and knock at the door of the poor, the needy, the sick, and on the doors of the churches and schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0152.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At the laying of the cornerstone of the church, this society turned over $2,000 to the church authorities. The sum of $5,000 was given by the society for the purchase of the church's seats. The society of "St. Helen", stands ready and willing to act in any need of the Church, School, and needy and sick families.</p>
   <p>It is an honor for us to print the names of the initiators of this society, who are guided and directed by the Rev. Mark E. Petrakis. Olga Marinakis, Helen Ioannou, Phani Tzatha, Elisabeth Haloulis, Catherine Stamos, Panagiota Stamos, Panagiota Karanastasis, Maria Kontonicolaou, Politimi Georgopoulos, Euthihi Galanos, Basiliki Koutsouli, Soteria Anagnostopoulos, Katherine Bouzanis, Demetra Stathopoulos, Avrocome Rakintzis, Paraskevi Kyriacopoulos, Athanasia Kougioufa, Demetra Kaltaas, Alexandra Nicolaou, Styliani Petrakis, Penelope Kalimeris, Despina Varveris, Helen Lymberopoulos, Angelika Karantzas, Merope Papadopoulos, Smaro Kambosou, Maria Drousia, Thalia Tzovani, Kalliroe Theodorou, Athena Pitas, Maria Kouvalis, Maria Antonopoules, Augeri Kotsoni, and Angeline Hronis.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0153.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This Society of St. Helen, under the auspices of God and its Patron Saint, was honored by the presidency of the following noble ladies, Styliani Petrakis, Georgia Chrisos, Basiliki Koutsoulis, Ifigenian Kopadis, Phani Tzathas, Zaharia Papadopoulos, and again Styliani Petrakis. The title of these ladies is known among the Greeks, as "Sisters of Mercy."</p>
   <p>The Greek Community of St. Constantine's Church, hopes and wishes, the perpetuation of these two societies. It is said that the longevity of these societies, is attributed to the fact, that they are under the immediate supervision of the Church. The societies are worthy of assistance, for, besides their other benevolent duties, they perpetuate the Faith of the Orthodox Church, and immoratalize the Greek Language.</p>
   <p>The Society of Mothers, which was based upon American ideas, was formed under the supervision of the Priest's wife, Styliani Petrakis, for the sole purpose advising and aiding the School. The welfare, guidance, activities and government of the above said societies always rested in the hands of the priest's <pb facs="5422062_4_0154.jpg" n="5"/>wife, who was, and is, the forerunner of charity and mercy.</p>
   <p>The community prays for the noble souls of the members of these societies, and invokes God to keep them united in their duty of mercy.</p>
