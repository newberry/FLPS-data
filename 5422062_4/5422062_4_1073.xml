   <p>P.1--As I have said in other articles, it is my religious and patriotic duty as a representative of the Church to convey to you my thoughts and convictions in regard to religion and country and our duty to them. And since I am convinced that the press is the best medium for my purpose, I herewith write this article, hoping that it will reach not only the Greeks of Chicago but also those who live elsewhere.</p>
   <p>One of the fundamental and sacred duties of man is his duty to his country. Faith and education, enlightenment and progress, although powerful themselves, depend upon the country for their existence, their nurture, and their fruition. And our patriotism should not be manifested only when we take our guns in hand to defend our country against her enemies; it should be displayed also in time of peace when and where the welfare and <pb facs="5422062_4_1074.jpg" n="2"/>progress of the nation is concerned. That is, every citizen, of whatever station in life and of whatever vocation has a duty to perform on behalf of the progress and the financial prosperity of the country. When a country as a whole is prosperous, prosperity also manifests itself among its citizens.</p>
   <p>The surest way for a country to be prosperous, in fact, the only way to become prosperous, in our present stage of evolution, is to acquire money, a fact which compelled that great patriot, the greatest orator of Athens, to exclaim, "Dei, dei chremation," which means that money is a necessity, without which nothing can be done. With money we build magnificent churches in which the spirit and the soul of the Christian are exalted to God. With money we build schools, academies, and gymnasiums in which the citizen develops his mind and his body for tasks of all kinds, mental and physical. With money we build navies and armies which are the safest guarantees that the country will be formidable to her enemies and respected by her neighbors.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1075.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And how shall the country get the money needed to accomplish the things above mentioned? Not from aliens, indeed, nor from enemies, but from her sons, within and without her domain; that means that it is the duty of every Greek to work, according to his physical and mental ability, and to acquire money; but the means employed to gain wealth should always be those which are sanctioned by ethics and by the Christian faith. Money is the sinews of enterprise; money boils the pot and makes the mare go; yet money should be not the master but the servant. It should not dominate our desires but should supply all our lawful and just needs.</p>
   <p>It is further the duty of the Greek, after he acquires money, to confine its circulation among Greeks as much as possible. "Greeks for Greeks!" This motto is supported not only by a natural law but by a social law as well.</p>
   <p>The idea in "Greeks for Greeks" might be realized by the following method. When a Greek needs clothing, let him deal with a Greek merchant; when he needs food, let him deal with a Greek who sells it, even if he has to go out of his way to procure the merchandise, and so on down the line for everything that we need. By doing this, he will let his money pass through <pb facs="5422062_4_1076.jpg" n="4"/>Greek hands, thus augmenting Greek business and making its influence felt everywhere. The Greek is racially bound to deal with Greeks even though he pays slightly more. On the other hand it is the sacred duty of Greek merchants to be sound, honest, and reasonable in their transactions.</p>
   <p>Money is not, as we say, the root of all evil; the lack of it is the root of all evil. Money is our own creation, to facilitate barter and exchange. Money, like everything else under the sun, is a blessing if we use it wisely. And when money circulates in Greek hands, it creates power for Greeks in our native land. Greek capitalists and Greek captains of industry living abroad have financed the arming of Greece to defend Greek populations and territories against the unspeakable Turk and against the rapacity of the Bulgarian beast. Greeks the world over, with the exception of American Greeks, have put this motto into practice, "Greeks for Greeks," for this is their duty to their native land and to their faith. The welfare of a Greek community in any part of the world demands "Greeks for Greeks."</p>
   <p>I wish to make it clear to you and to all concerned that my urgent advocacy <pb facs="5422062_4_1077.jpg" n="5"/>of "Greeks for Greeks" does not conflict with the fundamental national principles of America or of any other country but on the contrary sustains the universal equilibrium of money, which if it is allowed to fall into the hands of a few will automatically become a tyrant instead of a servant, a curse instead of a blessing. This idea of "Greeks for Greeks" should be applied where money is involved by other races also, by Americans, French, English, Germans, and so forth, since following this course they will not permit money and its power to fall into the hands of a few, Greeks, Jews, Americans, or others, but will keep in the hands of all races and all nations which put into practice the theory of "Greeks for Greeks."</p>
   <p>Right here in our adopted country, which will be the native country of our next generation, this motto, "Greeks for Greeks," is perfectly sound, and it could not be objected to by any reasonable and honest person. You are upheld by natural law and by social law when you deal with your own kind. By nature and by the laws of this country you are free to choose whom you will patronize. That you are American in body and soul, though derived of Greek ancestry, does not prevent your dealing with American Greeks who also are <pb facs="5422062_4_1078.jpg" n="6"/>part of this great country. You have the right and the privilege to deal with any one whom you choose to deal with. But Missourians prefer, and they are right and just to do so, to deal with Missourians. And if Chicagoans prefer to deal with Californians rather than with Chicagoans, they will soon discover that Chicago's industry and commerce is going on the rocks, and that will affect the prosperity and the welfare of the whole city. "Greeks for Greeks" stands up against all the arguments of logic because it is based upon truth and justice. No money-barons and no string-pulling could endure if "Greeks for Greeks" were applied everywhere in the world. And so money rightly and justly acquired and wisely used is a blessing, not a curse as some of us have unwisely been taught to believe.</p>
   <p>Greeks! In the name of faith, of country, and of duty I urge you to observe this motto, "Greeks for Greeks," and to refrain from extravagance and intemperance and from casting pearls before swine.</p>
   <p>Greek-American generations of the future will remember you and bless you for putting into practice now this "Greeks for Greeks" method, which will lay a foundation for them to stand upon and make them proud of their progenitors.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1079.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Racially, socially, and physiologically future Greek-American generations will be what we are now preparing them to be. It is our imperative duty to society and to our God to plant now religious, educational, and commercial seeds and to nurture their growth. Let us plant the right seeds now.</p>
