   <p>p. 2.- With great pomp and ceremony the installation of the officers of the three Ahepa chapters of our city took place. Although the weather was bad on that day, February 12th, over 3,000 members and friends attended the great affair which took place at the Gold Room of the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>The ball room was well filled before the appointed time. Many people who could not dance or had no intention of dancing, came anyway, to see the ceremony.</p>
   <p>At exactly 8:30 P. M. the guests of honor came forward in an orderly procession and took their places. They were followed by the Supreme President of Ahepa, B. Chibithes, and the presidents of the three Chicago chapters, B. Roussis, P. Sikokis, and M. Lambros. After them filed the vice presidents, secretaries, treasurers, and the counselors.</p>

   <p>After the oaths were taken, the past presidents of the chapters, D. Poulakos, Rekas nd Sikokis, were praised for the fulfillment of their offices. Mr. Chibithes' speech will long be remembered by those who had the fortunate opportunity of listening to him. After the speeches, dancing was on the program for the rest of the evening. Many prominent people attended this affair from Chicago and out of town. Among them were Mrs. A. Papaeliou, pharmacist, from Newark, widow of the well-known doctor of our city, who was, before his death, the first organizer and president of Ahepa. The affair will be long remembered by those who attended.</p>
