   <p>Last week we wrote an article urging parents to take their children to the church services held during Holy and Easter week. While attending two different churches on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, we were amazed to note that the majority of churchgoers were our young people. There were two young people for every one of the first generation lined up to be blessed by the priest in the St. Basil Church. We believe that this was true of all the other Chicago Orthodox churches.</p>
   <p>This seems to indicate clearly the attitude and desires of the younger generation toward a retention of those customs and religious programs which they consider worth keeping. Naturally they will discard or ignore some of the customs which do not harmonize with the American way of living, but this is not unusual, for the youth of every transplanted foreign group does likewise.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1938.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The phenomenon of so many young people's attending services is very encouraging, for when it is time for us to relinquish the reins to younger leaders, we shall be confident that our church will not suffer. Part of our duty to ourselves and the motherland is accomplished when we succeed in instilling the finer points of our racial ideology and culture in the minds and hearts of our children.</p>
