   <p>The soil of the grave in which the bullet-riddled body of James Floros was placed is still fresh. The tears of his loved ones and friends have not dried yet; while the countless wreaths which were placed on his last remains are still unwithered.</p>
   <p>Among those who are bereaved by the tragic loss of James Floros is the perpetrator of the crime and the victims oldest friend, Pantelis Rousetos. "How I wish that the cursed night of the crime had never come! How I regret that I did not save one bullet for myself!" These were Rousetos' words after he himself surrendered at the police station. "I have killed James. I have killed my brother," he said.</p>
   <p>These words show plainly how destructive the results of sudden excitement are.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0671.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Rousetos shouted, "If I could only bring him back to life!" This is a prayer in vain, but it indicates that he is truly sorry for his crime. Unfortunately, however, it is too late. His beloved friend, his dearest fellow countryman, is in life no more, nor can he ever return to us.</p>
   <p>The crime, which took place about a week ago in the offices of the great and rich Greek Ice Cream Company of Rousetos and Floros, has been announced with deep sorrow by Saloniki, but with incomplete and fragmentary information. Many rumors were being circulated from mouth to mouth by all our people, who were shocked and deeply moved by the tragic events.</p>
   <p>The victim, Floros, and Pantelis Rousetos were two of our finest Greeks, well known in our Chicago community. A long business partnership had united the two men with bonds of brotherly love and friendship. The world believed that they were inseparable partners and lifelong friends, but Satan had sowed the seed of jealousy and mutual distrust in their hearts. Hate and distrust had undermined the great friendship of these two men to such an <pb facs="5422062_4_0672.jpg" n="3"/>extent that all through the last three years many violent scenes had taken place between them.</p>
   <p>As founder of the company, Rousetos wanted to have complete control of the business, while Floros was inspired by the same ambition. It is said that the sum of $65,000 was offered by one in order to buy the other out, but neither one desired to leave the business. Finally, developments came to a point where the bloody night of last Friday brought about the murder of Floros and the imprisonment of Rousetos. Thus, both of the owners and largest stockholders of a great company have left the active management of the business. One is resting in eternal sleep, and the other is in prison awaiting the last decree from avenging Justice.</p>
   <p>One of the greatest faults of the Greek people is their inability to adopt and understand the spirit of business partnership and co-operation. That is the reason why, as an individual, the Greek can prosper and perform miracles; whereas, when co-operating with others, he retrogresses, fails, and is finally <pb facs="5422062_4_0673.jpg" n="4"/>destroyed.</p>
   <p>The prosperity and success of the Rousetos-Floros partnership, which was based on mutual trust, respect, and friendship, reached a high point, for, according to the most conservative estimates, the assets of the company amount to $200,000. Who could believe that this successful partnership would be dissolved by the firing of a gun and under such dramatic circumstances?</p>
   <p>What has been done, however, cannot be undone. And now the victim's heirs and all those who are interested in the fate of the prisoner should show all possible calm and poise. Let us not forget that in spite of the bloody confusion that has been created, both principals to the crime have a common interest in the huge company, which they had created with long hours of toil and sweat. For the sake of their common interest, the relatives and agents of both men should forget that they are enemies. Any further complications and quarrels will injure the good name of our good people. We do not wish <pb facs="5422062_4_0674.jpg" n="5"/>to be humiliated in the eyes of the American people. In this, all the Greeks of Chicago are greatly interested. As for us, we detest bloodshed as much as God does. We are very sorry for the victim, as every human heart must be.</p>
