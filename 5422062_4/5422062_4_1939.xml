   <p>In the meantime, the effervescent desire for rebuilding the church increased due to the passion enhanced by the perpetual urgings of father Petrakis. Men in every station of life worked day and night to raise money for the new church. The self-denial and self-sacrifice was apparent everywhere.</p>
   <p>A committee (of many members) was appointed, and composed of eminent members of our community, to raise funds for the building of a new and better church. The names are as follows: Bishop Philaretos, honorary president; Rev. Petrakis, general secretary; Dr. Constantine Theodorou, vice president; George Prassas, vice president; K. Tzovanis, treasurer. Other members were, N. Nomicos, K. Katsaounis, Dem. Stamos, Em. Kotsonis, G. Politis, H. Vrettos, Geo. Lempesis, John Mpontsolas, A. Agelopoulos, P. Mpouzanis, N. Karafotias, P. Rousopoulos, John Drousias, George Spyrou, Geo. Alexander, P. Milias, Vasil Argeres, John Vasilopoulos, Andr. Lyssaris, John Argyrios, P. Spiridakos, A. Papaleonardos, H. Simadis, G. Lampros, P. Kontos, G. Karavassos, D. Kontogianis, John Drapanias, E. Louloudakis, and N. Vasilacos.</p>

   <p>It is note-worthy to mention the praise, by the Daily News, for Mr. Andrew Karagianis, whose feverish activities and efforts were responsible for the erection of our institutions. Mr. Karagianis said, "My tremendous success in raising money, depends entirely upon the willingness and self-sacrifice of the Greeks of our community, without their generous contributions, my efforts would not have been crowned with success. The community wanted to have a church and school building to symbolize Greek idealism; I simply collected the money they willingly gave. The praise belongs to the community."</p>
   <p>Due to the efforts of all, the money was raised, and on the 9th of October, 1927, the cornerstone of the institution was laid, under the vigilant auspices of Mr. Karagianis and the rest of the committee.</p>
   <p>In that famous and excellent celebration participated, the whole of Greek Hierarchy of America who came to Chicago for the Convention of the Archdiocese; a multitude of people; the officials of the General Consulate; the South Side Chapter of the Ahepans; the Knights of Constantine the Great in their splendid regalia and the Societies of Greek ladies, the "New Generation" and "St. Helen".</p>

   <p>So great was the enthusiasm and joy of the participants, that right after the passionate speech of Bishop Ioakim of Boston, $16,000 was raised in the twinkle of an eye.</p>
   <p>A year after the cornerstone was laid, on October 14, 1928, the great portals of the church were thrown wide open to accomodate the 6,000 people who came for the celebration of the opening of the church. In the rite participated the whole Greek Clergy of Chicago. Archbiship Alexander presided, and was assisted by the whole hierarchy of America, who came here for the occasion. The splendor grandeur, and magnificence of the celebration was beyond description.</p>
   <p>It would be just and right to mention and print the names of the donators and the amount contributed for the building of the institution, but they are so many. The Wreath of Honor belongs to all. The writer of these lines said, the names and the amount given by them are unknown, because when they gave they followed the holy saying, "Do not let the left hand know, what the right, gives." God alone knows the donators and the amount, and their names are glorified before him. God bless you all.</p>
