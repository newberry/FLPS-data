   <p>During the last two weeks three of our church parishes elected new trustees. In all three of these parishes the number of members attending the elections was very small in comparison with the number of churchgoers. This common indifference indicates that the plight of the churches receives no sympathy from the people, who, therefore, take no interest in their activities.</p>
   <p>It is rather fortunate that there still exist a few individuals who have not lost complete interest and who continue to respond to the call of duty. We have never believed that an individual has no duty to his church because it is governed by an independent, non-co-operative system. In fact, these duty-shirkers are the very ones who hinder the unification of our community. Our hopes for centralization rest upon those who remain at their posts of duty. They, more than anyone else, will sooner or later recognize the need for the unification that the Greek Press has so repeatedly demanded. It is sincerely to be hoped that those few conscientious people in our community will not falter or lose their courage. Only their vigilance at election times prevents unworthy individuals from taking control of our parishes.</p>
