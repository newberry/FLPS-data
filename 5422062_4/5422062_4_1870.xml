   <p>p. 1 The fifth convention of the Greek Order Gapa, began its sessions, last Monday at the Medinah Athletic Club. Besides the delegates, who came from all over United States, three thousand Greeks and others participated in the opening ceremony was very magnificent and imposing. When his Excellency, Charalambos Simopoulos, Greek Ambassador, accompanied by the Hon, Depastas, Consul General of Greece in Chicago, the Supreme President of Gapa, Basil Toannou and the Patriarchic Exarch the Most Rev. Damaskenos, who came to America as representative extraordinary of the Ecumenic Patriarchate, to unify the Greek churches of North and South America, entered the convention hall, the bands immediately played the national anthems of the United States and Greece, consecutively the enthusiasm of the participants was very great.</p>

   <p>After the solemn and imposing liturgy Dr. Gavaris, President of the Organization Committee, introduced W. Saltiel, representing the Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Saltiel in a billiant speech welcomed the delegates, praised the work of the order and extolled ancient and modern Greece. Following Mr. Saltiel Dr. Gavaris read a letter, sent to the Convention by the President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. The letter created a sensation. It reads as follows.</p>

   <p>Dear Dr. Gavaris:</p>
   <p>Kindly convey my cordial greetings to the National Convention of the Gapa, and express to the members the esteem I have for the work of the Order in its faithful transplanting to American institutions the benefit of the historic past and lofty ideals of the Greek race, the perpetuation of which, is the aim of the Order.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Herbert Hoover.</p>

   <p>Basil Ioannou, Supreme President of the Order in his speech brought out the good work of the Order and emphasized the fact that Gapa has already established one hundred fifty lodges all over the land and sixty nine schools of which nineteen were build and owned by the Order, the fifty remaining being in rented buildings.</p>
   <p>The Greek Ambassador next spoke without oratorical effect, but in an advisory manner urged the Greeks of America to be loyal to the United States, their mother country and to Greece, the mother of all countries. He further urged the Greeks to import Grecian goods and products which America doesn't produce.</p>
   <p>Wednesday night the Chicago United Lodges of Gapa gave a dance in the Aragon ballroom in honor of the visiting delegates. Four thousand people participated.</p>

   <p>This dance was honored by the presence of the Greek Ambassador,Mr. Simopoulos and the Consul General, Mr. Depastas. Groups of Greek maidens gracefully presented various Greek dances.</p>
   <p>Thursday the delegates went on a sight seeing tour that ended with a visit to the stock yards. Thursday afternoon the women's lodges of Chicago held a tea party for the visiting ladies, at the Edgewater Beach Hotel.</p>
   <p>Saturday night, at the closing of the convention a symposium was given at the Medinah Athletic Club in which many prominent Greeks took part. The conviviality of the participants might have turned out to resemble the Dionysia (Bacchanalia) of the past had not the State and Church dignitaries been present.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1875.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The event was honored by the Exarch, Bishop Philaretos Greek Ambassador, Consul General Mr. Depastas, D. Kallimachos, Editor of New York's Greek Herald, past and present dignitaries of the Order, and many other notables of the Greek community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The departing delegates were very much pleased with the Greek's hospitality and much more pleased with the great Metropolis of the West, Chicago. Hundreds of them had never been in Chicago.</p>
