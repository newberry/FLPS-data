   <p>Activities for the relief of the Corinthian earthquake refugees are taking place on a great scale in the United States. The Greek newspapers in New York and in San Francisco have taken in large sums of money for the relief of the refugees.</p>
   <p>Various other agencies are helping in the collection of funds for the earthquake sufferers of Corinth. Noted amongst them are the Ahepa, Gapa, church communities, and other organizations.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, contrary to expectations and contrary to tradition, collections have been meager and disorganized due to the unavailability of the persons who, as a rule, act in affairs of this nature. The Greeks of Chicago always <pb facs="5422062_4_0296.jpg" n="2"/>predominated in affairs of this kind and it seems now that they have to "go some", before they occupy a box seat in the affairs of American Hellenism.</p>
   <p>Of the Greek societies in America the Ahepa has perhaps contributed more to the relief fund than all other organizations taken together. The reason for this is not hard to define. The Ahepa is the most strongly organized body of Greeks in the United States, with chapters in practically every large city.</p>
   <p>From all indications the members of this organization seem to be the most progressive materially, and the most prominent socially. Their contact with Americans has endowed them with the spirit of organization, to which they have added their own personal patriotism, and their love of the fatherland. Hence their willingness to support such causes as the Corinthian relief fund and the contemplated institution of Mr. Frangoudis.</p>
