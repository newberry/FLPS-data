   <p>It would be impossible for us to publish all the letters received from readers in regard to our community unification campaign. The great majority of these letters heartily applaud our efforts...</p>
   <p>There are, of course, some dissenting or questioning letters received. As a rule, they ask questions of the same type concerning methods of organization and the benefits of such a step. They remind us of the questions put by small children to their elders who often find themselves unable to give answers. Not, of course, because they do not know the correct answers, but because the very nature of the questions is such that no one could really speak with certainty.</p>
   <p>Many individuals follow a certain type of reasoning which is devoid of reason. They cannot comprehend and refuse to understand that people exist who perform <pb facs="5422062_4_0858.jpg" n="2"/>their duties with good and decent intentions. It is fortunate for the Greek Press that this fact has been accepted as such by the Greek Community as a whole,or else many unjust accusations would now be believed. The great mass of people recognize the need for the immediate formation of a unified Greek Community, and do not seek to create new obstacles to retard its realization. Not only is the healthy part of the Greek Community of Chicago sure that such unification is its only salvation, but it also intends to resist any policy which will continue the decentralized methods now in effect. The Board-of-Trustee system must go.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, in this trying campaign to readjust a bad situation by means of a central governing body for the Greek churches, has never resorted to the slightest meanness or smallness to achieve its ends. The entire Community and clergy can testify to that....</p>
   <p>We have never changed our policies to suit the disposition or desires of any one--not even the Archbishop Athenagoras. The policies we have followed have been considered <pb facs="5422062_4_0859.jpg" n="3"/>the best for ourselves and the Community. There should be no occasion for further discussion concerning the need for unification; the only thing we need to worry about now is the manner in which this is to be brought about. Even that will present no great difficulties if all the church trustees merely give their wholehearted assent. The Hellenism of Chicago desires to rid itself of the continued postponements and subterfuges which have so far prevailed. It desires quick and decisive action concerning this matter.</p>
