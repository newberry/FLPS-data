   <p>News reports from Greece bring us tidings that from now on "graduates" [sic] of grammar schools who desire to do so may become ordained priests. The papers received this announcement with surprise and disfavor, and all thinking people have become aroused and skeptical concerning this new decision and its influence upon the future of the Greek clergy. Many of our priests feel that this decision is degrading to their profession and that it reflects upon each of them. This ruling by the Holy Synod of Greece surprises us, as much as Balaam was surprised to hear his ass talk [Biblical allusion]. And yet this ruling need not, necessarily, be a detrimental one. In fact, it may even be one that is conducive to progress. This is our explanation of the last statement:</p>
   <p>Probably, none of the twelve disciples of Christ graduated from even a grammar school. They were simple, uneducated fishermen. One of them, Judas, must have <pb facs="5422062_4_2032.jpg" n="2"/>been a clothing salesman--as are most of his modern descendants. But I suppose, he must really have been a fisherman also. Nevertheless, those twelve ignorant fishermen founded the great Christian religion. Why is it not possible for modern simple shepherds to maintain this religion? Are not the two situations parallel types of responsibility? Are they not both--the priest and the shepherd--supposed to protect and lead the flock? The experience acquired by a shepherd in watching over his sheep and in seeing that they are in good pastures should make him an ideal priest.</p>
   <p>Of course, as our friend, Paul Javaras asks, how can a simple shepherd with but a grammar-school education understand and interpret the Bible for the benefit of his flock? Again, in that instance, the uneducated priest is preferable to any other. He will at least speak in the popular language, and not in the katharevousa [literary language], as do our pseudo-educated priests. As we all know, ninety-nine per cent of our priests do not know what they are talking about when they give public speeches. But because so few people really understand the katharevousa the priests manage to get by with their mistakes. If they said the same things in the common and <pb facs="5422062_4_2033.jpg" n="3"/>easily understood dialect, not even the treasurer would step into the church on Sunday. Moreover, why would the treasurer go to church if there was no one there to put money into the collection plate? Do you see what a great boon this literary language is to priests and patriotic orators? Just repeat long and difficult words over and over to your audience and they will talk about your wonderful and enlightening speech for days. The same is true for would-be journalists. All who happened to attend the Clerical Convention will testify to the same truths.</p>
   <p>From this standpoint, a priest's lack of educational veneer is to his credit. If such a man has anything to express, he will say it in the language understood by everyone in his audience. We do not mean to imply that education is unnecessary; but at times knowledge and theology do not mix very well, because a truly intelligent well-educated priest will analyze all the religious precepts and questions to such a minute degree that he will finally become a skeptic or <pb facs="5422062_4_2034.jpg" n="4"/>a hypocrite. If the former occurs, he will seek a profession in the social or economic world. If the latter happens, then he will only remain a priest be-cause of the easy living involved. Priests of such educational backgrounds have not been very common in America. The majority of them have been uneducated immigrants.</p>
   <p>Our priests have remained just as they were when they arrived in America. They have not done so because of laziness or lack of ambition, but because they have practiced the adage, "believe, and do not examine or analyze". I do not under-stand what the Greeks in America stand to lose if their priests are not scholars. All we seem to want of them is that they marry us and bury us and read a blessing at certain patriotic affairs. I admit that in all the twenty-five years I have spent in America, I have never heard of one Greek who was anxious to hear the Sunday sermon. After all, would we not prefer to listen to a family man conducting a service in order that his children may be fed and clothed than a monastic scholar attempting to explain the Immaculate Conception?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_2035.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Preston Bradley of Chicago is a modern type of priest. At one time, during his evening radio sermon, he stated that the clergy of the Greek Orthodox Church was very ignorant and backward. That, I think, is a compliment to our clergy. It would be better for the Greek clergy to be completely idiotic than for it to be forced to do some of the things done by Bradley three times a week in his radio speeches to earn his daily bread.</p>
   <p>This decision of the Greek Holy Synod benefits Greece and gives the Greeks a reputation for cleverness and intelligence. Our religion is not dominated by rich and powerful Popes and officials. Perhaps, in time, the other small countries of Europe will imitate the example set by the democratic Greek Church.</p>
