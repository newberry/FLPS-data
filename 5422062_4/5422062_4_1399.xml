   <p>p. 1.- The long expected meeting of the Panhellenic Union finally took place yesterday evening. As we expected, only a small crowd gathered, about 126 in all. Most of those present were friends of the promoters of the affair or were lured there by free tickets.</p>
   <p>One man admitted that if Mr. Lekatsas' name wasn't on the program, he and 15 others would not have attended at the La Salle Hotel that night. The Greeks of Chicago are realizing that they have become the dupes of a few people and refuse to be laughed at any longer. That is why they do not show interest in <pb facs="5422062_4_1400.jpg" n="2"/>various affairs that are given. The people have ceased to believe anything Mr. Manousopoulos, the president of the Panhellenic Union, has to say because he has so often contradicted himself.</p>
   <p>Last night we plainly heard the president say that he is on the friendliest of terms with the governor and that there is no man he respects more highly. Last May his words were just the opposite. He laudly denounced this same governor to all who would listen to him.</p>
   <p>If bigger crowds and better successes are wanted by the Panhellenic Union the president and many of the other members had better mend their ways.</p>
