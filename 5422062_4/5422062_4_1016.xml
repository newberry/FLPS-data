   <p>Do not let the title frighten you. It does not refer to a bankrupt bank or to the financial failure of a great business enterprise. We are referring, however, to the bankruptcy of something far more important, something which is called patriotism. Just as the banks and the bankers, and the various commercial tricks of dishonest characters, have swallowed thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars, so have patriotism and professional boosters of patriotism, for selfish and fraudulent purposes, drained the pocketbooks of our people, under the pretext of establishing clubs, organizing communities, editing books and newspapers, collecting funds, and many other pseudo-patriotic inventions.</p>
   <p>The exploitation of the people of our own and of the other Greek-American <pb facs="5422062_4_1017.jpg" n="2"/>communities by the commercial cannoneers of patriotism has reached its limit; thus we can justly say that the bankruptcy is complete. The only Greeks who still believe in and trust our imposing bankers and "powerful" businessmen and who entrust their money and savings to the charming and patriotic orators and the high-pressure salesmen of false patriotism are those who are mentally and intellectually bankrupt. All other Greeks have enough common sense to believe that they themselves are the only ones who can safeguard and protect their hard-earned money, that they need not hand it over to professional crooks and to clever brokers for safekeeping or to be invested.</p>
   <p>It is encouraging to see that the various pseudo-patriots and hypocrites, and the professional organizers of clubs and societies, are being ignored. All their patriotic blustering has been revealed as an easy means of exploitation and extortion. They have been condemned by the great mass of our people, and it is doubtful whether in the near future there will be any patriotic or nationalistic organizations left, except those that still have <pb facs="5422062_4_1018.jpg" n="3"/>some treasury funds to be neatly picked and foolishly wasted.</p>
   <p>To support the wise old Greek proverb that the green twigs are likewise burnt when they are placed near the dry twigs, we have noticed that we have ceased to trust one another, and that many truly worthy and beneficial clubs and organizations have gone bankrupt. This is attributed to the exploitation by our pseudo-intellectuals and false patriots. This is how the big bankers and financiers went on the rocks, after they had swindled the poor of their savings.</p>
   <p>Thus it is that today we are witnessing the bankruptcy of every sort of patriotism. And this shows that we have become saner.</p>
