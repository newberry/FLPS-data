   <p>p. 4.- Last week was entirely dedicated to entertaining Miss Diplarakou ("Miss Europe"). Receptions took place, afternoons and evenings, in private homes, hotels, churches and schools.</p>
   <p>Last Friday afternoon, a tea was given at the Stevens Hotel, by thirteen ladies and young ladies societies of Chicago, that left the best impressions of our community. The societies that participated in this never-to-be-forgotten event were the following chapters of Gapa: Estia, Gorgo and Kipseli of St. Barbara; Efsebia Society of St. Basil, Aghia Eleni (St. Helen) of St. Constantine, Kimissis Theotakou of St. Nicholas, the Ladies Society and Benevolent Society, both of St. Basil.</p>
   <p>At 2 P.M. people were coming from the four corners of the city. At 3 P.M. the vast hall was filled to capacity.</p>
