   <p>The historian of the future who decides to write about what we today call the Greeks of America will find that he is undertaking a very difficult task. Today, the subject is live and tangible; but after a few centuries it will be nothing more than a myth or a legend.</p>
   <p>The writer will not be able to find any "footprints on the sands of time" to verify the existence of the five or six hundred thousand Greeks who lived and died in America. In other words, the writer will find himself in the same predicament faced by those who are at present trying to write with authority about mythical Atlantis.</p>
   <p>A very learned man with whom I was dining in the International Cafe, owned <pb facs="5422062_4_0879.jpg" n="2"/>by Mr. Androw Spyropoulos, discussed this subject with me. He said: "overtheless, it is an undeniable fact that thousands of Hellenes have lived and struggled and died in this country."</p>
   <p>"And yot," I replied, "the day may come when this--now andeniable--fact will be an enigma. It will be remembered only as a legend and by word of mouth. But I have an idea of how to prevent this veil from being dro ped over our past."</p>
   <p>"And what is your idea?"</p>
   <p>"Were is my plan: when the time comes for the building which has housed the international Cafe at 705 South alsted Street for so many years to be demolished or condemned, the Greeks should buy the property. It should beanclosed, and in the center a beautiful white marble column should be placed.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0880.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Upon this column, in large Greek letters, the following inscription should be carved:</p>
   <p>'To The Memory of The Greeks of America, 1860-1960'</p>
   <p>"This, my friend, is the most appropriate place for such a memorial. Through the doors of this cafe, there has passed, at one time or another, practically every Greek immigrant. It has a mysterious attraction which brings every Hellene to its portals. Laborers are not the only ones to whom Barba [Uncle] Andrew has been host. Scholars and eminent men have come eagerly, to eat and talk with each other. Meletios, Vasilious, Damascinos, Callistos, and Athinagoras--these have all been frequent visitors. [Translator's note: These men are Greek patriarchs and bishops.] Prince Paul of Greece made it his headquarters while in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Through its doors have passed Diplarakow, queen of the Greek theater, and <pb facs="5422062_4_0881.jpg" n="4"/>Kotopouli, the finest artist of the theater. The four exponents of Greek melodrama--Moraitis, Parisis, Economides, and Vlahopoulos have sat and discussed the future of the Greek theater with the members of the Academy, here in the International. Brilliant men of Chicago eat here and exchange ideas with the successful businessmen of the community. For years, this restaurant has been the meeting place of the Academy, whose members frequently invite famous American professors to dine and to discuss things. The two personal secretaries of Venizelos--Mr. Tsolainos and Mr. Mihalopoulos--were guests here of Mr. Spiropoulos.</p>
   <p>"In fact, Mr. Venizelos himself seems to be the only one who has not visited this shrine, and he probably has never had the opportunity.</p>
   <p>"Yes, let me repeat, we ought to preserve and mark this spot, because it enables us to trace the history of a transplanted group. The International <pb facs="5422062_4_0882.jpg" n="5"/>has played a great role in the life of the Greek immigrant and in the drama of America called the "Great Melting Pot".</p>
