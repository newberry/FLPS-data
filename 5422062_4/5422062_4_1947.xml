   <p>The power and influence of environment cannot be denied by anyone. The Greek in America is not immune for the influence of the American environment. In his native hamlet, village, or town, he might have contented, when at church, with the singing of our singer, but here in America he is not. The customs here taught him that he must have a church choir.</p>
   <p>It was for this reason that the community of St. Constantine Church, with the initiative of Mr. G. Demopoulos the first singer of the church and Master of Byzantine and European Music, organized the church choir, which operates and functions in American style.</p>
   <p>The Choristers of both sexes are youths of the most religious families of the community.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demopoulos, every Friday, gives lessons to all who wish to join this religious legion.</p>
   <p>The Greeks are very proud of the Church choir as an achievement of the new <pb facs="5422062_4_1948.jpg" n="2"/>generation. The choir not only serves its purpose, but gives joy and delight to the masses.</p>
   <p>The young members of the choir with their melodies and their youthful faces are alight with the transcendent spirit of triumph. Their beautiful faces bathed in softly tinted light, enhanced by the lofty interior of the cathedral, present a scene of ineffable splendor. Under no consideration, to save space and time, their names would be omitted, for their services and devotion to their duty, is a relitious and national pride. Their names based upon the picture, from left to right first row are: Georgia Anagnostopoulos, secretary; Anastasia Papadopoulos, Despina Pelecouda, Theodora Vournazos, Damaskini Kladis, president; Christina Anorianakou, Elisabeth Vrouva, Georgia Agelopoulos, Kalliopi Konstantopoulos, Helen Agelopoulos, Olympia Katsambi. 2nd row: Theodora Stefanopoulos, Maria Aglamisis, Helen Kladis, Anna Rekas, Sophia Karavassos, George Demopoulos, teacher; Sevasti Antona, Euresia Karagianopoulos, Basiliki Katsambis, vice president; Helen Bricolia, Ioanna Grevenitis.</p>
