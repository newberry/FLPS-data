   <p>The organized mass-meeting on the West Side was crowned by success, and a large crowd was there to be informed of the reason why the purchase of the church, St. Basil, by the Association of the Greek Community, is pending for so long.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. Karaflos, President of the Community, was the first to speak; (explaining the difficulties that they had with the individual in possession of the property, etc. translator's note.) Following his speech, which was very illuminating, Mr. Geronlis, attorney at law, presented the legal side of the question.</p>
   <p>(Translator's Note:- Then Mr. Kyriakopoulos, attorney at law, followed with the story of how he took part in favor of the church, but when he discovered that it was the property of Mr. Petropoulos, he suggested the Pan-Arcadian Federation buy it. After him Mr. Perry, attorney at law, nephew of the owner of the property took the floor and told his side of the story, expressing surprise as to how Mr. Kyriakopoulos, a lawyer, could be deceived by Mr. Petropoulos, the owner of the property. Then Mr. Kotakis remarked that the building belonged to Mr. <pb facs="5422062_4_1990.jpg" n="2"/>Petropoulos but not the fixtures, and since the church building is private property, the priest there should be dismissed by the Archbishop.)</p>
   <p>At the end of the meeting, a resolution was adopted and ordered to be sent to the Archbishop of North and South America, Mr. Athenagoras, and the meeting was adjourned. by Mr. Karaflos.</p>
