   <p>p. 2.- The Great Day of the Greek race has come once again. It is March 25th, the day of Greece's independence, the day when a brave race, after four hundred years of submission and slavery, rose against the oppresions and became free again. This deed of the Greek people is one of history's greatest stories and as time goes on, its significance becomes greater. One more victory has been added to the long list of famous Greek battles. After four hundred years of tyrannic rule the Greeks rose against the Turks in 1821 and gained their long-sought freedom.</p>
   <p>This battle was followed by another one - a longer and harder one. After four hundred years of slavery, the Greeks had to remake a nation. For four hundred years their civilization and progress had been stopped. They were compelled to pick up the remaining shreds of their existence and go on - and they did it. In one hundred years they restored what the Turks had torn down in four hundred years and they did it successfully and single handedly.</p>

   <p>That is what Greek Independence means to us. That is what we are celebrating on March 25. Is it no wonder the Greeks are bursting with pride and joy and patriotism to celebrate the rebirth of a great nation?</p>
