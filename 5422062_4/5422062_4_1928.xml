   <p>A few days ago a new organization was launched in St. Nicholas church, under the name of the Holy Flame. Youths of the locality hastened to join the organization, the main purpose of which is to initiate and teach youths the principles of the organization and management of our church affairs.</p>
   <p>The youths of St. Nickolas church locality are grasping this opportunity with enthusiasm. The constitution of this new organization has been worked out and the installation of officers will be held soon.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the organization is to bring about the elevation of Hellenism and the Hellenic church before the eyes of other people.</p>
   <p>The following officers have been elected: George Askounis, president; Christ mallires, vice-president; Andreas Maniatis, secretary; Elias Mallires, treas. All these young men have devoted themselves, body and soul, to their sacred purpose. They will set themselves as examples before the new generation through their assimilation of the Greek ideals and character.</p>
