   <p>Well, the revolutionary movement of Mr. Kontogeorge is spreading and its activities have reached even Chicago, for it is ridiculous to keep silent about the fact, that Kontogeorge has established a church in Chicago, and to believe that by not taking this into consideration we fight it out by silence.</p>
   <p>Such a policy, we think, does not serve our church unity, and it will be the worse kind of service to the church, if we do not strike at the evil of separation in the making and especially, if we don't hasten the removal of the causes that have created this new split.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of the ordaining of Bishops we have had sounded the signal of danger. Having stated that the responsibility for this new split in the church lies wholly with Mr. Athenagoras.</p>
   <p>We again grasp the opportunity to repeat, that the further stay of Mr. Athenagoras in America would strengthen and spread the revolutionary movement of Kontogeorge to such an extent it would be too far gone to be removed.</p>
