<title level="a">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TEGEAN SOCIETY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It is about time that the numerous natives of Tegea [Translator's note: important province in the Peloponnesus, southern Greece] living in Chicago made their voices heard.</p>
   <p>Apparently the activities of our numerous local Greek societies and organizations during the past years did not excite or arouse the patriotism of the Chicago Tegeans, nor did they goad them on to organize a society or an organization composed exclusively of Tegeans. Such an organization would have benefited both them and our homeland. But, "better late than never."</p>
   <p>Judging from the huge number of Tegeans that were present at their first general meeting, the Tegean Society will become one of the first and greatest Greek organizations in Chicago. It is estimated that more than three thousand Tegeans live in Chicago; most of them own their business and are doing very nicely.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0053.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>More than one hundred and fifty prominent Tegeans from various parts of the city gathered in the hall above Mr. Constantine Salopoulos' drug store after reading the announcement in Saloniki that the organization of a Tegean Society was planned. By the way, Mr. Constantine Salopoulos himself is a Tegean.</p>
   <p>With Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, formerly Greek consul in Chicago, presiding, all, with one voice and a common desire, decided to obtain a charter from the State of Illinois, legalizing the organization. A membership committee was also appointed.</p>
   <p>Besides Mr. N. Salopoulos, many other Tegeans spoke with great enthusiasm about the work and future plans for the Society. It was suggested that not empty and endless talk but practical results and fruitful accomplishments should be the principle topics discussed in the meetings and councils of the Society.</p>
   <p>After discussing many questions concerning the details of the organization <pb facs="5422062_4_0054.jpg" n="3"/>and administration of the Society, the following gentlemen were selected to write the bylaws and constitution of the Club, and to obtain a charter:</p>
   <p>P. Anastopoulos, Nicholas Salopoulos, former consul; Doukas, Tsoulos, P. Zakos, T. Spirrison, Pasialis, Ganas, Demetropoulos Koutsouris, Belleson, and Karkazis. [Translator's note: first names not given.]</p>
   <p>Upon the completion of the work entrusted to them, these genglemen will call a general meeting to vote upon the acceptability of the constitution, and appoint a membership committee.</p>
