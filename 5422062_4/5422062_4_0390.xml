<title level="a">THE GREEK YOUNG WOMEN'S PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY GIVES A DANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GREEK VICTIMS OF THE TURKS.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>p. 2.. Last week in the beautiful ball-room of the Trianon a dance was given by the Greek Young Women's Philharmonic Society for the benefit of the Greek refugees of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>Many young women elegantly dressed directed the guests as they entered. More than five thousand persons attended the dance.</p>
   <p>There were two intermissions in which ancient Greek classical dances were performed by Mr. and Mrs. Vassos Kanellos, and Mr. Stavros Tsiopes, the dramatic baritone, who has a well-trained voice, sang selections from operas and Greek songs. He was accompanied by Mrs. Antoinette Le Broom, an instructor in piano. Mr. and Mrs. Kanellos and Mr. Tsiopes were heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>All went home about 1 a. m. pleased with the hospitality of the Greek Young Women's Philharmonic Society. In spite of rain and bad weather the dance was a splendid success and brought the greatest crowd ever seen at any of their dances. To the executive committee of the Society and to the management of <pb facs="5422062_4_0391.jpg" n="2"/>the Trianon we offer our hearty congratulations.</p>
   <p>Also worthy of praise and congratulations are the executive members of the Greek Relief Committee and those of our countrymen who have had the initiative to do something for the victims of Asia Minor.</p>
