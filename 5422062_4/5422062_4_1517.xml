   <p>Brilliant in every respect was the celebration of our National Independence Day Centennial by the Pullman Community, St. Spyridon, in conjunction with the Greek school, Plutarch, the Ladies Society Union, the Pullman Chapter of Ahepa and other organizations in Pullman.</p>
   <p>Members of the Ahepa chapter in Pullman gathered in the school and, as a body, marched in wonderful order and pomp to the church. They were followed by sixty or more pupils, boys and girls, who stood in the front row.</p>
   <p>The cheerfulness and dignity of the occasion was pictured in the faces of our Nationals who had gathered there to celebrate the centennial of our National Independence.</p>
   <p>After the Holy Mass, the beloved and indefatigable Father G. Sakellariow, in a brief talk, explained the great religious and national significance of the feast. Then all marched down to the large parlor of the school with banners, <pb facs="5422062_4_1518.jpg" n="2"/>cherubims and seraphims, and the pastor, with the choir of singers; the ExCouncil; the pupils; the Ahepans with the rest of the congregation, following.</p>
   <p>There, in the large hall of the School, that was decorated beautifully by the ladies of the Society Union, the President of the Community, Mr. E. L. Anastasopoulos, introduced the Director of the school, Mr. Geo. Drosos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Drosos, in a profound and inspiring talk, conveyed to the minds of those present, the deep significance of the religious and national celebration enacted, afterwhich the program of the day began.</p>
   <p>The pupils, boys and girls, sang patriotic songs, accompanied on the piano by Miss Olga Massia. Following this number on their program, the pupils gave various recited poems from our glorious poet, Lorenzo Mavili. The whole school program enthused all present.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1519.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During the school program, the scholar and poet, Dem. Mihalaros, who came along with the Ahepans, was called upon to address the gathering. Mr. Mihalaros emphasized the need for Greek education for our children. Mr. Mihalaros said, "By learning the Greek language and the Greek traditions, Greek children will become better Americans."</p>
   <p>Then Mr. S. P. Kotakis, the Manager of the Chicago Greek Daily and speaker of the day, was introduced. He, in an enthusiastic address, touched upon the emotions of the crowd, inspired them with pride for the glory of our race, and gave them courage and self-confidence to continue their loyalty to their great Greek traditions and to bequeath the same to the coming generations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kotakis was followed by Dr. A. Petrakos and Dr. Phemidas; the last having stated, in behalf of Ahepa, that it will stand by the side of the community as in the past.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1520.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This statement was affirmed by the energetic and progressive President of the Pullman chapter of Ahepa, who patriotically took the lead in the arrangement of the Independence Day ceremony.</p>
   <p>American and Greek National hymns were sung by the pupils, and finally Mrs. Petrakos, president of the society, St. Spiridon, after a brief talk, gave the signal for the dance, which lasted till midnight with everybody happy. It was a real Greek affair and all had a wonderful time.</p>
   <p>Many other prominent individuals honored the ceremony by their presence, among whom were Alderman Gouvier from Pullman, who congratulated the gathering in no uncertain terms for the celebration of their National Independence Day.</p>
   <p>Dr. Karaflos and Professor Trakas, also honored our feast by their presence.</p>
