   <p>Last Monday was a historic day for the Chicago Gapans. In the Viking Temple on the South Side, there took place the installation by the Governor of the 5th District of A. Kapsopoulos, of the third Chicago Gapa chapter, Thermopylae.</p>
   <p>Members from other Chicago chapters, and from Gary, Indiana were present at this grand occasion. Governor Kapsopoulos was helped by the president of Naviron chapter, Dr. Klepomenos Papatheodoron. Another assistant was Nicholas P. Gavares, vice-president of the Alexander Ypsilantes chapter.</p>
   <p>The guards with their brilliant uniforms, headed by P. Katsiavos, were a wonderful spectacle. The entire installation was an event that will be long remembered in Gapa history.</p>
   <p>After the installation, officers for the new chapter were elected. Their names will be disclosed this coming Tuesday.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1250.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Kapsopoulos spoke to the members on the importance of the organization and the significance of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>Thermopylae. He introduced Archimandrite Daniel Gambridis, priest of Saint Nicholas church, who had come to aid the Governor in the installation. Archreverend Gambridis spoke on the good deeds of Gapa, praising, Mr. Kopsopoulos and the rest of the members for the work they have done. Other speakers were Dr. Papatheodore, president of Navarinon, Nicholas P. Gavares, vice-president of Alexander Ypsilantes, Mr. Papas, of Gary, Mr. Drosos and Mr. Augerinos.</p>
   <p>We wish the new chapter all the progress and luck its fellow Gapan chapters have experienced so far.</p>
