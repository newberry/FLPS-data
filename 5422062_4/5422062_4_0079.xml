   <p>p. 2.- We have often wondered what became of the money from the auction of the furniture from the Macedonian Society. Six months ago, Mr. I. Sakellarakis promised us a report. He is still promising it seems.</p>
   <p>This is a very important question and we want it answered. What happened to the money? This much we do know -</p>
   <p>Mr. K. Loomos was supposed to buy the entire set of furniture for $125. A large desk was taken from the collection, so the price came downto $95. Mr. Loomos promised to pay the money the following Sunday, but failed to show up. As a result, the furniture was auctioned. Dr. Papaeliou bought seven chairs, two tables and two spittoons for his office. Mr. Karkazis bought a desk. Messrs. Floros and Maropoulos bought some chairs and pictures. Mr. Karkazis also bought the curtains. The last item, a piano, went to Mr. Biokaris for $145.</p>
   <p>We know where the furniture went but where is the money?</p>
