   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The Achaian League, which was organized in Chicago, September 9, 1910, for the purpose of promulgating among people of Hellenic descent proper ideals with reference to American citizenship, and also for the purpose of promoting the legitimate interests of those Hellenic people who have assumed the allegiance and obligations of American citizens, will hold its Ninth Annual Convention in Chicago, Feb. 15, 1919.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1911.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In as much as you are a candidate at the approaching primary, we respectfully request that you submit for consideration a brief statement touching upon your qualifications and fitness for the office, as a candidate for which you desire to be nominated, and particularly a statement setting forth your attitude towards the Hellenes and their rights.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1912.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In furthering the purposes of its organization, the Achaian League will, in conformity with its custom in this respect, attempt to assist citizens of Hellenic descent in reaching fair, accurate and just opinions, as to the qualifications and fitness of the various candidates at the approaching primary and election.</p>
   <p>While the Hellenes, more popularly but less accurately called Greeks, seek for themselves no privilege or consideration which is not due to all American citizens alike, regardless of ancestry, they do resent the prejudice indulged against them by some public officials whose attitude toward the Hellenes is reflected by opinions such as must have brought forth the remark of a certain judge of the Municipal Court of Chicago, that "All Greeks are liars. With me the question in these cases between Greeks is who lied the least?" This attitude does not conduce to any desirable understanding between native citizens and those who become citizens by choice.</p>
  </body>
