   <p>p.1-A local newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, has published in its Sunday edition a statement that a magnificent twelve-story building will soon be erected on Chicago's Gold Coast to house the newly-organized Greek-American Club. The plans of this building have been released by its architect, Zacharia Debis. The structure, a picture of which was printed in the Tribune will be in the Doric style, its facade closely resembling that of an ancient Greek temple. Columns will extend from the ground to the third floor, and the frieze will represent in relief the athletic games of ancient Greece.</p>
   <p>There will be a roof-garden for dinners and dances with a stage for theatrical presentations.</p>
   <p>The upper floors will have a hundred and fifty-two sumptuously furnished rooms for the members of the Club.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1292.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the basement will be a swimming-pool, baths, and a barber-shop. On the other floors will be richly decorated salons for relaxation, the main dining-room, a gymnasium, and special sections for the women who are members of the Club.</p>
   <p>The cost of the building will be $1,250,000, and the construction work has been awarded to S. Clifford and Sian.</p>
   <p>Irving Tzeo, Aristotle P. Kremer, and Aristomenes B. Elkon are named as the founders of the Club. They were legally represented by Attorney John G. Mac Donald.</p>
   <p>The membership is restricted to three thousand, of whom five hundred will be life members. Of the rest two thousand two hundred and fifty will be resident members and two hundred and fifty will be non-resident members.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1293.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The foregoing facts and many others about the building were published in the Tribune, and Mr. Irving Tzeo verified the report; saying that it was no figment of the imagination, since the members above mentioned have millions at their disposal.</p>
