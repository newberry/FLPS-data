<title level="a">THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE EUCHARISTIC CONGRESS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Eucharistic Congress that has been called by the Catholic populace these days--is the question that holds the interest of Chicago and America as a whole.</p>
   <p>For it is not simply a Congress where opinions will be exchanged upon theological and religious matters as usual. Primarily, it is not a Congress, because no subjects are to be discussed or resolutions to be voted upon concerning the Catholic Church. Popery always has its conclaves, and its decisions emanate from the Vatican to its faithful, -thoughts and decisions upon which it does not allow any discussion.</p>
   <p>This famous Congress, then, is rather a demonstration of power of the Catholic church in America. It is, furthermore, an imposing demonstration as those who tried to fight it know.</p>
   <p>The strong nationalist American organization of the Ku Klux Klan, whose program is general Americanization, declared war against the Pope's <pb facs="5422062_4_0968.jpg" n="2"/>church for being governed from abroad and belonging to a foreign rule. The Catholics also have a strong organization to back them, the Knights of Columbus, to which the Catholic populace of America belongs.</p>
   <p>The everyday program of the Eucharistic Congress which includes prayers to the Almighty and speeches of eulogy, in reality is a reply to the K.K.K. and American chauvinism, which, in its supernationalistic vehemence, overlooked every other force in the country and fancied that it could Americanize everything in its own way, there being no resistance. They consider the Catholics and other immigrants less American than they, not loving this country and not interested in this country where their lives and interests are bound.</p>
   <p>This peaceful congress, with its prayers and benedictions, is engaged in a mighty and furious battle whose results are not difficult to foresee.</p>
   <p>The Greek populace is merely a spectator to this struggle in spite of the fact that they have suffered from the overbearing attitude of K.K.K. and have experienced not a few attacks from it.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0969.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The imposing stand that the Catholic populace has taken against the mighty Nationalists, who have no more rights in this country than the lowest immigrant whose toil contributes to its progress and prosperity, is of great significance. The Greek population ought to realize that reunited and properly organized, they can constitute a mighty power in this country, and they have nothing to fear from any organization if they perform their duties as good citizens and obey the laws.</p>
   <p>The best defense against those who misinterpret Americanism and want to use it as a means of terrorizing their fellow-citizens and usurping their rights,whose only shortcoming is the fact that they came to this country later and still have bonds with their native land, is not to deny themselves and their descent but to improve their standing by their works, their good conduct, and their respect for the laws of the land.</p>
   <p>The Greeks in America should be proud of themselves and hand down to their children the Greek language and ideals.</p>
