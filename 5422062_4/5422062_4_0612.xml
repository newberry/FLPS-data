  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Greek colony is the largest Greek center in the West, if not in all America--according to the most conservative estimate, it has a population of over sixty thousand. This community presents the strange phenomenon of a colony which, though it is composed of very progressive individual members, is very backward as a society.</p>
   <p>In years past, the various Greek organizations, some of which are still in existence, displayed to the public our racial weaknesses and faults, and produced and harbored a peculiar type of Greek in Chicago. It seems to the observer that the product of this development in Chicago is a new type of Greek--one who is particularly inclined to mischief.</p>
   <p>We also find this peculiar type in Greek colonies elsewhere in America, but there he is the exception, whereas in Chicago the mischievous type predominates.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0613.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Greeks of this defective class have become so numerous in Chicago that they have influenced the whole community.</p>
   <p>For example, you may meet many people whose characters paradoxically present opposite and conflicting ideas. To illustrate this point we present to you the opinion of one prominent Chicago Greek on the subject of the muddled finances of Holy Trinity Church, recently uncovered by the auditing committee.</p>
   <p>This gentleman, a dramatic author, in expressing his opinion about this matter, said:</p>
   <p>"It is no cause for concern if the president, the treasurer, the secretary, or any other of the officials of the organization spends fifty or a hundred dollars of the public's money to repay himself for his services. But it is a different matter when he misappropriates two or three thousand! That constitutes embezzlement, while the taking of a small amount does not. An executive deserves a little for his trouble."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0614.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In another column we print a report concerning the Clergymen's Union, and we are about to begin a series of articles exposing various incidents of scandalous misappropriation of the church's funds by certain vultures who have had access to the community's treasury. It is a well-known fact that in every community there is a small gang of exploiters who meddle in their community's affairs. But here in Chicago this exploitation is practiced on so large a scale that plundering public finance is considered a praiseworthy act and an indication of cleverness. Imagine a person being caught embezzling a school's money, and yet declaring himself, without remorse or shame, only sorry that he did not have the opportunity to steal more from the treasury!</p>
   <p>Another habit of the shrewd swindlers of the various organizations is to collect money and pocket it instead of turning it over to the treasury; then, when the theft is discovered, the embezzler gives his note in settlement and so escapes the legal penalty for his act! It was stated at the trial of one of these unfaithful stewards that, if he were punished, all officials of the organization should be jailed for the same offense!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0615.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Whenever a person starts defending the interests of the public, shouting protests, and displaying exceptional concern for the institutions of the community, the chances are three to one that he has something up his sleeve and is laying the ground for some scheme of his own, which is why he is making so much noise. Thus we have as self-appointed leaders these same shrewd embezzlers who masquerade as public servants, but who work to their own advantage at the expense of the Greek public. The Athenian Night at the World's Fair is still fresh in our memory, and now more enterprises are on the way.</p>
   <p>These are but a few of the doings in this community which must be exposed and reported in order to prevent more and larger exploitations of our sacred institutions by profiteers, for we believe that these schemers will be harmless after they have once been exposed, and that many abuses will be prevented. Therefore we shall continue the policy which we followed for many years in Detroit, and employ methods even more drastic against these parasites who prey upon the flourishing Greek community of Chicago and who, in our opinion, are contributing to the financial and moral ruin of the Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0616.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>What Hellenism now needs is real, up-to-date Grecian idealism and the application of new practical methods, a form of the New Deal.</p>
   <p>Will it be lucky enough to get these things? Let us hope so!</p>
