  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday marked the end of the Ahepan convention in Kansas City. The representatives of the various chapters are to be praised for their indefatigable work concerning the convention, which was a huge success.</p>
   <p>Among other deeds, they managed to add $500,000 to the scholarship fund and voted a sum of $1,500,000 to build an Orphanage. Both these actions were received with the greatest of enthusiasm and work on the orphanage will begin as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The last task of the convention was the election of officers. George Philis, Supreme vice-president, was elected Supreme President for the coming year. We are glad to say that the office of Supreme vice-president was filled by our well-known and well-liked Chicagoan, Peter G. Sikokis. Mr. Sikokis was previously the Supreme Governor of the 8th district. Achilles Katsonis was re-elected secretary and John Godates, treasurer. George Bournas was elected General Consul. Stilianos Rekas, another Chicagoan, was elected Supreme Governor of this District.</p>

   <p>The Chicago chapters should be honored to have two of their brothers holding such high offices in the Ahepan organization.</p>
