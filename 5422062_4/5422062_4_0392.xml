   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>From the Greek Red Cross of Tripolis we have received two letters, and it will please us immensely if you will publish them in your esteemed journal so that those who are interested may be kept well informed of conditions in Tripolis and the purpose for which the letters were sent.</p>
   <p>These letters speak for themselves; we know very well that the Tripolites and the Arcadians, as a rule, are in a position to study and to understand the existing conditions, and we are sure that they will do their best to offer a helping hand.</p>
   <p>Our Bank, complying with the request of the Greek Red Cross, has consented to make all possible efforts to elicit prompt response to so urgent a request.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_0393.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It has also undertaken the task of collecting donations, and those who wish to make contributions may bring them personally or mail them to the following address. Peter Gregor, President, Atlas Exchange National Bank, 925 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The contributions should be sent as prompt as possible to serve this humanitarian purpose and the names of the contributors will be published. Since we are promoting a benevolent enterprise, we take the liberty of requesting you to place the columns of your journal free of charge at the disposal of this cause and to publish whatever information you may receive thereto pertaining.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>P. H. Gregor, President.</p>
  </body>
