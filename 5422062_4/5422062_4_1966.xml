   <p>The community of the St. Basil Church, which has been in existence but two years bought its fine church building on December 27, 1934. The building cost $21,800. In the short period of its existence this parish, with only a few regular church members, not only has managed to keep its Church open throughout difficult days, but has also been able to make expensive repairs and meet its payments promptly. The check is reproduced above. It is for the sum of $2,200, and is made out to the Chicago Title and Trust Company.</p>
   <p>The board of directors, which is composed of progressive, active men, set a good example by giving $370 to start the drive which amassed the sum shown in the check. They deserve congratulations for being courageous enough to buy the Church, which is of Greek rhythm and structure, and then exerting sufficient effort to guarantee payment for it.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_4_1967.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They hope to make St. Basil the pride of the Greek Community of Chicago and an inspiration to the young generation.</p>
