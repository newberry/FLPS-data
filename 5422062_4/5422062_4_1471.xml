   <p>p.2--Elaborate plans were laid a week ahead for the brilliant ceremony which took place last Sunday at the Masonic Temple, the installation of the new officers of the Pan-Hellenic. Society</p>
   <p>Eight hundred Greeks and Americans of Chicago and elsewhere participated in the event, which was characterized by many reporters who were present as the best that they had ever seen. The two ministers of the Greeks church, the Reverend Fathers Pegeas and Mandilaris, attired in their magnificent ecclesiastical robes, pronounced the doxology, which was devoutly followed by the attending crowd. After the solemn and dignified ceremony of receiving the path of office from the new officers the president of the Society, Mr. Eustathios Karavolis, delivered an eloquent address on unity, cooperation, and Americanism. He was followed by the Reverend Father Tegeas, who spoke on humanized religion and devotion to the laws of our adopted country. Dr. M. Halliondges spoke on hygines and sanitary habitations and urged the members and officers of the Society to become crusaders for the cause of sanitation both in business and at home. Other speakers were Messrs. Goe. Matales. Geo. Houtroumanos <pb facs="5422062_4_1472.jpg" n="2"/>, and Geo. Yokaris, who spoke on the Greek's duty toward America, our present country, and toward Mother-Greece, who expects every son of hers to remember her. The popular Greek tenor, Notis Limberopoulos, sang various songs with Miss P. Poulis at the piano.</p>
   <p>Among the several visitors who attended the affair were the Reverend Father Chiapralis of San Francisco, who has been here for the last ten days soliciting contributions for the prection of a Greek church in the Bay City.</p>
   <p>A dance followed the ceremony, lasting will the early hours of the day.</p>
