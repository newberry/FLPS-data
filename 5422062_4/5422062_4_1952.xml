   <p>Thus was the course of events, and the community was progressing, owing to the zeal and enthusiasm of both the clergy and laity, but the next day divine wrath, not known why, put a stop to the whole work of progress. While the administrators of the church were contemplating the building of a school next to the church, and money was raised for that purpose, the fire took place and everything was turned to ashes.</p>
   <p>On the 26th day of April, 1926, Palm Sunday, was a day of divine wrath for our community. At day-break of Holy Monday, from mouth to mouth, was spread the sad news of the conflagration, while the edifice was still in flames. The church was destroyed.</p>
   <p>The sadness of the people was apparent everywhere, nevertheless, their determination to go on was manifested and enhanced by the heroic deed of their head Priest, Rev. Petrakis, whose heroism was eulogized the next day by American and Greek newspapers. Defying the sky-reaching flames and the possibility of being burned alive, he rushed to the church and saved the sacramental objects of <pb facs="5422062_4_1953.jpg" n="2"/>the holy altar. In his heroic effort his hands and face were burned, although not seriously. He will bear, for the rest of his life, these indelible marks of heroism. The rescue of the beautiful sacramental objects, increased the determination of the community to go on.</p>
   <p>The next day, Greek Christians came from all over the city. Although grief-stricken, they were determined to go on for a new and better church. But the fire occured at the Holy Days of Easter, the biggest holidays of Christendom and the Greeks of the South Side would have been without ecclesiastical services at the arising of the Savior.</p>
   <p>A committee headed by the bandaged Father Petrakis, appealed, to the Catholic Church across the street, for permission to use that church for their services. The answer was negative. "No!" If the Catholics did not sympathise with the misfortune of their fellow Orthodox Christians, the Episcopalian Church did. At once the phil-hellenic bishop, of the Episcopalian Church, Right Rev. Mr. Anderson, through his emissary priest, expressed his deep sympathy for the unfortunate event and offered the Church of St. Paul, 53rd and Dorchester Avenue, to the Greeks to be used for the Holidays of Easter. After the holidays, another church <pb facs="5422062_4_1954.jpg" n="3"/>of the same faith was offered to the Greeks, situated at 61st and Indiana.</p>
   <p>The Greeks, did not, and will not forget the graciousness of the Episcopalian Church and Bishop Anderson. The community of St. Constantine Church again in 1927 celebrated Easter at the Episcopalian Church of Christ, located at 64th Street and Woodlawn Avenue.</p>
