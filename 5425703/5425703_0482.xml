   <p>We are informed from Burnside in Chicago, of the following activity:</p>
   <p>"The Siege branch in Burnside was established on May 3, 1913. We were forced by the local Poles to establish it for they opened a branch of Eagles, and coaxed our boys to join their ranks. This did not appeal to many of us, and we were determined to establish a Siege branch and thus save our youth from the Poles.</p>
   <p>"Our Siege branch spread very well. The Siege members bought uniforms, sabers, insignias, bugles, etc.</p>
   <p>"On December 2, 1917, the Siege members presented their first play "Bondariwna."</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0483.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"On July 14, 1918, this Siege branch celebrated its fifth anniversary. On this occasion we also celebrated the first Ukrainian festival in which a number of different societies and sodalities, both local and otherwise, took part. At this celebration, a strawberry-colored banner, worth $160, was unveiled.</p>
   <p>"The Burnside Siege Branch is well-known in Chicago. It has appeared in drills at banquets, festivals, parades, and manifestations. We have $520 in the bank, not including the investment in the uniforms. During the last three years we have paid $558 as benefits to our members.</p>
   <p>"On February 26, 1919, our branch united with the main Ukrainian Siege organization in the United States, as branch No. 17. Since this day we have already gained a number of new members. We should rejoice in the fact that the Ukrainian youth appreciates the value of the native national training, and rallies there, whereupon the banner is inscribed: "In unity strength!" Yes, in unity there is strength, colleagues! Let us join the ranks of fighters and go united to meet the golden sun of freedom.</p>
   <p>Siege member."</p>
