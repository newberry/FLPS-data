   <p>At the general meeting of the shareholders of the Ukrainian Publishing Company in Chicago, on the 25th of December 1918, in the hall at Erie and Robey Streets, Dr. Stephen Hryniewiecky and Mr. P. Radyk (from Canada) moved to sell the newspaper Ukraina, together with the printing shop and with all its machinery and stock, to the Federation of Ukrainians for the sum that was owned by the company; and this was passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>The remaining debt of the company amounts to $1,800. All the shareholders present at the meeting moved and accepted that they leave their shares for the good of the Federation of Ukrainians. Among the present share-owners there are a great many who have shares in larger amounts: $100, $150, $200, $250, and $300. They voluntarily and willingly obligated themselves to leave their shares for the good of the Federation of Ukrainians under one condition: That the newspaper Ukraina, a future committee organ <pb facs="5425703_0282.jpg" n="2"/>of the Federation, would be issued in Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the general meeting of the share owners, it was recommended also that the directors of the company speed up the transactions with the executive committee of the Federation.</p>
   <p>Those present represented more than two thirds of the shareholders of the Ukrainian Publishing Company.</p>
