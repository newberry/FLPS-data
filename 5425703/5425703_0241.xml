   <p>This association of Ukrainian musicians was organized as a Siege branch on June 19, 1921.</p>
   <p>On the picture accompanying the article we find twenty-six musicians. Their names are as follows:</p>

   <p>Top row: Nicholas Walkovelsky, Alexander Shostak, S. Novodvorsky, Dr. Sam <pb facs="5425703_0242.jpg" n="2"/>Kochy, Stephen Burdash, Nicolas Chytvinsky, Wasyl Pryhoza, and Stephen Diduch.</p>
   <p>Officers of the branch are as follows: Stephen Novodvorsky, commander; Alexander Shostak and Nicholas Batiuk, secretaries; Theodore Klykun, financial secretary.</p>
   <p>The very first inspiration the Ukrainian colony in Chicago received was in 1914, at the arrival of Mr. M. Edelman who started a spark of desire among the musically talented, energetic Ukrainian youth. From that time on they formed a club, and until June, 1921, it had many ups and downs. There was a time when it was dubious whether or not the band could exist any longer, so much so that for a time a semi-conductor had to take charge of the band. Dmitro Goy understood possibly more than anybody else the importance of such a band among the Ukrainians in Chicago. He did everything in his power to help this band exist in those days of crisis. After the World War, John Barabash, an American veteran, became the conductor. From that time on, the Ukrainian band in Chicago became more and more successful by leaps and bounds.</p>
