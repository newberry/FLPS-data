<title level="a">CURATORS FOR THE FIRST UKRAINIAN AVIATION SCHOOL IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>On Tuesday, September 11, a meeting of the parents of the Aviation School students was held in the office of the United Hetman Organizations, Dr. O. Tarnawsky presiding. The prospects of the Aviation School in Chicago were discussed and it was unanimously resolved to create curators for the School, these persons to be chosen from among the parents of the students, and from representatives of the United Hetman Organizations and other Ukrainian organizations which favor the idea of developing the Ukrainian Aviation School. The curators will be obliged to support the school morally and, if possible, materially, and to help the students become aviators who will be thoroughly qualified in the field of aviation.</p>
   <p>The following parents were elected executive curators: Messrs. Michael Petriw, Peter Hawrysh, Tymko Bahriy, Paul Vysochan, and Theodore Mamchuk.</p>
