   <p>On August 14, the executive office decided to write a letter to S. Dembitsky, recording secretary of Obyednania (Union), to force him to suspend his activity of collecting signatures for Obyednania (an insurance association) from the Siege Organization officers.</p>
   <p>A letter of resignation from M. Kotsiuk, assistant major, and for the time being the head of the first Siege District in Philadelphia, was read. The resignation, however, was not accepted.</p>
   <p>On August 28, they changed their minds after reading the letter of the first District, in Philadelphia. The Siege officers there, with all its members, agreed to join the Obyednania Insurance Company. This influenced the Headquarters executive staff who decided that the entire Siege Organization will officially join the insurance association. Whereupon the insurance association was permitted to use the names of Siege officers or members for advertising purposes, etc.</p>
