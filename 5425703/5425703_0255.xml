   <p>Attention, Ukrainians of Chicago and vicinity! First time in Chicago, a Ukrainian carnival, corner Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street, from September 18 to October 5!</p>
   <p>Countrymen, you have not as yet had such a wonderful opportunity for entertainment as the one now presented to you at this carnival. There are all sorts of games, raffles, social entertainments, witty monologues and, above all, there will be dancing in the open every evening to the music of a well-selected orchestra, all union men. There will also be a bar and a buffet--with all kinds of refreshing drinks and luncheonettes. In short, there will be everything worth while in the way of pleasure that you could ever find in any of the best carnivals.</p>
   <p>Should there be anyone who has never attended any such carnivals, he does not <pb facs="5425703_0256.jpg" n="2"/>know how fully he can enjoy himself at them. Let him ask someone who has, or, better still, let him come directly to Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street this very evening. The carnival is open every evening from 6 to 12; also Saturdays and Sundays. The carnival has already begun. It will end October 5.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note. The organizer of this carnival (name not given in advertisement) was the St. Nicholas Church.]</p>
