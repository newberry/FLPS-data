   <p>Dear Siege Members:</p>
   <p>The eyes of all the Ukrainian nation are turned on you. For your waits your dear native sister; for you waits your gray-haired father, hungry, almost completely naked and barefooted, with a scythe in his hands, and your mother and sister with a sickle. They fight against the bloody enemy, the Poles, who eagerly and relentlessly want to take away from us Ukrainians that what is dearest to any man: his freedom!</p>
   <p>Everybody longs for freedom. Cage a bird and give him to eat and drink all he wants, yet he will ever try to dash out for freedom. Why does he not want to stay in the cage? Because the cage is a jail for him, something similar to death itself. Therefore, regardless of how well you will feed him there, he will always long for freedom. So also it is with a nation.</p>
   <p>You know that every nation itself fought for and won its own freedom. Let <pb facs="5425703_0813.jpg" n="2"/>us take George Washington. He fought to liberate the American nation, to liberate its land, where we American citizens of Ukrainian descent presently live. He loved his country so much that he showered upon it his very sweat of blood. With a strong faith in his heart he went forward to fight for the golden freedom.</p>
   <p>We Siege members have experienced serfdom already. We Siege members are remembering the Polish, Austrian, and Russian jails, gibbets, tortures, and all sorts of countless abuses on our fathers and the whole Ukrainian nation. But we also know what means freedom, liberty, independence!! We Siege members love and will love freedom. George Washington taught us how to love freedom, how to fight for it! And for this reason, we, the Siege members, are loyal to the free land of Washington. We, the citizens of the United States of America, wish for nothing more than that what George Washington wished for America.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we believe that the American government, elected by the American citizens, will extend its helping hand toward our native country, Mother <pb facs="5425703_0814.jpg" n="3"/>Ukrainia, in her struggle, fighting for her freedom and independence.</p>
   <p>We American Siege members swear upon the spirit of our dead heroes, who gave their lives for freedom, before the whole civilized world, that our native country Ukrainia shall be free!</p>
   <p>We, the American Siege members, will follow the footsteps of George Washington! Washington was restless until he won freedom for the American nation. So also we will not rest until our country, Ukrainia, earns her freedom.</p>
   <p>Our enemies, the Poles and the Russians, have plans in their heads and outwardly they try to deceive us. They try to ignore our manifestations and endeavor to make the whole world do the same. But it won't be long!..</p>
   <p>The time is not far off when the Siege members will show the greedy big-bellied Poles the way back to Warsaw and Kracow!</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0815.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Dear Siege Members! At the last Siege convention we have all sworn that we shall be restless till the Siege organization in America reaches 60,000 members, who will be ready to lay down their lives for freedom and the independence of Ukrainia. Therefore, forward to work, members! Bring in new members; establish new Siege branches: this is the only medium which will win freedom for Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Join the Siege ranks all who love the Ukrainian nation. Those who belong to Siege give a proof that they are ready to defend their father and mother, brother and sister, their wives and children.</p>
   <p>Do you want to be an enemy of those that are nearest and dearest to you? No! and I am sure of the answer. Therefore, join one and all the ranks of the fighters for freedom and independence of Mother Ukrainia; join the membership of the Siege organization in the United States.</p>
   <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
   <p>John Boyko, Head Commander S. O. U.</p>
