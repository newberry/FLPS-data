<title level="a">REUNION OF UKRAINIANS FROM THE VILLAGE OF YHERSKO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>On Sunday, October 18, 1936, a group of Ukrainians who came here from the village of Yhersko, county of Striy, solemnly celebrated the Feast of the Blessed Virgin. In order that this celebration should remain a precious memory to future generations, the committee on arrangements gave a banquet which was followed by a dance, and invited not only those from the village of Yhersko who live in Chicago, but also many guests and friends from out of town.....</p>
   <p>The banquet was opened by the president, Mr. Nicholas Tymush, with a few impressive words, after which the Lord's Prayer, "Our Father," was repeated. Many of the guests spoke during the banquet, which terminated with the prayer "Ave Maria" and the Ukrainian national anthem. The dancing which followed and which lasted until a late hour was enjoyed by everyone.</p>
   <p>The proceeds from this affair are to be used toward the building of a <pb facs="5425703_0542.jpg" n="2"/>Ukrainian national home in the village of Yhersko. The committee takes this opportunity to extend its heartfelt thanks to all the guests and friends for their kind attendance and to all the ladies and gentlemen for their loyal work in helping to make this celebration a success.</p>
   <p>For the Committee</p>
   <p>Nicholas Yankevich, Nicholas Tymush,</p>
   <p>Gregory Kukta, and John Kozak.</p>
