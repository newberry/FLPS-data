   <p>The most important event in the life of the Chicago Ukrainian community is the appearance of the Ukrainian newspaper Ukraina. For a long time there has been felt very keenly the lack of such a Ukrainian medium. Many an effort has been made in this direction; yet they all came to naught, not so much because of lack of the material aid, but rather because of the want of people who could sacrifice their time and labor toward the publication.</p>
   <p>It was just with the arrival of Mr. G. T. Popel in Chicago that the matter of the newspaper has been definitely settled. With the moral and material support of the Chicago community, a weekly paper in Chicago began its existence. As its title shows, it is supposed to be a medium altogether independent from all parties--a national-patriotic progressive newspaper, the kind that for a long time was lacking, not only in the West but also in all America as well.</p>
   <p>One should expect that Ukraina will always remain faithful to its slogan as <pb facs="5425703_0284.jpg" n="2"/>evinced by the title it carries at the very heading of the same.</p>
