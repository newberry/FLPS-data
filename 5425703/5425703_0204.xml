   <p>Our church choir (Nycola Lysenka choir) was highly praised by the Procopiun newspaper (a college edition) for their part in the concert given in honor of the Golden Jubilee of the Benedictine Fathers of St. Procopius Abbey.</p>
   <p>The concert which started shortly after 3 o'clock Sunday February 24, was formally opened by the St. Procopius Band, under the direction of the Rev. Francis Sindelar, O.S.B. with the "March Pontificale" by Gould. Next came a welcome address by George Petrus, president of the Holy Nome Society, and a talk on the significance of the day, by the Rev. Walter Jendrusak, O.S.B.</p>
   <p>The "the most attractive feature" (as the Procopius Newspaper classed it) of the afternoon--the concert by Nycola Lysenko Ukrainian choir of St. Nicholas church, Chicago (here the Cossack chorus was, through some mistake or other, left out.)</p>
   <p>As a prelude to its concert,--the choir, under the direction of Mr. Dmitro Atamanec, sang three religious numbers among them the famous Techaikowsky Credo. Next came an operetta in three acts "Zaporozets Za Dunajem "(Cossacks from the Danube District). After a few selections from the Cossack chorus and a few group dances, which to most of the one thousand in the sudience were a novelty came a few solos.</p>
