   <p>No new thought or idea will be accepted by the nation unless it first finds its roots in the family life of the people.</p>
   <p>No reformation will spread itself in the nation if it is opposed to the family.</p>
   <p>No religion will exist that is against the family.</p>
   <p>No special education would do us any good if the family be not able to acquire it.</p>
   <p>The first main bond of the political and economical sphere is the family life.</p>
   <p>A nation is more or less an artificially complicated product. The <pb facs="5425703_0057.jpg" n="2"/>state is the creation of the brain. The family is a natural creation of the human life. It is based on instincts or human nature. This is why family life is eternal.</p>
   <p>It takes its start before all other institutions, before the states, churches and nations. They can fall or transform themselves, but the family life will remain.</p>
   <p>Disharmonious living of the family gives rise to prostitution, drunkenness, wrongs, generally speaking. A profound, good living in the family keeps the husband at home; gives him satisfaction; makes him a good workingman, energetic and scrupulous.</p>
   <p>The family consists of father, mother and children.</p>
   <p>The father provides for the home; the mother directs the home and rears the children.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0058.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Only this man, who cares for his home, can be considered as a good husband and father.</p>
   <p>Only this woman, who thoughtfully directs the home and rears the children in a painstaking way can be called a good wife, and has the right to be a mother.</p>
   <p>Only such a child, who willingly learns everything that is good, is competent to become a good member of the community and the nation in the future.</p>
   <p>If you want to raise your nation and community, start your work with the family, which is the only way to crown your work with success. When the life of the family is blissful then the whole community must be blissful.</p>
   <p>The mother is the foundation of the family.</p>
