  <body>
   <p>Dr. Vladimir Sieminovich was born on January 4, 1862 in Monastersky (county of Buczacz [in the Ukraine]), the son of a priest. His father's name was Leo, and the maiden name of his mother, Domicelia, was Turkevich. The mother of Dr. Sieminovich is still living; she is ninety-five years of age. Dr. Sieminovich received his early schooling in Buczacz, Berezan, Stanislawow and Lwow. University studies included at first law (two years) at Lwow, and later medicine at the John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; and after that, one year of medicine at Prague, a year at Vienna, a course at Cracow, one at Berlin, and one in Paris at the Sorbonne. These are the best universities of the world.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sieminovich has lived in America for the past thirty-nine years. At first, he lived in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, where he edited the <pb facs="5425703_0834.jpg" n="2"/>first Ukrainian newspaper in America, the weekly America. He worked there one year and a half. Then he went to Europe as delegate to Cardinal S. Sembratovich in Lwow, to obtain Ukrainian priests for the Ukrainians of America. He brought back Father Andruchovich. Dr. Sieminovich organized, or helped to organize, many Ukrainian churches in the United States. The first parish in Chicago was organized in a hall above a saloon at Robey and Homer Streets, twenty years ago. Dr. Sieminovich has worked in Chicago for the last thirty-two years. When he first came, there were no Ukrainians here from Galicia, except for a few Lemkos and Carpathian Ukrainians. The first mass in Chicago was celebrated by the Rev. Father G. Tsmaylo Kulchytsky in the hall under the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, at Noble and Blanche Streets. Dr. Sieminovich took active part in the organizing of the oldest Ukrainian society in Chicago, the Society of George Solomeychuk (later changed to Society of St. Nicholas). This is Branch 106 of the Ukrainian National Association.</p>
   <p>The first Ukrainian church in Chicago was situated at Bickerdike and <pb facs="5425703_0835.jpg" n="3"/>Superior Streets, and was purchased from the Swedes for $5,750. Dr. Sieminovich, along with the late Attorney Yanovich, signed notes for this amount. The above-mentioned amount also included the purchase of a parish house. The same group sold all this property and bought a large tract at Oakley and Rice Streets for the sum of $16,000. This tract included sixteen lots at one thousand dollars per lot, and is the site where the large Ukrainian Church now stands. Before the parish took possession of the property, quarrels began because part of the people wanted the Orthodox Church. Dr. Sieminovich stood for the Catholic Church, whereupon, upon his recommendation, the bank loaned the money without the signature of Mr. Fetzura, who was unwilling to sign because he wanted the Orthodox Church. Dr. Sieminovich vouched for the loan with his own securities and the bank issued the money.</p>
   <p>The first newspaper in Chicago was Ukraina which lasted for a few years. It began during the war. In the first issue of Ukraina, Dr. Sieminovich published the following proclamation: Organize a Ukrainian legion here <pb facs="5425703_0836.jpg" n="4"/>under the guidance of Roosevelt. The first to oppose this were the socialists from the "Federation", even though Dr. Sieminovich was their head. Mr. Semeshko, especially, voiced his opinion against the creation of the legion; he is now some commissar in Russia. He came here from Siberia.</p>
   <p>Besides the Ukraina, the Ranna Zorya (Morning Star) appeared for about a year. It was the organ of the Ukrainian Women's Alliance, which was organized on the same principles as the Ukrainian National Association. The administration was carried out wonderfully by a woman who came from Lwow, and who was the wife f a Croatian, Mr. Zubsich. This paper collapsed because of local misunderstandings. Dr. Sieminovich was also the editor of this paper. Dr. Sieminovich was co-editor for many Ukrainian newspapers in the old country, such as Dilo (Action) and Ukrainske Slove (The Ukrainian Voice). In America, he wrote for the Svoboda (Liberty), America, and the Narodna Vola (National Will). Twice he visited the Ukrainian colonies in Canada, where he organized <pb facs="5425703_0837.jpg" n="5"/>the Ukrainian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sieminovich has a great knowledge of life. One of the basic features of his character is the value which he attributes to women. He says that women are as important to any cause as the soil is to the feeding of people. When we turn due attention on our women, we will find that the idea of our freedom was originated by them generations ago.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we turn our Sitch organ over to the guidance of the worker mentioned above. The Chief Ataman [Hetman] and the Sitch Central Committee could not have made a better selection; they sent to Dr. Sieminovich the deputation to which he pledged his best efforts. He will certainly exert all of his imposing energy and all his knowledge of life, for he has seen many things on this earth and has been through a great deal.</p>
