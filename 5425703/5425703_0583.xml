<title level="a">ELECTIONS AT THE SIEGE ORGANIZATION</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>It was decided at the Siege Convention held in Cleveland during the last three days of May, that the Siege organization headquarters should continue to be in Chicago. Therefore, to facilitate the work, the executive staff of the headquarters was elected from the Ukrainian-American citizens of Chicago who belong to the Siege organization.</p>
   <p>According to the amendment of the by-laws, they first elected officers of and for the respective districts, namely: Michael Kotsiuk, major of the first district; Dr. Stephen K. Hrynevetsky, major of the second district; John Voytsitsky, major of the third district.</p>
   <p>Because of the fact that both the second district and the Siege headquarters are in Chicago, Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky became the head major or chief executive of the Siege organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0584.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Then followed the election of the general recording secretary. At this point all members present unanimously agreed that all the executive members of last year remain the same. S. Musiychuk, however, stated that he could not accept the office due to the fact that he is exhausted, because of the heavy work cast upon his shoulders for the past two years.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hrynevetsky, chief executive made a motion and Mr. M. Kotsiuk seconded it that Mr. Musiychuk accept for this year the managership of the Siege News, as well as the office of the general secretary of the organization for which he is to receive a steady weekly salary sufficient for the upkeep of himself and his family. All unanimously agreed. All subsequent resignations of Musiychuk were rejected and thus, without a single opposition on the part of the electors, he was elected manager of the Siege press and recording secretary of the organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0585.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Nicholas Pashko also stated firmly that it would be impossible for him to accept the office of financial secretary; therefore, Michael Sarabun was elected in his stead.</p>
   <p>John Shkraba was re-elected general cashier.</p>
   <p>The Comptrolling Committee includes all the district majors, whose travelling expenses to the headquarters are paid by the general financial secretary. The elected officers each gave a very short speech of thanks for the confidence the electors had in them.</p>
   <p>The Convention also decided that every district should have at least one picnic every year.</p>
   <p>Then followed the general swearing in of the newly elected officers, whereupon the convention came to an end.</p>
   <p>The last short speech was a culminating point at which a unanimous <pb facs="5425703_0586.jpg" n="4"/>resolution was made by all the delegates present to work and do everything in their power to make the Siege Organization a success, which in turn will help to free Mother Ukrainia from the Polish yoke.</p>
   <p>As a grand finale three national anthems were sung: "Ukrainia Still Lives"; "No Longer Shall We Serve"; "There on the Yonder Hill Siege Marches."</p>
   <p>Anthony Stangrytchuk, Joseph Potochny, secretaries of Conventions.</p>
