   <p>Hear ye, hear ye, what happened in Chicago on the South Side, at 50th and Paulina Sts., at the Ukrainian Catholic Church. As soon as the services in the church were over, before twelve noon, the observer noticed on the street a riotous crowd making a great commotion. What happened? Two communists, Trotskyists, were being milled around and were given a good thrashing by the Siege members. Communists Chub and A. Parubey had come to the church as usual, with the Bolshevistic handbills that are intended to injure the cause of Eastern Galicia, occupied by Poland. But our Siege members, found it out sooner than expected and dealt with the two Communists accordingly. The curious observer wanted to see the Trotskyists but the crowd was so thick that he did not have a chance. However, beating of the two was plainly <pb facs="5425703_0449.jpg" n="2"/>audible despite the crowding and loud talking. After they received enough of it, the two Trotskyists, almost martyrs, ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Some of the Siege members followed them and from time to time gave them a little assistance with a swift kick, thus trying to help them to get back to Lenin for a Red Celebration. The two servants of Lenin and Trotsky will surely remember the treat they received from the Ukrainian Cossacks on the South Side of Chicago. Never again will they dare, nor advise anybody else to approach the Ukrainain Cossacks with Communistic propaganda.</p>
