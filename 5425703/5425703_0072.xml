   <p>A great injustice is being perpetrated upon the Ukrainian nation; injustice that cries out to heaven for vengeance!</p>
   <p>During the World War, we honorably and honestly fulfilled our duties toward our American Government.</p>
   <p>We gave the American Government everything we could to help America win in the World War.</p>
   <p>We spent large sums of money, which we earned by the sweat of our brow, in purchasing the American Liberty Bonds.</p>
   <p>At the call to the colors by the American Government, thousands of Ukrainians <pb facs="5425703_0073.jpg" n="2"/>joined the United States Army, and shoulder-to-shoulder we fought and shed our blood, helping America to gain victory, glory, and power.</p>
   <p>And What an Irony of Life!</p>
   <p>The ex-President, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, in the name of the Allies and of the American Government, solemnly declared that we should go beyond the sea to destroy the aggressive robbers and imperialistic militarism, and win independence for all subjected nations.</p>
   <p>Ex-President Wilson, in the name of the American Government, in the name of the American Nation, solemnly declared before the whole world that we would fight for justice, and that all the subjected nations will get their freedom and independence.</p>
   <p>We sincerely believed that ex-President Wilson meant what he said and would <pb facs="5425703_0074.jpg" n="3"/>show himself actually a great and just man. We trusted that when he spoke in the name of the whole American People, that he would fulfill all his promises to the letter.</p>
   <p>We trusted that at the Peace Conference in Paris, the then President Wilson would defend the rights of the Ukrainian subjected territory in Eastern Galicia.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Wilson shamelessly did not keep his promise to us. For our honest-to-goodness loyalty and our great sacrifices, given during the World War, in the name of and for justice, he paid us back with terrible injustice. In an understanding with the Allies, he, in the name of the American Government, agreed that the bloody charlatan Haller, the Polish count, who is at the head of the Polish legions which were organized in America, could go and murder the Ukrainians; our fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters in Eastern Galicia.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0075.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This shamefully horrible act to which Mr. Wilson agreed is being perpetrated even to the present day.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. Wilson and the Allies promised justice and independence for all subjected nations, Mr. Wilson was the first one who ruthlessly stepped upon and permitted the savage Polish bandits to murder the Ukrainian people, and pillage and plunder our Ukrainian land to the very utmost.</p>
   <p>We cannot keep silent! We cannot plead any longer!</p>
   <p>We, American-Ukrainians, have a full right not to ask, but to demand that the American Government right this wrong!</p>
   <p>Our hearts are cruelly wounded and bleeding, because of the injustice done us by ex-President Wilson.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0076.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>And we believe that our present American Government with that worthy and just Chief Executive President Warren G. Harding, will turn greater attention toward our just cause, and see to it we are treated on the level with other Nations.</p>
   <p>Siege fellow-members! I, as a veteran of the American army, and your present Siege leader, call upon you: Let us be loyal to the United States of America as well as to our present American Government.</p>
   <p>I together with you feel a terrible heartache for the injustice perpetrated upon the Ukrainian nation, and it is our sacred duty to mourn and sympathize with our people and our dear subjected Mother-Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>I, from the very bottom of my heart, call upon you, and with a thundering voice command you: Wake up! Attention! Forward March!</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0077.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>All the Siege branches, as soon as possible should arrange conferences and meetings, and pass resolutions against the occupation of our Eastern Galicia by the Poles.</p>
   <p>Every Siege branch, without delay, must send a firm protest demanding the withdrawal of the Polish Pillaging soldiers and armed bandit police from Eastern Galicia, restoring her independence.</p>
   <p>Send your protest to President Harding, to the Senate, and the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>We believe that the present American Government, with President Harding at its head will consider our cause just; they will understand their reciprocal obligation, their indebtedness toward us has yet to be paid us--the indebtedness to us that was incurred by the former government during the World War.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0078.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Otherwise our place is there, beyond the sea, where we must sacrifice our very lives for the cause of freedom and independence for Ukrainia.</p>
