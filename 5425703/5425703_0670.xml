   <p>On July 1st, the Ukrainian Cossack Chorus of Chicago, conducted by S. Czuba and affiliated with the Ukrainian American Catholic Youth Organization, celebrated its first anniversary. Most appropriately they sang High Mass, and though this was the first performance of the kind, it served to effect the listeners most pleasantly. It showed that with cooperated energy little things develop to great indispensable realizations. It proved that work and patience can promote everlasting beauty. In the afternoon a picnic was arranged by the chorus members to which all were invited and at which all enjoyed themselves. The profit from the picnic was donated to the fund for the school soon to be built at the St. Nicholas Parish.</p>
   <p>Though the weather is very warm the Ukrainian American Catholic Organization meets every Friday. A new attraction to keep the membership steady is a library which was officially opened July 20th. Though the library is simple and the collection not immense it is already beginning to expand. Members of the organization are privileged to draw books. Baseball is keeping both the boys and girls physically active. A group of boys are now publishing a new weekly in Chicago, called <pb facs="5425703_0671.jpg" n="2"/>U. Y. O. A. Weekly (Ukrainian Youth's of America Weekly). The editor of this organ is N. Matviuw, and the business manager is J. Prietula.</p>
