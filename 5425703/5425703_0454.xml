   <p>Wherever one turns his head, even in the most forgotten nook occupied by immigrants, we find that these various foreign groups are energetically trying to do something profitable for their own people.</p>
   <p>So also we Ukrainian immigrants in the land of Washington are trying to do something profitable. However, the climate of this country seems to affect some individuals of ours in a negative way.</p>
   <p>We have good intentions and make enthusiastic beginnings, but these are insufficient to carry anything to a successful end.</p>
   <p>There was a Sitch congress from May 1 to May 3 this year in Pittsburgh. After electing new officers for the organization they decided to move the Sitch <pb facs="5425703_0455.jpg" n="2"/>headquarters from New York to Chicago. After this charge we expected things to run more smoothly. But alas! The outcome is such that some have lost the energy to continue the work in that particular field. They walk independent and detached, and yet trying to find out what is going to happen tomorrow. And just as usual, as soon as anything is started, there will always be some people acting as an impediment, but they hide themselves behind the fence to conceal their stained faces, knowing that their reputation for making trouble will easily be discovered.</p>
   <p>Now that we are worse disorganized than ever, we can hardly appreciate the value of solidarity. However, to understand public indifference in the political field in America, we have to explain it with this one thing: there are some maniacs who run from one meeting to another, just annoying the people by criticizing anybody and everything everywhere, and thereby trying to force themselves to leadership--absurd! The people have lost faith in them. They appear <pb facs="5425703_0456.jpg" n="3"/>on exposure like trunks of rotten trees, characterless and nameless, ready to collapse.</p>
   <p>Strange it is that such persons, usually with hardly any education or training whatsoever, have the audacity to get up before the public and to try to tell them something. The audience is so much disgusted with them that whenever afterwards any worth-while speaker wants to address them, they are so much sated with listening to worthless talkers that they are reluctant to listen to anybody at all.</p>
   <p>Look around then, and try to find anybody who would listen to talk of higher ideals, self-sacrifice, and love of one's people and of the country in which one lives. Yes, those maniacs who sweated in the attempt to prove that they are the only leaders of the people should receive their due reward for their wicked work against the Ukrainian people.</p>
   <p>Soon the whole thing will come to the surface, and we shall all see clearly the <pb facs="5425703_0457.jpg" n="4"/>malefactors in their true colors and find out that their vicious work, sociologically and politically speaking, perpetrated against the immigrants in America cannot escape notice, nor will the history of immigration overlook them.</p>
   <p>Now more than ever is the time when every movement, word, and action should be most precious because not only Ukrainian history but even world history will take note of how we Ukrainians have taken advantage of the present opportune time in comparison with other peoples--what gains, what progress we have made.</p>
   <p>But look! What are we doing? The opportune time is at hand, and in the face of it we apparently have become indifferent. We want liberty and freedom for ourselves and for our children; we desire with all our hearts that over there in Ukrainia there shall be as much freedom as we have here. We wish it so sincerely! (Wish is the desire that the thing which you long to have may come <pb facs="5425703_0458.jpg" n="5"/>to you; but to will to have something means to go after the thing that you want.)</p>
   <p>Shevchenko the poet says:</p>
   <p>"As for me, brother, I shall hope for it and expect it, and I shall add it to the yearnings of my heart."</p>
   <p>He foretold that his poems, his call, would beget new fighters for honor, glory, brotherhood, and the freedom of the Ukrainian people. Here is some of the poem:</p>
   <p>"There will sprout and grow up</p>
   <p>In that lovely land people</p>
   <p>Who will pierce the rotten heart</p>
   <p>Of the vicious one and will drain away</p>
   <p>The deadly decayed blood, and</p>
   <p>Instead they will refill the heart</p>
   <p>With life-giving blood of the mighty Cossacks."</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0459.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Oh, yes! And so they will grow up! But how long do we still have to grow? Is living a few hundred years under the yoke of our enemies not enough for us? Have we accustomed ourselves so much to concentration camps and dungeons for political reasons that we cannot lift up our heads and look with the eyes of a free people? But alas, some of us seem to think that a life of freedom belongs to a martyr who is rewarded with freedom only after death. We have completed our martyrdom, and unless we break the chains of captivity and oppression right now, we are likely never to have another opportunity to do so. Apparently we won our freedom in 1918, but wicked and uncalled-for leaders ensnare us, trying to fetter us again. Shevchenko silently looking at them spoke of them:</p>
   <p>"Slaves, stool pigeons, filth of Moscow,</p>
   <p>Garbage of Warsaw....."</p>
   <p>Let us now repeat these words with such powerful energy behind them that they <pb facs="5425703_0460.jpg" n="7"/>will terrorize all those who are seeking to fetter us!</p>
   <p>Thus, eagles, soldiers, if we fail to help our native land, let us remember that should we go back to her, we shall be unworthy of becoming American citizens if we declined to defend [the United States]. No man can call himself the son of a country, and at the same time prove himself a traitor against that country. When at the critical hour the country calls you with the words: "Join and fight for freedom!" what mockery it would be to refuse the call and to continue to hope and to wait for better days to come?</p>
   <p>Today, when we swarm and create groups of Sitch fighters everywhere, not one should leave his group without a serious reason. Every one should join his local Sitch group and become impregnated with its ideals and foster its spirit and always be ready to fight for the rights and the freedom of this country as well as for those of Ukrainia.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0461.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Never must we become discouraged because of the fact that we were misled by some one's showing us in a dark room a black cat which was not there. We should get a lesson out of it and become in the future more observant and more critical; in other words, we should pass those things through the sieve of our reason, and anticipate the possible true results instead, not letting disappointment creep over us and make us utterly despondent.</p>
   <p>We still call on you, youth; join one of our local groups, and thus you will have done part of your duty. We must not take a matter of such grave weight trivially, for the curse of our negligence, will fall upon us and upon our children.</p>
   <p>Sitch is and should be a source of every liberating and cultural movement, and therefore let us, one and all, understand that united in Sitch groups, we jointly can accomplish great things.</p>
   <p>N. N., Sitch member</p>
