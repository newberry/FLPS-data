   <p>In September 1930 a hundred years have passed since on the site of today's Chicago, the first white people settled down. At this time I wish to say a few words on the history of Chicago, and especially on the beginning of our Ukrainian immigration into this city.</p>
   <p>Chicago is situated on the river known by the same name, which today divides the city into three parts. Once this vicinity was a muddy space, the main part being a thick forest, which only the Indians had lived on. Just a hundred years ago the white people began to settle here. They had to carry on a persistent war with the Indians, who would not let the white people into their habitat.</p>
   <p>The first white person who saw this territory, about ten or more years before the white people had settled here permanently, was a French <pb facs="5425703_0615.jpg" n="2"/>Jesuit priest, Father Marquette, who tried to convert the Indians to the Christian faith. He died in this region. When more white people appeared on the site of this town, the federal government constructed a defensive fort on the island between the two branches of the Chicago River, and named it after its first commander, Fort Dearborn.</p>
   <p>In a short time the Indians attacked Fort Dearborn, and mowed down not only the small number of soldiers, but all the rest of the white inhabitants who sheltered themselves here from the Indians.</p>
   <p>From this time on there were more whites settled, and in 1833 the colony of Chicago received its city charter.</p>
   <p>And we Ukrainians too form a part of the colonization in this world renowned city.</p>
   <p>How many Ukrainians there are living in Chicago no one knows exactly, <pb facs="5425703_0616.jpg" n="3"/>for there is no complete census available. The number is estimated from fifteen to thirty thousand; if we take the median we may surely number them to the amount of twenty thousand.</p>
   <p>I came to Chicago from Shamokin, Pa., where I practiced medicine in the year 1893. I came hither only because at that time the Chicago World's Fair was in progress and also to visit my friend, the late Stephen Yanovich, who conducted a law office in this metropolis.</p>
   <p>At that time there were so few Ukrainians in Chicago that one could count them on his fingers. They were mostly the Lemko-Ukrainians, who then called themselves "Slovaks" instead of Ukrainians or Carpathian-Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>Here was a Russian church located at Center Avenue, far back of the railroad tracks, beyond the 16th street. Thither I went to church, trying to find my own natives. It was useless, for there was only a few <pb facs="5425703_0617.jpg" n="4"/>Hungarian-Ukrainians, calling themselves "Hungarian-Russians."</p>
   <p>This went on for about three years. In the end the Lemko-Ukrainians began to flock in. With them I tried to organize at least a small church, for this was the only way to organize our people into a group. At first we called priests from distant places, even if it were for only one Sunday service. The first priest who came to us was a Hungarian-Ukrainian, whose name I have forgotten. At that time there was not a large enough number of our people, even among the Carpathian-Ukrainians, so that we could organize a separate permanent parish. That is why we were quite satisfied with the services, the priest performed in the basement of St. Stanislaw Kostka's Church, Noble and Bradley streets. After some time we called the late Father Konstankewicz from Shamokin, Pa., and started to organize the parish all over again, at this time were likewise unsuccessful. Later on we called Father Izmaylo Kulchytsky. Now there were a few scores of our people already. Father Kulchytsky celebrated his first holy mass in a settlement house on Noble and Augusta <pb facs="5425703_0618.jpg" n="5"/>Streets. Now it appeared to us that people did not want to rent out places for services from the Poles any more. That is why we obtained the permission to use the American settlement house for our services.</p>
   <p>This time we really started to organize a parish in Chicago. We held a few meetings at my home, because Father Kulchytsky lived with me. This was about ten years after my coming to Chicago. But it was found out that there was not enough of us to support a priest, not to speak about building or buying a church. So again we postponed organizing the church for some time. In the end Father Kowalitsky came on his own accord; he was a Carpathian Ukrainian priest. We called a few of the leading people together: the late Mr. Fetzura, Mr. Vitzarsky, and others, and decided to call a general meeting of our Ukrainian Greek-Catholics. The meeting was held above a saloon on Robey (now Damen Avenue) and Homer Street. Here we put together a few hundred dollars to buy a church. At that time a Swedish church together with a small <pb facs="5425703_0619.jpg" n="6"/>home for a priest was for sale on Superior and Bickerdyke Streets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Yanovich and myself gave a few hundred dollars as a down payment, and for the rest we signed a note, which bought this church and home. Our first Ukrainian services were held here. But before this, there was a great deal of trouble, for some of our Lemko-Ukrainians (Mountaineers), especially the late Mr. Fetzura, and a few Ukrainians from lower Hungary, did not want Ukrainian Greek-Catholic church, but the Orthodox one. The majority however wanted the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, which remained so.</p>
   <p>Afterwards trouble started again, for the Carpathian Ukrainians wanted to have their own way about the services and the Lemkos wished their own. This was very unharmonious at times; for the Galician Ukrainians sang in their manner, and the Carpathian Ukrainians in their own fashion.</p>
   <p>In order to overcome this distress, I organized a church chorus, which <pb facs="5425703_0620.jpg" n="7"/>checked the misunderstandings for a while. Afterwards, during the second year of Father Kowalitsky's pastorate again a disagreement arose, because our Galician element was growing stronger and started to demand the resignation of the Carpathian Ukrainian priest, asking for their own. Yet Father Kowalitsky would not resign.</p>
   <p>This disorder led to the expulsion of the priest with the aid of the police. This conflict was inspired by a Galician Ukrainian, Mr. Kowalsky.</p>
   <p>Thus our church was left without a priest. Easter was near and we could not get any priest. The people began to be confused.</p>
   <p>Then we, together with Mr. Kowalsky, turned to Pennsylvania for a priest. At that time we had not our own bishop, so we had to seek a priest ourselves. But no priest was too eager to starve in Chicago. In desperation, Mr. Kowalsky, who is now a fireman, found a Polish Orthodox priest, <pb facs="5425703_0621.jpg" n="8"/>Father Pociecha, who knew a little of our liturgy. This orthodox priest celebrated the Ukrainian Easter services as best he knew. Anyway, the people were satisfied with such a priest.</p>
   <p>Shortly afterwards there came to Chicago from Canada, Father Nicholas Strutynsky, who took over the Chicago parish. In a short time, our group grew so large that the church on Superior and Bickerdyke Streets became too small. Father Strutynsky then bought sixteen lots, where the church of St. Nicholas is now located, i. e., on Oakley and Rice Streets.</p>
   <p>At that time this vicinity had very few buildings. Together with Father Strutynsky we went to a Polish priest who was then building a church opposite our old one, to find out the name of the architect. Father Strutynsky consequently made plans for the new Ukrainian <pb facs="5425703_0622.jpg" n="9"/>church which exists now. At first we were going to make the interior with the Hutzul-Ukrainian embroidery designs, but it was found to be too expensive for our colony; so we put the Hutzulian embroidery design, only in the front of the church.</p>
   <p>The first civic society in Chicago was the one under the name of "Yurey Solomeychuk," whereof the members called it "Hutzul Solomeychuk," to honor the man who just then was arrested in Kolomeya by the Austrian- Polish officials for his patriotic revolutionary speeches. Upon completion of the church, the society moved with its library into the basement of the church, changing its name to "Brotherhood of St. Nicholas, Branch 106, of the Ukrainian National Association," and thus it was incorporated.</p>
   <p>The library, which cost nearly $250, was likewise located in the hall of St. Nicholas Church. People borrowed books, but left no trace of <pb facs="5425703_0623.jpg" n="10"/>them, for once taken they were not returned.</p>
   <p>In the year of 1907 Dr. Stephen Hrynieviecky and his wife, Natalia, came to Chicago. The doctor and Madam Hrynieviecky began to take an active part in our community affairs; especially the late Madam Hrynieviecky, who undertook training a Ukrainian chorus.</p>
   <p>Through her expert instruction she gained fame among the Chicagoans. During one celebration at Grant Park, in the heart of the city, she led all the assembled choruses of Chicago that numbered more than a thousand singers. In this ensemble the chorus of Madam Hrynieviecky also took part, of course.</p>
   <p>Today Chicago has four Ukrainian Greek-Catholic churches and parishes, and a church for the Carpathian Ukrainians; one orthodox and one national independent church, besides. For the present these few reminiscences on the Ukrainians in Chicago will be sufficient. In the future I will write something on a larger scale.</p>
