   <p>At all the public demonstrations, parades, picnics, and even concerts sponsored by the Chicago division of Sitch, or by other Ukrainian groups, the need of a good Ukrainian band has been felt by all. Some of us thought that we could not tolerate this lack any longer and therefore occupied ourselves with the organization of such a band. This work will not be difficult because we found a young man who was looking for just a little encouragement to get started. This young man is Stanley Sabor, who has quite a reputation as a violinist and who also has had sufficient experience in directing a band. When approval of his plans was expressed by some of the executive officers at the Sitch head-quarters to back him up, this young man went to work.</p>
   <p>As a result, the Sitch band had its first rehearsal on Tuesday, March 27, 1934, <pb facs="5425703_0369.jpg" n="2"/>at the Sitch headquarters. The attendance was good. A new regulation permits the admittance of girls into the band.</p>
   <p>Anyone who wants to play in the Sitch band should come to the Sitch headquarters at 2406 West Chicago Avenue and sign up. We would like to have a large band. We have two baritones, two horns, and two basses on hand. Anyone who wishes to play any of these instruments may come, and the instruments will be loaned to him. For further information about the band, see Mr. Stanley Sabor at 2406 West Chicago Avenue, between the hours of 1 P. M. and 5 P. M.</p>
