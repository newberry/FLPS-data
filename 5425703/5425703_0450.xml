   <p>Mr. D. Zabolotsky opened the meeting with Sitch Greetings; following this, the members sang the song "There is No Time Any Longer."</p>
   <p>The unsettled business of the year was next on the program.</p>
   <p>The meeting decided when the Sitch festival of one of the largest branches, the Bohdan Chmelnitsky Branch No. 15, would take place. Conductor Theodore Choptiak and his male choir were asked to present a few numbers at the festival.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the net profit, $92.50, of the Sitch festival of June 19, should go to the Sitch press fund. Branch No. 15 added $7.50, and thus $100 was given for the Sitch press, which is about to be established.</p>
   <p>The following officers for 1921-1922 were elected: Commander, Mr. D. Zabolotsky; his assistant, Mr. Ivan Dmytriw; second lieutenants, Mr. Stanley Michalsky and <pb facs="5425703_0451.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Ivan Gabro; first lieutenants, Mr. Michael Husir and Mr. R. Boyko; flag and standard bearers, Mr. George Mashtal and Mr. F. Chornopysky; bugler, Mr. John Kozak; financial secretary, Mr. Stephen Muryn; cashier, Sam Boniakiwsky; recording secretary, Mr. Michael Dzyganowsky; comptrollers, Mr. Nicholas Hull and Mr. Michael Horodetsky; librarian, Michael Labuy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael Mayorchyk, head of the Chicago Sitch district, lined up the new officers and turned them over to Colonel P. Novodvorsky, who, after a few words of inspiration and encouragement, swore them in. In a short speech he compared them to those officers who were once elected in Zaporoze, beyong the Dnieper, in Ukraine.</p>
   <p>"There, before the election," he said, every nominee's faults were publicly brought to light. But once they were elected or appointed as officers, they were obeyed at all times, regardless of the nature of the command. Alas, with us it is somewhat different; when we elect officers, we give them a big ovation, but later we do not take their orders seriously enough. Let the newly-elected officers be prepared for, and anticipate from time to time, some antagonism from <pb facs="5425703_0452.jpg" n="3"/>the opposing political parties, remembering that it is sweet and honorable to suffer for Mother Ukraine.</p>
   <p>John Kozak and F. Chornopysky, Secretaries</p>
