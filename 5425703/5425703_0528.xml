   <p>On November 24, 1924, through the efforts of the Second Division of the Sitch Organization, a celebration was held commemorating the sixth anniversary of the conquering of Lviw by the Ukrainian armies. Those who witnessed this celebration surely thought that the Ukrainian group of Chicago had never held such a great celebration, and even questioned whether it was ever possible to witness a similar celebration anywhere in the United States.</p>
   <p>Already a few weeks before this day, great enthusiasm in anticipation could be noticed everywhere among our people.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, at 5 P. M., the hall at Oakley and Rice Streets, decorated with national colors, was filled.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0529.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the front wall hung portraits of patrons (renowned patriots) of every company of the Second Division. The portraits were illuminated with many colored lights. Near them stood about one hundred armed Sitch men and women, under the command of Ataman D. Zabolotsky, waiting to march to church for the requiem services to be held for the dead heroes of the Ukrainian armies.</p>
   <p>At six o'clock the church was filled. In the center was a sham grave decorated with flowers and grass, which represented the graves of the Ukrainian soldiers. On both sides of the grave stood uniformed Sitch members--totaling over one hundred in two long lines.</p>
   <p>Father F. Tarnawsky, gray but young in spirits, conducted the vespers. After the vespers he came to the pulpit and, loudly but shortly, vividly explained our struggle for the freedom of the Ukraine. He compared the holiday of November First--holiday of the resurrection of the Western Ukraine--with the <pb facs="5425703_0530.jpg" n="3"/>holiday of the resurrection of Christ. He concluded his sermon with the words of Shevchenko: "Wake up! Break the chains!"</p>
   <p>The requiem services then started. Standing were two priests, Father F. Tarnawsky and Father O. Prodan. The chorus was singing "Everlasting Memories." The Sitch members were standing at attention and saluting the heroes; chests were throbbing; hearts were pounding. From the green, decorated grave a faint voice seemed to be issuing: "Farewell brothers, we have honorably crossed the great road of love." The first part of the program was then over.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The second part of the celebration was going on in the hall. It was inaugurated by a vocal number by Mr. D. Zabolotsky. Then came a song by the women's choir directed by Mr. D. Atamanets. Other vocal selections as well as physical exercises, performed alternatively by boys and girls, followed. The leader was Mr. Stephen Musiychuk. There were also violin solos <pb facs="5425703_0531.jpg" n="4"/>(by Miss A. Motluk), singing by Miss Stephanie Tymkevych and Mrs. Stephanie Tsymbalist, and recitations by Mr. S. Musiychuk. After the solo vocal selections by Mr. D. Atamanets and Miss Anna Winiarska, Dr. O. Nazaruk, editor of Sitch, gave a ten-minute speech on the united front of all Ukrainians as a prerequisite of a free Ukraine.]</p>
   <p>After a short pause, the eighty leaders of all the companies of the Second Division appeared on the scene, followed by the Chief Ataman, Dr. Stephen Hrynevetsky. Mr. Stephen Musiychuk, the Secretary-General, read the special documents and handed them to the Chief Ataman as well as to the district leaders. Then Mr. Musiychuk read the special communications of the district managements, and, while delivering a truncheon into the hands of the Chief Ataman, pronounced these words: "With this truncheon we place into your hands the fate of our organization. This truncheon is not made of gold and is not covered with gems, but we believe that some day our Ukraine shall be free, and then this truncheon shall shine too, as was prophesied by Shevchenko:</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0532.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>'And then shall flare up the truncheon from the steppes of Ukraine.' "</p>
   <p>During the last few words, the truncheon rested in the hands of the Chief Ataman, Dr. Stephen Hrynevetsky--the chorus thundered the song "Glory, glory, Ataman!" With tears in his eyes, Dr. Hrynevetsky expressed his appreciation by assuring the audience that the truncheon belonged, not to him, but to a legitimate Hetman of Ukraine. Then he reaffirmed his word with a solemn oath and administered the oath to all the district leaders. He also nominated Rev. Father F. Tarnawsky as chaplain of the organization.</p>
   <p>The celebration was terminated with songs by a male chorus of seventy-five members, under the leadership of Mr. D. Atamanets.</p>
