   <p>The most complicated problem among the foreign citizens of the United States is to distinguish between emigration and immigration laws and passport regulations. Many immigrants living in America came here from the middle and eastern parts of Europe, where the consequences of the large European war began incredible changes in the states' rights, which up to today are not settled and reflect disadvantageously on the American immigrants who came from those countries. Many of them would like to go back to the old country or bring their families to America, but due to the abnormal situation and the rapid changes in the occupied territories by hostile nations, this is not easy to accomplish, because the American lawmakers adjust themselves to these abnormal European situation which is often changing, or are remedying the emigration and immigration procedure and the passport regulations, which must be followed along that line.</p>
   <p>But alas! often the immigrants cannot speak the English language fluently <pb facs="5425703_0720.jpg" n="2"/>enough to express themselves clearly. On this complicated question, and as a result of it, many a cheating agent profits by it a great deal, taking advantage of the immigrant to a point that is virtually impossible.</p>
   <p>This is oftentimes found among the Ukrainian immigrants who mostly come from the Eastern Galicia, Bakuvinia and Carpathian Ukraine. A long time ago these countries belonged to the Austrian monarchy, and now, with the agreement of the Peace Conference at Paris, these Ukrainians were partitioned: Eastern Galicia was ceded to Poland; Bakuvinia to Roumania; Carpathian Ukraine to Czechoslovakia. On account of this the Ukrainian immigrants have more difficulty in communicating with the old country than for instance, Italy, or some other country. When they are leaving America they frequently do not know how or to whom they should go for a passport, and sometimes fall in the hand of merciless cheaters.</p>
   <p>So, to remedy this and to protect the immigrant from exploitation, the American Red Cross opened a Foreign Language Bureau in New York, which <pb facs="5425703_0721.jpg" n="3"/>gives actual advice to foreigners in the cases of various laws of the United States, among them laws about coming to America and going to Europe. From the first of February, that is, from the time since the opening of the information bureau to the 30th of June of this year, 667 people turned to this information bureau for advice as to bringing their families to America; 972 people turned to the information bureau for advice on leaving America; 652 persons wanted to have their passports made out through it. It is understood that the information bureau cannot issue passports, but gives advice in which way they can be more easily obtained.</p>
   <p>During the time of the existence of the information bureau for the foreigners, which was put up by the American Red Cross, (it) helped and satisfied a few thousand people who turned to them for advice. Many of those are Ukrainians who number 750,000 in the United States of America.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0722.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Foreign Information Bureau, in which there is a Ukrainian branch, has its representative from Washington, who is well informed on the government organs, and notifies the Ukrainian branch of the information bureau about all changes and improvements of the government laws concerning foreign settlers in the United States.</p>
