   <p>The question, whom shall we follow for a leader, often arises and is rarely satisfactorily answered. Shall we follow older people? They have the advantage of years, but mere survival does not prove superior wisdom. They have observed failure and success, and have had more time to make mistakes but their experiences have been based upon bitterness. Why shouldn't we then follow Christ. Men require that their leader be wise, firm, brave, sympathetic and the possessor of ability to forget himself in his devotion to a noble and worthy cause. Does not Christ measure to these requirements? He is wise, for the experience of nearly two thousand years has revealed no folly in Him. No one was more firm, more courageous, more keenly aware of what human life can mean. There was no other who so freely gave self-oblivious devotion to a great and sufficient cause as He did. Man from all diversified influences needs solely some dominant integrating influence. He needs stimulus to unlock the store of energy within him. Christ can more than adequately supply a dominating and integrating influence. Let Him be the leader of followers.</p>

   <p>Let Him be the leader of young Ukrainians in the United States and Canada. Some people think that religion should interfere with nothing. Surely, it should not interfere, but it should guide us to do right for ourselves and for all. Christ was a leader for our forefathers, for even the earliest Cossacks at first fought in defense of Christ's words and not for political reasons. Now again, after the Great War the Ukrainian Youth in Europe are adopting Christ as their leader. Their motto: "Ukrainian Youth for Christ" is constantly shining ahead of all their activities and movements. Make Christ our leader too.</p>
