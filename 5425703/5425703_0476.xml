<title level="a">THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE BOHDAN CHMELNITSKY SIEGE BRANCH NO. 15</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Considering the aim of the Siege Organization, we find that outside the physical drills and spiritual excerises, there is also an educational phase to it whereby one gains knowledge and character. Here in America the Siege ought to place education ahead of other things. A Siege member of either sex, in America above all, ought to get enlightened on his native country, Ukrainia and he ought to know how to distinguish between things that are native and foreign to him. In the Siege, every member should gain knowledge, not only for himself, but to share it with others who did not have a chance to get it.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the Chicago Siege Branch undertook an educational work in order to get on the true path of its final goal. It established <pb facs="5425703_0477.jpg" n="2"/>a school for the illiterate, so that they may profit by the long winter evenings, and thus entirely eliminate illiteracy from our branch. All those who do not know how to read and write decided to begin to study with great earnestness, so as to learn at least the most elementary things by the next Spring. Harry Kryvovyaz, standard bearer, voluntarily applied for a position as teacher without any remuneration, eager to help the illiterate fellows join the ranks of those who know at least how to read and write in the vernacular language. Thanks to him for this, from every member of all the Siege branches!</p>
   <p>Morever, here they established a class of rhetoric and elocution, whose teacher is the chief Siege organizer, D. Didyk. He was the first one to give the initiative to a class of this kind, which is one of the most necessary ones in the Siege organization in America. In such a <pb facs="5425703_0478.jpg" n="3"/>school a Siege member can profit in two ways: (1) By acquiring knowledge and fearlessness, and thus being able, if need be to get up with a speech at a meeting or convention, and (2) Should any Siege member go back to his native land, he would be able to become a leader in a Ukrainian community, either in his native village or in another town.</p>
   <p>M. Moranetz voluntarily applied to give lectures on the history of the Cossacks, as well as on history in general.</p>
   <p>Then, it was decided that every member should learn and master some kind of trade for his own benefit, whether he stays here or goes back to his native country, where great scarcity of tradesmen is being felt. Should a number of Siege members return to the native land from America, they, as enlightened speakers and organizers and rounded out individuals will be able to help the Ukrainian cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0479.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Therefore, the work initiated in our branch is quite a desirable one at the present time. Let us, therefore, all get to work and, without any exception, let us become enlightened sons and daughters of our Mother Ukrainia, and some day the time will come when some of us shall be able to go back to our native country, where we would become desired adjuncts to work for the national cause and help liberate our loving Ukrainia!</p>
