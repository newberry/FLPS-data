   <p>Our newspaper lived through the crisis. For four weeks Ukraina was not published. The shareholders of the Ukrainian Publishing Company, to which our newspaper belongs, are of a strong and reliable character. They said: "We have given a great deal for the newspaper Ukraina already and will give still more for its continuation in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Besides this, a number of the Ukranians in Chicago, although they always boast that they are the best Ukrainians, are against the Ukrainian newspaper.</p>
   <p>Some oppose it because they are blinded by the red Soviet "internationalism" of the Russian Jews - in all cases where liberation work (has been done) by the Ukrainian peasants and workers on their own land. They look through the glasses of the Jews, Russians, Poles, Rumanians, Germans, French, and other nations, but not Ukrainian.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0275.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our Ukrainian newspaper is very gloomy for these Soviet friends. It voices the sentiment that the Ukrainian people must be their own boss and master on their soil; that the Ukrainian peasant and workingman have the right to keep his own order in his land; that for such as him they seem most fit and most profitable, and will not listen to any stories coming from Warsaw, Paris or Moscow.</p>
   <p>The second group of people in Chicago that oppose our newspaper consists of those who do not yet understand the value of their own newspaper.</p>
   <p>They really are not opposed to the newspaper, but you cannot expect any aid from them for they are indifferent.</p>
   <p>They fear everything, are indifferent to everything. They live only for themselves, yet are not altogether so bad after all.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0276.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There are people in Chicago who understand their obligations toward our nation.</p>
   <p>This group of people organized our newspaper and at all costs are keeping it up.</p>
   <p>In order to overcome the financial difficulties in which our newspaper found itself in the past time, our share owners put upon themselves a voluntary monthly fee.</p>
   <p>Ukraina in Chicago is the only Ukrainian medium in the middle western states which will continue in existence.</p>
