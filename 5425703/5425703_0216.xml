   <p>The Ukrainain cossack chorus under the direction of Samuel R.Czuba has entered the Chicagoland Music Festival and has made a good showing against the long organized professional choirs.</p>
   <p>The contest took place at the Drake Hotel on August 13, in which eleven choirs were entered, the Ukrainian cossack chorus being the youngest of them. All other choirs have been organized for at least ten years, while the Cossack only one year.</p>
   <p>First place was given to the Rotary Glee Club, directed by Frank Bennet; second place to the Bohemian Workingmen'w Choir, directed by Frank Kubina; third place to Morgan Park Choir, directed by Mr. Rose.</p>
   <p>The next day the female choir contest was given to Mrs. Bennet, the wife of Frank Bennet.</p>
