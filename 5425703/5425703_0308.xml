   <p>In Hanson Park, there has existed for a few years, in the 39th ward, the Ukrainian American Citizens Club. Much work has been done by Mr. J. Shumowsky, a citizen in that ward.</p>
   <p>In 1929, that club was considering a proposition, with a view of establishing an evening school, at the club. The proposition was accepted, and the evening school was to be opened not in 1929, but later, in 1930.</p>
   <p>This proposed school, was opened in April, 1930, and already at the opening, the attendance amounted to 50 pupils.</p>
   <p>For maintaining that school in proper state, the elected school board, composed of the citizens, - Messrs. M. Ryza, I.L. Stsimborsky, M. Yendzheyovsky, P. Zarubiy, W. Matveev, K. Sichevsky, and D. Shostak, worked very hard to supply it with the means of support.</p>
   <p>Mr. Steven Mussiychuk was appointed teacher of that evening school. The school is located at - 2254 North Mansfield Avenue, and the school meets three times a week, <pb facs="5425703_0309.jpg" n="2"/>namely; - on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The plan of teaching is as follows: Reading, and writing plainly in Ukrainian language, and beside that, athletic exercises, Ukrainian national dances, according to instructions of Auramenko, Ukrainian history, and Ukrainian folk songs. The teaching of religion is not considered to be a subject on the curriculum, because the parents of the evening school pupils, belong to different churches; to Catholic churches, and to Orthodox churches; and the teaching of religion is given to pupils at the church hall, to which their parents belong.</p>
   <p>Through the devoted work of the above mentioned teacher, was held the first concert, and the contest with a large program of all kinds of songs, declamations, dances, and athletic exercises. This first concert will be held on Saturday, July 19th, at 8 o'clock in the evening, at the auditorium of Municipal Park, at 6100 West Fullerton Avenue.</p>
