<title level="a">CHICAGO UKRAINIAN SIEGE BAND PLAYS AT THE LITHUANIAN MASS MEETING AGAINST POLES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Siege Band, under the capable leadership of John Barabash, its conductor, played at the Chicago Lithuanians' Mass meeting against the Poles.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously, this Lithuanian Day was also their Thanksgiving Day to America for its recognition of Lithuania as an independent State.</p>
   <p>There also were a number of other union bands, yet the Ukrainian Band was not only one of the biggest, but also, through its behavior, discipline, and training proved to be one of the best, according to the Lithuanian Mass Meeting Committee.</p>
   <p>In short, we might add that the Ukrainian Siege Band is becoming more and <pb facs="5425703_0427.jpg" n="2"/>more important and beginning to be well-known in the city of Chicago. We wish and hope that the members of the band will work hard to improve themselves, and under the capable leadership of its conductor John Barabash, the Ukrainian Band will become a first-class band, and will become known not only in Chicago, but also all over the United States. This will be not only important to the band, but it will also add to the joy of all the Ukrainian people.</p>
