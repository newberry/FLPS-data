<title level="a">THE AMERICAN PEACE DELEGATE,POLK, HELPS POLAND TO SEIZE GALICIA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Polish newspaper, National Daily, organ of the Polish banker Smulski, who is a personal friend of Paderewski, usually has very good information about all affairs concerning Poland, and about all the Polish propaganda and its official politics both in Europe and America.</p>
   <p>In the issue No. 266 of the above mentioned newspaper, of Nov. 12th, the editorial, "It, and let it be so," there are important data which throw light on the character of the Polish official circles headed by Paderewski and the delegates for the Peace Conference in Paris, and particularly on the character of Polk, the United States delegate with reference to the Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia.</p>
   <p>The Poles make great endeavors to make the Peace Conference in Paris, which has almost decided as to its taking the final step, to cede definitely Ukrainian Galicia to the Polish state forever.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0800.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Poles, who in a criminal way, aggressively with the force of arms, against the will of all the Ukrainian nation, occupied Ukrainian Galicia, are very much concerned and want to induce the Peace Conference in Paris to give them some title, whereby they could hold the Ukrainian land in the rapacious claws of the Polish white eagle.</p>
   <p>Mr. Polk, a delegate to the Peace Conference in Paris, a representative from this great American nation, waged war against the European autocracy to insure all the enslaved nations who are deprived of freedom and independence to give them justice; according to the Polish newspaper, he acted very favorably toward Poles in their robbing aggresiveness with reference to foreign lands, and in the first place toward Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia.</p>
   <p>Here is what the National Daily writes: "With reference to Eastern Galicia Mr. Korab Kucharski in his last letter from Paris writes favorable news.</p>
   <p>"Our general opinion is that the Polish affairs have been pushed aside <pb facs="5425703_0801.jpg" n="3"/>from the green table and our delegation, having folded their arms indifferently, follows a development of affairs foreign to us. However, to judge it to be so would be a mistake. President Paderewski told me: 'During the last three weeks I signed more notes and made more declarations than before during the congress session.'</p>
   <p>"As a matter of fact, within the last few days our delegation waged one of the most important, if not the heaviest fights at the congress. It was about ceding Lemberg and Eastern Galicia to Poland. This affair had been decided and buried in the mass of documents and memorials.</p>
   <p>"The highest tribunal had decreed that Eastern Galicia will be ceded to Poland for a stretch of fifteen years, and after that a plebiscite will take place as to where it is to belong.</p>
   <p>To lose Eastern Galicia would mean not only to lose the oil fields and the fertile land, but would mean also tearing down one of the main pillars of the Polish state.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0802.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"This view was directed by the activity of our delegates, Paderewski and Dmowski.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, our representatives when they learned about the decision of the Peace Conference with reference to Eastern Galicia, they did not take it for granted.</p>
   <p>"Paderewski succeeded, due to selected arguments and ceaseless activity for several weeks, in the first attempt to convince the congress.</p>
   <p>"The matter is altogether exceptional and extraordinary. The business about Eastern Galicia, although already decided a few days previously, was brought back before the highest tribunal.</p>
   <p>"Our representatives succeeded in breaking through the congress routine due to the American plenipotential delegate, Mr. Polk, who was so taken up with the arguments presented to him by them in their private conversation, that he interrupted the discussion which was in progress before <pb facs="5425703_0803.jpg" n="5"/>the highest tribunal and brought up the question about Eastern Galicia.</p>
   <p>"The French, Italian, and English delegates, on hearing this declaration unanimously decided that Eastern Galicia should be ceded to Poland without any further plebiscite. From now on we can consider that our endeavors are won already."</p>
   <p>Such information is given to the Americans through the Polish-American newspaper by the correspondent Korab-Kucharski, who is one of the noted Polish politicians in Paris. In the presence of the American Poles he handed in to Minister Polk a flattering acknowledgment of his zeal in favor of Poland.</p>
   <p>The American Poles ought to be thankful to Minister Polk for what he has done for Poland.</p>
   <p>Yet, for the Americans and the Ukrainians who stand for truth and justice, <pb facs="5425703_0804.jpg" n="6"/>the ardent undertaking by the American delegate, Mr. Polk, of the business about Eastern Galicia which was ratified later by the Paris conference (before Mr. Polk was there), was again sent back before the highest tribunal with this aim, that it be done in favor of the Poles, only because Mr. Polk was taken up in private conversation with the Polish representatives, appears to us at least queer, if nothing else.</p>
