   <p>The Ukrainian National choir, under the direction of Mr. George Benetzky, in Chicago, as was already mentioned in one of the previous numbers of Ukrainia, will take part in the "Chicago American Music Festival", which is arranged by The Chicago Daily Tribune, the largest American newspaper. In this festival, will take part, choirs, orchestras, and soloists from five states, namely, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa and Indiana.</p>
   <p>This festival "Chicagoland Music Festival", will be held on Saturday, August 23rd, of this year, at 8 o'clock, in the evening, at Soldiers" Field, Grant Park. The Soldiers' Field contains 100,000 seats. Choirs that will sing there, are composed of even more than 1,000 voices.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian National choir, is invited to sing there at the end of the festival, jointly, with other choirs, the well-known "Messiah" from the "Halleluyah", by Handel.</p>
   <p>The contest of the choirs will take place also, on Saturday, at 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon, in the "Great Northern Theatre."</p>
   <p>The contest will be held in the presence of the judges only.</p>
   <pb facs="5425703_0228.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There, the judges will arrange the place for the Ukrainian song also. There, in that theatre, in the presence of the judges, the Ukrainian national choir, by its appearance, will prove that we Ukrainians, have the great treasure- the Song, which makes every Ukrainian heart proud.</p>
   <p>We hope that the singers of the Ukrainian National choir in Chicago, will do their best in order that the Ukrainian Song should get the first prize; for, by this we will secure the honor for the Ukrainian people, and the director of the choir, Mr. Benetzky, will feel fully satisfied, and morally benefitted, having applied much of his time and hard work, not only for this contest, but, in general, to the field of the Ukrainian Song.</p>
   <p>God help the Ukrainian National choir on the 23rd day of August.</p>
