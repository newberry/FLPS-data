   <p>The Ukrainian Workers Home whose Chicago branch is located at 2457 West Chicago Avenue is a national organization whose purpose is to spread culture and education among its nationals in the United States. Headquarters of the above organization is in New York City.</p>
   <p>The Chicago branch was organized in 1914 but was reorganized in 1924 under the name of the United Ukrainian Toilers Organization. It is also connected with I. W. O. (International Workers Order) and Ukrainian Women's Educational Society under the name of Lesia Ukraininska. The United Workers Home also extends help and aids its nationals abroad whenever the opportunity arises. The above organization is non-partisan and any Ukrainian, regardless of his political affiliations, may join that organization. They hold their meetings twice a month at the Peoples Auditorium 2457 West Chicago Avenue. Frequently lectures and plays are given by the Ukrainian Workers Home in which the youthful organization of the I. W. O. takes a large part. The membership of the Ukrainian Workers Home is between 350 and 400.</p>
