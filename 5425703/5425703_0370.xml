   <p>The wedding of First Lieutenant Felix Chornopysky, of Chicago Siege Branch No. 15, District 2, and Miss Mary Yatsyshyn, a pretty Siege member, took place at St. Nicholas Church, Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street, on Sept. 14, 1924. The Lysenko Choir and the Siege Orchestra took part in the ceremonies, which were witnessed by a large number of people. The wedding celebration, truly a la Cossack, took place at 830 N. Main Street, and was attended by Siege members and representatives from several Ukrainian organizations active in the Chicago Ukrainian colony. Among the guests were the staff from the Siege headquarters and the trustees of St. Nicholas Church. The singing for the wedding banquet was in charge of the Siege Male Choir under conductor D. Atamanets.</p>
   <p>Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky was the first one to raise a toast to the newly wed couple, wishing them the best of luck for many years to come.</p>
   <p>Toward the end of the wedding entertainment, the general recording <pb facs="5425703_0371.jpg" n="2"/>secretary Stephen Musiychuk, in his usual poetical style, told the guests how lovely it is to belong to the Siege and other Ukrainian organizations, where members can spend from time to time a few sociable hours with their friends. He appealed to the guests not to forget, not even during this occasion, their duties toward the Siege, especially the Siege press. His appeal added $25. to the Siege Fund.</p>
   <p>The Siege headquarters has received the money and herewith wishes to thank all the contributors, especially First Lieutenant Felix Chornopysky and his bride, to whom it wishes health, happiness, and prosperity.</p>
