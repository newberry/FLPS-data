   <p>I have, on several occasions reminded the Jewish parents of their duties toward their children--[especially their duty] to give them a Jewish education. But this time I shall say something to the grown-up Jewish children.</p>
   <p>After hearing and seeing the way in which Jewish parents are mistreated by their grown-up children, I cannot but help pitying the parents in their plight. Now let us talk about the trouble and responsibilities the parents have in raising and training their children to maturity. Can't you sometimes picture in your own minds the strain and anxiety your parents have to endure while giving you the proper kind of rearing and training until you grow up? Most of the hardships in raising the child are,of course, expected of the mother. Many nights she does not get a chance to sleep. She does not eat in time--she devotes all of her energy and time for the comfort of the child. And when <pb facs="5423972_2_0098.jpg" n="2"/>the child is grown he thinks that he was just raised up by himself--that the parents had no trouble whatsoever in raising him. The children usually take it for granted that the task of making good citizens out of them was just a simple routine matter, and that their parents had nothing to do with implanting in them the proper training which makes good men and women; in other words, the parents do not get any thanks from their children for all the hardship they have gone through in bringing them up to maturity. The children forget it, and never think anything of it.</p>
   <p>Those children who possess a higher degree of education, knowing that they are more educated than their parents, show great contempt for them and are ashamed of them. Most of the American boys or girls are ashamed of their parents because they are too "green" for them. Such children never think of the trouble and anxiety their parents had during the time of their training. Hence these children leave their parents.</p>
   <p>Now what about the children of the religious Jews? The pious parents who give their children a proper religious training are very sad when they see their <pb facs="5423972_2_0099.jpg" n="3"/>children turn away from everything that looks Jewish. This is certainly a very, very sad feeling for the pious parents who value the Jewish religion higher than anything else in the world.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I appeal to you Jewish sons and daughters: Think of your solemn duty toward your loving parents! Do not forget their kindness to you and the sacrifices they made during the entire time when you were Jewish citizens in the making! Honor, respect, and love your parents for the great good they did for you! Show them your appreciation in their old age and by showering your love and affection upon them--for that is the only pay they expect of you. Your parents are the best and only friends who can be relied upon. It does not matter whether they are American or "green" ones. Pay them [for their efforts] with respect, appreciation, and love--for that is all they expect of you!</p>
