   <p>Be it resolved, that the Executive Board be requested to invite and receive applications for the position of minister of this congregation from Jewish Theologians of modern reform principles and of good repute, who have graduated at a German University with honor, are excellent also in all those branches of study which characterize the learned Rabbi of our day and who are good orators and able to preach in the German and English vernacular.</p>
   <p>Resolved, that inasmuch as circumstances over which we have no control, prevent a large number of our members and young Israel especially from attending public worship on the Biblical Sabbath, this congregation considers it an imperative duty to hold services on the common day of rest, and to this end it shall be the duty of the incoming minister to attend to all functions of his station on Sabbaths and festivals and to deliver lectures before this congregation on every Sunday.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1468.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Resolved that the incoming minister shall also take charge of our Sabbath School and devote a portion of his time to the instruction of a class of young men and ladies who have graduated at our Sabbath School and are desirous of making further advancement in Jewish lore and history.</p>
  </body>
