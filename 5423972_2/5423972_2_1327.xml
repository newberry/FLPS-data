   <p>Stirred by the question whether the Jews in America are an alien race or still are Jews but a part of the American nation, the Council of Jewish Women held a lively session of its convention yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>A report on the organization in the junior branch of the council by Fredric A. Fischel furnished the fuel for the outburst. He decried living on the defensive and added:</p>
   <p>"Our council is organized to make its members better Jews, to arouse in us the ambition to become true, active, conscientious representatives of American Judaism, to battle down the theory that we are Hebrews, so that we shall be known as Americans, as we actually are."</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch American</p>
   <p>Herman Wolff of Cincinnati cried at once that every member of the council should be proud to be called a Jew and not aspire to be known as an American. Others followed in the same line until Dr. Hirsch arose.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1328.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We cannot be good Jews and not be good Americans," declared Dr. Hirsch. "And we cannot be good Americans and not live up to the spirit and teachings of our race and religion. We are not Hebrews. The term is a misnomer. The Hebrew race is extinct. All the prophets of Israel thundered against it. We are Jews, but we also are Americans.</p>
   <p>"We must not say there is a double nation in America. My nationality is American and I would not change it. My religion does not prevent me from being one.</p>
   <p>"Little Rabbis" Rapped</p>
   <p>"Our rabbis should be more than more expounders of the law. The little rabbi knows only four subjects - "The Missionaries of Israel," "The Literature of the Jews," "The Fatherhood of the Soul," and "The Brotherhood of Man." He gives them in order, and when he has finished "The Brotherhood of Man" he starts again on "The Missionaries of Israel."</p>
   <p>Rabbi Schanfarber replied in impassioned and energetic words. He argued that they <pb facs="5423972_2_1329.jpg" n="3"/>should never forget that they are primarily Jews.</p>
   <p>At the evening session in the auditorium of Sinai Temple discussion of settlement work was led by Mrs. Edwin Wehle of Louisville. Mrs. Sadie T. Wald told of one section of Chicago where two bathtubs accommodate 223 persons.</p>
