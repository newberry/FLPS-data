   <p>Mrs. Becky Yazo discussed the question of the age at which a girl should marry but did not mention the chief factor, viz., her preparation for marriage.</p>
   <p>When we set out on an enterprise, the first question in our minds is our ability to handle it. How much necessary knowledge do I possess to make a success of it? Unfortunately, one seldom asks himself these questions when contemplating marriage. Problems are not considered then. It is good enough for anyone just to marry. If the girl only meets a suitable boy, she marries him.</p>
   <p>Marriage should not be viewed from the standpoint of age, but rather from the standpoint of aptness. One can be as apt at the age of eighteen as another at the age of twenty-five; and, on the other hand, one of twenty-five may not be as apt as one of eighteen. A girl who seeks to gain favor <pb facs="5423972_2_0047.jpg" n="2"/>by her outward appearance will never make a good housewife and a sensible mother, even if she doesn't marry until thirty.</p>
   <p>Marriage is approached frivolously. This holds good for both the boy and the girl. He need only be a spendthrift and present gifts, and she need only be good looking; nothing else matters. Little thought is given to the future. We seem not to think that in time he will stop giving gifts and that her appearance and dress will become outmoded. We do not realize that the honeymoon lasts but a very short time, and is followed by cold reality for the rest of married life. Married life consists of work, of being capable, of keeping the rooms clean and the house in order, and of managing so as to get by comfortably and pleasantly on small means; furthermore, it consists of rearing, washing, and taking care of small children, of having to go without parties, balls, theaters, and stylish clothes. The girl does not think of this when she is about to marry and that is why we see so many unhappy couples; and it is no wonder.</p>
   <p>Every faculty must be developed in a human being. The love for running a <pb facs="5423972_2_0048.jpg" n="3"/>house, for giving comfort to others, for keeping everything orderly ararranged, is, like any other good trait, born with the individual first and later developed.</p>
   <p>A girl who up to marriage, devotes all her time to her outward appearance only, loses the little ability imparted to her by nature. Being unprepared she is helpless and inept, not knowing how to make life pleasant for herself, for her husband, or for her children. After marriage a girl must needs forsake the old art of beautifying herself and refining her outward appearance for lack of means and time.</p>
   <p>Usually, after marriage the young wife is seldom dressed neatly. She walks about the house like a slattern, which is abhorent to her husband and friends. The house is kept unclean, the children filthy, and meals are not served at the regular hours. Instead of spending his time at home with his wife, the husband goes to some gambling joint. The wife is left alone every night.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0049.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In order to have a happier family life, women must be apt, skilful, and industrious. They must, however, be interested not only in dresses, cleanliness and housework, but also in cultural activities. The husband often takes refuge in gambling because he feels uncomfortable in his home, or because his wife seems to be rather uninteresting. It is true that a husband likes a well-dressed wife, but to speak of dresses is beyond the husband's scope of conversation. Most married people talk about domestic things, or money matters. Very seldom do they exchange opinions on world affairs, that is one of the reasons why men often leave their wives alone in the evening.</p>
   <p>Thus, I say that equality of age is not a guarantee for a happy life. It largely depends on how capable the girl is, to be industrious, to make a comfortable home, and to be able to talk about things other than house, dresses and cleanliness.</p>
