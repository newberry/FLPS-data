   <p>The tolerance of the present day is curiously illustrated by the fact that a church edifice at the West Side is used as a house of worship both by Christian and Jew. The church is at Henry and Johnson streets and has been used for some time as a synagogue by the congregation B'nai Abraham.</p>
   <p>The Jewish congregation is a reformed one, though not so radical in its tendencies as others in the city. It has prospered, and the members not long ago reached the conclusion that a new edifice was necessary. The church is a good sized handsome structure, but the Jews wanted to go further west. A site was purchased on Marshfield Avenue and a fortnight or so ago the corner stone was laid. In the meantime the old synagogue had been sold to the German Baptist church congregation, which was also in need of better quarters and thought the synagogue a good investment. Both congregations found themselves in a quandry. The Jews had seen a good opportunity to sell and by taking advantage of it had deprived themselves of a place of worship. The difficulty was adjusted in the most friendly spirit, the Baptists agreeing to let the Jewish congregation worship Saturdays, while they occupied the church Sundays. As the B'nai Abraham congregation worships only Saturdays, this <pb facs="5423972_2_1378.jpg" n="2"/>arrangement was eminently satisfactory and thus the Baptist and Jewish congregations are worshipping in peace and harmony underneath the same roof.</p>
