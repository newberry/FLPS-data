   <p>We are rich in poor people but we are also rich in millionaires--that helps a little; we are rich in misers but we are also rich in great philanthropists--that is a small comfort; we are rich in troubles but we are also rich in great deeds--that is a great comfort. We have so much misery, we have so many open wounds on our nation's body--but Israel is not yet lost. We have many great Jews with great hearts--every true Jew has a great heart--who do not stop giving and who keep on giving for all kinds of Jewish public purposes, and thus we somehow manage to pull through, and thus fate compensates us morally for our physical sufferings, for our great misery.</p>
   <p>The Armenians have suffered as much as we, during and after the World War; they were ruined by the War and by the mass slaughter. But they do not have a Julius Rosenwald, and the Armenians in America, who are almost all well-to-do, <pb facs="5423972_2_0599.jpg" n="2"/>do not collect millions for Armenian relief. Other small nations have also suffered from the War, but none of them have the moral compensation for their sufferings that we have. Our nation is suffering terribly at this time--now when it attempts to rise to its feet, it feels as though its entire body were full of wounds and it can hardly get up. But our moral satisfaction is in proportion to our misery--the Jewish heart never beat as warmly as it does now.</p>
   <p>Few of us realize what it means to raise fourteen million dollars in this lean year. Just the same, we are raising the money, and before the year is over, we will have collected the entire sum of fourteen million dollars. Many of us thought that our great efforts for the relief work would hurt our local charities--but what is the truth of the matter? The more we give for relief, the more we give for local charities. This is a happy event of which we may all be proud.</p>
   <p>Before us are the annual reports of many of Chicago's Jewish philanthropic institutions and of many charity organizations of other cities. All these <pb facs="5423972_2_0600.jpg" n="3"/>reports are very comforting and cheering because they prove that American Jewry is making great progress in all fields of Jewish philanthropy, despite the last few lean years and despite our efforts in behalf of the relief and Keren Hayesod. Almost all of Chicago's Orthodox charities have greatly increased their income during the last year and all the recent reports of the charity federations have been very encouraging. It seems that the productive work of our local charities has had a good influence upon our relief work and vice versa. The reports that now come in about the activity of all of our philanthropic forces are very encouraging, and we have a right to be proud of our work and achievement during the last year. Such reports are, even in normal times, a great comfort and a great inspiration to a nation, but in times of misery and sufferings, such reports are doubly encouraging and doubly inspiring; they give the sufferers courage to bear their misfortunes, and the workers courage to go on with their work.</p>
