   <p>Yesterday, the funeral of Mrs. Beile Eisenstein took place at the cemetery of the Kehilath Jacob Congregation, in Waldheim [Cemetery]. This was the first Jewish funeral on Sunday since the Liverymen's and Chauffeurs' Union refused to permit funerals on Sunday. A large crowd attended the funeral. All the ceremonials for the dead were conducted according to Jewish and American law. Funeral orations were delivered by Rabbi Shach and Rabbi Goldman. One hundred and fifty dollars was collected for various charities.</p>
   <p>In his speech, Rabbi Shach scolded those who do not permit funerals on Sunday. Mr. Sam Piser also spoke in the same vein. They both pointed out that it is a burden upon a family to keep a corpse for a few days, that it is against the Jewish law, and that it is detrimental to the health of the living.</p>
