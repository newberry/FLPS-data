   <p>Our Charities.</p>
   <p>We Jews have always been considered a charitable people. No Jewish community in the old world remained for any length of time without some charitable institution to take care of the needy and provide holiday food for those unable to provide themselves with them.</p>
   <p>When unusual circumstances arise, the community would usually meet the emergency with renewed vigor so as to mitigate sufferings. In Europe the people were divided into two classes, the contributors and contributees. Wealthy Jews who refused to contribute soon became social outcasts. However, the situation in the United States, Chicago not excluded, is mighty different. We do not seem to have an organic public opinion on the matter of charity. We have become members of societies and lodges. Our hearts have turned to stone. We forget our needy Jews and their sorry plight.</p>
   <p>What we need is unity and organization. There are many rich Jews who are seldom approached to do their share in aiding the needy and in helping <pb facs="5423972_2_1300.jpg" n="2"/>support worthy institutions.</p>
   <p>Chicago has a Jewish Orphan Home, a Yeshiva, and an Old Peoples Home and many other worthwhile community institutions which should have the full support of our richer Jewish element. However, there are many institutions lacking, that are just as vital to us as those we already have. For example, we have not as yet a Jewish Kosher Hospital. Much has been said, but very little has been done toward its realization. We could go on to name innumerable institutions now lacking but highly desirable.</p>
   <p>Could not the one hundred and twenty five thousand Jews of Chicago raise the necessary funds toward the creating of necessary community institutions? We think they can. It requires unity and organization. As soon as we realize this we will be able to go forward and live up to our reputation.</p>
