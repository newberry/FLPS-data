<title level="a">THE UNION OF HEBREW CONGREGATIONS IN CHICAGO WANTS TO LEVY A TAX ON KOSHER MEAT</title>.
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In order to raise a half-million dollars the Union of Orthodox Synagogues of Chicago has decided to levy a tax on kosher meat. The leaders of this union have looked forward to such an opportunity for a long time. They are negotiating with the magnates of the stock yards to get sole rights to inspection of the kosher meat; and the authority to appoint Rabbis and overseers.</p>
   <p>For this, the owners of the stock yards will be asked to pay a certain sum of money, let us say a cent for each pound of meat sold to Jewish butchers. Thus, a huge sum of money will be credited to the union, through what virtually amounts to a tax on meat.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0105.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Why should the owners of the stock yards want to enter into such an agreement in order to enrich this institution? There is a very good reason for the meat kings to accept this offer. The leaders of the union have presented the meat magnates with a very costly gift.</p>
   <p>There are, at present, from 25 to 30 Jewish cattle killers in the stock yards. These men could kill ten times as much if they were to kill poultry. Supposing that the number of men were increased by fifteen; they would then very easily be able to kill all the kosher poultry that Chicago Jewry could consume.</p>
   <p>The kosher poultry business would then go into the hands of the meat magnates - as well as the profits, of course, <pb facs="5423972_2_0106.jpg" n="3"/>For the valuable gift which the leaders of the Union of Orthodox Synagogues has offered to the stock yards magnates, the latter have reluctantly agreed to accept the proposal and to levy a tax on kosher meat products in order to compensate the leaders.</p>
   <p>What would be the result of such a system - killing chickens in the stock yards instead of in individual butcher shops as it is done at present? The outcome would be that about 150 Jewish killers would be thrown out of work and the killers' union would become weak and most likely dissolve altogether, for the stock yards magnates have little use for organized labor....This tax on meat will be a very excellent source of income for the Union of Orthodox Congregations in Chicago, but it will be a burden on the Jewish population as a whole.</p>
