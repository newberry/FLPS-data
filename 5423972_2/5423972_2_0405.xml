   <p>The thrill of a lifetime. Walking down State Street the other evening we were attracted by the many banners and flags of all nations on the Marshall Field Store. Among the first three, the Jewish National Standard..... The blue and white with the Mogen David in the center....What a welcome to the Nazi representatives who are somewhere hiding from the press and public right here in Chicago.......and to some of our Jews who are still trying to deny the nationhood of Israel.</p>
   <p>Chicago as usual is way behind the times. New York and other large and smaller cities have definitely adopted the boycott program against German goods.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0406.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The effect of this move is illustrated by the numerous non-Jews who have joined the movement, Chicago Jewry, on the other hand, remains unmoved. It is practically the only city in the United States that has done nothing in the matter. The boycott movement throughout the United States has had a very beneficient effect upon the Nazis government in Germany, but our so-called Jewish leaders in this city are still in a state of innocuous desuetude. Silence weakens our position. We must assert our rights and strike back with the only weapons available. The non-Jewish pupulation in this country sympathizes with the plight of the Jews in Germany and are willing to do their bit in checking this crime of the century. But our lukewarm elders are the least affected. It is about time that Chicago Jewry asserted its stand and this is as good a time as any.</p>
