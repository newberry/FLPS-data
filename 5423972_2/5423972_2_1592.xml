   <p>The newspapers mention, in a small corner of space that is hardly noticeable, that Daniel J. Clark because of poverty was forced to go to the Blair County Poor House. This man helped John D. Rockefeller when the oil king was a common worker and he (Clark) was oil inspector. It is this man who in his waning years had to resort to the poor house.</p>
   <p>In this report lies hidden a true estimate of Rockefeller and those of his class. We get a view of the methods with which these people finally reach their heights, and thus are able to hear the resounding slap in the faces of the great masses of people who speak of morals, good deeds and goodfellowship.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1593.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Clark at one time loaned Rochefeller $20 to enable him to pay for his board and room. Now, Rockefeller is the richest man in America. His yearly income is about a hundred million dollars. Yet here is Clark, his one-time benefactor, penniless, unable to support himself.</p>
   <p>Yet this is something more than a personal tragedy. Clark as a personality is not here important. One person advances, the other does not. But how is it that the multimillionaire could look on calmly and permit this one-time benefactor to proceed to the charitable institutions? How does it happen that Rockefeller can forget the man who helped him secure his food and lodging?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1594.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is in this that we find significance in Clark's condition. This characterizes the soul, the personal feelings of Rockefeller. This tends to indicate the methods used by millionaires, that enable them to amass all the wealth that they can possibly put their hands on.</p>
   <p>The report of Clark's condition should have been spread throughout the land. Let the people get a true picture regarding their magnetic personalities. Then there would be no such occurrence in which a benefactor must beg and the recipient unheedingly dominates over everything.</p>
