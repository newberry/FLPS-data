   <p>The new administration of the Lawndale Club, the Jewish club of the Lawndale District, only place where our well-to-do get together to spend a social evening, has apparently changed the tactics and traditions of the old administration.</p>
   <p>Instead of the whist and other card parties officially sponsored by the club, and unofficially sponsored by King Cross, it was announced that Mr. Clarence Darrow will lecture there to-night.</p>
   <p>This proves that our prosperous citizens of the Lawndale District are not so irresponsible as they have been pictured.</p>
   <p>True, there is a percentage of our well-to-do, to whom the ideal of social enjoyment consists of card games, or other so-called pleasures, but the percentage is very small, much smaller than many of us think. This small number is a natural development of a mass of people, among whom a certain <pb facs="5423972_2_1124.jpg" n="2"/>few have become wealthy by sheer accident, and not having the proper training spiritually and morally, they cannot find any pleasure in science or any other cultural undertaking. They cannot become interested in civil or general human problems, and when we treat these problems with lectures or debates, they feel strange.</p>
   <p>The majority of our well-to-do have always, more or less, benefited by a fine upbringing. They are prone to the higher and finer things. Music is more soothing to their nerves than the shrieking of four kings or one hundred aces. A book that covers current or scientific topics is more welcome to them than a deck of cards, and a lecture by a learned man is more pleasing to them than silly talk or the "kibitzing" that takes place in the club by the lower type.</p>
   <p>Men are but human. We cannot always give our attention to all particulars. Therefore, it can so happen, even in the best of clubs, that for a short <pb facs="5423972_2_1125.jpg" n="3"/>time the minority gets the upper hand and runs the club in such a fashion that it is of no credit to the club. However, the majority is eventually bound to triumph. The Lawndale Club was no exception of this, and for a short time it was run by such people as not only lowered the club to public disgrace, but also cast reflections upon the wealthier class of the Chicago Jewish community. Whenever the Lawndale District was mentioned, one would point at the Lawndale Club with its whist, pinochle, and poker games.</p>
   <p>This, however, did not last long. As soon as the members of the club were presented with the opportunity to voice an opinion, a new administration stepped into power. The present officers and directors are mostly of a better class. And they show this by endeavoring to introduce lectures on current events and general subjects, musicales, concerts, debates on Jewish interests, and welcome Jewish guests, as was done in the good old times, when the Lawndale Club was first organized.</p>
   <p>The first thing the new administration has done was to arrange a lecture, <pb facs="5423972_2_1126.jpg" n="4"/>and it could not have selected a more competent lecturer than the well-known barrister, Clarence Darrow, to open this season for spiritual and moral ecstasy. Mr. Darrow will speak tonight at the club on "Lawmaking" an appropriate subject for an audience of business and professional people who should, and can, become interested in lawmaking, as concerns the country, state and city.</p>
   <p>The new administration of the Lawndale Club consists of Max M. Grossman, president; Dr. M. L. Aren, vice-president; J. A. Levin, treasurer; Robert Edelson, recording secretary; A. M. Slat, financial secretary. The directors are Dr. H. L. Frankel, S. J. Rosenblatt, Adolph Goldberg, Bernard J. Brown, Dr. George Sultan, Dr. L. A. Gordon, Max M. Korshak, Morris Kurtson, Ellis Epstein, Jacob Blum, Judge Harry M. Fisher, A. H. Burnstein, Charles S. Brill, Henry Schwartz, and M. Snower.</p>
