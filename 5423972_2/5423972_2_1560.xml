   <p>Elbert H. Gary, steel magnate and for years a bone of contention for his reactionary attitude on questions such as the twelve-hour day, which he has persistently been defending, now, upon his return from a trip abroad and to the Holy Land, quotes the Bible to his interviewers and concludes that it behooves every nation and every individual to follow a true Christian course in their lives. This is, to say the least, [a] very old and very conventional doctrine and dubious in its results. Being Jewish, we need hold no brief for Christianity but even at that every thinking man and woman must resent the attitude of men like Gary. A committee representative of the chief Protestant churches in America recently stamped conditions in the Gary works as thoroughly un-Christian and inhuman. And they were certainly a disinterested committee of investigation. If Mr. Gary, however, chooses to assume an attitude more consistent with the better spirit of the times and more humane than the one his <pb facs="5423972_2_1561.jpg" n="2"/>corporation has assumed hitherto, then this statement may be worth something, although we desire to say that Christianity has no monopoly on the quality of humanness, for other creeds know it fully as well, if not actually more.</p>
