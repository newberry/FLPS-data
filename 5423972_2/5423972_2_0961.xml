   <p>The following letter from Dr. Moses Gaster, head of the Sphardic community in London, and one of the greatest Jewish authorities in the world on Jewish conditions in Rumania, needs no explanation:</p>
   <p>"Worthy Mr. Braunstein:</p>
   <p>"I received your letter of March 12. I am in communication with the principle committee of Rumanian Jews. It would be difficult for me to give you a report of what has already been done. I fear all our efforts to send aid to our unfortunate brothers in the war districts of Eastern Europe meet with very little success.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0962.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Those who come from Rumania will understand the difficulties encountered in sending this aid when the government and entire administration are unfriendly, making use of every opportunity to display their dislike and hostility toward helpless Jews. It is impossible to describe the sufferings of our brothers, the persecutions they face every day, every hour, and no one can be found there or elsewhere to help them.</p>
   <p>"The political outlook is no better. The situation is critical. Public opinion is forever being skillfully diverted.</p>
   <p>"What occurred in Poland is happening now in Rumania, mainly in Bessarabia and Bukovina. Wherever the Rumanians took control the Jews were the first to suffer. The murders and slaughters are more horrible and more frightful than any committed in any other land, and yet newspapers are not permitted to print them. We can understand why that is so. The Rumanians are our <pb facs="5423972_2_0963.jpg" n="3"/>allies, and this explains everything.</p>
   <p>"All facts were sent to Jewish agents in Paris and elsewhere in the provinces mentioned.</p>
   <p>"We must awaken public opinion so that the unfortunates will be given the opportunity to enjoy equal protection of law and equal rights.</p>
   <p>"I hope you will continue with your work and collect money for the unfortunate Jews in the old world. Relay this to our friends and do everything possible to secure the aid of the American nation and government for this justice and humanity. We do everything we possibly can here, but our work must be strengthened by the united efforts of everyone, mainly from those who come from Rumania and are acquainted with the kind of life Jews lead there.</p>
   <p>(Signed) M. Gaster</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0964.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>To B. J. Braunstein, president, Illinois Branch, American Union of Rumanian Jews.</p>
