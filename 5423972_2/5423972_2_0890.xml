   <p>Polish newspapers of Chicago cannot say enough of the Jewish protests against pogroms in Poland on Jews. They appear to be very much afraid that these protests may have some influence in Paris.</p>
   <p>In yesterday's issue of Dziennik Narodowi, we find an editorial to the effect that pogroms were the work of Bolsheviks. On a previous day, they had issued a statement that there were no pogroms.</p>
   <p>In the same vein this paper writes that the Bolsheviks are Jews. This, according to the logic of John Smulski's organ, would mean that Jews instigate pogroms against themselves to protect the good name of Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0891.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Jews know that the pogroms in Poland are the work of Bolshevists, and they know too that these are led by Jews," argues the Dziennik Narodowi.</p>
   <p>"The Poles have proof that the Bolshevik movement is led by Jews, just as Jews lead the speculations in food. When Poles carry on a fight with Bolsheviks and Jewish usurers, conflicts are unescapable. Could it be otherwise? Would not Jews be fired upon (meaning here in America) if they attacked the City Hall in Bolshivik fashion? Do not Jews threaten to burn Budapest?"</p>
   <p>This is a good sample of Polish logic and judgment.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Chicagoski, organ of the Polish priests, remarks joyously that most American newspapers do not devote space to the Jewish pogroms, <pb facs="5423972_2_0892.jpg" n="3"/>but on the other hand, they print in full the statements of the Polish leaders.</p>
   <p>"Excepting the "yellow" Hearst newspapers, leading American newspapers do not give Jews a hearing or a voice. They believe us, and agree on the stand taken by Poles who are ready to grant to Jews of Poland equal citizen privileges but no suffrage rights, thereby preventing Jewish ambitions from creating a state within a state. "</p>
   <p>Narodowi and Zwiazkowy are both harassers, says Rabi Kolerargon.</p>
   <p>The radical Polish organ Dziennik Ludowy seeks to clear itself of the "charges" that the other Polish newspapers have made against it, namely, that it defends an accusation that they certainly have not earned. The <pb facs="5423972_2_0893.jpg" n="4"/>Polish radical attacks his reactionary competitors for these "charges" of his friendliness toward Jews, expressing meanwhile some true statements.</p>
   <p>"The harassing articles of the Narodowi or Zwiazkowy will not improve our reputation with the Americans for whom the Jews translate these articles into English," says Ludowy. "Will there be any one person who, reading these articles of Narodowi and Zwiazkowy, will believe that no pogroms occurred in Poland against Jews? If in America there are among the Poles harassers, why wouldn't there be any in Poland? Such would be the thoughts of the reader after becoming acquainted with the literature of the Priests."</p>
