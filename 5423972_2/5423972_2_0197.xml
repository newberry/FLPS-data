   <p>What is the difference between the year around and the Passover days? As far as the poor and crippled Jews are concerned, there is a great difference. Throughout the year, when a piece of bread is missing in the home of a poor family, no one will notice it. Little children may starve because the poor mother does not have the price for groceries or meat. The same thing is true in all cases where the poor among the Jewish people are concerned. Thousands of tragedies are occurring in the homes of the poor and unfortunate because they lack food. But at least once a year, on Passover, we should stop and consider the poor and unfortunate Jews and see to it that they have all the necessities of life.</p>
   <p>Passover is the symbol of the freedom the Jewish slaves were given from Egyptian bondage. During their wanderings the Jews had no bread to eat; they were forced to mix flour and water and bake it in the heat of the sun.</p>

   <p>Interesting sights can be seen at the Waller Street Hebrew School a few days before Passover. Tickets for mazoth, meat, and other eatables necessary for Passover are being distributed there to the poor who do not have the money to buy those essentials.</p>
