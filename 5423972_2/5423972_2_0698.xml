   <p>The protest of the American-Jewish leaders against the sordid anti-Semitic agitation in Henry Ford's magazine Dearborn Independent, which was published in full in all Chicago's English newspapers, did not fail to make a deep impression upon the American non-Jewish readers, and the favorable editorial comments which the press made about the protest has strengthened this impression still more.</p>
   <p>The average American possesses a sense of justice, although he is not well posted in the intrigues of race against race and nation against nation, which are carried on in the old country. The attempt to organize an anti-Semitic movement in America as in Europe was made upon the contention that the American public is not acquainted with the history of those poisonous <pb facs="5423972_2_0699.jpg" n="2"/>plants which first sprouted on German soil, and found a practical application in the form of horrible pogroms in Eastern Europe. The leaders of this shameful conspiracy have figured that the American public will, in its ignorance, swallow the ridiculous forgeries of the Jewish danger, and in such a manner will become contagious with the anti-Semitic bacillus.</p>
   <p>The only remedy against such a conspiracy is to appeal to the sense of justice of the American public, and enlighten it as to the absurdity of those accusations and calumnies against the Jewish nation in general and American Jewry in particular. This the American Jewish leaders did with their protest, and it was time they should do so, because the poisonous propaganda of the Ford newspaper has already begun to spread throughout the country. It is hoped that the protest did not come too late, and that American public opinion will, with fear and disgust, reject the attempt to sow anti-Semitic seed upon free American soil.</p>
   <p>The Chicago English press deserves credit for its friendly stand toward the Jewish protest. Its attitude in this matter is not only in the general interests <pb facs="5423972_2_0700.jpg" n="3"/>of humanity and justice but also in the true interests of America, against which the anti-Semitic conspiracy is treason.</p>
   <p>But while condemning the Ford conspiracy, the Chicago Tribune did, we believe, deviate somewhat. They compared it with so-called hyphenism, i. e., the loyalty and interest of foreign born American citizens to the countries of their origin. The Tribune declares that the best means to keep America free from anti-Semitism is for the American Jew to reject any form of hyphenism and be Americans only.</p>
   <p>If there are any hyphens in America, they certainly are not the American Jews. Every naturalized American Jew, without exception, has full-heartedly disclaimed the country of his birth, where he was treated as a stepchild. He no longer has any interest in that country, except thoughts of his suffering relations who remained there. And if the American Jew becomes aroused and protests against the horrible slaughter which is perpetrated <pb facs="5423972_2_0701.jpg" n="4"/>upon his brothers and sisters abroad, it is by no means in contradiction with the interests of America. The participation of American Jewry in the Zionist movement is closely connected with the fate of the hundreds of thousands of Jews in Eastern Europe, who must flee from the inferno and can find refuge only in a Jewish Palestine or in America.</p>
   <p>The remark of the Chicago Tribune is, therefore, not in order. This does not, however, lessen the credit which is due the Tribune and the other Chicago English newspapers, for taking an outspoken position against the false anti-Semitic accusations published by Ford's newspaper. They have helped to enlighten the public as to the true character of this conspiracy.</p>
