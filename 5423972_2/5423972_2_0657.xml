   <p>The Jews may, or may not, be admirers of Mr. De Valera and his policies. We may, or may not, be satisfied and delighted with the display of Irish tenacity and stubborness; and we may, or may not, look upon with favor at the present happenings in Ireland, but as a rule, we Jews cannot help admiring the Irish for their national conscionsness and national aspirations. The Irish are not so hardly oppressed as the Jew, nor are they living in dispersion. The Irish are living on Irish soil. There is an Irish culture, art, and a system of national politics based on Irish civilization. As individuals, the Irish are not oppressed; they can do whatever they please; they can follow their occupations; they can practice their religion; they can develop their literature and their language; and they can live a true Irish life in their own land. But still, they insist upon getting recognition as a sovereign people; they are not satisfied with national liberty but want full national independence, full national <pb facs="5423972_2_0658.jpg" n="2"/>sovereignty no matter whether or not this national sovereignty will be of advantage to them materially.</p>
   <p>There are many Englishmen, and even Irishmen who claim that the secession of Ireland from the British Empire would do a great deal of harm to Ireland materially because, England being the best market for Irish products, if Ireland be no longer an integral part of the British Empire, the British market will no longer be opened to Ireland. But still the Irish, though a very realistic people, do not want to trade with their sovereignty as a nation. They may lose materially, lose economically, but they do not want to lose their pledged national rights, nor do they want to forego their national sovereignty. For that they deserve our admiration and the admiration of every liberty-loving people.</p>
   <p>We Jews are placed in a much worse position than the Irish. The majority of the Jewish people do not live on their own national soil, as do the Irish. The Jewish people have no opportunity to develop a national civilization, as <pb facs="5423972_2_0659.jpg" n="3"/>the Irish have, because they are living in dispersion. Without national soil, the upbuilding and development of national civilization is not possible. The Jewish people have none of the advantages of life the Irish people have even under the present rule of England, but still not one in every hundred Jews has the endurance, tenacity, stubbornness, national pride and consciousness of the Irishman. Not one Jew out of one hundred will make such sacrifices for the cause of Judaism as one Irishman will make for his cause. The Jews have not even the courage to demand publicly the establishment of Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Only a certain group of Jews, the Zionists, possess this audacity and they are considered to be very audacious. The average Jew may theoretically sympathize with Zionism, but he will do very little to help materialize the Zionist ideal.</p>
   <p>We make no sacrifice deserving of its name for the cause of Zionism, that is, Jewish independence and liberty. This may be one of the reasons why the Irish are respected everywhere and the Jews are not. The Irish are romantic like the Jew, but they are more inclined to realism than the latter. The Irish sense of realism is more outspoken and more developed than that of the Jew.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0660.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They know what Irish reality means today and what it ought to mean normally; The Jew does not. They are satisfied if they are not oppressed individually or collectively, and though they may dream of the redemption of their people, they never take this dream seriously. To them it is more a religious fancy than a real national hope.</p>
   <p>The Irish will soon get everything they want because they have endurance and national pride and strong national aspirations, but it will take long before the Jews will get what they are entitled to, because their national consciousness is never outspoken, and because they are not ready to make the same sacrifices for the Jewish cause as the Irish are ready to make for theirs. Surely, we ought to take an example from the Irish, because their behavior and their bearing are inspiring. When we make up our mind to be as ready for every emergency, when our national cause is at stake, as the Irish are ready for every emergency when their cause is at stake, then we will also be in a position to dictate terms and to tell the world what we want. Then we will be as respected as the Irish are today.</p>
