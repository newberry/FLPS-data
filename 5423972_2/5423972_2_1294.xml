   <p>"The word Jew stands and will continue unchanged until the world recognizes that out of Zionism grew the laws of nations and out of Judaism were written the words of the gospels," declared Dr. Emil G. Hirsch at Sinai Temple yesterday morning. "What is in a Name?" was the topic of the sermon, the particular name referred to being that of Jew.</p>
   <p>"There is not a word in the New Testament but that is Jewish and there is not a theme or lesson in that book but what has its antecedent in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible," he continued. "Jesus, the great prophet of religion, was taught by Jewish teachers and His teachings are fundamentally Jewish.</p>
   <p>"Is it any distinctive mark of the Chrisitan religion that He died for His religion, and is this in itself such a great sacrifice? We Jews have died by millions, deaths for our religion more bitter than the one which wrenched from Him the anguished cry on the cross, 'My God: My God: Why hast thou forsaken me?' All the tortures of the Jews could have been escaped by merely saying one word, bowing the head and receiving three drops of water on the lips.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1295.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Meaning of Jew</p>
   <p>"Think of these things and then say the name of Jew is unnecessary. Every Jew who respects his parents and knows the glorious history of the past should protest against its abandonment. Jew means a man of character, a man of true conduct - such a one is a Jew.</p>
   <p>"The loose use of adjectives which gives the name Jew a meaning which it does not imply is what makes the name distasteful. It is the same with Christian. We hear of Christian gentlemen as if they were a superior class of gentlemen or the possibility that all Chrisitan men are not gentlemen. In a few weeks on Memorial day we will hear of the Christian soldier when we know that if Jesus taught one thing it was nonresistance.</p>
   <p>"Even I was complimented on my Christian spirit in lecturing before the Unitarian Sunday School Association without charging them anything. After I had delivered twenty-one lectures in as many weeks, the organizations passed resolutions thanking me and felicitating me on my 'Christian spirit' in doing it all without cost, as if such charity or doing anything without pay was so foreign to a Jew that it could <pb facs="5423972_2_1296.jpg" n="3"/>not be Jewish spirit.</p>
   <p>Asked Price For Lecture</p>
   <p>"Not a week goes by but that I am called to the telephone and asked if I will lecture before this or that religious society. If I say 'Yes,' then come the hesitating query, 'How much will you charge, we cannot afford much?' believing that, being a Jew, I must always get money for everything I do.</p>
   <p>"My invariable reply is: 'My standard price for religious societies is $100,000. You contribute the ciphers and I'll strike off the one.' That is all I ever receive."</p>
