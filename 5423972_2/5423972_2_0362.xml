   <p>Dear Editor Occident:</p>
   <p>I am one of the daughters of Judah born in this Country, my father migrating from Russian Poland, and as a natural result, I am reared as an orthodox Jewish girl. Having been educated in this Country where women, nay even girls strive with men for equal political rights and endeavor to compete with them in the field of science and education, it is, I believe, also natural that my mind does not observe everything that is orthodox.</p>
   <p>For a while I looked upon reformed Judaism to make all things right and all crooked places straight. I am a constant reader of the Jewish journals, but my diligent reading of these excellent papers has destroyed my hopes. I saw that what we call reformed Judaism is not Judaism at all. Their sons and daughters with some of whom I am well acquainted, know nothing of Judaism, do not study its laws nor practice its precepts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0363.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They go to their Synagogue or Temple and while there, pray by proxy. They are there the same as in the theatre, more spectators and but one actor. They all hear and one prays for them all. They have crowned the Dr. (Hirsch?) with infallibility, which even the church of Rome could not during the whole of its existence ascribe to its Pope.....</p>
