   <p>The following is from an article published in the Hebrew Observer and reprinted by the R.A.</p>
   <p>Rev. Dr. Kohler, in the September issue of the Menorah, states his belief that Sunday services are a failure and urges faithful adherence to the old sacred Sabbath.</p>
   <p>It is our opinion that in this hustling and busy country where everyone is compelled to toil six days every week for a living, and where Sunday is a legal day of rest on which work is forbidden to the vast majority of people, the Jew cannot afford to rest for two days and compete with his neighbors. The facts as they exist must be faced. Can the Jews afford to rest two days? It is admitted that one Sabbath is sufficient. The question presented is, which day to observe. The question, also presented is, shall the Jews <pb facs="5423972_2_0051.jpg" n="2"/>observe any day? Speaking for the vast number of Jews here it is safe to say that most of them do not regard Saturday as a holiday. With very rare exception, all Jewish business houses are open, and all Jews work the entire day. The merchants cannot afford to close on that day and Sunday also. The result is that the Jews do not observe any day of worship. The advocates of Sunday worship take the position that unless some religion is instilled into our people, they will become non-believers. Which would be wiser, to lose all our religion or simply to change our Sabbath day? Could we see any prospect of re-establishing Saturday as the Sabbath, we are therefore, in favor of services on Sunday.</p>
