   <p>Dr. Emil G. Hirsch of Sinai Temple stepped out, in the last edition of the Reform Advocate, with a "demand for intolerance."</p>
   <p>In an editorial under this title, the honored Rabbi says: "A Jew must be intolerant to non-Jewish Judaism. Let the Jew be a Jew. Jewish institutions must be Jewish. This will not prevent them from accomplishing good work. On the contrary, this will add much more opportunity to fulfill their good work. It is a peculiar, irrational notion, embedded in our social world to ignore the Jewish element, and to avoid anything associated with Judaism."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The honored Rabbi goes further in his observation proving how the Young Men's Christian Association, while doing social work, are not only Christians in name, but also those who direct the institutions. Those, who create the spirit by which the institutions should be conducted, are recruited exclusively from the believers in a certain form of Christianity, and develop this form of Christianity in the final aims. The development of the body, educational classes, and all other social work are merely methods of arriving at final aims.</p>
   <p>He remarks bitterly that, "An artist will not work according to the opinion of the color blind. The Young Men's Christian Association will not permit people, lacking faith in Christian principles, to be recruits who shall carry on its institutions. People, who do not sympathize with Judaism, are not in their place when acting on Jewish <pb facs="5423972_2_1230.jpg" n="3"/>administration boards. This may apparently be intolerance but it would be very good if the Jews possessed a bit more of it."</p>
   <p>After voicing his general opinion, the honored Rabbi then comes to the point: The Chicago Hebrew Institute and all other Jewish centers.</p>
   <p>"The Hebrew Institute and the Jewish settlements," the Rabbi declares, "have a mission entirely different than that of the Young Men's Christian Association. They must Americanize the immigrant, and, at the same time, not estrange him or his children from Judaism. They are obliged to preserve the sentiment of the moral and intellectual relationship between the older fathers and mothers and the young sons and daughters, and due to this the Jewish religion is not an approved instrument with which to condemn the work of the Hebrew Institute and the Settlements.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1231.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Let us remember that more is expected from a Hebrew Institute, than a good organization and financial support. A good acquaintance with those sympathizing with Judaism and Jews is of chief importance. Judaism it is needless to say, does not recognize any priest's authority. It does not have or should not have any priests. The Rabbi should be an expert in Jewish studies and principles. Not because he has a theological degree, but according to his scholarship he should use his authority. But should the Rabbis have no more authority that the illiterate man, who doesn't know anything about Jewish life. We are ruled by an illiterate, we must be still more intolerant, we should combat them courageously; it differs little, whether he is attired in Rabbinical clothes and neck tie, or the modern clothes of the highest social set."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1232.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It is very pleasing to hear and especially, to see in writing, the opinion of this great authority, scholar, and education. However, we regret that this opinion by the honored Rabbi is spoken too late. Now, we have practically lost the hope of seeing the Chicago Hebrew Institute as a Jewish institution. There was a time when we thought that this institution would be the Small Temple of Chicago Jewry. We struggled for our holiness as did the ancient plebeians against the ancient patricians. Dr. Hirsch was, at that time, against us. He, living on the South Side, was unable to understand or see how the Institute was being contaminated. We, at least, did our duty, until God's wrath poured out and a fire destroyed Chicago's Small Temple, as occurred to our great Temple, 1848 years ago. The Chicago Institute was destroyed and not even a "Wailing Wall" remained.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1233.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>In its place, a mosque is being built, where there will be ample room for everybody and everything excepting Jews and Judaism.</p>
   <p>And now when we find the learned Rabbi, doctor, and philanthropist, in the office of the Reform Advocate weeping at the destruction of the Hebrew Institute, we join him by removing our shoes, sitting down and beginning to read the Lamentations.</p>
   <p>And now if Dr. Hirsch wants to build a second temple, the great masses on the West Side will support him financially and morally. But when we find Dr. Hirsch weeping in the office of the Reform Advocate at the destruction of the Hebrew Institute, we must admonish him: "Scholarly hypocrite, who has torn away from them!"</p>
