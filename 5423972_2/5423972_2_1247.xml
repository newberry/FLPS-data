   <p>We are so accustomed to hear how all of our charity institutions appeal for money, that when we received a letter from the office of the committee on uniting the Jewish charities in which they relate that sufficient money can be obtained to finance all of our charity institutions, it was a pleasant surprise to us.</p>
   <p>It was something to be wondered at, knowing that the Marks Nathan Orphan Home is in a critical condition, and that the leaders of the orthodox orphanage seek to combine with our German brethren in order that they shall accept several orphans in their home, so that the income should be able to support the rest. Those who know how the directors of our orthodox Marks Nathan Home assail, at each opportunity, the system of rearing children in the German Jews orphan home, the Home Finding Society, and accused the director of the reform children's institution of all sort of crimes against Judaism and Jewish traditions, became suddenly aware that these very accusers were negotiating with the "wicked" to accept seventy-five children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1248.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It can readily be seen now how poverty stricken our orthodox Marks Nathan Home is.</p>
   <p>Only the most horrible conditions could effect the leaders of our Marks Nathan Home so that they should discuss the matter of discharging teachers from the home. In the midst of this unpredecented financial condition, the committee on the uniting of Jewish charities informs us that they are already in receipt of subscription for the sum of 45 thousand dollars subscribed by 700 people and there are 20 thousand prospects on the list. This means that when the committee completes its task, they will have a grand sum of a quarter million dollars, or ten times more than all Jewish orthodox charity institutions require to support those who depend on them.</p>
   <p>We herein print the letter of the committee on the uniting of the Jewish orthodox charities, which speaks for itself, because we know how interested everyone is in their work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1249.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is what was submitted to us: After the move that the Federated Orthodox Charities made we can see how far the public sympathizes with their movement, and there is no doubt that it will be carried through. What the federation needs now is only a good committee to solicit subscribers; until now, 700 people were called upon, who contributed $45,000. This sum was subscribed on the West Side. Twenty thousand prospects are to be convassed in various localities, and there is no doubt that when all will be contacted there will be sufficient money to support all charity institutions in Chicago.</p>
