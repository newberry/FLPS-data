   <p>The news that we printed last week that Dr. Joseph Marcus of New York was appointed as Jewish chaplain for the jails here, brought many letters of thanks and appreciation from Jewish prisoners and outsiders to the Courier office. From the letters the prisoners have written to us we can see that the appointment of a Jewish chaplain brought some joy to the men and women who have been incarcerated in the different prisons of Cook County. Their spirits have been enlivened by the news that Dr. Marcus would visit them regularly and would try to help them with advice and deed even after they are released from jail. Here is one of the many letters we have received from Jewish prisoners in Joliet about this matter:</p>
   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I read the news in your paper, with pleasure, about the appointment of Dr. Marcus as Jewish chaplain for the jails in Illinois. It is unnecessary <pb facs="5423972_2_0310.jpg" n="2"/>to tell you what a prisoner has to go through in a penitentiary; the rigid discipline he has to comply with, the pangs of remorse and lonliness that seizes him at all times. The melancholy isolation behind bars and high gray walls of the prison, away from his family and the outside world. Such conditions make the life of the prisoner hard and unbearable. Very difficult is the life of the prisoner in general, but exceptionally difficult is the life of the Jewish prisoner. The Gentile prisoner is regularly visited by their chaplain who preaches before them, consoles and comforts them in their hours of need, and helps them with advice and deed. But such has not been the lot of the Jewish prisoner. He has to spend his life there in deadly silence. He has nobody to talk to. He is entirely deserted, neglected, and forgotten.</p>
   <p>Although my term in the penitentiary is almost over, yet I would like to see Dr. Marcus and hear him talk, at least once, before I am released. I want to leave this place with at least one pleasant memory.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>(The prisoner requests that his name should not be printed.)</p>
