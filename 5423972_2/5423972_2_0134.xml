   <p>Do the Jews have an adequate number of precepts? As far as you and I know, they have plenty. But there are people who believe that Jews do not have enough precepts and that we should establish more, in order that we may become a real nation. One of these great men is the noted Jewish historian, Dubnov. He does not exactly say that we need more precepts, but, rather, that we need new, up-to-date precepts, in order that we may continue to exist as a people. What will become of the old precepts? Shall we pronounce them obsolete and reject them? Does he [Dubnov] want us to break completely from them? Mr. Dubnov does not answer the latter question. At present, he would like us to create new precepts.</p>
   <p>Who is to establish these new precepts? Will it be the rabbis, the politicians, or the mediators? Mr. Dubnov does not give a satisfactory answer to this question either. He speaks emphatically of one thing only, and that is that the new precepts must include national issues, as for example, Jewish education, a <pb facs="5423972_2_0135.jpg" n="2"/>struggle for national autonomy, a struggle for the old national language [Hebrew], and for the native languages, a struggle for a Jewish Congress, etc.</p>
   <p>What is a precept? A precept is a religious commandment. If a person adheres to a precept, he fulfills a religious duty, for which he will be compensated in the future world. If he does not abide by a precept, he will be punished in the future world. If a person does not believe in the religious character of the precepts, he does not observe them. Who, today, is able to establish new precepts? Shall the rabbis declare that anyone who does not adhere to the new precepts will be punished in the future world? Or should the politicians say to the Jewish masses: "Either you fight for national autonomy or you will not enter heaven"? What will be the reward of the observance of these new precepts and what will be the punishment for their nonobservance? It seems to me that there is something phony about Mr. Dubnov's proposal.</p>
   <p>If Jews adhere to their old precepts, they will be good Jews; they will know Hebrew, and they will have nationalistic sentiments. Then they will fight for <pb facs="5423972_2_0136.jpg" n="3"/>their rights, for their language, for their culture, etc.</p>
   <p>If the Jews adhere to the precept of "Thou shalt learn," they will have all the happiness in the world. All Jews will then be well informed with regard to Jewish literature; all Jews will know how to act as Jews, and how to live as Jews. They will have a knowledge of Hebrew literature, which will develop a strong national consciousness. If a Congress is needed, there will be a Congress, and if we have to struggle for national autonomy in the countries of the Diaspora, we will do so.</p>
   <p>We can, therefore, see what the adherence to one single precept can do, and I am firmly convinced that, if the Jews would, at least, adhere to this one precept, there would be no need for Mr. Dubnov's proposal of new precepts. I am also convinced that if the Jew completely forgets this precept, the new precepts will be of no value. Furthermore, they [the new precepts] will be superfluous because without the precept, "And thou shalt learn," there can be no Jewish people. The dead do not have any precepts, especially such precepts as the <pb facs="5423972_2_0137.jpg" n="4"/>struggle for national autonomy, because everybody is free and autonomous in the grave. Mr. Dubnov is a very prominent educator and a great historian, but there is no law against a great historian's uttering nonsense.</p>
   <p>I believe that the "modern" Jews who wish to place Judaism on a purely "universal" basis ought to thank God that there are still conservative Jews in this world, who have a conservative Jewish outlook. If there weren't any conservative Jews, they ["modern" Jews] would have buried Judaism long ago.</p>
   <p>Anyone who wishes to be a really modern Jew, must do one thing, and that is, become familiar with our own ancient literature. In that ancient, yet ever new literature, one will find more modern material than in all the modern books on Judaism. But anyone who ignores those wonderful words, written by our ancient sages, must seek domestic remedies to cure the sick Jewish people, and domestic remedies, as you know very well, help very little.</p>
   <p>We have plenty of precepts and we have good precepts. We do not need new <pb facs="5423972_2_0138.jpg" n="5"/>precepts because, first, they would have little value, and second, they would be superfluous. Mr. Dubnov's motion is also superfluous and out of order.</p>
