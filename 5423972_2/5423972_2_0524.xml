   <p>The latest victim of anti-Semitic propaganda in America is the Polish Jew. The anti-Semitic writers have recently directed their venom at the Polish Jews and are attempting to paint him as an unmitigated scoundrel. According to the theories of these anti-Semitic publicists, the Polish Jew is the worst of all the Jews and he deserves to be hated. He is the cause of all the trouble in Eastern and Central Europe, as well as of all the trouble from which mankind is suffering.</p>
   <p>It is not difficult to point out the source of this attack upon the Polish Jews. The first person who attacked the Polish Jews in the American press, is a bosom friend of Mr. Morgenthau, who has also sharply criticized the Polish Jews. Morgenthau is very angry at the Polish Jews because they unmasked him and showed that the major part of his report is based on lies, and that he behaved in Poland <pb facs="5423972_2_0525.jpg" n="2"/>like an archenemy of Israel. To what extent Mr. Morgenthau himself had a hand in this baiting of the Polish Jew, we do not know, but as Mr. Hendrick is the author of the anti-Semitic article on the Polish Jews, and as it is known that Mr. Morgenthau is the owner of the newspaper in which the article appeared, Mr. Morgenthau cannot free himself of the suspicion that he himself has had some hand in this propaganda.</p>
   <p>Even if Mr. Morgenthau has had no hand in this propaganda against the Polish Jews, the source of the propaganda is still obvious. Mr. Hendrick, the writer of the article against the Polish Jews, was the "editor" of Mr. Morgenthau's report on the Polish pogroms, and Mr. Hendrick has good connections in Poland and with Polish politicians. If we know this, then we know everything about the source of this vile propaganda.</p>
   <p>Whatever the substance of the anti-Semitic complaints against the Polish Jews <pb facs="5423972_2_0526.jpg" n="3"/>may be, it will be enough to point out that what is now being said about the Polish Jew, has been said about the Russian, the German, the French Jew, etc. The French anti-Semites claim that the Jews in all other countries are all right, but the Alsatian Jews are no good. The German anti-Semites say that the English Jews are all right, but the German Jews are no good. The Russian and Polish anti-Semites claim that the Jews in Western Europe are the best people in the world, but the Russian and Polish Jews are corrupt and must be annihilated. It stands to reason that the French anti-Semite hates the German, Russian, and English Jews as much as the Alsatian Jews, and that the Russian and Polish anti-Semites hate the Western European Jews no less than they do the Russian and Polish Jews. Remembering, however, the maxim of the English statesman, Burke, i.e., that we should not and must not accuse a whole people, the anti-Semites utilize the hypocritical pretext that they do not mean all the Jews, but rather a certain class of Jews.</p>
   <p>The Polish Jew is no different from the Jews in any other country, and if he has outstanding, individual characteristics, it is because he has lived in an <pb facs="5423972_2_0527.jpg" n="4"/>atmosphere of oppression for many hundreds of years. As far as ability and general aptitude are concerned, the Polish Jew is as capable and as talented as the Jew of any other country. He is a son of the Jewish people, and he shares in common what all Jews share. In many respects the Polish Jew is abler than the Jew in any other country. Artistically, he is more talented than, for example, the Lithuanian Jew. As a businessman, he is better qualified than the Jew of many other countries because for many centuries, the Polish Jew was the business agent for the Pole, and he trained the only commercial class in Poland. As a result of a unique position in the economic life of Poland, a strong commercial spirit developed within him and this, at any rate, is not a liability. In modern times, Polish Jewry has produced great men in all walks of life. It will suffice to mention that the greatest philospher of our time, Henri Bergson, whom the French acclaim as their greatest writer today, is a Polish Jew and the grandson of a Hasidie rabbi. Neither Poland nor the Jews need be ashamed of Henri Bergson. The Polish Jews have produced a number of great painters, sculptors, musicians, and writers, and they have contributed <pb facs="5423972_2_0528.jpg" n="5"/>as much to modern literature and art as any other great Jewish group. Now, when the anti-Semites in America attack the Polish Jew and paint him as some sort of demon, they have no more and no less justification than when they attack the German or English or American Jew. It is stupid on the part of some Jewish publicists to defend the Polish Jew by proving that he is not as bad as he is portrayed. The only answer that we should make to the anti-Semites who are attacking the Polish Jew, is that the Polish Jew is a Jew like all other Jews.</p>
