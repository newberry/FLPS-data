   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>We earnestly enter our solemn remonstrance against the persistent abuse which your local editors and reporters resort to when they designate and cast a slur upon us with the term "Jew," or when more mildly insinuated, with the words "Hebrews" or "Israelites" in matter of civil or criminal proceedings. We suppose that in this land of liberty no religious distinctions are necessary or called for and that before the law all men are equal. It is a well known fact that whenever a culprit is arrested or tried if he chances to be an Israelite.....that your reporters seem to lay particular stress therein that he is a Jew. But we fail to find that if John Jones, a Baptist, Robert Burns, a Catholic, John Wesley, a Methodist, or W. M. Johnson an Episcoplalian were arraigned or are so designated for murder, embezzlement, robbery, mayhem, or the other innumerable crimes. We ask in all fairness that you instruct your reporters to desist in designating us as "Jews" if one should <pb facs="5423972_2_1448.jpg" n="2"/>be unfortunate enough to be brought before a magistrate. We do not claim to be more exemplary than other sects......A word of instruction from your department will arrest this unjust and prejudicial made of designation which at best sounds too mediaeval for even intelligent Christians.</p>
   <p>It reminds us of the bitter hatred instituted by a bigoted Priestcraft in Germany who invented the epithet Hep! Hep! in that country. It may alsobe borne in mind that nothing will be gained to the journals who are the vehicles of education and intelligence to draw such invidious distinctions. We observe that many Jewish merchants such as Mandel Brothers, Schlessinger and Mayer, Judah, Weil and Company, Morgenthan and Company, S. Shirich and others who have long and extensive contracts for your advertising columns, must be pained to read these implied insults.</p>
