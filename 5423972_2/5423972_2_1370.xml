   <p>The sketches that appeared in a recent number of Harper's Weekly, of the scenes at the Judd Street Jewish Synagogue in Chicago, during the recent distribution there of free tickets for bread and meat, portrayed in a graphic manner the urgent need and timeliness of this charity. Begun, as it was hastily and in an unostentatious way by two open-handed merchants, Mr. David Kallis and Mr. A. Kopperl, it was beneficial in satisfying the hunger of thousands of the unemployed poor, and it afforded immediate relief in cases of want where the efforts of an organized public charity would have been defeated by the delay necessary in investigating individual applications for aid. As it was, fully twenty two thousand needy persons were supplied with food in a single day at the kopperl agency, with no questions asked as to character, and it is a fact of suggestive interest that although the fund was originated primarily for the Hebrew poor, but few Jewish people found it necessary to avail themselves of it.</p>

   <p>Hardly ten percent were of that race, more than half of the applicants being Poles, Bohemians, Russians, and Germans, and the remainder mostly persons of American parentage.</p>
   <p>If there were sham displays of poverty among the applicants for tickets, they were not numerous, as was shown by the sight of men gnawing their loaves of bread before they left the agency at the synagogue, and of women pausing in the street to break a piece from the loaf hidden under their shawl.</p>
   <p>Bread amounting to 1,676 pounds, and of meat to 4,222 pounds were distributed, while the expenditure for three days aggregated $1,400. The tickets issued called for from one to eight pounds of bread each and from one to four pounds of meat, while some were made negotiable at neighboring groceries and bakeries.</p>
