  <body>
   <p>The statement made by a Catholic prelate to the effect that the Pope "feels" that the anti-religious Campaign on the part of the Bolsheviks is influenced by Russian Jews and that the Jews of America should therefore exercise their influence upon their "co-religionists" in Moscow to stop the persecution of Christian clergymen, is full of venomous anti-Semitism and Jesuitical hypocrisy, which calls for a sharp reply of protest.</p>
   <p>Actually, there is little difference between the Pope's "appeal" to the American Jews that they influence the Bolsheviks to stop persecuting the Christian Clergymen, and the demand of the Polish anti-Semites that the rabbis of Poland be interned as pawns for the exculpation of the Catholic clergy in Moscow. Both aim to make the Jews of the whole world responsible <pb facs="5423972_2_0558.jpg" n="2"/>for the acts of the Bolsheviks in Russia.</p>
   <p>The "Holy Father" in Rome has already evinced his anti-Semitic inclinations by his position against the Palestine Mandate. The statement he now makes puts him on an equal footing with the leader of the Warsaw "Rozwoy" [?] by whom he was, for some good reason, intimately befriended when he was papal ambassador in Warsaw.</p>
