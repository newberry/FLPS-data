   <p>Now that Berger, the victim of criminal negligence on the part of the Mount Sinai Hospital, is dead, and the first excitement over his tragic death is over, it is time to speak plainly about our kosher hospital.</p>
   <p>Chicago should and must have a great and beautiful kosher hospital, with a good and fine management. This kosher hospital, being primarily a charity hospital, should serve the interests of the poor people who cannot afford to pay.</p>
   <p>The present kosher hospital is neither great nor beautiful, and its management is scandalous. It is not a hospital for the poor but for the rich, though it <pb facs="5423972_2_0469.jpg" n="2"/>is being kept up by the [United Jewish] charities. It could be a beautiful hospital, it could serve the interests of the poor, and it could have the proper management even though it is a small hospital. The trouble with the Mount Sinai Hospital is that its management is bad. Not the spirit of charity, but the spirit of Sodom, reigns there. The manager of the hospital should have resigned after such a scandal. The president of the hospital could also make room for somebody else, because a man who is heading such an academic institution as a hospital ought to be an educated man. Business experience alone is not a sufficient qualification for holding an office like that. The [United Jewish] Charities have a right to demand that good management be introduced in the hospital because the present management is scandalous. Dr. Lewisohn, chief of the staff of the hospital, should make an investigation to find out who is responsible for the tragedy of poor Berger.</p>
   <p>In short, the Augean stables must be cleaned; otherwise the scandals will never cease.</p>
