   <p>Mourning Procession and Protest Movement scored as False Propaganda.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, John Smolski's paper attacked the Jewish people of Chicago, the Forward, and the speakers, who addressed the evening mass meeting. The latter were referred to as "Jewish agents."</p>
   <p>John Smolski, a Chicago Pole, is now Paderwiski's agent in America. Because of the Jewish protest against Poland, he began to agitate strongly against the Jews of America, especially the Jews of Chicago, and the Forward. At first he proved rather successful. He persuaded the Jew-hating Associated Press to print very little about the New York meeting at which Charles Evans Hughes was the chief speaker. In this dispatch he smuggled a statement asserting that he and his Polish National Department had performed many favors for the Jews of America, especially in cooperating with them in assisting the Joint Relief Committee to send food to Poland. At the end of his statement, Smolski denies that there were pogroms upon the Jews in Poland, and ends by declaring that such protest demonstration will make it impossible for the Poles to cooperate with the Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0927.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This rather ambiguous declaration of war has been published in the English papers.</p>
   <p>In his Chicago Polish paper Dziennik Naradowe, he came out with pogrom propaganda against Chicago Jewry. The movement for protest and mourning is called false propaganda by Smolski. Hughes, the ex-governor of New York, United States Supreme Court Justice, and Republican candidate for the Supreme Court in 1916, is declared to have been bought by the Jews; Taft is misled by the Jews, President Wilson, however knows more than to believe the above lies.</p>
   <p>This paper which is Paderwiski's organ in America, carried a full report about the mourning procession and the protest mass meeting. The report is written venom, every speaker is termed a liar, and also, the paper uses polemics in regard to each speaker. The paper averred that even before Clarence Darrow was born, Poland had a democracy and Jews were in receipt of equality. The Paderwiski-Smolski organ belittled the elderly Bishop, <pb facs="5423972_2_0928.jpg" n="3"/>Samuel Fullois as a Rabbi. At the conclusion of the article, was printed a list of all the stores in the Polish neighborhood along Division St. and Chicago Ave., which had been closed during the procession. The reason for the printing of this list of stores is of course to develop a boycott movement. Evidently, Smolski believes that the boycott movement now going on in Poland will do well in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The paper also reprinted Zogat's cartoon of yesterday's Forward, which displayed the manner in which the Poles were celebrating their freedom. The anti-Semitic paper hired an anti-Semitic cartoonist to place Trotzky in an ugly light.</p>
