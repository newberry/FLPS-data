   <p>The convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church, which was held last week in Washington, D. C., adopted a resolution that a Jew when converted to Christianity is not obligated to give up his family or to forsake his national duties and responsibilities as a Jew. The resolution was the outcome of a discussion on Jewish national endeavors and the prospect of establishing a Jewish national home in Palestine. The convention declared itself in perfect sympathy with the Jewish Palestine movement--with "Judah's national hopes", as the resolution states--but the convention found it necessary to let it be known that if a person is a good Zionist and wishes to remain within the fold of the Jewish nation, this, then, should not prevent him from believing in Jesus of Nazareth, if he should be so inclined.</p>
   <p>For such a privilege granted by this Protestant Church, we are very grateful; but we doubt very much that there could be found a single individual in the <pb facs="5423972_2_0994.jpg" n="2"/>entire Zionist movement who would care to take advantage of this privilege. We recall that several months ago a similar resolution was adopted at a large Christian convention in Minneapolis, but so far we haven't heard that Jews were hastening to take advantage of the privilege of becoming converted to Christianity and at the same time remaining with their families. Even the concession of permitting them to remain nationalists did not induce any Jews to profess their belief in Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
   <p>But the leaders of the Protestant Episcopal Church, in their Gentile innocence, evidently believe that such a resolution would make a deep impression upon Jews. Apparently they imagine that every Jew must be fully convinced of the gospel and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth; that they would have become Christians long ago, but for the family ties standing in their way; that they could not break away from their wives and children and relatives; and that their ties to the Jewish people and the hope of a Jewish national life likewise prevented them from breaking away from Judaism. But now that permission is granted Jews to retain all of these--even after conversion--then surely they will come in large numbers to the baptismal basin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0995.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Naive people! It does not even enter their minds that the individual Jew who has been converted is, on the contrary, the one who has broken away from his own, or who longs to break away, not wanting any longer to be recognized as a Jew. They do not know that with many apostates, conversion is only the backdoor through which they sneak out from the Jewish camp and quickly intermingle with the crowd in order to conceal their true identity. Such Jews certainly will consider this "privilege" as a "favor in the form of a charity loan".</p>
   <p>Perhaps the resolution bears still another purpose. Perhaps it is a polite hint to converts and would-be apostates that they should remain where they are: as believers in Jesus of Nazareth they are welcome, but as comrades they are not necessarily desirable, and therefore can and should retain all of their Jewish social connections.</p>
   <p>Besides--it is no more than a suspicion on our part, and perhaps it isn't proper to employ suspicion--it is possible that the Gentiles didn't mean it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0996.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At any rate, the resolution has shown one thing which should satisfy us. It shows the stand taken by the great Christian Churches in regard to the Jewish national problem and to Palestine. They recognize the claim of the Jewish people to a national existence and to a homeland in Palestine. With this part of the resolution we fully agree. As to the improvement of the Jew through the belief in Jesus of Nazareth, they are mistaken, but eventually they, too, will see this mistake.</p>
