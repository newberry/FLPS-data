<title level="a">A HOLIDAY PROCLAMATION BY MAYOR HARRISON</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The proclamation by Mayor Harrison has ended the campaign for the recognition of Jewish, Orthodox holidays by the national, state, county, and city governments. Congressman [A.] Sabath has prevailed upon the National Government to allow all post office employees and other Government officials time off from their work to observe the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur. Mr. Jacob S. Labosky and Senator John Waage helped Governor Deneen secure State recognition of the Orthodox holidays. The various counties, headed by President A. A. McKinley, followed the rulings of the higher governments. The Mayor, in yesterday's proclamation, proclaimed the recognition of the holidays by the city government.</p>
   <p>Yesterday Mayor Harrison sent the following proclamation to all the heads of the city government: "The Jewish Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur will fall this year on October 2 and 3 and 11. These holidays are Holy Days according to the Jewish religion. You are, therefore, requested to excuse all employees of the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_2_0298.jpg" n="2"/>faith in your department from their duties on October 2 and 3 and 11....."</p>
   <p>Judge Philip P. Bregstone will leave today for Joliet. He has been invited by Jacob S. Labosky, the attorney for the West Park Board, and Senator John Waage of 25th Senatorial District to officiate as the cantor and preacher in the penitentiary.</p>
   <p>Forty-five Jewish prisoners in Joliet will pray and hear Jewish consolations administered to them this Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur. Judge Bregstone was chosen because he is well-acquainted with the Orthodox rituals, hymns, and prayers. Besides he is one of the best national, Jewish orators.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Savanka, Clerk of the Probate Court, announced a letter to the Courier that it would be a pleasure to permit his Jewish employees to observe those holidays.</p>
