   <p>Chicago, June 20. - In your editorial on the Hilton-Seligman affair, which has raised quite a sensation among all intelligent Christians as well as Jews, and more especially your comments on the fact that such a spirit, which was supposed to have died long ago, should again be revived in an age of enlightenment, you have shown yourself worthy of the modern idea of a journalist. But there were some statements which you made to the following effect: "If there has not been the same harmonizing of interests socially, it is not entirely the fault of the Christian races. The Jews themselves are the strictest constructionists in religious matters. They are exceedingly clannish in their associations and amusements; they prohibit inter-marriage with Christians, which is itself an insurmountable social bar; and they have never taken the same pains and cultivated the same opportunities for removing social prejudices, as in business, the professions, and politics, and in so far as this is true they have only themselves to blame." And the Jews have frequently, from time to time, made strenuous efforts to break up this so-called social barrier, and have been as often repulsed. This existing clannishness is a necessity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1514.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jews have tried to have their children forget that they were oppressed children; have tried to inculcate oblivion of the old feuds; have imbued them with the liberal spirit of religious toleration; and no sooner has this "broad Christian spirit" implanted itself than they are reminded by the Christian children that this feud still exists. Not more than six months ago did an insignificant dancing-master in this city refuse admission to his class to Jewish children, on the ground that the mothers of his "Christian" classes would not permit it. There is not a school in Chicago where the Jewish children cannot tell you every day of some gross insult heaped upon them by their Christian schoolmates. Their first instinct of resentment is to brand them as a Jew, meant to sting their finer sensibilities, - and where does this emanate from? Certainly they are taught that those only who believe in a Trinity are the elect. Sir, this difference has manifested itself in concerts, theatres, and all places frequented by Christians. Why, then,should the Jew not be clannish? Do the Christians not force him to it, when they will not admit him into their society, and when once admitted they will insultingly sneer at him with the epithet always so readily at their tongues' end, "You are a Jew?"</p>
   <p>How often do we hear of these slurs at this "unfortunate" race? They have got to be a by-word, and it goes to show that this hatred is inherent in a large class of Christians.</p>

   <p>There is no Jew who cares whether Mr. Seligman can stop in the hotel or not, nor does any person care for Mr. Hilton in the affair; but the fact that Mr. Hilton issupposed to be the mouthpiece of a large class of intelligent Americans, who are silently building up that old wall which Lessing and Macaulay broke down, is what is alarming. It shows that danger to the liberty of the citizen is not entirely extinct, but may at any time reappear in another form. Sagacious as De Tocqueville was, and as much truth as there was in his predictions about this country, he could not foresee a religious persecution. This is not yet what may be termed a universal persecution, but who knows what may come out of such outrages if permitted to propogate themselves and if they are not checked in time? We rely on the wisdom of our journals, which are the palladium of our liberties, to cut off the approaches of tyranny and oppression.</p>
