   <p>Once more the Jewish papers are full of descriptions, "How brilliantly Reverend so and so conducted the holiday services," "How Rabbi H. has succeeded in the ten weeks of his ministerial career to enthuse, inspire, electrify, rouse, move, touch the vast audience, which never, oh! never, in the history of this citywas privileged tohear such brilliancy and eloquence, such oratory, such elocution." "How the spark of religion which was almost extinguished in the last twenty or thirty years under the administration of that old fogy Rabbi N. has been rekindled ignited and fanned into an immense flame, which caught the whole town, young and old, orthodox and reformers, Germans and Poles alike, even the Atheists,who, one and all, closed their stores, fasted all day, and listened with rapt attention to the 'fine' lectures of the erudite deep, great and unexcelled scholar,..... who though young in years has revolutionized our religions life and so forth, and so forth."</p>

   <p>Are not by such sickening reports the readers, as it were, compelled to think, that the only purpose of a service is to give the preacher the long sought chance to show himself? Must not the people, who peruse such stuff come to the conclusion, that the only object of a sermon or lecture is to please the audience as if the whole thing was nothing and nothing less than a theatrical "show." Oh! when will the people and particularly our rabbis learn, that it is not at all the mission of the pulpit to please the pew.</p>
   <p>The Jewish press has done a great deal towards spoiling rabbis and congregations in treating every important holiday-service in a synagogue like some new comedy, or new star, which were just brought out. The press can remedy this sin by impressing on the people the time mission of the pulpit-to teach and to admonish. A sermon or lecture, by which five hundred people are delighted and-entertained is far inferior to one, which may dis-please four hundred and ninety-nine persons but by means of which one person has been uplifted, enlightened, and induced to lead a better life.</p>
