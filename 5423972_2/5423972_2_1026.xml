   <p>How does the Russian Jew differ from the American Jew? Of what value is Russian-Jewish immigration to American social life? What new forms of life and ideals does the [Russian] Jew contribute to the American nation? Such questions are of interest to everyone engaged in the study of social conditions and trends in American society.</p>
   <p>Today it is practically impossible to speak about the progress and development of America without mentioning the Russian-Jewish group, who have contributed a great deal to this progress and development. In order to estimate the contributions made by Jews to the progress of this country, we must examine a bit deeper the life of the Jews; we must not judge that contribution by its superficial aspect alone. It is also impossible to understand the psychology of a people without an historical perspective, and the individual cannot be understood by <pb facs="5423972_2_1027.jpg" n="2"/>his daily actions, if his past is not known.</p>
   <p>The Russian Jews are, without a doubt, the most progressive element that has migrated to America, and, as a politically oppressed people in Russia, they understand, more than any other group, the value of the political and social institutions of their new home.</p>
   <p>In America we can show that the majority of the Jewish masses support those who strive to improve the political system of government, to give the individual more opportunity to develop himself, and to abolish race hatred. Possibly this is why the Russian-Jewish immigrants make every effort to see that their children receive a good education, and that they enter those professions that will bring them into closer contact with the general public.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that wherever the spirit of liberalism prevails, there the Russian Jews can be found. Because he has been more oppressed than anyone else, the Russian Jew is receptive to liberal ideas which promise the brotherhood of man, and the transformation of the sword into the plowshare.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1028.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The growth of Jewish newspapers and weekly or monthly magazines shows how thirsty the Jewish masses are for spiritual development.</p>
   <p>The Jewish drama also occupies a prominent niche in the Jewish life of this country, and notwithstanding the fact that it has undergone a severe crisis in the past few years, it is, nevertheless, recuperating.</p>
   <p>As for the radical movement, although it can stand severe criticism, it must be admitted that the Jewish youth, who are the most important section of it, reveal splendid convictions and noble aspirations for justice and humanity.</p>
   <p>The Russian Jewess is highly important in certain industries and it is a recognized fact that she demands higher wages than other immigrant girls, or for that matter, than native Americans.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Jewish trade unions are the weakest, but this proves that the Jewish worker tries to better himself, and at the first opportunity, he <pb facs="5423972_2_1029.jpg" n="4"/>will enter a business or profession that will give him a better chance to develop and progress.</p>
   <p>Like immigrants of other nationalities, the Jewish immigrant suffers from the fact that the American influences, customs, and language tend to tear the children away from their parents. But various methods are adopted to bring the children back to their parents. Modern Talmud Torahs and Sabbath schools are built. In these schools Jewish children become acquainted with the spirit and the tradition of the Jews. Thus, a national sentiment is inculcated.</p>
   <p>Even if all nationalities fuse in this melting pot of American life, traces of Judaism will remain because the Jews have contributed their share.</p>
