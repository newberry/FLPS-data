<title level="a">A PLEA THAT ARMOUR AND COMPANY, MEAT PACKERS, SHOULD HIRE AN INSPECTOR OF KOSHER MEAT AND COMPLY WITH THE JEWISH DIETARY LAWS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>At a well-attended meeting, held yesterday by the Chicago Kosher Butchers' Association, the members agreed unanimously to demand from Armour and Company to install a kosher meat inspector in their packing plant. The reason for this demand is because it happens very frequently that non-kosher meat is stamped "kosher" and is sold to Jewish butchers as kosher meat.</p>
   <p>It was definitely established at this meeting that Armour and Company's slaughter house is the only one which cannot be relied upon to supply strictly kosher meat. You can never tell whether their meat with a kosher stamp or seal is real kosher meat, according to the Jewish dietary laws. These doubts arise because the workers in the packing plant are careless. They are the ones who make the mistakes. The management did not know anything about this negligence.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0301.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A committee will call at the Armour slaughter house and present the demand for a suitable inspector who will stamp the kosher meat himself and not allow anyone else to do any stamping or sealing.</p>
