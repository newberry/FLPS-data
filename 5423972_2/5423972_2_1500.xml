   <p>In two former articles of this journal (No. 5 and No. 8) it was stated that the number of inter-marriages between Jews and non-Jews is constantly increasing, and that this inter-marrying will work as a powerful destructive element within Judiasm, if wise measures will not be taken in time to counteract them.</p>
   <p>We know that not every Israelite will, with regard to mixed marriages, look so pessimistically into the future of Israel. But, gentlemen, in 99 cases out of 100, the descendants of mixed couples, even of such in which the mother is, or was, an Israelite, have lost all adherence to,all knowledge of, all connection with Judaism. We could, in proof of this, give illustrations from facts that happened and still happen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>There was a time when there was good and sound sense in the doctrine that Once a Jew, Always a Jew. When a Jew was understood to be a member <pb facs="5423972_2_1501.jpg" n="2"/>of a distinct nation or tribe, he could not cease to be a Jew by having a few drops of water sprinkled upon his head. But Judaism divests itself daily in more and more of its tribal garb. It becomes daily more and more denationalized. It enters evidently more and more into a new phase of its history, when it will be transformed into a religious community, and lay aside its national garments. The process of denationalization will be greatly hastened on by the rapidly increasing number of inter-marriages.</p>
   <p>While our nationality is about being lost in Western Europe and in America, our duty is now to see to it, that our religion shall remain as a mighty spiritual power in the world, and that our own kinsman, our children, and our grandchildren shall be kept within the Jewish boundaries. And our hope is, that the denationalization of Judaism will in the end prove to be one of the great blessings of mankind; the transformation of Judaism into a world-conquering religion.</p>
