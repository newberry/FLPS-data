   <p>In Monday's edition of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, appeared an editorial on the above subject. You deserve, and are assured of thanks as well as recognition from all Jews for your honest, correct and courageous conception regarding the difference of these two words.</p>
   <p>You hit the nail on the head. This race of Walachia (also spelled Wallachia) and Russia, whose cultural standard is still more than half Asiatic; these people cannot rid themselves and have no intention of ridding themselves of the dirt that has surrounded them since remote antiquity; they find it impossible to comprehend the spirit of the time, to understand progress, religion and civil liberty.</p>
   <p>Their education is limited to the Talmud and superstitions; they are mendicants in Europe and peddlers throughout America. They are the type, which our Christian co-citizens designate as Yiddish, and the term is justified. In Prague, and other old Jewish cities, we still find, even today, Jewish districts (Jewish quarters) whose inhabitants form a state within a state, <pb facs="5423972_2_1466.jpg" n="2"/>just as we have here in our great and lovely Garden City, a similar section at Canal Street near 12th street. There the people's trade, barter, language and morals, are still a relic of past ages, the "second-hand Egypt". In one word they are Yiddish, but not the intelligent Jew, whose homes bid a welcome to all cultured people, regardless of their religious beliefs - where one meets ambitious men; their capable wives and the young generation. Continue in the same spirit, Mr. Editor, the time is near when Schiller's words will bear fruit: "Let us be a united people, brothers all", only with this distinction, - the sisters are included.</p>
   <p>A Jew.</p>
