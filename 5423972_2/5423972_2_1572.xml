<title level="a">GROCERS PROVE THAT HIGH PRICE OF SUGAR IS NOT THEIR FAULT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The statement by officials of the American Refining Company, published in the Courier, in which blame for the high cost of sugar is placed upon the retailers, brought to this office many Jewish grocers in violent protest against the statements of the sugar barons. The latter claim that they sell sugar to the retailers at nine cents a pound, according to the price set by the Federal Sugar Board. The grocers displayed bills showing payments of more than nine cents a pound for sugar, and clamored that accusations labeling them as sugar profiteers were therefore false. Here are some samples of the sugar prices which Mr. Max Karashik, a grocer at 3417 Twelfth Place, had to pay recently to the brokers, according to the bills which he brought into the Courier office:</p>
   <p>Bill dated July 31, $11.35.</p>
   <p>Bill dated July 22, $11.45.</p>
   <p>Bill dated July 20, $11.55.</p>
   <p>Bill dated July 26, $13.25.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1573.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The prices quoted above are for one hundred pounds of granulated sugar in bags. All prices quoted were net cash.</p>
   <p>The last price mentioned, means thirteen and a quarter cents per pound, plus one quarter of a cent for delivery. Sugar costs the grocer, therefore, thirteen and a half cents a pound, and he cannot sell it for less than fourteen cents a pound. The bills brought by all the other grocers to the Courier office yesterday were similar to those of Mr. Karashik's.</p>
   <p>Word was received yesterday that United States District Attorney Klein will file a claim tomorrow in the Federal Court against the sugar brokers, charging them with unlawful profiteering on sugar during the war and with selling it at considerably more than nine cents a pound. It is said that one of the first to be indicted in this sugar case will be a prominent Chicago broker, whose name is at present being withheld by Mr. Klein.</p>
