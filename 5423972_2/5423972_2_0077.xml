   <p>Jewish mothers are no exception to their [i.e., they too should supervise and censor movies] censorship or supervision of the films their children go to see at their neighborhood movie houses. Often they are glad to see their children go off to the scene of amusement, and the opportunity it affords them for a quiet moment at home, the doing of some household duty or the fulfillment of another obligation without the noise and disturbance that is more or less natural with the presence of children. We believe that nothing is more wholesome than a wholesome movie, nothing more instructive, more intimately influential on the mind of a child than a good film, for in truth, a good film, like any transcript from life in art form, must be beneficial to the mind, especially to the mind that is yet plastic and capable of large expansion and intensification. A bad film, however, must be in no less degree harmful, and certainly Jewish mothers and fathers, recognizing this fact, should exercise <pb facs="5423972_2_0078.jpg" n="2"/>some judgment in the carte blanche they seem to be allowing their children in this manner. Just as good chums and good, rather than bad books, are most desirable for daily companionship, for both child and adult, so good films are desirable, too, in so far as they represent a part of our life and interest in life. Now there is no denying that the screen life is today very definitely a part of our education and recreation both, and hence it is, we think, rationally desirable that the selection of such a relationship be wisely made.</p>
