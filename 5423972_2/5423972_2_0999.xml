   <p>At the second convention of the Hebrew Teachers of America, the former secretary, K. Whittman, expressed himself as follows:</p>
   <p>The education, as we Hebrews understand, consists of three units - Hebrew education, National, and Zionist education. There are Zionists who are not Nationalists; that concern themselves with demonstrations and other external appearances. They require no change in the regular routine of human life. Therefore, it becomes necessary to emphasize Nationalism.</p>
   <p>The president of the Hebrew Teachers Convention, Reuben Bragen the well-known author, confirmed the statement of the chairman, adding - "I know Zionists that would not mind in the least if the Jews would convert themselves in Jerusalem."</p>
   <p>Those Hebrew teachers and Zionists that were raised among the Jewish masses and feel with the nation, must look on with heartaches at the evil assimilated; cheap politicians and so-called social workers, who call themselves Zionists, and even some Mizrachists (Orthodox Zionists) are ready to sell their entire race, with all its ideals, for any little job in the land where they live.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1000.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Zionists and even Poale Zion have a dudgeon. The world says that; but the truth cannot be kept secret very long and the true Zionists themselves must explain to the entire world that Nationalism and Zionism are different things and that whoever is a Zionist needs not be an assimilator and a hypocrite.</p>
