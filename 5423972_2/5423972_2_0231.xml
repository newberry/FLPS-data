   <p>When we read in the work of A. Litvin, A. S. Sachs, S. Rosenfield, and so forth, the descriptions of the man-loving rabbis of Eastern Europe, we find that they practiced in life the writings of the ancient sacred chronicles, that the "race (Hebrew) was before the Torah," but we search in vain, on our American grounds to find a ray of the holy light, that illuminates the spirit of the European rabbis.</p>
   <p>And when we see that several "orthodox" synagogues lie in the hands of godless politicians and that their "rabbis" peddle with Kosher license and bow down before every Jewish and Gentile Haman, we, then begin to think that the American atmosphere can not digest the "Cedars of Lebanon," the strong Jewish oaks, which have grown into forests in Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>We are forced to change our opinion upon observing Rabbi Simon Harry Album. We must agree then, that America is not the cause of our rabbi's becoming business men and politicians. On the contrary, they would have been magicians or organ grinders in Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0232.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The true rabbi, he who belongs to the tradition of Rabbi Israel Salanter, Rabbi Hyman Brisker, Rabbi Meyer Radiner, does not become a dishonest rabbi in America. This can be illustrated with Rabbi Album, whom the great rabbis, throughout the world, honor with the name eminent scholar or "the prince of the Torah", and whose word about Jewish religious affairs, is recognized as law among all the young, as well as old, rabbis.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Album was raised in the spirit of the popular scholars of Eastern Europe. He did not peddle with Judaism, did not earn his livelihood by granting Kosher licenses, and did not bow down before those, who became wealthy from the sweat and blood of the poor man. He was always ready to fight for the honor of the Law of the Prophets, and for the interests of the Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>He did not come to America with the intention of being a rabbi, but with the intention of securing sustenance from private industry. His body, however, was too weak for physical labor, and his soul was too pure for the atmosphere of business. He was forced to become rabbi in an academy of <pb facs="5423972_2_0233.jpg" n="3"/>poverty-stricken students. His weekly salary was smaller than a well paid laborer earns in one day. Yet he lived, up to the standard of a spiritual leader of a race.</p>
   <p>No one seeing with what pride he refused to accept money, could believe that such a man could resist remuneration, he interpreted matters and laws of the Torah, devoted much effort towards making peace between man and wife (he never granted a divorce), went to the stockyards to watch the observation of the dietary meat laws. He visited the butcher shops, the bakeries (so that they should not work on the Sabbath), he lectured in synagogues, helped in founding Hebrew Schools, the Theological College, the Home for the Aged, always defended the schoctim (Kosher animal slaughterers), was for sometime the only rabbi on the West Side, and held the entire supervision of Judaism in his hands. But whatever he did was for idealistic motives and without any material and selfish objectives.</p>
   <p>When the meat magnates became aware that the noted rabbi was working without pay, they wanted to agree upon a wage for his visits to the slaughter house, but he proudly refused the offer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0234.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>His love for the broad masses and his strong sentiment for justice was clearly seen in his attitude towards a trust of Jewish butchers of Chicago, twenty-five years ago, in 1893. The butchers, at that time, had planned to carry through a small trust, which should control the Jewish meat markets by not permitting new butchers to enter and also to raise the price of meat. In order to sanctify their trust, they offered Rabbi Album a sum of money for his approval, but he scornfully rejected it.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Album also was not satisfied with the role of passive onlooker, but he, himself, began the fight against the trust. He opened a people's butcher shop, where he sold meat at low prices and forced the trust to dissolve.</p>
   <p>Later, when a clique, at the Jewish Courier, became ambitious for the rule of the city by introducing taxes and being astride the Jewish "House", the new social workers sought to drag Rabbi Album into their gang, in order to carry on their corruption. Because he left them, they threw many false accusations at him.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Album, who possesses a sharp pen, is one of the most brilliant and remarkable <pb facs="5423972_2_0235.jpg" n="5"/>scholastic writers, among the orthodox rabbis of America.</p>
   <p>The fight against Rabbi Album was very bitter. He was libeled by the Jewish Courier, and other hypocrites, who canvass Judaism. There were also such city-robbers in Chicago, who hired gangsters to murder him. But Rabbi Album always triumphed. He stood against them with the strong weapon of truth and righteousness.</p>
   <p>The Jewish masses know how to estimate the work of the sixty-eight year old sage. His household is waited by old and young, and everyone wishes that this eminent, popular scholar, the pride of Judaism in Chicago, should live for many more years and continue to protect and to fight for Judaism.</p>
