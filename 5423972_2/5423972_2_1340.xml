   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The doctrine of selection, as Dr. Hirsch calls it, appears to be much the same as the doctrine of the survival of the fittest, only it apparently supposes an inscrutable intelligence to standing behind and directing the operation of the law -a conscious, purposeful intelligence in which the believer in the theory of evolution may or may not believe.</p>
   <p>In his application of the doctrine to his own, the Jewish, people Dr. Hirsch seems to be exceptionally depressed, to be suffering from a pessimistic attack which disturbs his mental vision. He builds on the theory that each individual and each race is selected for some purposes, the Greek for imparting beauty, the Roman for civic organization, the German for thoroughness, and so through the list of races, and he crowns his theory with the idea that the Jew is chosen for ignominy and suffering and must continue to suffer until butchery and savagery shall be no longer necessary in the plan of life.</p>
   <p>The suffering of his people in the present disordered condition in Russia, although <pb facs="5423972_2_1341.jpg" n="2"/>they are not the only sufferers, seems to have induced this exceptional depression of mood. Why characterize the Greek, the Roman, the German, each for his particular gift save that of enduring pain and the other races have not that gift or are not called to exercise it?</p>
   <p>Have there indeed been no tortures inflicted on anybody but the Jews? What of the torturing and smothering of the classic civilizations under the ocean of barbarism - a vast, bloody tragedy in comparison with which the trampling out of the little Jewish state of Titus may be regarded as a skirmish in comparison with a pitched battle?</p>
   <p>What of the dragonnades of Louis, of the Albigenses, of the Fronde, of the Terror, of the Moors and the Spaniards, of the welter of blood since the world began? Has the Jew alone suffered?</p>
   <p>Looking to the other side, it is true that the Jew has not revealed a gift of state-building for himself, but has not he revealed other capacities in as signal fashion as the capacity to suffer?</p>
   <p>Since the fall of the classic civilization, at least, has he not developed acuteness <pb facs="5423972_2_1342.jpg" n="3"/>and breadth in the accumulation of the wealth whereon civilization rests in greater degree than any other? Has he ever had a rival in that regard until within a generation?</p>
   <p>Has he not contributed to the intellectual wealth of the world in a degree exceptional for his numbers? Is not this especially true of the whole aesthetic and artistic side of human life?</p>
   <p>Did not his people more than any other give to the world the monotheistic idea? And has not one of his race been worshiped for 2,000 years by races now dominant in the world as an integral element in the omnipotent God of monotheism?</p>
   <p>If he thinks his suffering exceptional one may respond that not he alone has suffered tortures and that, while other races have developed compensating gifts of conquests, of state-building and others which in fairness must be balanced against what they have suffered, so too, have the Jews developed compensations which must be weighed in striking their balance - a balance which will not be found lower than all others, though Dr. Hirsch's dicta would appear to lean toward that meaning.</p>
