   <p>The owners of Jewish bakeries in Chicago are longing for a strike.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Jewish Bakers Union, local 237, a better, written by Irving I. Cohen, their business manager was read, which signified that the Jewish worker should be at the mercy of the owners, in order to help them make profits for their invested capital.</p>
   <p>Since the reduction of bread at 2Â¢ per pound, they thought the salaries were eating up all their profit. It was resolved that the workers lowered in pay at the food will of the workers themselves, without any strike. They applied the term concession, so that they may continue with their business and profit by it. Not a word was mentioned about a reduction of sugar, flour, or other articles consumed in the bakeries.</p>
   <p>Morris Ziskind, representative of the United Jewish Trades, declared that <pb facs="5423972_2_1683.jpg" n="2"/>the owners of the bakeries will hear from the Union, and they are fooling themselves by thinking that any sort of concessions will be considered by the workers. Morris Ziskind also spoke of the high cost of living and how it effects the worker. Ziskind moved to elect a committee to deal with the owners. Those appointed on the committee are: V. e. Kraus, H. Krishen, Walter Krash, L. Weissbaum, and M. Ziskind.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were adopted and were submitted to the Forward: That the workers are underpaid in normal times, and if their pay will be reduced, a strike will be carried on.</p>
