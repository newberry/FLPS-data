<title level="a">JEWS, CATHOLICS, AND PROTESTANTS ASSEMBLE AT HANUCCAH FESTIVAL TO PREACH LOVE AND TOLERANCE AMONG ALL RACES</title></bibl>

   <p>A Hanuccah feast was served in the banquet hall of the Kehiloth Anshe Maariv Temple, the oldest Jewish Reform Congregation in Chicago, Thursday evening, where the main guests invited were Catholics and Protestants. It was a feast of "brotherhood" among the Jews and Christians and a great number of compliments were exchanged.</p>
   <p>The Hanuccah feast was arranged by the Kehiloth Anshe Maariv Congregation. Seventy Jewish guests were invited. Each guest was to bring a Christian friend who was introduced as "my best Christian friend." At the head of the table were seated both rabbis of the temple, Tobias Scheolfarber and Solomon Freehof; the Catholic priest, Father Joseph Reiner, dean of Loyola University, and the Rev. Ralph Davis, pastor of Hyde Park Presbyterian Church. The feast lasted for three hours and the prelates praised the Jews in their speeches and, in return, the rabbis complimented the Christians.</p>

   <p>Rev. Ralph Davis, who was introduced by the president of the Kehiloth Anshe Maariv as "our good friend and neighbor," gave a length talk in which he said that we should no longer think of the intolerant concepts of the Middle Ages, but to live in brotherly peace and to be related through common sympathies and friendship, and that one should respect the other's convictions.</p>
   <p>Then, the Catholic priest, Father Reiner, dean of Loyola University, was introduced. He said he preaches intolerance, but only intolerance towards criminals, intolerance towards the immoral, and the home-destroyers.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Freehof ended the speeches with these words: "How unimportant are the things that divide us and how great and important are the things we have in common."</p>
