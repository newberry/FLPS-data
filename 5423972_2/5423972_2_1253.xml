   <p>Anderson, who is a partner in a barber shop near Salinski's store, case in to Salinski yesterday, and offered to sell him a shirt. When Salinski refused the negro insulted him, and breaking a glass pane in the front door, he ran out into the street. Salinski ran after him, but near Maxwell St. the negro stopped and stuck a knife in his pursuer.</p>
   <p>The negro was endangered of beinglynched by the crowd that ran after him and caught him, and it was with great difficulty that the police of the Maxwell St. Station managed to free him from the mob and arrest him.</p>
