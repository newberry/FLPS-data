   <p>The Federated Orthodox Charities of Chicago has a membership of 8,300; the Associated has a membership of 6,000, but still the Federated, although its budget is very moderate, is always in financial straits, while the Associated with less members is flourishing financially. It is also good to bear in mind that a great many south and north side Jews also support the Federated in spite of the fact that they are not Orthodox Jews--in any meaning of the term. They do it because they feel it their duty to come to the aid of an organization that is doing so much good among a vast section of our people in Chicago. Of course it is also true that a great many Orthodox Jews support the Associated. Among the prominent members of the Associated will be found men and women who are also highly prominent among the Orthodox Jews and preside over the destinies of the Orthodox community. We need only mention the <pb facs="5423972_2_0571.jpg" n="2"/>names of James Davis, Samuel Phillipson, B. Horwich, M. Ph. Ginzburg, and many others, who contribute liberally to the Associated. But the fact remains that while the Associated is very seldom short of funds, although its membership is not as large as that of the Federated, the Federated is always in financial straits and must resort to drives and campaigns to make both ends meet. How is this remarkable phenomenon to be explained?</p>
   <p>It is true that the west side Jews are by no means as wealthy, or even half as wealthy, as the Jews of the north and the south side, but as a whole they are a well-to-do people and can be considered a good middle-class group. Since they are large in numbers, they should at least contribute $300,000 a year to the Federated, so that the main charity organization of the Orthodox community be in a position not only to pay its bills but to expand and develop. But it seems to us--and this is also the impression of our people in the north and in the south Sides--that the West side Jews do not do all they can for the Federated, and as a matter of fact they do not do their plain duty towards the main charity organization of the Orthodox community. Men who are in a position <pb facs="5423972_2_0572.jpg" n="3"/>to contribute a hundred dollars a year, give only ten or twenty dollars a year; a man who could easily give fifty dollars a year is satisfied with giving five or ten dollars a year, and the result is that there is a vast membership but no money. This results in the necessity of resorting to special drives to which the non-Orthodox element also contributes.</p>
   <p>Altogether it is a very deplorable state of affairs. The plain fact is that the Orthodox Jews in Chicago, forming the majority of the Jewry, are economically so situated that they can very well maintain the Federated and supply it with all the funds it needs, and they do not do it. They are relying on us to do it. But since the greatest donors have most influence, it goes without saying that the mass of Orthodox Jews in the city of Chicago has less influence on the development of the Federated and all its policies than it ought to, because in proportion it gives less than it ought to. The results, of course, are plain. The Federated, the main Orthodox charity organization in Chicago, established by the Orthodox Jews and for the Orthodox Jews is not controlled by purely Orthodox elements. We do not say that those in control of the Federated are not alive <pb facs="5423972_2_0573.jpg" n="4"/>to their task, as leaders of an Orthodox organization. They are all able men and very devoted to the great cause, but they are not leaders of Orthodoxy and do not claim to represent Orthodoxy. They say, however, that those who represent Orthodoxy in Chicago should be more closely connected with the Federated, and if they are not, it is because they do not do their duty towards the Federated and do not want to assume responsibility. To these people we say this: If you want to run the Federated in your spirit, support the Federated, give all you can to the Federated, in money and time, and then you will have all the control you want to; but as long as you do not do for the Federated as much as others do, you must not bear a grudge against those who are in control of the Federated, although they are not as Orthodox as you are. They give their money and time and are willing to assume responsibility, nay they are compelled to assume responsibility because you try to evade responsibility. Give as much to the Federated as they do and you will be in their place. Double or treble your membership dues, give more of your time and energy to the Federated, and you will be gladly admitted to leadership. [Editor's note: This article is in English originally.
