   <p>At a meeting at the Covenant Club last Friday the Chicago division of the American League for the Defense of Jewish Rights elected eighteen delegates to attend a convention of the League in New York City on September 10. Delegates from cities in all parts of the country are to gather to discuss the boycott situation of products of Nazi Germany.</p>
   <p>The Chicago delegates are Ald. Jacob M. Avery, Gen. John V. Clinnin, Morris Katz, John Rissman, Dr. Samuel B. Hollander, H. B. Ritman, A. H. Rosenberg, Harry Lipsky, Louis Harrison, Jacob G. Grossberg, George A. Gordon, Joseph R. Dorfman, A. Paul Holleb, J. B. Berland, Joseph Weil, Abraham Feldman, A. Z. Halperin and Charles P. Schwartz.</p>

   <p>Master in Chancery Max M. Korshak, presided at the meeting. The speakers, who included General Clinnin and Paul Hutchison, editor of the Christian Century, declared that there should be a universal boycott of Germany in condemnation of its treatment of Jews.</p>
   <p>LETTER FROM LEVINSON.</p>
   <p>Mr. Korshak received a letter from Mr. Salmon O. Levinson, noted peace worker, in which he said:</p>
   <p>"I have followed Mr. Untermyer's activities with the keenest interest and great admiration. While in my international work I have opposed the theory of governmental boycott, I feel that there is a clearly defined distinction with reference to individuals in relation to the outrageous treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. I feel all the more <pb facs="5423972_2_0398.jpg" n="3"/>strongly on the subject because, for several years, I devoted a substantial part of my time here and in Europe in endeavoring to promote a settlement of the war legacies with an especial view to the liberation of Germany from the thraldom of the peace treaties.</p>
   <p>"I am therefore disposed to support in substance a movement so courageously and effectively launched by Mr. Untermyer. It strikes me as the only natural defense that we can make to the uncivilized conduct of Hitler and his colleagues."</p>
