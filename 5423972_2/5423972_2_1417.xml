   <p>The Cincinnati reprint of American Israelite in Chicago in its last issue, complains of the dereliction of our Jewish citizens who manage public affairs, that its reporters are not invited to report the Jewish doings in this city and says:</p>
   <p>"Nowhere but here in Chicago is the Jewish press thus treated. Some of the leaders of important institutions through the fact of catering for notoriety, and bending efforts in that direction, are so entirely wrapt up in their own conceit and their supreme selfishness that they forget not only to show proper courtesy to their representative journal, but also to their fast friends. Away with this miserable way of attempting to curry favor with those who cannot nor will not do any real good for the institutions."</p>
   <p>These statements are as untruthful as they are base. If the Jewish citizens of Chicago do not care to have their affairs mentioned in an interloping <pb facs="5423972_2_1418.jpg" n="2"/>concern, they cannot be blamed. We are quite sure that they do not care for the libelous attacks, or to be blackmailed in that way. The Israelites of this city have long since known that the Wises of Cincinnati do not represent Chicago's interests. The elder Wise's theological gabble does not have any following in Chicago. In Cincinnati the Israelite appears on Thursday or Friday - they are devout Jews there - but in Chicago, it appears on the Jewish Sabbath, Saturday, virtually desecrating the Jewish Sabbath. In Chicago, Israelites abhor such demagoguery and deceit. Another lie flaunted at the head of its Chicago reprint is its Cincinnati's volume number, to make its advertisers believe, especially those who do not know much about Jewish newspapers, that its age gave character to it. The Jewish people of Chicago fully understand the underhanded methods of the Wises of Cincinnati, who want to subordinate Chicago to Cincinnati by foisting upon our community a reprint of their senseless and valueless journal upon our great city. Its whole stock in trade is simply an endless gossip-monging twaddle, and "personal" advertising sheet. But when the reprint speaks of the Jewish press being badly treated, the writer should be reminded that he falsifies and misrepresents us, The Occident. We have never been thus treated, we have always had the most cordial invitations to be present at all important meetings and affairs and have <pb facs="5423972_2_1419.jpg" n="3"/>ever fostered and encouraged our Jewish institutions. The only subjects the reprint of Cincinnati mentions favorable is when the Hebrew Union College Committee goes begging. The Wises are interested only in that, as all monies and subscriptions filched from our Chicago people goes eventually into their pockets. For this reason our Jewish citizens do not care to have their matters aired in a third class town or journal like the Israelite's reprint. The date line "Chicago" over the original Cincinnati issue is another fraud which our Chicago people "got on" to lately. It may serve as a means to get advertisements with, but even innocently deluded patrons soon find out what a snare and delusion they were inveigled into as they never get any adequate results from such a cunningly devised scheme. The sooner our mercantile people learn these facts, the better. They do not edit, print, or publish their reprint in Chicago - they pay no taxes in Chicago - they sneak matters to Cincinnati overnight and the result is a Cincinnati reprint on Saturdays - the Jewish day of rest. All this being done under the name of I. M. Wise, Rabbi of B'nai Jeshurun Congregation, Cincinnati.</p>
