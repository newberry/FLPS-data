<title level="a">THE REVISED CONSTITUTION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND THE JEWS</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Doctor A. Margolin</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The revised Constitution of the League of Nations was unanimously accepted at the meeting of the Peace Conference on April 17.</p>
   <p>The original twenty-six points of the Constitution, which must, according to Wilson's assurance, support "the justice and peace of the world," have remained almost unaltered. The amendments of Japan for race equality, and the amendments of France for an international military organization, were withdrawn by these worthy diplomats. Some of the smaller countries, such as Greece and Belgium, will be represented in the executive body of the League. Its headquarters and secretary are already chosen, and everything is being prepared.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0984.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bleeding mankind is saved. But what about the Jewish question? Just as in its first form, the second form of the Constitution is conspicious in the obvious absence of the homeless Jewish question.</p>
   <p>The matter is self-explanatory. At a meeting of the Peace Conference, where Dmovsky, Paderewsky, Brotianu, and Leon Burzu advised Lansing.... it is impossible for Jews to take an equal place in the statutes of the League with such cultured peoples as the Poles, Rumanians, Brazilians, and Greeks.</p>
   <p>It was quite obvious that Jews were not given the minority rights of the small nations, for otherwise, it would ascertain protection for the Jews against persecution and pogroms thus reflecting unfavorably on some of the peace-driven makers who helped to form the Constitution.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0985.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Naturally, there were no Jewish representatives invited to the League of Nations, in spite of all mediators in our behalf, and the loving concern of our Palestinian Trustee, England, which also shared our interests, and in spite of all memorandums, promises and appeals to the proper authorities.</p>
   <p>Jews may not have a diplomatic higher tribunal for appeal from oppression and persecution among civilized allied nations as Poland, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, etc., for Jews are categorized by the official Jingo-press, and by various Conference members as revolutionaries and bolsheviks....</p>
   <p>The only hope held by some of our optimists lies in the principal article of race equality, so strongly demanded by the Japanese to be entered as a point in the Constitution of the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>It was hoped that this would make for national equality, even for the yellow race among other nations, and an assurance for the Jews everywhere <pb facs="5423972_2_0986.jpg" n="4"/>for citizen and national minority rights, granting us an equal, emancipated representation among the family of nations.</p>
   <p>But it was not to be so. Japan was forced to withdraw her unwelcomed amendment. Thus, our Jewish political mediators were robbed of their last "paper bridge."</p>
   <p>Have the great Jewish masses unwittingly placed weights on the salvation of Jews at the Paris secret and entangled peace meeting? Did they, too, believe that the pillars of European imperialism and the Annexed Zionists, who cannot arrive at peace terms without war profits, even with Socialistic states, are in a position to protect small nations and bring salvation for the Jews?</p>
   <p>If so, it is a pity. It indicates that our practical common sense, and <pb facs="5423972_2_0987.jpg" n="5"/>healthy national desire for truth and justice are absolutely degenerated, our thoughts, which are forever the vanguard of every new current idea of freedom, have, from much doubt, become dependent and paralyzed.</p>
   <p>Yet, we are certain that this is not the case. The Jewish working masses, who have had a correct, healthy, instinctive point of view about the entire War with all its aims and consequences, have placed very little hope in salvation and consolation from diplomatic secret treaties and constitutions. Just as previously in all our dark diaspora epics, Jews, now too, will not seek any rights and justice based on Imperial advice and decisions, but will await the international democracy to which belong the opposing and future hegemony of mankind.</p>
   <p>Its righteousness is our justice, and its triumph is the proper solution to the Jewish question.</p>
