   <p>The subject of this editorial may appear to be peculiar to some. This peculiarity is due to the subject matter handled. Therefore, those that read it will feel neither surprised nor alarmed at the statements that follow or at the conclusions arrived.</p>
   <p>We continually hear that Judaism is losing its foothold in Chicago. We are in a position to know the true facts of the case. Upon investigation we find the case to be true in that district known as the ghetto. Lunchrooms owned and controlled by Jewish proprietors, whose windows display in big Hebrew letters, Basar Kasher [kosher meat], and who have been sending around circulars giving in detail a full explanation of the menus prepared for the Passover, thereby gaining trade from people who are by conviction Orthodox in their belief and observance, particularly during Passover, found to their <pb facs="5423972_2_0322.jpg" n="2"/>utter dismay, after having bought holiday meal tickets for the entire week, that bread and other eatables not allowed during the holiday were served.</p>
   <p>This thing ought to be done away with. The people should get together and put an end to the practice of demanding prices for one type of article and of giving another type of article in its place. This fraud is being carried on every year not only in restaurants but also in stores that advertise their Passover wares with Passover labels supposedly signed by Orthodox rabbis. When the rabbis are asked whether they permitted their signatures to be used on the labels they usually answer that they know nothing about the product. The people must get what they pay for. We shall use these columns to acquaint the public with the facts, after a thorough investigation has been made.</p>
