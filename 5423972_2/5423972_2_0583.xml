   <p>The clockmakers suffered during the last few seasons due to insufficient work in their trade and, therefore, many clockmakers were unemployed for many months.</p>
   <p>The executive board of the clockmakers local unions have therefore, determined to recommend to their members that a large fund be created in order to improve the clockmakers as much as possible.</p>
   <p>One of the most popular plans that will be proposed at a mass meeting to be called soon, is that every member who in employed, should give a certain percentage of his earnings to establish his financial security during employment. This proposal is being highly praised in the clockmaker circles and, if it should be adopted, it will demonstrate the true spirit of union fraternity.</p>
