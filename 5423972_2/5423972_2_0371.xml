   <p>Considerable attention has been directed to the fact that several prominent clergymen of this city have recently determined to seek a fresh woods and pastures anew, and there has been an effort to create the impression that this ministerial exodus is a reflection upon the ability and willingness of Chicago churches to sustain their pastors.</p>
   <p>Within the last few days, however, not less than four eminent clergymen have been enticed away from their Chicago congregations. Robert Collyer, the Unitarian; Dr. Patton, the Presbyterian controversialist; Dr. Harris, the pastor of St. James' Episcopal Church; and Dr. Kohler, the Jewish Rabbi, seek to have decided with one accord to seek new spheres of usefulness.</p>
   <p>As to Dr. Kohler, the Jewish Rabbi, he has the best reason of all for quitting Chicago. Two Sundays are too much for the most orthodox and most devout minister. We don't believe that any Christian clergyman could stand it. One day in seven set aside for Divine worship, whether it be the Sabbath (Saturday) or Sunday, the seventh or the first day in the week, - is a proper and salutary allotment, which both Jew and Christian believe to be of Divine origin; but the devotion of two days to church- <pb facs="5423972_2_0372.jpg" n="2"/>going is certainly exacting. Those Israelites may stand it who, being in doubt, go to church neither on Saturday nor on Sunday, but the Rabbi, who must put in an appearance on both days, in justified in looking up a congregation that will be satisfied with one day in the week. Chicago has reason to regret collectively, as the various congregations do individually, the loss of clergymen who have done such excellent service in this country.</p>
