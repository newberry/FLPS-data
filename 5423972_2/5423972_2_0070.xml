   <p>May the 19th will be Chicago's Boys' Week and plans for some fitting celebration of the occasion are being rushed now. It is only proper that it be so. However, we may ask, what will be the good of it all? What will such a celebration achieve for our boys? How will they be benefited by the noise of shouting and the din of music and the pretense of their reigning power during the week? Something much more important could be done for the boys of Chicago and the United States than the celebration of a boys' week. If attempts were made to improve the lot of many of the children of the city, whose circumstances are anything but conducive to good future citizenship and a happy life, much more positive results could be obtained, and the celebrants could more easily congratulate themselves upon their achievements. Many boys go to work when they should be at school and others, by force of circumstance, fall into groups that are unfavorable for their future development. Every week in the year <pb facs="5423972_2_0071.jpg" n="2"/>ought to be boys' and girls' week. Else the entire business is but a polite sham. The coming celebration may do a bit of good somewhere, but if it could impress upon us the necessity for a policy of continual assistance to the children and the youths of the time, its achievement would be of a more significant and permanent character.</p>
   <p>Professor Forrest A. Kingsbury, an eminent pyschologist at the University of Chicago, commenting on the intelligence tests taken of the army personnel during the war, asserts that we are a nation not so much of illiterates but a race of "dumb-bells". This is far from a high compliment to us, but the professor speaks as an authority and since we may not pretend as much, we must accept his conclusions, even if we shrug our shoulders in skepticism or cynical disapproval of his statement. Why is this so and what, if anything, can be done about it? The learned servant offers us no opinion on these very important inquiries of ours. Yet some solution of these problems must be offered. We may not pretend to any exceptional wisdom or experience, but since the deed <pb facs="5423972_2_0072.jpg" n="3"/>must be done, or at least some solution must be offered, we will attempt one, and leave the right of approval or condemnation to our readers. Hence, in brief, we say that to provide a generation that shall be an improvement upon our own, we need to inculcate in our children the belief never before generally taught at our schools, the belief that more wisdom and not quite as much money is essential for a happy life, a belief we all subscribe to, in a way, but rarely practice. We must see that our children learn less about the value of money and more the value of thinking for one self. We must train them to act in accordance with what they may be taught at school. The achievement of this end is a rather difficult one but it is worth while, if possible of realization. It would certainly make a saner and a more intelligent nation of us.</p>
