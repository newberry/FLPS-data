   <p>The custom adopted by Jews, especially American Jews, to send Leshonu Tovu (New Year) cards to relatives and friends is a beautiful tradition, that deserves to be made more beautiful.</p>
   <p>Large sums of money are being spent every year on all sorts of cards that are being sent out in such large numbers, that before New Year's, the post offices in the Jewish districts are overloaded with large and small envelopes containing New Year's wishes from Jews to Jews. The cards in the envelopes are plain, on them is no more than "A Happy New Year," with the name of the sender, written or printed. Some are large with a picture of Moses or Aaron, Isaac, Moses Montefiore, Dr. Herzl, the Holy Temple, or the Menorah (candelabra and the Ten Commandments).</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0237.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nearly everyone sends out New Year's cards, and everyone who has relatives and friends, are bound to receive a few days before New Year's, a number of such cards. Jews in business, having many acquaintances, receive these New Year's cards in such large quantities that they cannot spare the time to remove them from the envelopes to see who they are from. In most houses they are not even taken out of the envelopes but are given to the children to play with.</p>
   <p>So as the years pass by, this beautiful tradition must lose its beauty, and this would be to our great sorrow, even if it were in most cases no more than just a formality. Still, this tradition has in it a Jewish ideal that fits in the spirit of the Jewish New Year's.</p>
   <p>In order that this tradition may not vanish it's necessary to make it more beautiful and more important.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0238.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The New Year's cards should be made to serve a higher purpose than to just bring good wishes for the New Year.</p>
   <p>We would recommend that every Jew who sends a New Year's card paste a stamp of the National Fund or the War Relief on each card.</p>
   <p>To one who sends out two or three dozen cards, the extra expense wouldn't mean much. If he spends one dollar for 25 New Year's cards including envelopes and stamps, he can spend 25 cents more for National Fund stamps. But if this would become a part of the tradition, it would bring in large sums of money for the National Fund. How much nicer would that tradition become if every year it would make possible another building, another institution, another place for Jewish workers to work. At present all the money goes for the cards and stamps and no practical results are achieved but if these cards were to serve for the Keren-Kayemes Leisrael (The National Fund), then everyone would have a double delight in sending such cards.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0239.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They would bring good wishes to friends and relatives, and at the same time bring large sums of money for the Jewish homeland.</p>
   <p>The beautiful national fund stamps would beautify the New Year cards, for instance, the stamp that represents Dr. Herzl in Palestine or the landscape of Pesach-Tikvu (a colony in Palestine), or the picture of Dr. Nordou, or of Echod Am (a renowned Jewish author), etc. New Year's cards with such stamps would soon become very popular. If only a few hundred Jews would start using them, the tradition would be beautified and would bring better results.</p>
