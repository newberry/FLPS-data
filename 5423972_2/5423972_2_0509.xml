   <p>The condition of the Jews in Poland has again assumed a critical character. The edict to expel [Jewish] Ukranian refugees has been pressed by the government official organs most cruelly, causing the economic ruin of foreign Jews. And the Warsaw Jews who tried to protect their unfortunate brethren were severely punished. Together with this national catastrophe, under the pretext of revenge for the execution of Bishop Bushkevitch, the political and social conditions of the Polish Jews themselves have become so aggravated that they no longer expect any protection against violence from the law, but are rather appealing to their own defenseless people for self-defense. The Warsaw pogrom, which was a result of Premier Sirkorski's encouraging politics in relation to the anti-Semitic Rozvoynicks [?], the pogroms in Mlava, Pozen, and Bromberg, awakened the Jewish representatives of the Sejm <pb facs="5423972_2_0510.jpg" n="2"/>[Polish Parliament] and of the Warsaw Jewish community from their dream that the Polish reactionaries will protect them against injustice and that the Polish Parliament will help them in their fight for humanity and justice.</p>
   <p>The Polish Parliament has, by a large majority of votes, abandoned the "urgent interpellation" of the Jewish deputies regarding the Warsaw pogrom, and has, contrariwise, urged President Waitchechowski's government to immediately rid Poland of Jewish refugees. Fortunately, Russia pardoned the unfortunate, "illegal" emigrants and permitted them to return to their homes. Germany opened her doors to a small portion of them and the Jewish Colonization Organization took them under its supervision. The condition of the Polish Jews proper has, at the same time, become hopeless. The Jewish representatives in both legislative chambers of Poland have, as a protest against injustice, left the session of the reactionary Parliament and have, at a protest meeting in a theater, under the watchword "Self-defense for the defenseless," adopted damning resolutions against the action of the <pb facs="5423972_2_0511.jpg" n="3"/>Warsaw Administration and of the Parliament.</p>
   <p>The Warsaw [Jewish] communal administration, the erstwhile fortress of assimilation and Chassidic hypocrisy, proclaimed, as a protest, a one-day strike in all Jewish business places and factories.</p>
   <p>In one word, the entire thinking Polish Jewry has openly taken a stand against the governments anti-Semitic policy and against the criminal acts of the organized Polish reaction.</p>
   <p>Not once has the history of Jewish life in the "liberated" Poland for the past five years brought about such a powerful and organized resistance of the Jewish citizenry against persecution, injustice, and pogroms as have the recent deplorable events in Poland, in which Sikorski's barbaric administration lined up with the hoodlums and the instigators of the boycott and refused to protect Jewish citizens against violent attacks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0512.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The independent political action and the united front of the Polish Jewry against the government-sanctioned anti-Semitism and the Polish reaction even frightened somewhat the Polish Rusvoynicks themselves.</p>
   <p>Paderewski's pogrom-sheet, Jetch Pas Polita, attacked the Jewish protest demonstrations ferociously and designated them as "conspiracies against the government," because they intended to arouse public sentiment abroad against Poland....and the reactionary newspaper, therefore, demanded that the government severely punish the Jewish deputies of the Parliament, who had organized these protest demonstrations. This, of course, is nonsense!</p>
   <p>The organized Jewry "abroad" can deal a mighty blow to the Polish government because of its criminal politics against Jewish citizens and, by taking a firm collective stand against the Polish pogrom policy, it can protect our brothers in the anti-Semitic country from further suffering and maltreatment on the part of Sirkorski's reaction.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0513.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Polish National Committee in America, at its last convention in Cleveland, resolved to raise ten million dollars in this country to aid both Polish Relief and Polish government finances.</p>
   <p>It would be no more than right that the Jewish Congress Committee in New York should, at once, call to the attention of the Polish National Committee, which seeks to raise in America financial support for the Polish Government, the scandalous politics of the Sikorski's administration in relation to the Polish Jews and the recent organized pogroms in Poland.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Congress Committee must demand of the Polish National Committee in America that it should influence the Sikorski's government to halt its Anti-Semitic, volcanic, and barbarous mistreatment of its Jewish citizens, because the families, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, of the Polish Jews are free American citizens and will not permit the Warsaw government to help organize Anti-Jewish boycotts and pogroms with the <pb facs="5423972_2_0514.jpg" n="6"/>financial aid of America. This should be the first political step of the organized Jewry in America to help our brethren in Poland in their deplorable condition and to strengthen their courageous hands for further independent struggles against active official anti-Semitism. Such a political step will yield favorable results for the defenseless Jew in Poland, because it will show Paderewski's press that its fear for the reverberation of the Warsaw Jewish protests has not been in vain.</p>
