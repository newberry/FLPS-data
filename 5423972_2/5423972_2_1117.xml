   <p>Destitute Jews are lying about the streets suffering from hunger and cold. Jewish families are not cared for and are sinking into an abyss of suffering and misery, and there is not one Jewish organization that sympathizes with them, that comes to their rescue.</p>
   <p>Years ago when Jews were not divided into Orthodox and Reformed, a wealthy Jew who had a heart of stone and a closed hand could not, for any amount, receive recognition from his people because at that time no learned rabbi dared declare publicly that the rich and the poor Jews belonged to two separate nations, that the wealthy Jews have through the power of their money been dissolved in the "melting-pot" of the Golden calf into Mosaic Gentiles, and have no longer any relationship with the poor Jews and their paupers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1118.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At that time the maxim, "whosoever saves one life stands as high as if he would have saved the whole world," was still being practiced. And in those times there were many Jews who did not even own a small fraction of what present day wealthy Jews own. And yet their greatest delight was to be the cashier of their creator, passing out wages to the needy of their race.</p>
   <p>Those Jews have disappeared. The synagogues are rich and wealthy but the spirit of mercy does not prevail there. The Torah [Law] of truth and justice is garbed in silk and satin, adorned with a golden crown, but it remains locked beyond the public's reach, rendering its philosophy of life obsolete.</p>
   <p>The Jewish masses, who can contribute but little, have given more than they possibly can, but the wealthy Jews who are able to contribute large sums, if they should only want to, have, with the exception of a few outstanding ones, not as yet responded, - not as Jews and not as men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1119.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The poor Jews can expect nothing from the wealthy Reform Jews. Along with Zion, they have stricken out the most beautiful and best characteristics with which the children of Abraham have become distinguished throughout the centuries. Their loftiest ideal is to assimilate with their non-Jewish colleagues. The language of their people is to them a despicable jargon and their hearts remain untouched when their hungry brethren appeal for succor. Even the parvenues, who are merely candidates for Reform Jews, ignore the Jewish life. They spend their lives in comfortable homes, in luxury, and their spoiled children often spend more in one day than it takes to feed and heat all the poor Jewish families of Chicago for an entire month.</p>
   <p>Those Jewish families that suffer from hunger and cold look about themselves despondently, asking where shall our help come from? And the cold winds carve the answer of their well-fed brethren in their hearts: There is no relief for you.</p>
