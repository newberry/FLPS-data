   <p>The standkeepers of the Maxwell St. Market, who built stands during the past two years, can expect to see them torn down during the next 48 hours if the Commissioner of Public Works will carry through his plan. The Commissioner has formulated an order which directs the Fire Department to tear down 168 stands, which the peddlers have built on Maxwell St.</p>
   <p>Alderman Henry Pick (or Peck) who is fighting the standkeepers, declared that according to the law, each stand must be removed from the market after the closing hour. In the last year, according to Alderman Pick, a system of payment to the overseers of the market, allowed the peddlers to overstep the limits of the law, and booths and stands were built on the street, which could not be removed at the closing of the market, but remain as a barrier for the passage of the street.</p>
