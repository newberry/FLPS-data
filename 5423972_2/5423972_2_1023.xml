   <p>In East St. Louis, Illinois, a war between the white and black citizens broke out. Some have fallen in battle; others were wounded. The state government found it necessary to send soldiers to check the riot. Destruction of life is the order of the day. The whites are setting ablaze the homes of the negroes.</p>
   <p>This is a result of the wholesale Negro migration from the Southern states to the Northern. They are attracted by the high wages now paid to labor. A large number have settled in East St. Louis, and the white residents show resentment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1024.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is one of the fresh evils resulting from the war. There is a large demand for workers, and the war has completely brought to an end immigration. Manufacturers therefore permit Negroes to go North, where they come in thousands to industrial centers.</p>
   <p>The riot in East St. Louis is the first insinuation of the white populace's discontentment with such a condition.</p>
   <p>This is a sordid insurrection. Such a riot can likely become as effective as an edpdemic. The East St. Louis event is such as to create anxiety among the authorities of that state as well as other northern states.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1025.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This is how the present American generation is paying for the sins committed by their grand-fathers and great grand-fathers.</p>
   <p>By purchasing slaves that were stolen from Africa, they have violated the law of "stealing and selling human beings for slavery," [Talmud], and now the grand-children must suffer the consequence.</p>
   <p>Evidently, the passage, "the children will bear the sins of their parents for three or four generations," is of deeper significance than what was apprehended by the rabbi's interpretation of it.</p>
