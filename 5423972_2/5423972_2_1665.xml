   <p>A Courier reporter has learned from a reliable source that a significant number of the local waist and skirt manufacturers, who are all Jews, have, at a secret meeting in the La Salle Hotel, closed a conspiratorial anti-Semitic agreement among themselves, providing that the Jewish girls who last week ended their ten-week strike for better working conditions, are not to be reinstated.</p>
   <p>Coupled with this anti-Semitic bund, many Jewish waist-makers complained that they were rejected when seeking employment in the various shops with the remarks: "We want no Jews"; "We wouldn't take back the Sheeney trouble makers." Other similar remarks were passed indicating that they would not be reinstated because they are Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1666.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The reporter visited a few of the prominent manufacturers, who denied that they were involved in the anti-Semitic bund, declaring that they were not present at the meeting in the La Salle Hotel and did not know anything about the agreement. At the same time, however, they admitted that, under any circumstance the "trouble-makers" will not go back to work and they also stated that the strike killed the entire season to such an extent that there is no work anyhow. The Courier reporter was shown several applications upon which were such remarks as "N. C.", "Strike Leader," etc.</p>
   <p>The strikers, however, stick to their convictions about the "black listing system" which was carried on by the manufacturers. The strikers declare that a few Jewish firms are even beginning to engage Negro help, so that the Jewish girls may not have the opportunity of getting back their jobs.</p>
