   <p>Rabbi Edward Browne lectured last evening at Central Music Hall on the "Talmud - Its Ethics and Its Literary Beauties." The speaker was introduced by Bishop Fallows. Among other things Dr. Browne said: "What the Congressional Record is to the loyal American citizen, the 'Talmud' is to the Jew - an embodiment of the laws and history of his race. And yet the books of the 'Talmud' so dear to every Hebrew heart, have gone through a most trying ordeal. At times they have been banished and burned, plundered and torn, and yet their glory lives.</p>
   <p>"The four cardinal points, which I wish to dwell upon in connection with the ethics of the 'Talmud' are: Reverence for the father and mother; charity and benevolence, peace and the obligation to keep it, the acquisition of knowledge and its general distribution. I shall attempt to show that the Hebrew nation has excelled all others in its strict observance of these ethical laws.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks through their historians, Herodotus and Plutarch, point to the example of those two brothers who upon finding the oxen sick, which were to draw their mother to the festival in honor of Juno, five miles distant, harnessed themselves to the chariot and thus conveyed her to her destination as the most illustrious <pb facs="5423972_2_1380.jpg" n="2"/>one of filial reverence in the entire history of the nation. Solon alludes to them as the ones extremely happy in an interview which he had with Croesus. And yet the 'Talmud' points to an example far more striking in its simplicity and its strength.</p>
   <p>"A poor emanciated student, too weak to bear the weight of an other one on his shoulders, saw his aged mother traversing the ground in the rear of her residence without sandals on her feet. Fearing that she might take cold by the exposure, he knelt down and compelled her to step on his hands, moving them so as to adjust them to her steps. His filial love invented the means of protection to the aged woman, whose weight he was unable to carry in his arms. And yet from the estimate placed upon these two acts by the respective nations, we find that the poor student did not fulfill a thousandth part of his duty, judged from the standpoint of a Jew while the Greeks did little less than deify their two athletes, whose action lays them open to the charge of self-glorification."</p>
   <p>Dr. Browne went on to show in the same general manner how the Hebrew nation has always been preeminent in its observance of the four ethical laws laid down in the opening of this discourse.</p>
