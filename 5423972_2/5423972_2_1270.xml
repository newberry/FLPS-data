   <p>For the first time in the history of the Sinai Temple, Dr. Hirsch spoke to a large audience consisting of young men only. In spite of the fact that the meeting was advertised in all parts of the city, most of the audience were Jewish young men from the West Side. Dr. Hirsch noticed that, and said:</p>
   <p>"I am firmly convinced that the majority of you are thinkers and highly cultured people. You have been reared and schooled according to the demands of our modern times. You live in poverty and in slum districts, yet I found among you, young men who really surprised me with their knowledge of world history, and of all branches of science. We have, unfortunately, few intellectual young men on the South Side. I am, therefore, gratified to you for coming here."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1271.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch spoke at length on the fundamental principles of the Jewish religion. He mentioned our martyrs who have sacrificed their lives in bygone centuries for the Jewish belief, and spoke further:</p>
   <p>"We live now in a country where the conditions are different from those in Western Europe. There, unfortunate people are being persecuted and tortured. We have to chage our conceptions of life, acquired through two thousand years of exiled life, to conform more to modern times. Our Bible is permeated with sublime poetry which can inspire us to do noble deeds. It tells us of our great prophets who lifted their noble voices either to praise or admonish their people. They occasionally reminded the people of their duty when justice and righteousness were involved, regarding the conduct and behavior of men to men. Here is where the beauty of our belief lodges. We Jews never knew of charity. With us it <pb facs="5423972_2_1272.jpg" n="3"/>was a solemn debt, to be paid to society. It was considered a mere act that justice demanded. Charity belongs to other peoples from whom we acquired it."</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch then concluded his speech by saying:- "Young men! The Jew has always been proud of the purity and cleanliness of his family life. Unfortunately, we have observed lately that this sacred jewel, the pride of the Jewish people, - the purity of our family life, - is being polluted. On your shoulders, young men, lie the duty and responsibility to restore again the standards of the moral principles of the Jewish people to the same lofty heights of other years. Lend all of your efforts so that we can be proud again of the cleanliness and beauty of our family life."</p>
   <p>The assembled audience rose after the speech of Dr. Hirsch and enthusiastically applauded him.</p>
