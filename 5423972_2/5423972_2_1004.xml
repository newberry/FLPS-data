   <p>Why the Courier is working so vigorously for John Toman is readily understood; its social workers and Zionists are still all Democratic politicians, and one hand washes the other.</p>
   <p>Interesting, however, is the arrogance of the Courier by mixing together a Jewish synagogue, in which is found a number of honest Jews, with dirty politicians.</p>
   <p>A certain politician, Mr. Rosenberg, is president of a Jewish synagogue. Whoever remembers the fact, that one of the Frank brothers was president of the Kolwarior Synagogue, and, at the same time a white-slave dealer and a favorite of the Courier, knows well, that not all fine Jews are presidents in orthodox synagogues.</p>
   <p>In the Sawyer Avenue Anshe Maariv Synagogue can be found a number of ordinary Jews, - hard workers, and poor men. There can be also found old-fashioned scholars, very pious Jews, who study Talmud each day. All these pious people are far from politics. They are not aware of the fact that their rabbi, the Rev. M. Kardon is a tool of the politicians and dares not to speak a word <pb facs="5423972_2_1005.jpg" n="2"/>against them. On the contrary, he must find some clue in the Bible that will purify these dirty politicians. And who knows but the politicians will probably command him to declare that in accordance with the "eleventh" commandment of the Ten Commandments, all good and pious Jews must cast their votes for the candidates of their synagogue president, the politician.</p>
   <p>However, Passover is near, the holiday of the emancipation of the Jews from Egypt, and it is to be trusted that the honest Jews of the Sawyer Avenue Synagogue will emancipate themselves from the dark Egypt, in which the Courier politicians want to lead them.</p>
   <p>The Jews, who are not politicians, have no interest in electing an alderman who is a faithful servant to the capitalistic companies which rob the people. They certainly do not want to pay higher prices for cheaper gas, ride in over-crowded street-cars, have muddy streets and unclean alleys.</p>
   <p>We know that this false accusation on the synagogue originates from the Courier's politicians, who boast for the Sullivans and Harrisons, that they can secure them the Jewish votes. There are in every Jewish synagogue a certain number of unclean politicians who are ready to sell the interests of all Israel for a pot of lentils. But it is a terrible "frame-up" to <pb facs="5423972_2_1006.jpg" n="3"/>brand an entire Jewish community as the Sawyer Avenue Synagogue to the effect that they are all Democratic boys and will vote the way the Courier tells them to.</p>
