   <p>It is understood that should anyone tell a Jew that he is classified as a Negro he would feel greatly offended - a Negro would feel very much the same, if he were told that he is considered as a Jew.</p>
   <p>But a thorough consideration of the Jew and Negro will lead to the fact that neither should feel offended. In this world, among the masses, the Jew is treated as a Negro and the Negro as a Jew. They are tolerated wherever they are small in numbers, wherever they have no power, wherever they seek no equality; they are praised in places wherever they can not be found; nevertheless, they are persecuted, they are barred from their natural right to seek fortune and contentment in their own fashion wherever they constitute a majority, wherever they can ascend to high levels through their abilities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1235.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This hatred does not spring from ignorance; this is not antagonism that comes from the lack of understanding true equality, brotherhood, and freedom. It is a natural hatred, without any reason, instinctive to man. It is a race hatred implanted in man's soul from which it can not be torn out, and as long as people continue to be people this hatred will exist.</p>
   <p>The lynching of the Negroes in the South is similar to the massacres upon Jews in Russia. The acts of liberal Russians concerning their discrimination between Russian Jews and other European Jews can be compared to the act of the"peoples man" Theodore Roosevelt, who discriminates between the Southern Negro, who must not mix in politics, and the Northern Negro who is welcome in the ranks of political work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1236.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The anxiety of philanthropic Gentiles to aid Jews in settling in Palestine, or elsewhere, as long as they will be segregated from the Gentiles, and the agitation among the white to comparatively care for the colored so that they may not come in contact with the Caucasian race, comes from one and the same source. The general desire is to get rid of an element that nauseates, although this desire is covered with the mask of philanthropy. We do not wish to say that Mr. Labdel, or other governors, of various aristocratic clubs that are against the admission of Jews as members is an Anti-Semite; just as we do not think that the majority of our readers, who will not approve of any Negroes in our clubs as members, are Anti-Negroes; just as we will never think that love for Jews prevails in the clubs where Jews are admitted. Man's inhumanity to man does not originate from meanness, and the less this question is discussed the better it will be for humanity in general. One thing is certain and that is: whenever we become aware that a weaker race is suppressed,all other races should come to its assistance.</p>
