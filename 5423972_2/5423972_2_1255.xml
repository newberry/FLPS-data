   <p>Our West Side Mission School has continued doing its best to fit itself to the peculiar conditions in that section of our city.....In this school we have to contend with the prejudices of the parents more than we are hampered by the unwillingness of the children to come. Yet though we are by no means justified in saying that we have been successful in a very remarkable degree, the school has been wielding an influence for good in the Jewish community across the river. It has been of use in combating the efforts of Christian missionaries who have been very active of late again. They do not work in the open. They resort to all sorts of trickery in order to attach the young to themselves. We must meet them on their own grounds, and fight them with their own weapons. I incline to the belief that we should reorganize the mission school so as to provide instruction on several days during the week. If we would teach Hebrew, we could draw a very large number of boys now attending the pernicious 'Hedarim. Sewing <pb facs="5423972_2_1256.jpg" n="2"/>classes also might be instituted, for it is through sewing classes that the missionairies succeed in capturing their unsophisticated victims. I submit these suggestions to your earnest consideration.</p>
