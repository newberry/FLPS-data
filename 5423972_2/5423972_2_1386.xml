   <p>The Jews of this city, who always care well for any of their race in distress, object to receiving any of the immigrants' fund provided by Baron Hirsch, and object, also, to the sending of expelled Russian Jews to this city. This is right and proper. A good thing is charity, but charity should be broad and cover all phases of a situation.</p>
   <p>The presence in Chicago of any large number of a poor class, alien in thought and language, would be misfortune from every point of view. This is not the place for the unfortunates expelled from Russia. Baron Hirsch's scheme for colonization in South America is much more reasonable. The Russian Jews already in Chicago, some 12,000 in number, form a colony by themselves, and are in many cases a burden upon the well-to-do of their race and religion. The attitude assumed by those prominent in Jewish charitable work here is fully justified.</p>

   <p>Chicago has enough of the unfortunate strangers. In fact, this entire body of immigrants practically comes within the restrictions of our immigrant laws. They are assisted to cross the ocean; but a few are self-sustaining; as a body they are paupers, many are diseased and many are criminals. This is the judgment of the most intelligent American Jews, and the Russian exiles should not be permitted to settle in this country.</p>
