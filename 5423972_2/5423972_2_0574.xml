<title level="a">The Truth About the Courier Circulation</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>At last we have the opportunity to prove to the world the truth of the Courier circulation. One of their own former employees, who has been with them for nine years and the only one who supplies all the news stands and stores where newspapers are sold, took an oath that the Courier has a circulation of a little over 7,400, in the Jewish districts of the West Side and the Douglas Park district, North West Side. The South Side is not included, but every one knows, that the South Side has a very small percentage of Jews who read Jewish papers, therefore, the circulation on the South Side cannot be very great.</p>
   <p>Read the following Affidavit:</p>
   <p>State of Illinois)</p>
   <p>County of Cook)S.S.</p>
   <p>Charles Roeske, being first duly sworn on oath, deposes and says that he resides in the city of Chicago, and that he is in the newspaper delivery business. That he was employed by the Jewish Daily Courier of the city of Chicago as the sole distributor and collector of all the papers published by the said newspaper to the Jewish sections on the West Side, North West Side, Lawndale district, <pb facs="5423972_2_0575.jpg" n="2"/>Albany Park, and the North Side of the city of Chicago, and that he handled all of the collections which he made from the people to whom papers were delivered, and turned over all collections to Jewish Daily Courier.</p>
   <p>He further states that during the month of March, 1922, he turned over to the said Jewish Courier all the money collected for papers delivered by him for the week ending March 1st, 1922, the sum of $444.25 and for the week ending March 8th, $442.25 which represented the full amount of net paid circulation of the said publication.</p>
   <p>Affiant further states that the wholesale price charged by them to the news-dealers was $1.00 a hundred copies, and that the net paid circulation handled by him during the week ending March 1st, 1922, was 44,425 copies, or a daily average of 7,407 copies, and that the week ending March 8th,1922, was 44,225; being a daily average of 7,371 copies circulation, said paper being published six days a week.</p>
   <p>Affiant further states that he was employed by the Jewish Daily Courier in the capacity of sole distributor of their paper for the last nine years, having resigned this position in March,1922.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0576.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Affiant further states that he has in possession numerous return paid checks and many other records as further proof that the Jewish Daily Courier had never, at any time during his employ, even had half of the circulation claimed by the said paper.</p>
   <p>Further Affiant sayeth not.</p>
   <p>Chas. Raeski.</p>
   <p>Subscribed and sworn to before me a Notary, this 3th day of May, A.D.1922.</p>
