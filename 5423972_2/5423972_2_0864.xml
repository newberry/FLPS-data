<title level="a">INCITEMENT OF POLISH PRESS FLARES UP RACE HATRED IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The incitements of the Polish press in Chicago become more shameful with every passing day, and the result of it becomes strongly noticeable in the relations between the local Polish population and the Jews. Jewish peddlers were attacked in the Polish sections of the city. Some Polish homes even threw the Jewish peddlers down the stairs. This anti-Semitic poison, which is being spread daily by the Polish press, has also penetrated shops employing both Polish and Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>One of the victims of these incitements is Mr. L. Magid, 1391 N. Oakley Blvd. He works in a machine shop, 1800 N. Francisco Ave., <pb facs="5423972_2_0865.jpg" n="2"/>where several Poles also work. Yesterday, at dinner time, when the Jewish workman was alone with the Poles, one of them, a youth, teased him, shouting that all "sheenies" should be killed. Naturally, it vexed Mr. Magid and he made a reply. The youth fell upon his victim and beat him murderously, being encouraged by his fellow-men, who did not permit the Jew to defend himself.</p>
   <p>Mr. Magid will get a warrant for the Pole today.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Narodowi, the organ of John P. Smulski, and the Dziennik Chicagoski seek, it appears, to outdo each other in spreading anti-Semitism among their readers. Yesterday's Polish newspapers printed inciting cartoons to illustrate how the Jews seek to "annihilate" an unfortunate Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0866.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Narodowi had a cartoon showing a figure that represented Poland nailed to a cross. Near by this figure stood two figures representing Jews in long coats and skull caps. The caption beneath this cartoon reads as follows: "Just as they crucified Christ, so the Jews wish to crucify Poland."</p>
   <p>In Chicagoski we again see the picture of a Jew in a prayer shawl and skull cap negotiating with a Bolshevik, a German, and a Ukrainian, just as Judas sold Christ for thirty silver Shekels.</p>
   <p>The anti-Semitic tone of the Polish press is reflected also in their advertisements. Thus we read in Narodowi a large announcement regarding the following:</p>
   <p>"Learn commerce"; it is the best answer to the Jew on their agitations and attacks."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0867.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The announcement of the Polska Corporation Chamber, 1112 Milwaukee Ave., appeals to the Poles to patronize their company, that it may compete with the Jewish ones.</p>
   <p>But this, nevertheless, does not prevent the Polish newspapers from accepting announcements from Jewish firms, of which we find quite a number in their advertising columns.</p>
