   <p>To the editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>Permit me to invoke your friendship again, so that I may defend myself against Mr. Leo Zolotkoff's accusation.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Zolotkoff wishes to convince himself about my assertion, that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, expresses the sentiments of many Jews, in regard to the undesirable immigration of Russian-Polish Jews, then I suggest that he take the trouble and see a hundred Jews of German, English, Bohemian, Dutch, or Polish nationality and ask them what they think about this (immigration) problem. Of these hundred, at least ninety-five will corroborate my claim.</p>
   <p>No prejudice forms the motive for such a statement, especially as Mr. Zolotkoff <pb facs="5423972_2_1435.jpg" n="2"/>well knows that the Russian-Polish Jews differ greatly from the Jews of other nationalities. They are not only inferior from a mental and physical aspect but their persistent retention of habits and customs, which are not a part of the Jewish religion, may be all right in Russia but here it has a tendency to place them in a light which is anything but commendable; it affects the status of their race as well as their religion. Their qualities have not mainfested themselves, regardless of the "en masse" immigration of Russian-Polish Jews.</p>
   <p>In regard to Mr. Zolotkoff's doubts about my nationality, I wish to assure him, although it may not be necessary, since I have the pleasure of knowing him personally. I pray, when I do to the same Jehovah whom he beseeches, and that I also belong to the Jewish race is therefore self-evident.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Adolph Schlesinger.</p>
