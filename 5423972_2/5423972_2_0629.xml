   <p>Dr. Oscar Levy, the famous English Nietzche-translator and a scholar of international reputation, has been expelled from England after nearly twenty-five years residence in London. Dr. Levy is a German Jew, and has settled in England a quarter of a century mainly because he could not live in the anti-Semitic atmosphere of Germany. He lived in England all these years quietly and happily, and was very popular with English intellectuals and scholars. He has rendered great service to English literature by translating Nietzche's works into English, and he has also written many essays and treatises of a scholarly nature, and has become, so to speak, the literary ambassador of Germany. In England, Dr. Levy is a typical representative of the cultural mediator. Dr. Oscar Levy is not a man of politics, and has never meddled in politics. He was only engaged in scholarly and literary work, and <pb facs="5423972_2_0630.jpg" n="2"/>has done nothing to warrant his expulsion from England. Instead of that he is guilty of the crime of being a German Jew.</p>
   <p>A punishment similar to that of Levy has been meted out to the greatest Jewish man of letters living, Dr. Max Nordau. Dr. Max Nordau is a citizen of Germany, but has spent forty years of his life in France. He has not changed his citizenship because he does not believe in such changes. He is primarily a German writer, and believes that a German writer, if a German citizen, should retain his German citizenship. The great Heinrich Heine was very much criticized by the Germans, because while in distress he accepted a subsidy from the French government, and Max Nordau deemed it more compatible with his dignity as a German writer of international reputation not to lend color to the belief that he is forsaking the country of which he is a citizen and that he is favoring the French. Dr. Nordau was by no means an admirer of Kaiserism and the German imperialists. He was known in Germany as a leader <pb facs="5423972_2_0631.jpg" n="3"/>of the liberal intellectuals, and had never anything in common with those men of letters in Germany who are constantly busily engaged in patrioteering. The French knew perfectly well that Max Nordau was not a Kaiserist, but when the war broke out, he was expelled from France, and was in addition made a pauper. The French government has confiscated all his property.</p>
   <p>After the war came to an end, Max Nordau petitioned the French government to permit him to return to France, because having spent forty years of his life in France he could not possibly return to Germany. To all practical intents and purposes, he is a Frenchman. His habits of life are French, and a man of seventy-five does not change his habits any more. The French government complied with his request, and gave him permission to return to France, but the French press and public have given him a very cold reception. To the present day he is the target of the French anti-Semites and reactionaries, but he is at the same time also a target of the German anti-Semites and reactionaries. The French say that he is a German native, and the Germans accuse him of disloyalty to their country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0632.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Max Nordau in Paris, like Oscar Levy in London, has rendered great service to the French literature. He is considered by French scholars and men of letters the shining star on the firmament of French literature. He is a member of the most important French academic institutions, and an officer of the French Academy. In addition he is one of the best known neurologists in France and is considered by men like Clemenceau and Briand. Every people should be proud of having a man like Max Nordau in its midst, for he is one of the pillars of world literature. But still if not for the intervention of influential Zionist leaders, he would not even be permitted to return to France. Having been permitted to return to France, he is constantly the subject of attacks and to insults by anti-Semitic ruffians.</p>
   <p>Oscar Levy and Max Nordau are not the only great Jewish writers who are homeless and have to live like the wandering Jews because the Jewish people is homeless. There are any number of them in Austria and Hungary, in Germany <pb facs="5423972_2_0633.jpg" n="5"/>and in Poland, in Italy and Czech-Slovakia and even in Roumania. The greatest Roumanian scholar of our days, Dr. Moses Gastor, had to spend most of his life in England, because Roumania would not have him. He was expelled from Roumania, and in England he is to the present day considered a Roumanian. Dr. Feldman, the great Polish Jewish writer, is not accepted by the Polish as one of theirs, because he writes German, and he is not accepted by the Germans because he is a Polish Jew, and in the end he has to lead a life of a wandering Jew. The same holds good of many other brilliant Jewish minds in many European countries. Because the Jewish nation is homeless, many of it great sons are homeless too. The real great Jewish mind, the creative Jewish mind, always feels the tragedy of the Jewish people, and this tragic feeling causes him to be restless, to be a wandering Jew. Circumstances are often such that he cannot stay in the country of his nativity, and he is not accepted by any other country either. He is, therefore, never settled in life. But when the Jews will have their own country, and when they will lead the life of a normal people, the great Jewish minds will no longer be compelled to lead a life of the wandering. They will live with their people, in their people's country and their creations will be Jewish creations.</p>
