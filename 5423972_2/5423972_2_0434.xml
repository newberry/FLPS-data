<title level="a">NEW YORK HEARS ABOUT THE SCANDALS IN OUR MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL</title><title level="a" type="sub">by S. Loebner</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>That the Mount Sinai Hospital of Chicago has only contempt for the poor is well known to us, but an echo of this has just reached New York.</p>
   <p>S. Rosenfeld, former editor of The Friend of St. Petersburg, Russia, and now one of the chief writers of The Day of New York, writes thus: "Something happened in Chicago's Jewish Mount Sinai Hospital which sounds unbelievable. A poor Jewish peddler, suffering from blood poison, rushed to the hospital. Not only did the hospital refuse to take him in, but he was not even given first aid, was not examined. They let him wait so long till it was impossible to help him any more. When he was brought a little later to the County Hospital, it was already too late and the poor Jew died. Had this happened <pb facs="5423972_2_0435.jpg" n="2"/>in Vilno, Cracow, or Berdichev [these are Russian and Polish cities], the manager of the hospital would have been the first person to be held responsible. Very likely he would have been dismissed from his office. Mount Sinai Hospital bears not only a Jewish name but it is a Jewish hospital, being kept by Jewish charity."</p>
   <p>The writer in The Day sees that this charity institution with its high sounding name does not consider it necessary at all to serve the poor. Whoever can pay for his treatment at the hospital is admitted first. The managers of the hospital have not the slightest regard for Jewish public opinion in Chicago. The writer concludes: "Interesting facts are being told about the mismanagement and ill-treatment at the Mount Sinai Hospital. It is not worthwhile to tell them here because these stories might serve as an example for other Jewish leaders in other cities and other hospitals to follow."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0436.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mount Sinai Hospital wrote last night another page in its book of scandals and crimes.</p>
   <p>A pregnant woman, the wife of a Jewish letter carrier [named] Feingold, feeling severe labor pains, was brought at two o'clock in the morning to the hospital. She wanted to be in a Jewish hospital, among Jews, in the hospital where she had registered before. She needed immediate attention and a bed, but she received neither. She waited and waited, a la Berger, till finally someone came up to her and told her the old story: "We have no place". Sad, downhearted, the pregnant woman and her husband returned home. With the greatest difficulty she climbed the stairway up to the third floor where she lived. The effort left her entirely exhausted. She gave birth to a child a little later, without the aid of a physician, suffering from extraordinary and severe labor pains.</p>
   <p>The physician who was supposed to assist her in delivering the baby went to <pb facs="5423972_2_0437.jpg" n="4"/>the hospital. There he was told that she was at home. He rushed to her house but arrived too late.</p>
   <p>They should have made place at the hospital for the pregnant woman and not to send her home when she was in a dangerous condition. Not only they did not make place for her but they did not even show her any pity. As a proof of their cruel attitude, let me tell you another story. A few weeks ago a newly born baby was put on ice while alive and died as a result. (We will tell you the details of this case at another opportunity.)</p>
   <p>The mismanagement of the Mount Sinai Hospital causes us to be ashamed before the Jewish communities of America, retards the recovery of its patients, and sacrifices human lives. The sooner the president, Morris Kurzon, and his clique (the inner council of the fire trap on Rebecca Street (sic) and California Avenue) will withdraw, the better it will be for everybody. We <pb facs="5423972_2_0438.jpg" n="5"/>will never have, as long as they are there, the great, modern Jewish hospital for which there is on hand nearly three quarters of a million dollars raised by the drive led by Mr. Jacob M. Loeb. The Mount Sinai Hospital is in the way. Its "inner council" means trouble to our community. An appeal will have to be made, at the end, to the Jewish Charities, to stop giving a subsidy to that institution, because the subsidy is taken by it under false pretenses. The hospital is full of patients who can afford to pay, while the poor people are shown the door.</p>
