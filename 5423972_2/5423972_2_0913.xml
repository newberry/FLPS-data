   <p>Like a shadow of the past, fleet by the gloriously magnificent ideals that were proclaimed during the War. And, as if from sleep awakened, we rub our eyes, unable to believe that these contrary occurrences are true facts to be reckoned with. Now the sum total of it all, is being passed upon in Paris. Once and for all, we, too, must earnestly take account of our resulting totals and see what we have received for the countless victims whom we sacrificed on the altar of a greater humanity.</p>
   <p>Should we desire to express this total short and precisely, we can, and it is to be regretted that, said in one sentence, we lost much and gained <pb facs="5423972_2_0914.jpg" n="2"/>nothing. At that I refer here not to the Zion problem, which at present is, so to speak, still dangling in the air, but to our hopes, all our hopes of human rights, which are lost at the Peace Conference.</p>
   <p>The fact that equality of the Jew was not included in the Constitution of the League of Nations, is, to us, a worse factor than had this problem been omitted entirely from the Peace Conference. If certain Jewish circles believed they could gain something for the Jews by diplomatic negotiations, it is now perfectly clear that these were false hopes. Why should the Messrs. Paderewski, Bratiani, and others reckon with our back-door politics when the Peace Conference itself found it unnecessary to write even a paragraph on equality for Jews in its Constitution?</p>
   <p>Let us yet again underline this fact: If those who advocate to the world the self-independence of the smaller nations; who knew well the great patriotic role Jews played in every land; who knew how much Jewish blood <pb facs="5423972_2_0915.jpg" n="3"/>was shed directly and indirectly in the last four years of fighting; if those have not found it possible to write a paragraph for the equality of the Jew in the newly formed nations' pact, then what can we await from any other diplomatic circles? Are any comments necessary to the people? Must we explain more definitely yet the meaning of this great injustice against us?</p>
   <p>We take also into consideration the Jews in the newly formed governments, and we see murderous slaughters, such as are occurring now in Polish territory, where Jewish blood flows like water. Now that the Poles have thrown off their yoke, they have become wild animals. As we view this dark scene, the Inquisition seem to have been an Eden compared to these present horrible predicaments of our brothers. We think of the Czecko-Slovakians and their gruesome massacres of Jews, and so we reach our sum total. How does the Russian poet Nekdosov say, "The hare tramples <pb facs="5423972_2_0916.jpg" n="4"/>on us and the wind smites us."</p>
   <p>In deducting the sum total to this point, we must not be satisfied with drawing the line at the present total. We must immediately ask ourselves this question: "And what further?"</p>
   <p>True, on the Jewish streets reigns a great deal of bewilderment. Also true, we expected much from the Peace Conference. But that was only because we were too blinded and too bewitched by beautiful phrases, and permitted ourselves to be put to sleep in the cradle of phantasy. No matter how hard the awakening may be, yet we must not fall into despair. The Jewish people have more than once gone through similar experiences. Our history is a series of such unfortunate occurrences. The Blood Accusation, the Inquisition, the Autos De Fe, Chmelnitzkis, Kazatshina, all and everything, have we weathered with pride. Now, too, we will courageously bear our troubles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0917.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We must not weaken our courage and energies, but must follow the true path to National consciousness, because we are certain that these times must pass and newer and better ones will take their place when human justice triumphs. If our leaders have made an error this time, expecting justice from sources that make promises but give nothing, it does not mean we must, therefore, drop everything. On the contrary, we must raise our voices high and demand, not of a few, but of all the world, that we, too, secure our rights; that we, too, may enjoy life as other peoples and nations on this earth.</p>
   <p>In the sum total of our present figures is the time to lay our foundation for a further battle. If we do not obtain our rights by back-door politics, because they have no desire to grant them to us, we will yet secure our human-right demands from the masses. They, the nations, will grant them to us, because, being less diplomatic, they can understand that the Jew is a part of mankind and as such is entitled to a fair treatment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0918.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The pessimism which, as a result of present conditions, took a firm hold on the greater part of our people, must be uprooted and replaced by a courageous and bolder fight for the human-right demands of the Jew.</p>
