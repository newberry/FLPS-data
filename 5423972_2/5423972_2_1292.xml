   <p>We hope that the New Year will see many changes for the better in Judaism, especially in this country among our orthodox brethren. That they will once for all resolve to have union in their camp and that the whole of their religion will not center in the observance of the three days in the year and the rest kept by proxy. It is time that every congregation should have a leader, a Moreh Derech, who shall be positive in his principles. Not be buttermilk on one day and something else the next day. We have had enough of that kind in the past. The orthodox must stand for their principles and have men to represent them and be their spokesmen wherever and whenever it is necessary to voice their sentiments. We need not be fanatics, for that band of Judaism is as dangerous to the growth of our religion in this country as is the radicalism which has been rampant for these many years and with <pb facs="5423972_2_1293.jpg" n="2"/>Mephistophelian irreverence sardonically jeered at everything that is orthodox and truly Jewish, and those who were assailed remained silent. We hope that a new spirit will pervade our camp and that men will arise to do their duty in defense of the cause of true Jewishness.</p>
