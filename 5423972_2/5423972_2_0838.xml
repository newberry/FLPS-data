   <p>A gang of hoodlums, said to be young Poles, have terrorized the Douglas Park neighborhood for sometime, and last Saturday and Monday evenings, a bloody riots broke out. The Jewish men and women that were in the Park were beaten up, some seriously, until the police arrived and cleared the park.</p>
   <p>Commenting on the racial feelings that has been strong for many weeks in the Douglas Park neighborhood because of Jewish charges of pogroms by Poles in Poland and of the threatened meetings of large number of Feudists, Judge Trude said:</p>
   <p>"To kill any plan of violence that is now being formulated and to prevent serious trouble, my advice is that the reserve militia be called out if there is another occurence of this kind. Bayonets and bullets are often the only answer to mob violence. This is America and we are all anxious to defend our citizens. I am a member of the reserve militia myself, and I am willing to do my part if there is need for it."</p>
