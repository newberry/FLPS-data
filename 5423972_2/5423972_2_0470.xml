   <p>The tragic event at the County Hospital, where a poor Jew died of blood poison because the Mount Sinai Hospital did not admit him as a patient and did not even pay any attention to him, is not an isolated phenomenon. It deserves, however, to be seriously considered.</p>
   <p>The Mount Sinai Hospital is a Jewish hospital and a charity hospital. The United [Jewish] Charities would not support it with sixty or seventy thousand dollars a year if it were not a charity hospital. Every member and every subscriber to the United Jewish Charities is a supporter of the Mount Sinai Hospital, and we, therefore, have to assume that the prime duty of the Mount Sinai Hospital is not to the rich, not to the middle classes, but to the poor. The rich and the middle classes can always find a place at a hospital. It is just the poor Jew who cannot always find a place at a hospital because <pb facs="5423972_2_0471.jpg" n="2"/>he is poor, because he is a Jew, because he is lonely and has nobody to stand up for him. The Mount Sinai Hospital is, therefore, primarily but not exclusively for the poor sick Jews; after the requirements of the poor sick Jews have been satisfied, then the requirements of the rich or middle-class sick Jews can be considered. This is the way it should be. What sense is there to a Jewish charity hospital which does not first of all take care of the poor Jewish sick people?</p>
   <p>It should be this way but it is not. In Mount Sinai Hospital one can find eighty or maybe ninety per cent of the patients to be well-to-do people; people of means, and only ten per cent poor people. That is why there was no place for the poor Berger when a tragedy befell him.</p>
   <p>The people who think that by supporting the Mount Sinai Hospital they support a charity institution because poor, sick Jews are being taken care of there, live in a world of false illusions. They actually support a hospital which caters to the well-to-do classes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0472.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Mount Sinai Hospital has three kinds of patients--those who pay from five to six dollars a day, those who pay three dollars a day, and those who do not pay anything. The first class of patients pays the full cost of their hospital care, those who pay only three dollars a day pay sixty per cent of the cost of their hospital care, and only the small number of patients who do not pay anything at all constitute real charity cases. The patients of the second class consist of people of means. When a patient can pay three or three and a half dollars a day, he can also pay five dollars a day and not be a charity patient. The patient, by paying three dollars a day, thinks that he has paid in full for his care. He has no idea that he is accepting charity. This class of patients, constituting one half or maybe a majority of all patients, absorbs the support which the hospital receives from the Jewish community. In other words, the community keeps up the hospital for a class of people which does not want any charity, which does not need any charity, and which has no idea that it is accepting charity. Because this class of people fills up the hospital, there is no place there for a poor man, even if he hovers between life and death.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0473.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Do we live in Chicago or in Sodom? The Mount Sinai Hospital, which accepts money from the [United] Jewish Charities for patients who must not and should not accept any charity because they themselves can pay the full cost of their care, is not a charity hospital but a big community scandal. All those who take part in its management are responsible for this scandal.</p>
   <p>The case of the poor Rumanian Jew who died of blood poison because the Mount Sinai Hospital ignored him, is a very ordinary case of murder. The Mount Sinai Hospital is directly responsible for his death. But how many similar tragic occurrences happen every year at the Mount Sinai Hospital? The tragic case of Berger became known because a member of the editorial staff of the Courier took the victim to the Mount Sinai Hospital and personally witnessed the entire tragedy. How many such tragedies remain unknown? How many poor, sick Jews in Chicago die prematurely because the Mount Sinai Hospital has no room for them, because it has filled most of its available space with patients who can pay and who do not want any charity?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0474.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The United [Jewish] Charities must not ignore this tragic affair. It must conduct an investigation into the Mount Sinai Hospital to determine to what an extent it is a charity organization. If it is not a charity institution, it does not deserve to receive money from the [United Jewish] Charities. If it is a charity institution, how could a case like Berger's happen? What kind of a Sodom is this?</p>
