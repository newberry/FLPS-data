   <p>The holiday Succoth has a deep significance. On this day, when we sit in a home made hut of logs and twigs with green grass covering the roof, we are besieged by the memory of our one time agricultural holiday of harvest gathering; the storing of grain in the granaries. Then we were in our own land, worked our own fields, had the joy of our own harvest. Yes, when everything was cut we celebrated the harvest gathering.</p>
   <p>Thousand of years have since past. We have weathered the worst suffering and persecutions. Many nations have since then passed into oblivion to remain only a memory. But we have overcome all obstacles.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0292.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We fought our enemies, sacrificed our lives for our religion, and Torah, and our enemy could not annihilate us. Instead they created martyrs, robbed us of human rights, locked us within crowded Ghettoes, persecuted us, oppressed and tormented us, but they could not wipe us off the face of the world, nor shall they err be able to accomplish this.</p>
   <p>The old tribe of Isreal lives and takes great pride and joy from its God and its holidays. In it lives a strong hope to again have a Jewish land and again be a nation among nations. Yes, Isreal lives and its hope lives, this is a source of strength that enables it to overcome all its torments and sufferings and colors our memories of the past.</p>
   <p>Therefore, enjoy your holiday; it is the time for our happiness.</p>
