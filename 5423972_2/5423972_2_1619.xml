<title level="a">JEWISH BAKERY OWNERS DECIDE TO CUT WAGES</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Jewish Bakery Owners Association, at a meeting held yesterday afternoon, decided not to conclude a new agreement with the Union under the old terms. It was further decided to reduce the present wages. The present agreement expires this Saturday, May 27.</p>
   <p>The Bakery Workers Union proposed to the bakery owners a renewal of the present agreement with a slight change in the hours of night work, which, according to the proposed new agreement would begin at six o'clock in the evening instead of eleven o'clock at night as heretofore. The bakery workers receive thirty cents an hour extra for night work.</p>
   <p>The Jewish bakery owners not only refused this demand of the Union but decided at yesterday's meeting to reduce the wages to the scale received by the Polish and Bohemian workers.</p>
   <p>The Bakery Workers Union will hold a special meeting on Friday, one o'clock in <pb facs="5423972_2_1620.jpg" n="2"/>the afternoon, at their headquarters, 3420 West Roosevelt Road. This important question will be taken up and a decision will be reached regarding the attitude to be adopted on this question. The officials of the Bakery Workers Union, in their call to the meeting, notified the members of the Union that those who do not come to the meeting will be fined.</p>
   <p>The officials of the Bakery Owners Association declared that they are fully resolved to introduce a reduction in wages, which action may possibly precipitate a strike.</p>
