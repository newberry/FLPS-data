   <p>We take issue with Reverend Doctor Hirsch when he states that the incoming refugees from Russia are filthy and that they cannot be colonized......The Reverend Hirsch evinces but a small amount of humanity when he pronounces such wholesale accusations against his people, who, desported of everything in their homes,with scarce enough raiments that they might come in a delapidated condition to us.</p>
   <p>The Occident has for a number of years advocated that our people devote themselves to the tilling of the soil. The charge has been often hurled against us that we are simply barterers, traders and traffickers. We are more than convinced that colonies can be established and successfully thrive and with it we can convince the world that Jews can become as independent and industrous farmers as any other nationality.</p>
   <p>The opportunity is now iminent and a beginning should be made with our expatriated Russian brethren.</p>
