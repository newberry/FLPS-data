<title level="a">CONGRESSMAN SABATH IN TROUBLE</title>.
</bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Our Chicago congressman is in a heap of trouble, and his own "organ" does not dare to defend him.</p>
   <p>His trouble is that he has a good heart and likes to be friendly with everybody. A few years ago, when Congress voted upon breaking the treaty with Nicholas because he did not recognize the American passport in Jewish hands, Congressman Sabath did not have the heart to offend Nicholas. He did not want to hurt the Jews by voting against the bill, so he departed from Washington.</p>
   <p>In course of time, he greatly specialized in his non-voting tactics. He became an excellent "log roller, "and absentee at important decisive matters.</p>
   <p>His speciality of silence is so conspicuous that if he does say anything, he gets into trouble.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1019.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He conceived the idea of paying respect to the small nationalities, as the Bohemians, Poles, Serbians, Czckoslovakians, Roumanians, and so forth. However, he forgot that there is a race in the world called the Jews. When his attention was called to it, he answered that they were already considered among the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Why does he speak to us at the time of a campaign, as a Jew, to Jews. A certain element of Chicago rabbis, social workers, and prominent Zionists always appeal for his re-election in the name of his "devotion" to the Jewish nation.</p>
   <p>In peaceful times, that would perhaps pass off well and his Chicago friends would cleanse him with many alibis. They would turn black into white and the result would be that the Jewish race would crown him for his great Jewish patriotism.</p>
