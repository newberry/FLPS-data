<title level="a">THE JEWISH TRAGEDY IN CENTRAL EUROPE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It is hard to say which of the two evils are the better, to be run over or to be trampled upon. Jews in Russia and Poland are run over by Slavic machines, but Jews in Central Europe, Germany, Austria, and Hungary are trampled upon with the swiftness of the riding horse. In the three above mentioned Central European countries there live about a million and a half Jews, who for more than one hundred years have dreamed the false dream of assimilation through complete emancipation. Yes, for over one hundred years, Jews in those lands pursued the policy of the ostrich, seeking to hide their heads in the sand, thinking that thus they will not be recognized as Jews. But in five years of war, all the visions of a hundred years were annihilated.</p>
   <p>Today, German and Hungarian Jews are doubly lonely; as a group in a land that is conquered, and as a Jewish group that has lost contact <pb facs="5423972_2_0895.jpg" n="2"/>with other Jewish groups and know not where to go now. As part of a conquered nation, Jews in Central Europe are literally ruined. They were among the largest agents of commerce and industry in their lands. In Germany some controlled large industries and regulated others not controlled by them. For the last fifty years, they were so prosperous that, as a group they were comparatively the richest in the world. For example, thirty thousand Jews in Frankfort-On-The-Main contributed one third of the taxes of the entire city of Frankfort, with a population of four hundred thousand persons. Cities as Charlottenburg, Magdeburg, Minchen and Berlin, Carlsruhe and Dresden, possessed more Jewish millionaires than the rest of Germany. In Frankfort-On-The-Main, before the war, there were counted more than one hundred Jewish millionaires possessing up to two hundred million marks.</p>
   <p>In a small town near Frankfort, Openberg On-The-Main, with a Jewish population of three thousand persons, there were thirty Jewish <pb facs="5423972_2_0896.jpg" n="3"/>millionaires. A German Jew not possessing at least a hundred thousand marks was considered poor.</p>
   <p>Even those German Jews who had no riches, lived comfortably, for all earned well and lived well.</p>
   <p>The same may be said of the Jews in Austria, West Austria, and Tyrol. In Hungary, Jews were not so rich or prosperous as in Germany or Austria, but economically they were better off than those Jews of Eastern European countries.</p>
   <p>This prosperity of richness of Jews in Central European countries has been destroyed, together with dreams of assimilation and total emancipation. Today, German Jews are a poor group. Their riches, invested in German War Loans, will yield nothing because Germany is bankrupt. They have no credit because Germany has no credit and is practically cut off from world commerce. German Jews, therefore, <pb facs="5423972_2_0897.jpg" n="4"/>have a very uncertain economic future. We must not forget that it was the German Jew who helped increase German trade in all parts of the globe. But with the destruction of this trade and the ruin of German industry their future becomes a very tragic one. The Germans proper can return to agriculture, but German Jews, who have not devoted themselves to agriculture, but were ever the commercial element, cannot suddenly become peasants or village dwellers.</p>
   <p>Just as their total economic structure has collapsed, so too has their political edifice been destroyed. German Jews could have dreamed of assimilation as long as Germany was the mightiest and strongest nation in the world. But with whom can German Jews assimilate now? With a country in financial and economic bankruptcy, a country outlawed by the entire world? If at one time it was a pride to be a German, today such is not the case; at least not in the eyes of the world. And assimilated Jews always adhered to the policy of the people of the land.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0898.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>German Jews today cannot have any desire to assimilate or to carry forward the old time assimilation policy. If they do not assimilate, what then? There is but one way, back to their own folks. This, naturally, is easier said than done. When a group has for many generations been separated from its nation, it cannot return and immediately take up a natural existence, because it has lost contact with the nation.</p>
   <p>Tourists recently returned from Germany report similarly, that the Zionist movement among German Jews has never been as strong as at the present time. Old half assimilated Jewish families in Germany joined the Zionists quite as a practical matter. They will, at the first opportune moment, pack their belongings and move to Palestine.</p>
   <p>This indicates that the German Jews have a clearly defined future. Having none in Germany, neither economic or political, they turn to <pb facs="5423972_2_0899.jpg" n="6"/>the land where they will be happy, Palestine.</p>
   <p>The War has run-over the Jews in Central Europe, but the Jewish people, as a nation, will perhaps, through this, lose nothing.</p>
