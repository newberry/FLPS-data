<title level="a">TWO THOUSAND JEWISH REFUGEES WANDER IN THE VICINITY OF VLADIVOSTOK</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The sad condition of hundreds of Jewish refugees who wander in the regions of Vladivostok is portrayed in the letter that President John L. Bernstein of the Achnosas-Orchim And Immigration Aid Society received from Mr. Samuel Mason, managing director of that institution. This letter was sent from Vladivostok in the month of March. It tells of the beneficial work accomplished there by the Achnosas-Orchim And Immigration Aid Society.</p>
   <p>Among other things Mr. Mason writes the following:</p>
   <p>"Two thousand Jewish refugees find themselves within a hundred mile radius of Vladivostok. (A list of the two thousand will shortly be printed in the <pb facs="5423972_2_0901.jpg" n="2"/>newspapers.) They are not those who desire to emigrate to America. Many seek the opportunity to return to their old homes. Most of them are homeless, and sleep in railroad stations, in freight cars, or under the blue sky.</p>
   <p>"Less than one hundred Jewish refugees are in the barracks of the American Red Cross. They receive one meal a day according to the quota of the local Jewish community. These barracks are nine miles from the city. It is seldom that anyone goes there because the distance is too far and too risky for traveling in the unsanitary, overcrowded cars. It is too cold to travel in a cart. A motorcar charges twenty rubles for the journey.</p>
   <p>"I discovered that those in the barracks suffered from cold and insufficient nourishment. An epidemic of typhoid prevailed there. Among these barracks are also Jewish Refugees. Much illness has spread among the Jews. In at least four cases the patients lay four days without care until an ambulance <pb facs="5423972_2_0902.jpg" n="3"/>of the Red Cross arrived.</p>
   <p>"The American Red Cross furnished coal, wood, and kerosene for all the barracks including those used by the Jews. Their hospital serves all the sick without discrimination of creed or race. But the coal, wood, and kerosene furnished are not enough to keep the Jewish barracks warm. I immediately arranged with the Red Cross Department For Refugees to increase the ration of these items and send us a bill for them. Only through the Red Cross can these things be secured for they have the means of transportation and can deliver these articles to their destinations.</p>
   <p>"I have also found it necessary to make arrangements with the medical department of the Red Cross for treating Jewish patients as paid customers.</p>
   <p>"I have also taken steps to improve the exterior conditions of the Jewish barracks. I bought wood and other materials, and hired workmen to build <pb facs="5423972_2_0903.jpg" n="4"/>additional rooms for the following purposes:</p>
   <p>"Sleeping quarters for women and children; sleeping quarters for men; a dining room, a long room for keeping food and such things; a baggage room, a kitchen; wash and toilet room, and such other necessities.</p>
   <p>"The rooms were painted on the inside and kerosene lamps were secured for lighting. Outside, a barn was built for wood and coal. Arrangements were made to get drinking water from a city well.</p>
   <p>"The Red Cross is in the process of constructing a building for a bathhouse and disinfecting station. I contributed five thousand rubles of our funds for this purpose.</p>
   <p>"I also made arrangements for the Jewish refugees, after the Purim holiday, <pb facs="5423972_2_0904.jpg" n="5"/>to receive three meals a day according to the quota of the local Jewish community."</p>
   <p>Mr. Mason tells also that forty three trunks of old clothes sent from Chicago arrived in Vladivostok a few weeks prior to his own arrival there, but because of neglect and certain difficulties, the trunks remained unopened and the clothes undistributed while Jewish refugees shivered of cold and went around half-naked. After much trouble, Mr. Mason managed to have the clothes distributed. Some of the trunks were sent to Yirkutsk and to Omsk for refugees there.</p>
   <p>Eighty-six refugees were aided in leaving the city. A Rumanian bride and groom were married under the supervision of the committee and a collection that Mr. Mason made for them brought a sum of over three thousand rubles. The couple were among those refugees who were overlooked by the local <pb facs="5423972_2_0905.jpg" n="6"/>community. Both were clothed in rags and had no shoes on their feet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mason further writes of the impossibility to rent houses in Vladivostok. For one house that was vacant the sum of forty thousand rubles a year was asked. Besides, it would be necessary to spend twenty thousand rubles a year for repairs. Mr. Mason negotiated to rent for the Red Cross an entire floor for twenty-five thousand rubles a year, which is to house unattached women and girls. But he is not certain that he will obtain this flat because someone still lives there. The local government does not permit evictions, the tenant moves of his own accord. It is uncertain if they will do so or not. When they do, the owner of the house will contribute the rent as a donation for the refugees.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mason writes further: "Among the war captives in Vladivostok, Nikols, and Novonikolaievsk we find close to eleven hundred Jewish officers. Their <pb facs="5423972_2_0906.jpg" n="7"/>conditions in Nikolsk are especially bad. Five share one suit of clothes."</p>
