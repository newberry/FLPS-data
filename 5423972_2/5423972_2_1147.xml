   <p>"Whereas, Mandel Bailis, a Jewish workman, is at present being tried in Kiev, Russia, accused of having, in March of 1911, murdered a Christian boy, Andre Euchinsky, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The charge against the aforesaid Bailis, reads that he murdered this boy to use his blood for religious purposes, generally termed ritual blood, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The use of blood is absolutely forbidden in the teachings, spirit and conduct of the Jewish religion as has been proven by non-Jewish theologists, educators, publicists, and historians, and</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1148.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Whereas, Over seven hundred rabbis, the leading men of the Jewish religion throughout the entire world, have recently made a sworn statement and in fiery words denied that there is even the slightest reference that can be found in Jewish teachings and conduct that requires human blood for any purpose whatsoever, religious or otherwise, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The six million Jews residing in Russia are exposed to general shame and harassment due to the wide spread accusation of their practicing such barbaric custom as a blood ritual. More than two million American citizens of the Jewish faith are heartbroken and tortured by the assault made on the morals and conduct of their religion, and</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1149.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Whereas, Even the general conservative press of Russia called this accusation of ritual murder barbaric, horribly heathen and ignorant, and blame the law or court for spitefully overlooking these things and holding its higher officials responsible to set aside all facts that favor the defendant, and the liberal press of Russia fears that the populace will be incited to new pogroms as a result of the ignorant accusations against the defendant, therefore</p>
   <p>"Be It Resolved, That we, the citizens of Chicago gathered at a mass-meeting, hereby express our contempt and voice our protest against using such a barbaric accusation and such medieval insults as may arouse the diligent and law-abiding races to use common curses, and throughout other parts of the world, to terrify persons and confiscate their property, and</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1150.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"We Further Resolve, That a copy of this resolution should be given to the Secretary of State to be forwarded through the proper diplomatic channels to the seat of the Russian Government."</p>
