   <p>In our last weeks issue, we indicated the supposed number of Minyanim that were in vogue in Chicago and the list was quite a formidable one. Since then we have been informed that there were more than thirty of such congregations.....all well attended.</p>
   <p>It seems the Israelites of our suburban environs who are too far away from our city synagogues and temples, in order to hold divine services get up these Minyanim in their own midst and quite a demand was occasioned for Chazanim. (Cantors.)</p>
   <p>A dealer in Esrogin (Citrons) informs us that the demand is greater by half than that of last year. We learn also that the religious services are kept up constantly during the year. It is quite evident that Judaism is not decreasing, but augmenting.</p>
