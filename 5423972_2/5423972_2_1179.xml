   <p>"Be patriotic" is forever the cry of our teachers and leaders in every part of the world. "Be Russian patriots", was the call of the Haskalah period of Yahuda Leb Gordin and his followers; "be Polish patriots" is even today the cry of the great Polish-Jewish leaders in Warsaw; "be German, English, Austrian, Hungarian, and Romanian patriots", comes the call from those lands.</p>
   <p>Here the cry to become an American patriot has become so great that on one occasion when there was a discussion for the selection of a superintendent for an orphanage, the candidate being a young Russian who lived for several years in England, a director protested vehemently in a heated speech against entrusting poor orphans of this country, who are to be raised as good American citizens, to a man who is a citizen of the English King whom George Washington fought in the Revolutionary War.</p>
   <p>So heated was this director in this matter that he failed to realize that he was speaking to Jews who had spent their youth under King Nicholas and Alexander third. He carried on about the revolution, citizenship, and the flag and even went so far as to say that one who was a citizen of England had no right to rear Jewish children in America.</p>
   <p>We are forever outdoing the holy man in his holiness. Before our very eyes we <pb facs="5423972_2_1180.jpg" n="2"/>constantly see English and Canadian religious and secular teachers being imported to this country and vice versa.</p>
   <p>Even those who clamor loudest on the subject do not really mean it. When England needed a learned Rabbi she choose a man who changed the King's Prayer according to the fitness of the position or rank given him. President Kruger of Transwell, Taft of America, and George V of England were alike to him.</p>
   <p>Patriotism is not merely something you drill into one's head. Patriotism is simply a result; in a larger sense it is a longing. When a person becomes accustomed to his environment he becomes attached even to its memories. A worm is a horseradish patriot - when he knows of nothing better. Jews have always been patriots of the land in which they lived providing that land permitted them to live in peace. It is not necessary to intimidate a Jew to become an American patriot. He becomes accustomed to the land and its customs and he enjoys the liberties extended to all people. To be a Rumanian patriot in Rumania means that one becomes in time of war fodder for the cannon and in peace one is an undesirable stranger. Or to be a Russian patriot in Russia means more pogroms, or Polish patriots in Poland means bouycotts not only against Jews, but against all other so called undesirables. Therefore, the clamor for patriotism is unwarranted. In fact that is wasted patriotism.</p>
