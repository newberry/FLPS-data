   <p>The report that the Jewish butchers will open their stores Saturday evening and sell good kosher meat at 12¢ a pound, was accepted with overwhelming joy in every Jewish home.</p>
   <p>It is understood that not all butchers are satisfied with this agreement. Many Jewish butchers, who have formerly sold meat at 18¢ a pound, fear that their customers will complain that their meat isn't good, and at a meeting of the Butchers Association, they expressed dissatisfaction in this case.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_1668.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Most of the butchers were of the opinion, however, that it should cause no fear. Everyone knows that the schochet (kosher animal slaughterer) did not slaughter any animals all week (due to the strike), that there is no kosher meat in the slaughter houses, and that all meats, that will be brought into the butcher shops, will be strictly fresh. Of course, there will be better and poorer grades of meat, which entirely depends upon the animal.</p>
   <p>No one will be opposed to those butchers taking higher prices, if their customers are satisfied to pay. The essential gain is that those who want to pay only 12¢ per pound for meat can do so.</p>
