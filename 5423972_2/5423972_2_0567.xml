   <p>Sidney Hillman's Speech. - Tailor Corporation for Russia.</p>
   <p>"I believe that the Soviet government is able enough to take care of the conditions in Russia. There are certain things that Russia is not interested in, things which leaders here look at as very important. The Russian government is very little interested in this or in any other ism.</p>
   <p>"The government of Russia has huge wealth sources of which many are in the ground, and it will require plenty of energy and exertion to bring this wealth to the surface. Those treasures are there for some one just to come and take them - today these treasures are Russia's own. Russia has the capital, inherited capital, which has not been touched as yet. She has the people to do the work and she also has the most able government. I believe that all capital that will be invested in Russia is as well protected and guaranteed, as the capital invested in other countries of Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_2_0568.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I discussed the question of investing capital with the representatives of the Russian government, I visited factories, interested myself in tailoring and weaving mills. There are clothing factories that employ over a thousand people each, over a dozen factories are operating in Moscow and Petrograd alone. If our girls would sew the buttons as they are sewn there, in the same time that it takes them there, our price committee would be busy every day. Clothes are being made there that could be worn here in America. Weaving factories are of the latest model there. What they need is capital to develop their industries.</p>
   <p>"After the long conferences we held, the representatives of Soviet Russia have offered us concessions, that is, not to the Amalgamated Clothing workers, but to a corporation, which we are to organize, in which workers of all organizations, and people who believe it their duty to help, will become members. The Russian government will turn over to this corporation, in partnership, nine clothing and weaving factories employing at <pb facs="5423972_2_0569.jpg" n="3"/>present over several thousand workers. The real value of the property, buildings, and stock, is between five and ten million rubels, or about $5,000,000 which will make it possible to start work. Under this concession we will have many privileges. Delegates, I appeal to you, in the name of humanity, in the name of everything that should be dear to every one. I assure you that through your example you will influence others to do likewise. You are sending a message to the world, that we workers are taking upon ourselves the responsibility of rebuilding the world, in order to save civilization for every one alike."</p>
