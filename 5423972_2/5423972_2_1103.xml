   <p>The income tax of Edward Morris, late meat magnate of Chicago, amounts to $236,000, and transactions to reduce this sum are now pending. The income tax of others also amounts to huge sums. The fact alone, that the wealth of big millionaires is now being publicized, is enough for us to understand the importance of imcome tax, because, after all, we can now see that America is a rich country. It possesses vast deposits of wealth, even though this wealth does not belong to the masses.</p>
   <p>We also see that at a time when the city is filled with thousands of unemployed who walk about hopelessly and despondently, thinking that the world is lost to them, there are millionaires whose taxes alone would be a godsend, if given to these unemployed.</p>
   <p>Income tax in itself is a public good, for it has long been proven that <pb facs="5423972_2_1104.jpg" n="2"/>the poor, who have hardly enough to live on, are not able to pay taxes. Taxes should be paid by those who have enormously vast fortunes. They should contribute a share that will provide for the poorer citizens.</p>
   <p>The more income taxes turned in, the more opportunities are opened in this country, which can introduce better federal conditions.</p>
   <p>We all know that in a city like Chicago, which is densely populated, all means should be employed to keep the city cleaned or to build the best and finest city institutions. This naturally requires money, which can only be raised through taxes. This also goes for the whole country.</p>
   <p>Let us, however, pause at one more fact, and that is, that many wealthy citizens hold their pursestrings tight until they are threatened with punishment. It is only then that they pay their taxes. Yes, up to this day large sums are still to be paid to the government, which shows that our biggest millionaires are not willing to perform their duties as citizens <pb facs="5423972_2_1105.jpg" n="3"/>until they are forced to do it. When their money interests are concerned, there are some who refuse to admit that this income tax is for the good of all the inhabitants. The better and more comfortable the life of this country in general becomes, the better will it be for the individual citizen. In the final analysis, it becomes obvious that interests dazzle the eyes of people so strongly that they can no longer see the truth.</p>
