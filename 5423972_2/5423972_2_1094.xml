   <p>In Ireland, as in other regions where the Irish have immigrated, the Irish celebrate today the national holiday of St. Patrick, their sacred leader. The Irish are very sentimental about this holiday. In regions where there are a vast number of Irish people, this national holiday is also observed by the non-Irish. In Chicago the City Hall is closed on St. Patrick's Day, thereby giving it official recognition. The national green flag is hoisted above the New York City Hall as well as all public institutions, and in every city of America can be seen many people wearing today in their lapels the shamrock, - the symbol of Irish nationalism.</p>
   <p>By this participation, the broad masses, i.e., the non-Irish, give encouragement to the Irish in their hopes to build up their homeland and strenthen their nationalism. It is an approval of the desires of the Irish to become <pb facs="5423972_2_1095.jpg" n="2"/>in due time a free people in their own free land, from whence shall emanate Irish laws and sprout their own sovereign.</p>
   <p>As an eternal Diaspora people, we sympathize heartily with the desires and intentions of the Irish, and we wish whole-heartedly that in our time the Irish may be redeemed not only with Home-Rule, but also with unconditional independence, as good Irish patriots would like to have. But with all our sympathy and good wishes, we cannot supress a feeling of envy for these Irish, for, even scattered and dispersed as they are, they have not abandoned their self-respect nor their confidence in their own strength. And their self-confidence is so adamant that their neighbors are forced to respect them. If an alderman born in Ireland proposes to have the City Hall closed on St. Patrick's Day, he receives the unanimous approval of all his colleagues, regardless of their racial or national heritage or of political affiliations. No one would dare vote against it.</p>
   <p>Here is where we become envious. If, God forbid, a Jewish alderman would <pb facs="5423972_2_1096.jpg" n="3"/>make a proposal to the effect of having the City Hall closed on the seventh day of Adar [six month in Hebrew calendar, of 29 days, falling in Feb. and March] in commemoration of Moses, the great Jewish leader, we hardly believe that a Jewish alderman would think of it, but if it were to happen, it would probably meet the approval of the Irish and other aldermen. But what would our great Jews, those who do not believe in foreign nationalism say? They would ridicule such an alderman. We are certain that even those who are now reading these lines cannot refrain from laughing at the indiscreet idea of closing the City Hall on the seventh day of Adar. Yet, Moses ought to be, at least among us, a person as highly connected as St. Patrick.</p>
   <p>This is why we envy the Irish on this day, while we do not begrudge them their holiday.</p>
