   <p>Some time ago someone brought up the matter of the World's Fair, pointing out the lack of interest and activity in this direction. We consider this a huge task. What are the Slovaks doing as their contribution to this gigantic undertaking? Several months ago, a board was selected to make plans and programs regarding our people. However, the board lacked activity and nothing was done. So, another committee was appointed, which seemed active for a while but later ceased to function. No more is heard of it now.</p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0241.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We do not know what excuse they have, but the fact is that they are not doing anything, and they should. The time for the World's Fair is rapidly approaching, and by all indications we are trying to accomplish in the six months before the opening of the Fair the things which should have been in the course of completion for the last two years. There is also the matter of taking care of out-of-town groups, relatives, and friends, who will no doubt come to see this colossal exposition. Therefore, let us be prepared and have something to offer them other than alibis.</p>
