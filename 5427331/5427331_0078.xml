   <p>We have one example of how dignified the representation of the Czechs and the Slovaks will be.</p>
   <p>Last Friday, February 3, the Chicago Daily News published an article about an exposition, which was to be, according to previous plans, a representation of the Czechs' and Slovaks' contributions to A Century of Progress. What do we see? The article was under the heading of "Czechs' Gifts to the World to be shown at Fair." The Slovaks are not mentioned at all. As we read the article further, we noticed a paragraph on the contributions of the Czecho-slovaks. Among the contributions specified there appeared Dvorak, the composer; Komensky, the pedagogue; Ressel, the inventor; the city of Plzen, for his brewery, and various others. All these contributions are the Czechs' pride and they have a right to be because the above mentioned men were of Bohemian descent.</p>
   <p>We can see for ourselves that there was not one Slovak contribution mentioned. The president of the committee could not recall one Slovak contribution to tell the Daily News' reporter. That just goes to show what the Czechs' intentions <pb facs="5427331_0079.jpg" n="2"/>are for the future. They will try to deceive the world and keep it in ignorance of the Slovak achievements and contributions.</p>
