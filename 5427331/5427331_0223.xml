    The Slovaks who resigned from the Czecho-Slovak World's Fair Committee, because the Bohemians did not want to hyphenate the name Czecho-Slovak, are constantly being reproached for desiring to import a European political battle to America.

One thing was certain, that, American Slovaks clearly revealed to the Bohemians, in this city, that they are not compelled to subordinate themselves, and that the Bohemians must deal with the Slovaks as their equal brothers. This step, which the Slovaks had taken, brought respect and recognition from some of the Bohemians and also from other nationalities.
