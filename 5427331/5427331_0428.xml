   <p>The first Slovak Day was celebrated in the Coliseum on Sunday, July 25th, in commemoration of the fiftieth birthday anniversary of General Milan R. Stefanik. This gala event was sponsored by the Chicago Slovaks for the benefit of the Slovak Charitable Organization. Despite the depression about 6,000 people attended this very unusual festival, the like of which has not been witnessed by the Slovaks for twelve years. The participants assembled at one o'clock in the American-Bohemian Auditorium, situated on 18th Street. From there the procession marched east on 18th Street to Wabash Avenue, and then north to the Coliseum, where a great crowd of people welcomed the procession and the program was started.</p>
   <p>Speeches were given by prominent speakers, after which a protest by Chicago Slovaks, to abolish or correct a contract made by the Czecho-Slovakian government, was read and will be sent to both President Hoover of the United States and President Masaryk of Czechoslovakia. The success of Slovak Day, was evidence of the great esteem in which the Slovaks hold their hero, General Milan Stefanik. Credit is due to the committee whose sincere efforts have made the success of this festival possible.</p>
