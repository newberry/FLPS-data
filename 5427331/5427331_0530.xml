   <p>Reports on the conference held by Mussolini and Premier MacDonald of England have appeared in several American daily newspapers.</p>
   <p>One of the chief subjects of discussion was the revision of the map of Central Europe. No mention was made of Czecho-Slovakia or its boundaries, but when Mussolini was asked his views on that matter, he replied that within the next ten years the Czecho-Slovak Republic will collapse. The northern part, he said, will become the possession of Germany; the southern part will go to Austria, and the eastern part will be taken by Hungary.</p>
   <p>The reason for Musolini's prediction we cannot comprehend, but if there is any truth in Mussolini's words, the Czecho-Slovakian government should give some thought to it and endeavor by every possible means to prevent its fulfilment. In order to protect itself, Czecho-Slovakia must preserve solidarity, peace, and co-operation within its borders; people may be united in the loyal defense of their country against these neighbors who are anxious to possess it.</p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0531.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A government which has loyal subjects in time of peace may be assured of their loyalty in time of emergency. We hope that Czecho-Slovakia may be able to prove the loyalty of her subjects in the near future.</p>
