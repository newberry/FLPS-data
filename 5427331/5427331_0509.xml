   <p>Some years ago, we well remember, the Slovak of Chicago was always repoached for not having anything, and accomplishing less. In fact, in various publications it was pointed out that our student youth was not even represented at the last convention of the Federation of Slovak Catholic Students, and that we were to be pitied more or less. However, sad as this statement is, it is, nevertheless, true; we cannot point to anything concrete which belongs to us. The reason for this is that we evade our own responsibilities, yet are always willing to help those who care very little for us, as a consequence we are always in the background. Now is the time to look ahead!</p>
   <p>The Slovak Catholic Student Youth of the Middle West has recently been organized, It is, therefore, up to us to promote and support its welfare, and make it a permanent institution for the future.</p>
   <p>There is a movement in progress to promote a sick benefit organization for our Slovak Catholic women. Not a bad idea! We sincerely urge all husbands to assist their wives as much as possible in this worthwhile undertaking; and their efforts shall not have been in vain. We do not have to lean toward those, who, after getting our money, turn their backs.</p>
