   <p>Last Sunday, August 23, the Slovak Catholic of Chicago and vicinity successfully celebrated the fourth Catholic Slovak Day at Pilsen Park.</p>
   <p>This event was held for the benefit of the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society.</p>
   <p>The weather was ideal, and according to reports some five thousand people were present. Festivities began with causes in same of our churches at which prayers were offered for the success of the fourth Catholic Slovak Day.</p>
   <p>The gates at Pilsen Park were opened to the visitors at 10 A. M., and at 12 o'clock noon the school band of St. John's Parish began to play concert selections. Music was also played by an orchestra under the direction of J. Stefanik. The main program of the day began a little after 2 P. M., with the singing of the "Star Spangled Banner." "Hej Slovaci!" was played by the boys' band of South Chicago. The chairman for the day, Frank Bohula, greeted all those present and explained the purpose of the occasion.</p>

    Mayor Kelly, who honored the Slovaks by his presence, expressed his admiration for the efforts which the Slovak Catholics of Chicago and vicinity are putting forth in taking care of their hungry and destitute.
   </p>
   <p>A solemn address was given by the Reverand Michael Kallokan, pastor of St. Joseph's Church, at Cudahy, Wisconsin, who spoke encouragingly of the Slovak Catholic and of his cooperation with his faith and his people. Others who spoke were the Reverend Victor Blahunka, pastor of Sacred Heart Church, Attorney Michael Tremko, who spoke in Slovak and in English, and the Reverend Lousi Basko, O.S.B., of St. Benedict's College, Atchison, Kansas, who has undertaken to write a book in Slovak on social surveys. A number of Slovak non-Catholics attended this festival and by their presence paid honor to the fourth Slovak Catholic Day. The affair was a success financially as well as socially, for which we are very grateful.</p>
