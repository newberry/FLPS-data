   <p>Every citizen who is interested in the progress of his community, should belong to some organization, the object of which is to promote the community's welfare.</p>
   <p>We, the residents of the neighborhood known as Pilsen, which comprises the larger part of the 20th and 26th wards, are organizing a protective association, to which every home-owner, businessman, and worker should belong, because united we can protect ourselves against the loss of the things which have taken us so many years to build. Our community is <pb facs="5427331_0386.jpg" n="2"/>being menaced from many angles. We are not only paying exorbitant taxes, but are being threatened by the invasion of the yellow race.</p>
   <p>At the time we built our homes, schools, and churches, we were not thinking of only ourselves and the present; our object was to maintain them for future generations. This can only be accomplished by united efforts. At the last regular meeting of the association, it was decided that anyone who joins at the next meeting will be accepted as a charter member; consequently, he will not have to pay an initiation fee. Dues are one dollar a year; however, if you are out of work and cannot pay, come anyway. The next meeting will be held March 7, at 8 P. M., in the hall at 1908 S. Halsted Street.</p>
