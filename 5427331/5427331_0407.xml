  <body>
   <p>All young Jednota members are hereby reminded that on June 24th will be celebrated our annual "Jednota Day." Nothing would be finer than to have a representation of at least a few hundred of our young members turn out on this occasion. The committee in charge of affairs is working hard to make this day a success this year. Our last two "days" did not turn out so good because the younger element did not lend its support. All the world loves a winner, now, why is it that we cannot be winners? If the enthusiasm displayed by our youngsters for the affairs of different organizations was to be confined to our affair, do you know that the "Jednota Day" would be the talk of the Slovaks in our city? Everyone would be expectant from one "Jednota Day" to another.</p>
   <p>What pleasure would be derived from this popularity cannot be counted. But the main fundamental cause for any successful enterprise is work and plenty of it. Don't be a slacker. If you are interested in the success of this "Jednota Day," make inquiries of the officers of your branch and they will <pb facs="5427331_0408.jpg" n="2"/>tell you how you can help. All the Sokols are requested to report to their instructors for practice. Anyone desiring to participate in the races or field events, make inquiries of Mr. Katrak. Don't forget, you do not get anything for nothing. Work, and when success has been attained, you will feel honored to know that you did your share.</p>
