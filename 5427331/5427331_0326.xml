<title level="a">CLUB FURDEK HELD A MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Club Furdek held a monthly meeting last Sunday in the La Salle Hotel. Although a majority of the membership were present it was noticed that several prominent members were absent. Various matters pertaining to the club were discussed. The Entertaining Committee reported that it is making preparations for a stage performance, "Tea at Mr. Senators."</p>
   <p>Matters regarding the Youths Slovak Week, which is to be held sometime in the Fall, were also discussed. A Slovak drama, "Janosik," will be translated into English by the president of the Literary Committee. This sad drama will be presented in English for the benefit of the Slovak youth. There are many of our young people who do not comprehend the Slovak language well. Therefore, an opportunity is offered to them to see and hear the play in the American tongue.</p>
   <p>Attorney John Hlavacka gave a lecture on the theme, "What is wrong with the <pb facs="5427331_0327.jpg" n="2"/>Slovaks?" The lecturer spoke about many of the problems that trouble the Slovaks, explaining the means that are necessary to solve them.</p>
   <p>The lecturer dedicated some of his time to our professional people, such as business-men, physicians, lawyers, editors, radio announcers, etc., showing their relationship to the Slovak public.</p>
   <p>It was evident that the words of the lecturer penetrated every one's heart. It is to be regretted that the entire Slovak public did not listen to this interesting and educational lecture.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned with the Slovak national hymn "Hej Slovaci."</p>
