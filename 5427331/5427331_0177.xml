   <p>
    We have just been informed of the amalgamation of two leading banks; the Southwest State Bank and the Depositors State Bank. The two banks will be united under the name of Depositors State Bank, which will be located at the latter's present address, 4701 So. Ashland Avenue. 
   </p>
   <p>The Depositors State Bank is one of the soundest banks on the Southwest side. Its present resources are $8,000,000, with 21,000 depositors. Through this consolidation, an institution has been created which will be able to serve its patrons better than the smaller banks.</p>
   <p>There will be no change in the staff. Mr. Julius F. Smietanka, well-known Slovak banker and lawyer, is chairman of the board of directors; Mr. John S. Jurik, one of the leading Czecho-Slovak bankers of Chicago, is vice chairman; Robert D. Mathias, under whose untiring efforts and leadership</p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0178.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>the bank has grown, is president; Mr. George D. Hopkins is chairman
   of the executive board; Mr. A. J. Calek, former
   vice-president of the Southwest State Bank,
   and one of the best known Czecho-Slovak bankers of Chicago,
   was made vice-president; Thomas E. Wilson, president of Wilson &amp; Co.,
   is president of the advisory board; Mr. A. M. Smietanka is vice-president
   and member of the board of trustees; Mr. Stanley J. Ratajczak, who has
   been connected with the bank since its foundation, is vice-president and
   treasurer; and A. Tupy is assistant treasurer. The firm of Smietanka, Poulton,
   and Bryant took care of legal matters for the Depositors State Bank.
