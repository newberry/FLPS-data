   <p>Doctor Peter Hletko is not chief physician of the Tatrian Slovak Union anymore. This position was taken away from him, without his knowledge, last Sunday at an annual meeting of the executive board of the above mentioned organization.
   In his place, Dr. Rurik was chosen. Has Dr. P. Hletko not fulfilled his duties or did he not meet the requirements of the executive board?
   There are other organizations which are satisfied with his work; therefore, it is strange that he did not satisfy the requirements of the
   Tatrian Slovak Union. The reason probably is that Doctor Hletko is a Catholic. Therefore, he became a victim of circumstances.
   It is evident that the situation in America is similar to Czecho-Slovakia. In that country a loyal Slovak has not a place in any
   public office, and it is likewise here in America.</p>
