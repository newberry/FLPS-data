   <p>Last Saturday, members and friends of the champion Catholic Sokol basketball team attended a banquet given in their honor, at the Stevens Hotel, where they were presented with a trophy, in recognition of their splendid basket-ball playing. Shortly after nine o'clock a meeting was held in the upper hall, which was presided over by Dr. Peter P. Hletko, chief medical examiner of the Slovak Catholic Sokol who after a brief talk, introduced J. Tomasko, chief sports director. Mr. J. Tomasko came all the way from Washington D. C., to attend this celebration. He spoke favorably of the local organization, and, in behalf of the Slovak Catholic Sokols, presented the taken of victory to the squad leader of the champions.</p>
   <p>Following the presentation of the trophy, the squad leader, Rudolph Rehak, expressed his sincere gratitude and presented each member of his squad with a sport sweater as a token of remembrance.</p>
   <p>A splendid supper was then served in the "Boulevard Room" of the hotel where Charles Agnew and his orchestra furnished the music. </p>
