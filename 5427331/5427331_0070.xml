   <p>The Federation of Slovak Catholic Women's Organization is sponsoring a "Slovak Wedding." The net profit will be given to the treasury of the Slovak World's Fair committee.</p>
   <p>The wedding will be performed according to Slovak custom. The bride and groom, as well as the entire bridal party,will be dressed in Slovak costumes. The wedding ceremonies will begin at six o'clock in the Bohemian-American Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The bridesmaids and ushers, accompanied by musicians, will go to the home of the groom, where, at the invitation of the ushers, the musicians will play. Songs appropriate to the occasion will be sung by the bridal party. The best-man will take the groom to his parents to bid them goodbye and to </p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0071.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>ask for their blessing. From the groom's home, the bridal party will visit the bride's home. The bride greets the people with tears in her eyes and her mother leaves her in the care of the lady-in-waiting. The bridesmaids lead her to a seat at the table and sing while crowning her with a wreath. The bride is then taken to her parents by her sponsors. Since she is not supposed to utter a word becaues of the sorrow and grief in her heart, her sponsors, in her name, thank the parents for their kindness and love. They ask them to forgive their daughter all the sorrows she might have caused them, and finally they ask the parents to impart their blessing.</p>
   <p>After the rites are performed by both the bride and the groom, the bridal party leaves for church to witness the wedding. After the completion of the marriage ceremonies, the couple and the guests return to the bride's home, where they celebrate till early in the morning.</p>
