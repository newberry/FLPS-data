   <p>It was probably noticeable that our past year was a fair success for the ladies branch of the Socialists group. It is not for us to stop but to cintinue getting more members and spreading the socialists idea among the people.</p>
   <p>Last year we had two lectures and one picnic, the lecture being very well attended too. Mr. Torzicky spoke on the topic, "Woman workers and Religion" and the audience gathered excellent suggestions from his talk.</p>
   <p>The dance committee is again preparing a program on February 8th at Noble and Huron Streets so dont forget to bring your friends and have them meet us so they can get an idea who we are and so we can prove to them we are not as they picture us.</p>
