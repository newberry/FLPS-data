   <p>Not all of us occupy high places in the course of a lifetime, no matter how conscientiously and efficiently we fulfill our duties. A certain English critic truthfully said: "We cannot all be knights, or gentlemen of leisure." A great number of us must become tailors, bricklayers, carpenters, and leaders of business enterprises. He who refuses to do his bit in this life, or tries to avoid doing it, makes the burden placed upon all humanity more difficult to carry.</p>
   <p>The young boy or the university graduate who tries to make his livelihood without work may or may not succeed. However, the young man with the determination to make good will not let any barrier stand in his way to distract him from accomplishing the achievements he set out to conquer. This boy will occupy one of the higher places during the course of his life. Judging from the various social and political positions our Slovak youth are now holding, they are headed in this direction.</p>
