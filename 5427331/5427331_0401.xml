   <p>The month of June ends the school term. A great number of our youth leave school with the conviction of being one degree closer to their goal. Many of them will receive diplomas as a reward for their effort, and will then enter into a more serious life. They have, however, a long way to go before they are prepared to participate in the affairs of the public, as professional individuals, and to solve the critical problems of the period. We are certain that a great percentage of those who have vocations have sacrificed, a large portion of their youthful life for their education. Many self-denials and sacrifices were required to attain their purpose. They yearned for the light of knowledge and desired to see the dawn of a new day which would take them out of the darkness of ignorance, regardless of cost. It is true that the price which they paid was high, because society today, does not give anything free of charge. In some cases the price they paid was double what it should have been, and yet many of them were given only half of what was due them. Now they have finished their studies and are standing on the threshold of a new life; they rejoice in even that half amount.</p>
   <p>American-Slovaks are proud of those who have reached maturity, and they <pb facs="5427331_0402.jpg" n="2"/>exult in their success. We trust, that they will work for the Slovak race, propagate national consciousness among our Slovak brothers and defend the honor and good name of the Slovak nation in public. Only for one reason may the American-Slovaks make claim for the youth's support in the national field; and that is because these young people were reared in the Slovak spirit, attended Slovak schools where the Slovak tongue and the love for their nation is instilled in them in the early part of their life.</p>
   <p>The future of the American-Slovaks lies in their training. It is a known fact, that Slovak immigration is restricted; we cannot depend on strength and aid from the outside; therefore, it is our duty to rear men and women who will perform the Slovak mission, and awaken national conciousness among American-Slovaks.</p>
   <p>Our younger generation must be brought up in the Slovak spirit. This can be accomplished by sending our children to Slovak schools where patriotism and the Slovak language are cultivated.</p>
