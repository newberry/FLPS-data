<title level="a">DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE FIRST SLOVAK CATHOLIC DAY</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Board and the Program Committee are going right ahead with the First Slovak Catholic Day, to be held in Chicago for the benefit of the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society. The celebration is to be held on October 11th of this year at Pilsen Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>Earlier this week, the Ladies Auxiliary of the Slovak Day Committee held a meeting during which workers were assigned to the job of securing program advertisements from business and professional men. Our Slovak business and <pb facs="5427331_0495.jpg" n="2"/>professional people will be the last ones to be solicited by the Ladies Auxiliary. In the meantime, however, they are asked to cooperate and listen to their pleas.</p>
   <p>The program is not going to be of the ordinary type, confined only to advertising; on the contrary, it is going to be a memorandum filled with illustrations of our daily lives, both moral and material.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we sincerely ask our Reverend Fathers to lend their assistance, and see to it that their parishes are mentioned in this booklet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrew Suhany, organist of St. Michael's Parish, who, at a meeting of organists two months ago, was appointed to lock after the singing, informs us that everything is in readiness. Those who fail to attend this celebration will prove their weakness, not only as Slovaks, but as Catholics as well.</p>
