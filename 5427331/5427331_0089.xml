   <p>The Slovak public may have been informed about the report of the Supreme Officer of the Slovak League, regarding the matters in which members of the Club Furdek are involved. The report, which was read at the previous congress held in Youngstown, Ohio, pointed to the fact that the president of this group is untiring in his fight against Hungarian propaganda. This proves that the club is devoting its efforts for the benefit of the Slovak race.</p>
   <p>The Slovak cultural Club Furdek was organized nine months ago with seventy members. In the short period of its existence it has already accomplished much. Its purpose is to unite the local students, former and present professional people, to work for their nation. It, therefore, deserves the support of our people. However, there is some misunderstanding, whether intentional or not, which is holding the progress of the club in abeyance. There are many individuals who are desirable as members, but who decline the opportunity. The greater the strength, the greater the work which can be accomplished. Students are requested to apply for membership cards which will entitle them to participate in the sublime work for God and Nation.</p>
