  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday the members of the Aerie of Eagles and their friends of St. Simon's parish had a very pleasant evening in the parish hall. The affair was sponsored by members of the board, and everyone present was pleased with the program, which was as follows: Greetings by Alma Massura; address by the president, Peter Budaj; and prayer by Rev. Joseph Job.</p>
   <p>The evening meal over, there followed a Dutch dance by Julia and Irene Hoferic, a speech by Emilia Ardon, songs by Marie Kvacala and Joseph Kolar, a play with Margaret Tylka, J. Ivancik, George Massura, M. Massura, and A. Budaj; a lecture by Joseph Massura; piano solo by Margaret Kolena and Frank Ivancik, and a song by the audience. The festivities of the evening were concluded by a dance which was enjoyed by all.</p>
