   <p>It is the month of June, the termination of the school year for our children, and many graduation exercises are in progress at all of our schools. From there, our sons and daughters are on the threshold of a new life, a new world is opened before them. Kind parents listen with keen interest to the inspiring words of the orators and are wondering what will become of their sons and daughters. They look upon them with pride and great expectation mingled with fear. What shall become of them, they are asking themselves?</p>
   <p>The school is deeply interested in the future of these children. Will they heed the principles and ideas laid down by their educators, and give these teachers a chance to proudly say: "They are ours'. Their church and their God, too, are casting a watchful eye upon them, sincerely hoping that the most fruitful years of their life shall not have been spent in vain.</p>
