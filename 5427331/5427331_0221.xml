   <p>The Chicago Slovaks for quite a number of years have taken care of their poor and unfortunate in Chicago and vicinity through Slovak welfare organizations. There are, however, many Slovaks in various cities of America who need assistance but have not any organization to turn to.</p>
   <p>Unemployed and without financial support, our Slovaks are in the greatest need. They suffer from cold, hunger and sickness; consequently, they are on the verge of despair. In their predicament, they seek the help of the Slovak League of America which, through "Mutual Assistance," distributes "gifts of love" among those who are in need.</p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0222.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In order to continue this humanitarian work, it is essential that those who are loyal members of the Slovak League should contribute according to their means to this noble cause. You can do so by attending a "friendly social" which will be held in the Ivar Temple. 4146 Elston Avenue. The social is sponsored by the 435th Branch of the Slovak League for the benefit of the treasury, in order to continue in the above mentioned work.</p>
   <p>A very interesting program has been prepared and the committee assures all participants of an enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>The social will take place January 29, 1933, at five o'clock. The admission is thirty five cents per parson. The Slovak public is cordially invited and welcomed to this affair.</p>
