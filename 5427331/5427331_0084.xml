<title level="a">THE CZECHO-SLOVAK QUESTION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Czecho-Slovak World's Fair Committee held a very serious meeting last Monday evening, and perhaps a meeting of historical importance also. It was held in the Havlickatyrsa Hall, Twenty-sixth Street and Lawndale Avenue, in which the Slovaks members of the committee were compelled to make a statement and defend their principles regarding the "Czecho-Slovakian" question.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called chiefly to discuss the question of uniting the Czechs and Slovaks World's Fair Committee into one body. The majority were in favor of the idea.</p>
   <p>Attorney Adam Poliak, a Slovak, had been commissioned to look after the matter of uniting with the Bohemians. In order to take the proper steps in the matter, he inquired of the president, Mrs. Cervenka, who is a <pb facs="5427331_0085.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian, how should the names "Czech" and "Slovak" be combined. Should the combination be hyphenated or not? It has been observed that some official papers and documents refer to the Committee as "Czecho-Slovak," and also "Czechoslovak." Mr. Cervenka's answer was as follows: "It is not an essential matter, since both nationalities are working for the same purpose."</p>
   <p>That was the Bohemians point of view, but the Slovaks thought otherwise, and their answer was given by Dr. Peter Hletko, who mentioned the fact that in the by-laws the name had been spelled "Czecho-Slovak," and he stated that it ought, therefore, remain in that form. Consequently, both sides began to argue the matter. The Bohemians stated that the name may be spelled without hyphen because it is known among them that they are two separate nations, but the outside world considers us as one, and, therefore, we spell the name as one and show the world our unison. Mr. Poliak and Doctor Hletko stressed the fact that if the <pb facs="5427331_0086.jpg" n="3"/>exposition and the other projects of the committees are to be successful, they must have the strength and the support of both Czechs and Slovaks. They also stated that if the name is not hyphenated, the Slovaks will not take part in this venture.</p>
   <p>After hearing the statement of the Slovaks, Mr. Cervenka said that he would resign from the committee if the name is hyphenated, and Mr. Poliak and Doctor Hletko said they would do likewise if it were not.</p>
   <p>They debated the matter till midnight, when the meeting had to be adjourned.</p>
   <p>The Slovaks had the courage to stand up for their rights; therefore they deserve credit. These rights were recognized by the Bohemians at a meeting of the same committee several days later.</p>
