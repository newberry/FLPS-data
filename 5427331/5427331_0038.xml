   <p>The above mentioned words are inseparable; because to visualize Slovak life in America without the assistance of its Alma Mater is impossible. That is what the Alma Mater has already accomplished and what it further intends to maintain.</p>
   <p>Since its beginning, the Slovak in his adopted country has taken a new lease on life; there is consequently, more order in the arrangement of his daily schedule, and he is constantly striving towards greater things. In fact, much has been achieved since the World War. In the first year of the Alma Mater's existence, the first two Slovak high-schools in America were built.</p>
   <p>Previous to this time, much discord prevailed in the daily lives of the American Slovaks. Confidence has now, however, been restored, and fear replaced with faith; as a whole, all our daily lives have taken on a more practical and interesting aspect. "We are no longer followers -- we are leaders!"</p>
