   <p> The Slovak heart is beating faster and overfilled with enthusiasm. The declaration and bold demonstration of the Chicago Slovaks blazed like a flash of lightning in the cloudy sky of the Slovak national life. It was not just an ordinary utterance that the Chicago Slovaks made; they were serious words describing the conditions prevailing in the Czechoslovak nation; they were words of protest against their deception and against the suppression of their tongue. These words showed how the Bohemians seek to rule in the Czecho-Slovak republic for their own benefit, deceiving and misleading at the same time the entire world.
   </p>
   <p>No matter where a Slovak may go, his nationality is unknown to the public; the world only knows the Bohemian nation. When reference is made to the Czecho-Slovak Republic, the Bohemians have it all figured out and say that the Slovaks represent only a small fraction of the Republic. The diplomacy of the country is thoroughly Bohemian. The present situation in Czecho-
   </p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0081.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Slovakia is identical to the one when the Hungarians ruled our people.
   </p> 
   <p>The Slovak nation must find means to reveal the true situation to the world and expose the unhappy economic and cultural situation of its people. The world will grant us recognition only if it knows that we exist. Today we are unknown and silenced. We are at the present time only a useful branch of the Bohemian nation.
   </p>
   <p>A Jewish merchant once said to a poor Slovak: "My intention is to rob you of all your possessions, but I see that you have not anything of value." The Bohemians have also the intention of depriving the Slovaks of all their properties, of their jobs, and of their speech. Just so we would not be able to protest, the Czechs endeavor to keep the world in ignorance of us.
   </p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0082.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Slovaks, come out of your seclusion! Make yourselves known to the United States, to England, France, and Russia. We must become known to all the civilized countries of the world, so that they may know what is happening to us, what an outrage the Bohemians, who call themselves a brother-nation, are perpetrating.
   </p>
   <p>Let us arrange thousands of mass-meetings and send from each one a protest to some men of honor interested in the peace of the world, so that they may ask the Czechs: "Why do you want to destroy the Slovaks and take away their daily bread? Why take from the Slovaks their natural rights, which were safeguarded by the Pittsburg Pact?
   </p>
   <p>Since they consider us as a negligible quantity and treat us the way they want to, the Czechs will some day be responsible for all the wrong done
   </p>

   <p>to us. Some day the Slovaks' rights will be recognized. It will be a victory for which the Slovaks have waited many years.
