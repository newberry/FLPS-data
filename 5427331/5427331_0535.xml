   <p>The Slovak League is also engaged successfully in collecting thousands, the aim being to complete the million dollar collection, which was first proclaimed as a goal early in 1917. The number of local branches is still increasing so that the last branch is No. 295. In addition to collecting money, the Slovak League is also obliged to undertake cases of which the Bohemian National Alliance is free, for the Slovaks in America are still the only branch of their people with freedom of speech and action. Until the Magyars are expelled from the Slovak countries of Hungary, the Slovak League of America must protect the interests of their brothers at home.</p>
   <p>The officers of the League are, therefore, busy gathering statistical data and preparing pamphlets for use in the Old Country, which will inform the people over there of the share the Slovaks in America had in the great work of liberating the United Czechoslovak State. The League also plans to take an important part in the economic up-building of Slovakia, which has great undeveloped natural resources. It intends to find capital among Slovaks and among American friends to be employed in the Old Country.</p>
