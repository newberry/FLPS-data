   <p>Club Furdek's Dinner Dance, which was held February 12, in the Red Room of the La Salle Hotel, in honor of the recently elected officers, was a success.</p>
   <p>Approximately 100 members and friends were present. The master of ceremony was Rev. John Fedor. Rev. Charles Florek opened the dinner with a prayer.</p>
   <p>During the dinner, several selections were played by a professional pianist.</p>
   <p>Following the meal, the toastmaster introduced the Club's retiring president, Attorney Michael Rehak. Mr. Rehak explained the objectives of the Club and in concluding gave the gavel to the new president, Mr. Florian Tylka, wishing him luck in all his undertakings. Mr. Tylka, the editor of Osadne Hlasy, thanked <pb facs="5427331_0218.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Rehak and expressed his appreciation to the members for the trust and honor they bestowed upon him. He asked for their cooperation.</p>
   <p>The following officers of the club were introduced: spiritual advisor, Rev. Charles Florek; vice-president, Attorney John M. Dluhy; recording secretary, Miss Mary Wargos; financial secretary, Miss Cornelia Flaska; treasurer, Attorney John Hlavacka; director, Rudolph Janega; president of the membership committee, Attorney Joseph Steller; president of the entertaining committee, George Galos; and Dr. Peter Hletko, president of the literature committee.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Dr. Peter Hletko, delivered a speech and stressed the fact that the members should adhere to the Club's principles and participate loyally in all the nationalistic and religious undertakings. He also declared that every <pb facs="5427331_0219.jpg" n="3"/>Slovak in America is watching, with interest, the progress and the activities of the club.</p>
   <p>The speaking program was followed by dancing which lasted until the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>Credit is due the entertainment committee for making the affair a success. They have a right to be proud of their accomplishment.</p>
