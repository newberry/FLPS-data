   <p>The annual meeting of the American Slovak Citizens' League was held Friday evening, January 13. A considerable number of representatives of both men's and women's clubs were present at the meeting. During the meeting everyone was in his best mood and a complete understanding was evident between the clubs and the executive boards. The president of the League stressed the fact that in order to accomplish anything, a complete understanding must be had among one another.</p>
   <p>Among the important matters discussed at the meeting there were a few corrections in the by-laws and the election of the officers and the committee for the coming year.</p>
