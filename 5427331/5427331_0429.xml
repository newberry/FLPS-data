   <p>Who is there among us who can forget the World War, with its heartaches and its tragedies? To most of us it has left a wound that can never be healed. The bitter tears of fathers, mothers, and orphans still flow. Not only those who are sick in body but the maimed and the crippled who walk among us like the living dead have poisoned our minds against the recurrence of such a catastrophe.</p>
   <p>Who is going to cure these ills? Who is going to dry the tears of those who grieve when hatred and bitterness are still rampant? Only He who said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." None other than our Saviour with his precious Mother the Queen of May.</p>
   <p>Today as we unite at our cemeteries in sad remembrance to place a wreath and pay homage to our fighting dead, let us pray for the emancipation of their <pb facs="5427331_0430.jpg" n="2"/>souls from purgatory as a reward for their sufferings and their sacrifices. Let us also ponder on our own death and remember the words of our Saviour, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall remain forever." Let us ask God not to punish the God-fearing rulers who conscientiously fought and cared for the happiness and the peace of their people. Let us pray for our citizenry that peace and kindness shall reign among them. For it is not always the rulers who have been at fault, but hatred and jealousy breed sin and are against God and the nation. We already see in Russia and Mexico the shedding of innocent blood by those who selfishly destroy Christianity and democracy to further their own personal ends. Only that nation which adheres to the morals and the teachings of Christ shall survive. Therefore we beseech thee, Heavenly Father, to protect our own Slovak race from destruction.</p>
