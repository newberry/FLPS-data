   <p>On his return from a two-month visit with his parents in Europe, Florian V. Tylka, treasurer of Club Furdek and editor of Osadne Hlasy, was surprised with a social given in his honor by the members of Club Furdek. The affair took place Thursday evening, September 10, in St. Michael's Parish Hall, where a goodly number of club members had gathered. The social began with a welcome address by Mr. Joseph Steller, president of the club, who also acted as master of ceremonies. After a fine supper prepared by the Ladies Auxiliary, the program continued with speeches by Adam Poliak, Stephen Skriba, and Reverend Fathers John Fedor, Charles Florek, OSB., Joseph Rondzik, and John Rondzik. Mr. F. V. Tylka expressed his heartfelt appreciation of this cordial welcome. Between speeches the audience was entertained with a vocal solo by Miss Claudia Mika and a piano selection by Miss Marian Fabry. This was followed by dancing and everyone present had a good time.</p>
