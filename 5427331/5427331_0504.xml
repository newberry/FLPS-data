   <p>Activities of the Slovak Catholics of Chicago, in recent years, have been more or less lagging. We showed the least participation in the natural and cultural fields, when compared with the Slovaks of other communities. Therefore we had no interest, or probably were merely careless; nevertheless, we were like strangers, quite distant toward one another. However, immediately after the publication of Osadne Hlasy, which carried reports of different parishes, matters changed.</p>
   <p>It was not long when announcements and invitations to all sorts of amusements became quite frequent. These cultural undertakings were and are the means of better friendship and understanding. In this endeavor we are not in the making, but are on par with other Slovak groups. Yes, the Slovaks in Chicago, are on the road to progress and success. "We are now on the right path. Let us then continue to work together and adhere to our Christian principles; the result cannot be other than gratifying!"</p>
