   <p>We presume that it is known to the Slovak public that Marianne Halamova has finished her vocal studies in Europe and has recently returned to America. Since her return, the Slovaks from the East are continually arranging concerts which are well met. Slovak periodicals are full of praiseworthy recognition of our Marianne, and their articles are overflowing with joy and pride in her well - trained and sweet voice.</p>
   <p>There is a rumor, however that only we Slovaks of Chicago, the hometown of our artist, are backward with our manifestation of recognition and affection towards her. We are, therefore making plans for a concert, to show our pride and gratitude.</p>
   <p>The Slovak folk - songs are like precious treasurers therefore our people cling to them with all their power. We hope that for the love of Slovak songs, and in respect to our singer, that all clergy, social group and individuals will lend their financial as well as moral support for the success of this cultural undertaking which will take place March 28, in the Slovak - American Sokol Auditorium at 915 Will Street.</p>
