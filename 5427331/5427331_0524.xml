   <p>As the Pittsburgh Pact lies at the very basis of any understanding of the present unfortunate relations between the Slovaks and the Czech government at Prague, the Slovak Catholic Federation thought it wise to publish a brochure on the subject at this time when the fight for putting the provisions of the Pact into effect is at its peak. One of the members of the Executive Committee of the Slovak Catholic Federation was, accordingly, commissioned to prepare the brochure of which I now write.</p>
   <p>The work is written in English for the benefit of the American public, and also for the benefit of those of our younger Slovaks who, through lack of knowledge of their mother tongue, have been unable to follow the discussion that the Pittsburgh Pact has in recent years occasioned in our Slovak newspapers.</p>
   <p>No Slovak can read through the forty-odd pages of this weighty little pamphlet without becoming a better Slovak for it, and, if he should be <pb facs="5427331_0525.jpg" n="2"/>among the growing number of Slovak indifferentists, who decry any mention of what they like to call "old-country politics," a reading of it will not only prove a revelation to him, but, what is even better, make him thoroughly ashamed of himself for his slackness.</p>
   <p>It is not possible that any true Slovak should be so hardhearted as to be indifferent to the fate of his people in Czecho-Slovakia, unless it be under the mistaken notion that "Americanism" means the destruction of all respect for one's racial heritage, and lack of interest in the homeland of one's ancestors. But heavens above, that is not Americanism! A person so utterly lacking in feeling is no more a genuine American than was the patriot of Ku Klux Klan days, who called himself "a one hundred per cent American" because he wore a nightshirt in public.</p>
   <p>As stated by the author in his preface, "The Slovaks and the Pittsburgh Pact" was written "that the reader may know who the Slovak people are and that they have a glorious past; how they came to be in the Czecho-Slovak Republic; <pb facs="5427331_0526.jpg" n="3"/>how events developed and led to the drafting and signing of the Pittsburgh Pact. We want the reader to know what the Pact guaranteed, how the stipulations of the Pact were ignored, and what flimsy objections were raised relative to the validity of the Pact by those who were parties to that Pact and who later became interested that the provisions of the Pact should be ignored. We hope that the reader will then understand why Slovaks are clamoring for their autonomy-home rule-in the Czecho-Slovak Republic."</p>
   <p>Here are some of the chapter heads in the brochure: Historical Background, Hungarian Persecutions of the Slovaks. The Early Relations of Slovaks and Czechs, Nationalistic Movement of Slovaks.</p>
   <p>The Early Movement for Freedom, Cooperation of Slovaks and Czechs, Organization of the Czechs in America, The Cleveland Agreement, Difficulties between the Czechs and Slovaks, President Wilson - the Allies and the Rights of Small Nations, T. G. Masaryk in America, The Pittsburgh Pact, President Masaryk and his Attitude toward the Pittsburgh Pact, Criticisms of the Pact are Unfounded, Conclusion."</p>
   <pb facs="5427331_0527.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The facsimile of the Pact on page 28 is alone worth the price of the brochure. One can read it for hours, without exhausting its riches. Just 134 words and 29 signatures, but how those words talk, and what interesting histories are attached to each of those signatures. There are traitors here and heroes, polite intellectuals whose word is not worth a plugged nickel and simple men of character on whose yea one can stake one's life, there are cynics here and upright souls who have not as yet learned to distrust the honeyed words of diplomacy, there are-but why continue? Look at the document and see for yourself how eloquently is speaks.</p>
   <p>Look at it frequently, look at it long, look at it in the merciless light of what happened during the past sixteen years.</p>
   <p>That more and more Slovaks and Czechs might have the opportunity of meditating on it, I should like to see the time come when on Memorial Day, the anniversary of the signing of the Pittsburgh Pact, all our loyal Slovak editors will publish a large facsimile of the Pact on the front page of their respective newspapers, and that a copy of each of these papers will be sent to all living Czech signatories of the Pact, as well as <pb facs="5427331_0528.jpg" n="5"/>to all Czech leaders, political or otherwise, living in this country or in Czecho-Slovakia.</p>
   <p>Of course, special efforts should be made to send the reigning genius of the Czecho-Slovak Republic as many copies of the pact as possible, for he, above all others, must be reminded that Slovaks the world over will never forget that he, the first President of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, drafted the Pittsburgh Pact; that he, "the Father of the country," signed the Pittsburgh Pact, and that he, "the personification of the Czech character," declared the Pittsburgh Pact a "farce."</p>
   <p>After collecting upward of $750,000 from the Slovak people on the strength of it, and using this money for the establishment of a government that does not even recognize God, let alone the existence of the Slovaks as distinct Slav people, who never were Czech, have no desire to become Czecho, and loathe being called Czechoslovaks.</p>
   <p>But returning to the brochure. I advise all Slovaks to buy a copy of it, not only because it gives all the pertinent facts about a historical document <pb facs="5427331_0529.jpg" n="6"/>that is destined to effect Czecho-Slovak relations for a long time to come, but also because by buying a copy they will help defray the expense of distributing the brochure gratis to the more important American libraries and newspapers. Thus, for twenty-five cents they will give themselves a treat and, at the same time, do a bit of missionary work for the cause of Slovak Liberty.</p>
