   <p>Life is stubborn. Oftentimes deligence and economy cannot ward off hardships. As long as we have our health, everything seems to go smoothly, but when sickness strikes, especially when it strikes the head of the family, the few cents we have saved, often by depriving ourselves of the real necessities of life, disappear. Hunger and privation stares us in the face and our only solution is to seek aid from the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society. Consequently, this charitable organization can be of still greater assistance to the needy, - families, widows, and orphans, if there would be more agitation for membership among individuals, as well as among our Slovak Catholic fraternal societies. Thus far there is only a mere handful of Slovak Catholics who are members of the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society. It is the duty of every Slovak Catholic, as well as of every Slovak Catholic fraternal society, to acquire membership in this great humanitarian organization. We cannot be satisfied with so small a membership as now exists when we know there are thousands of us here. We also have some well-to-do families and businessmen among our local Slovaks, who, even in these times, could well afford to contribute more <pb facs="5427331_0502.jpg" n="2"/>than the usual initial one dollar. What great wonders this would perform for those who are in dire circumstances! The Slovak Catholic Welfare Society seeks to aid those whose needs have been properly investigated and warrant assistance. They will assist not only our own parishioners, but also all Slovak Catholics who deserve to be helped. Dear brothers and sisters, once more we beg you, in the name of the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society, to become one of its members and donate freely to its fund. Have a heart for your suffering brothers and sisters. After all, we are of the same blood and bone. Also, let us bear in mind that today they are asking for aid, tomorrow, perhaps, it will be you or I.</p>
