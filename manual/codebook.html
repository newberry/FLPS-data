                                Each foreign-language community in this city has developed certain attitudes
                                    toward the institutions of the new home and the problems which it has had to
                                    face as a group or as part of a great nation. This is not to contend that
                                    each is unanimous in its opinions; divergent interests, different economic
                                    strata, and factionalism have brought about differing attitudes on many
                                    questions within each group. There is, however, a certain unity in the
                                    opinion of each group.  attitudes toward problems of life in this
                                    country, the conflicts which have arisen because of differences between
                                    inherited mores of the old homeland and the of life of
                                    the new, are of particular interest in a study of the history of
                                    foreign-language communities in 
                                        Chicago
                                     and their part in the development of the city.
                                The impact of their influence on the life of 
                                        Chicago
                                     and the course of its development is tremendous. Their
                                    attitudes toward public questions, customs, and ways of life have had an
                                    overwhelming influence. Whether these attitudes are in organized fashion in
                                    the polls or whether they are reflected in the daily political, social,
                                    economic, artistic and moral life of a great metropolitan center such as 
                                        Chicago
                                    , they have had much to do with the course of its development,
                                    resulting in social phenomena which are not to be seen in more homogeneous
                                    "American" sections of the nation. Of course, all of these people are
                                    American; they have merely brought with them points of view differing from
                                    those earlier immigrants.
                                In order that historians and sociologists may chart the development of our
                                    cosmopolitan city, it is necessary that we should collect a great wealth of
                                    material which reflects the attitudes of these groups, that is, those
                                    thought patterns which influence and mold public opinion among them.

                                       The education of youth has, perhaps, created more problems in the various
                                           foreign-language communities than any other subject. The nature of this
                                           education, its relation to old-country customs, and the questions
                                           involved in organizing life in a new environment have been most
                                           difficult of solution.

                                                         community. Other factions have supported it as a means of

                                       Each nationality brought to this country certain ingrained customs, of
                                           which, despite the new environment, it could not rid itself in a day.
                                           Certain human ways, common to all peoples, are looked upon by each in
                                           different fashion. There was a tendency to pass such customs along to
                                           the succeeding generation; even today they are strong in each community.
                                           Therefore, it was but natural that these inherited outlooks should
                                           influence every foreign-language community in its approach to the
                                           problems which were encountered in the new home. Nowhere is this
                                           tendency to follow the old ways so strong as in those practices which
                                           touch the family and personal life of the individual. For this reason,

                                                     Formerly, here as elsewhere, the man was the breadwinner. In a

                                                         Immigrant parents are bewildered at the sight of their working
                                                         daughters; and attempts to re-establish the customs and ways of
                                                         the homeland have failed almost completely.
                                                     Although this development is not peculiar to this country, it is

                                                  prized and desired to follow. Some of these had to be fitted into a
                                                  new culture, which resulted in many difficulties. For example, Jewish dietary laws have resulted in
                                                  a Kosher food industry. The Russian

                                            opposed everything German. These relationships played a
                                           large part in our political, economic, and social life. The Italians and Germans of

                                            have condemned Irish
                                           politicians; various groups are accused of religious bigotry or
                                           dangerous economic practices. In a city where each national group is

                                           but lately had been a peasant, thought that his wage represented the
                                           acme of wealth and well-being, a belief which his employer oftentimes
                                           fostered zealously. As his acquaintance with
                                               America grew, this feeling passed away; the
                                           worker became more Americanized in his outlook and began a struggle for
                                           better living and working conditions.
                                       If the immigrant had been an industrial worker in the old country he was
                                           likely to transfer to America the outlook of his
                                           fellow-workers at home. This was often socialism more or less extreme,
                                           anarchism philosophical or active, or some form of syndicalism. At any
                                           rate, a considerable degree of class-consciousness was generally
                                           evident.
                                       All of these factors have influenced the immigrant and his children in
                                           their theories of economic organization in
                                               America and, therefore, have become a part of
                                           our political life.

                                                         likely to be entirely different from the man who controls it,

                                                         positions. Such opinion as is expressed is usually influenced by

                                                     Thousands of those immigrating to America
                                                         were independent artisans and were used to a type of economic
                                                         organization which gave great freedom to the individual. The
                                                         artisans had their own traditions and standards, which often
                                                         were at variance with those of this country. Such people had a
                                                         stake in small business; therefore, their attitude toward it is
                                                         important.
                                                     In this country there has long been a group which supported small
                                                         business on the theory that it was a healthier form of
                                                         organization for American society. How have the foreign-language

                                                         they brought about modifications in theories? On this subject

                                              Labor organizations have wielded great influence in most of the
                                                  foreign-language communities since their members are strongly
                                                  represented in industry. Sometimes in national union, oft-times in
                                                  locals of their own nationality, the immigrants have fought for
                                                  better working conditions and higher wages. Of course, there are
                                                  sections in some communities, particularly the older and
                                                  economically stronger, which oppose unions in the same fashion as
                                                  the "American" bourgeoisie. Some groups, however, are simply not
                                                  interested in them. But, on the whole, the labor union plays an
                                                  important part in the foreign-language community.

                                       Women in America occupy a position which is almost
                                           unique in the world today. Their struggle to achieve this status is a
                                           most interesting phase in the development of our nation in modern times.
                                           Immigrant women coming to the New World found
                                           themselves in the midst of a bewildering series of changes. The struggle
                                           for common suffrage, the increased importance of this sex in business
                                           and industry, and efforts to remove legal disabilities under which they
                                           had labored in the past were things which, except in the case of a few
                                           intellectuals, had not entered the sphere of the immigrant's interests.
                                           Tradition, and in some cases religion, shut women out of the man's
                                           world.
                                       As economic conditions, accelerated by the World War, began to change the conditional status of the
                                           sexes the immigrant communities found themselves faced with new
                                           problems. The experience of seeing his wife and daughter enter business
                                           offices and factories, through economic necessity or the desire for more
                                           spending money, was something new to the head of the household, and
                                           sometimes it was a rather fightening experience to his womenfolk. The
                                           reactions of the varioius peoples to this new (to them) phenomenon are
                                           significant. Their discussions of questions, their judgments of its
                                           effect on family life, morals, and the female sex are valuable material
                                           for an understanding of this sociological change.

                                           our foreign-language communities were peasants in the old country. How

                                           think of American agriculture? Bear in mind that this section related

                                           work in industries where many face the hazard of occupational diseases.
                                           Unfortunately, most of them do not appreciate this problem, but much has
                                           been done by members of the varioius communities who have struggled
                                           (sometimes almost alone) to ameliorate these conditions.
                                       This section of the outline is designed to include opinions and attitudes
                                           on this problem, as it applies both to general living conditions and to
                                           specific industries. Discussions of such conditions as dirty streets,
                                           contaminated drinking water, and venereal or occupational diseases
                                           should be given this code or cross referenced to it. All attempts to
                                           prey on the credulity of the naive and ignorant in the communities in
                                           matters of health should carry this as the main code or be cross
                                           referenced to it, depending upon the content of the note. However,
                                           routine health information is not to be included; in fact, no
                                           translations of health columns are to be made, and if they come to your
                                           attention should be rejected.

                                The activities of the 
                                        Chicago
                                     foreign-language communities have been multi- and their
                                    contributions to the life of the city almost too numerous to catalogue.
                                    Their activities are even more significant than their attitudes, since they
                                    are of a more positive character, affecting every phase of life. The 
                                    "contribution" must not be misunderstood; it applies to activities generally
                                    considered undesirable as well as those looked upon with favor. Criminal
                                     are as much contributions to the life of 
                                        Chicago
                                    , albeit not regarded as favorably, as work in music or the
                                    organization of schools.
                                Newspaper records of the enterprises of these communities are of prime
                                    importance for historical and sociological studies. Indeed, newspapers are
                                    the principal source of information concerning the foreign-language
                                    colonies. In no other place is the life of the close-knit community so well
                                    portrayed.
                                The activities of the groups will demonstrate their economic position in the
                                    city, the cultural levels of their members, their intellectual interests,
                                    and to some degree, the extent of demoralization and crime among them. From
                                     raw material we can reconstruct, in part, a connected record of the
                                    history of each foreign-language community of 
                                        Chicago.

                                              The material under this code is important since it gives significant

                                                  various periods. Most immigrants, upon arrival in
                                                      America, went into the ranks of common
                                                  labor or small business. It was only after their economic position
                                                  was more firmly estalbished that they were able to enter the
                                                  professions. In this country professional status has always carried
                                                  a certain social prestige. Therefore, many immigrants were anxious
                                                  to gain this position, which made them of even more importance

                                                         In general, these schools supplement the child's public school

                                                     Likewise, some schools are devoted to the training and education
                                                         of adults, teaching them English and, in some cases, trades.

                                       Some colonies have been able to secure memorials to members of their
                                           group who have rendered service to the city and nation, or who have been
                                           outstanding in various fields. These may be statues or public buildings;
                                           sometimes parks and streets are named for such persons. Examples are
                                                   Riis Park,
                                                   Pulaski Avenue, and
                                           the large number of streets named for individuals prominent in various
                                           communities (Cermak, Diversey, Damon).
                                           Such memorials are important in tracing the growth of the
                                           foreign-language colonies.

                                              The immigrants, particularly those who came to this country for
                                                  economic reasons, soon realized the insecurity of the American
                                                  industrial system. Although their wages represented undreamed wealth
                                                  in the old country, there was no certainty of employment and savings
                                                  were rapidly exhausted when there was no work. On the other hand, at
                                                  home the close-knit peasant family had aided its destitute members
                                                  when misfortune resulted in hardships.
                                              To protect themselves and their families in times of economic stress,
                                                  the newcomers developed the "Mutual Benefit Society". Such organizations are based on
                                                  the principle of the strength of numbers. If each member, when he is
                                                  able, pays a small sum at regular intervals into a central fund,
                                                  then when he needs aid the fund can render assistance through
                                                  lump-sum or periodic payments. Such organizations have had
                                                  tremendous influence in almost every immigrant community. A large
                                                  number of organizations, created for other purposes, have added this
                                                  feature; others have been created for this purpose alone. They
                                                  render every type of aid: Burial assistance, sick benefits, and
                                                  payments at the death of members. In the latter instance the
                                                  organization resembles an insurance company (see next code). In some
                                                  instances members make specified payments; in others they are
                                                  assessed when funds are needed. Some organizations make lump-sum
                                                  payments, others make payments periodically for a stated time.
                                              It must be remembered that these bodies quite often engage in other
                                                  activities--educational, political, and social, etc. In order to
                                                  make available all the activities of mutual aid societies notes on

                                              As communities gained in numbers and strength insurance companies
                                                  organized within the groups began to take over some of the functions
                                                  of the mutual aid society, although they have not ousted this type
                                                  of organization. Sometimes considerable research may be necessary to
                                                  discover whether the organization is an insurance company in the
                                                  true sense of the term or a mutual benefit society. In general,
                                                  insurance companies must be firmly established bodies, incorporated
                                                  as such (although mutual aid organizations also are usually
                                                  incorporated), operating under the insurance statutes of
                                                          Illinois and
                                                  employing recognized actuarial practices.
                                              Again, it should be remembered that organizations pursuing other aims
                                                  have recognized insurance sections. The Polish National
                                                      Alliance is an excellent example. Be careful to
                                                  distinguish between the insurance company and the mutual aid or
                                                  burial assistance society.

                                              All types of medical assistance which the groups have developed
                                                  should receive this classification. Frequently the more formal types
                                                  of medical aid--hospitals and clinics--are beyond the community's
                                                  financial power. But in many such colonies physicians make a special
                                                  effort to improve health standards and do a tremendous amount of
                                                  charity work. A good illustration of this is the Russian community, where the
                                                  physicians, who are high among the leaders of the group, have done
                                                  much to help the pitifully ignorant immigrants. Some religious
                                                  denominations have organized hospitals and nursing orders.
                                              Emphasis here should be placed not on prevention of disease (for this
                                                  see I M) but the organization of
                                                  medical aid, whether for charity or for profit.

                                              Creches where working mothers can leave their children have been set
                                                  up in a few instances. Such institutions are important in a

                                                  justice may result. In many foreign-language communities legal aid

                                                  raised millions to help their people throughout the world; and Russians have helped their

                                                      Revolution. Sometimes these contributions have been

                                              Many kinds of such assistance--relief of war devastation, famine,

                                                  Editors should bear in mind that such contributions need not
                                                  necessarily be large. They may be made for the assistance of single

                                       Crime and delinquency are a "contribution" that no one wishes to
                                           acknowledge, yet they are important factors in the life of
                                                   Chicago. Juvenile delinquency is a
                                           particular problem in many foreign-language communities. The children of
                                           these communities, sometimes living in depressed areas, are often
                                           "Americanized" more rapidly than their parents since their roots in the
                                           old culture are not as firm. At the same time, however, in their homes
                                           they are subjected to the influences of the old country--its language,
                                           customs, and mores--which are considerably at variance with those of the
                                           school, the street, and the playground. Conflict between parents and
                                           children is the inevitable result. The young people, often deprived of
                                           proper guidance, drift into crime and anti-social practices.
                                       American individualism, which is in strong contrast to the closely-knit
                                           social organization of many European communities, has often been an
                                           influence for the deterioration of the individual. In the homeland (for
                                           example Poland) the individual
                                           was usually kept in line by the social and economic pressure which a
                                           community with traditional standards was able to extort. In
                                               America this is not so true; consequently
                                           there is less desire or need to conform to accepted standards. Ofttimes
                                           the colony here does not interest itself in the demoralization of its
                                           members. As a result, the prevalence of crime and delinquency is
                                           frequently quite high.

                                           permits will give considerable information concerning the legalities in

                                The problem of the assimilation of the foreign-language groups living in the
                                            United States is a most
                                    important and difficult one. Those Americans whose people came to this
                                    continent many generations ago, who have forgotten that their forbears were
                                    originally foreign or who keep alive a pride based on the nationality of
                                    their immigrant ancestors, are quite likely to view this question with
                                    misgivings.
                                In the communities composed of recent immigrants two general tendencies, on
                                    the whole, can be distinguished. The desire to become "American" in every
                                    sense of the word, to become completely identified with this nation, is very
                                    strong. This wish (coupled with the desire to avoid the prejudice often
                                    shown to things foreign) has led many to Anglicize their names. On the other
                                    hand, among those who grew to maturity in the homeland there is a strong
                                    desire to save inherited cultural values and many of the old customs. Severe
                                    strains result from the conflict of these tendencies.
                                Assimilation in the sense of the disappearance of the foreign-language
                                    communities in a sea of "Americans" will never take place. The
                                        mores of many of these communities are becoming a
                                    part of the American tradition; this fusion of cultures, mellowed by time,
                                    will produce an "American" culture unlike any one of those which entered
                                    into its composition.
                                It is to provide for an analysis of source material on the question of
                                    assimilation of immigrants that this section of the outline has been set
                                    up.

            <div>
                                       Almost always immigrants of the same nationality and language have
                                           settled together in communities on their arrival in this city. The
                                           strangeness of American life, the difficulty of making themselves
                                           understood by strangers, and the problem of finding employment have
                                           caused new arrivals of the same language and nationality to live in the
                                           same area when possible. The location of these settlements was
                                           determined by many factors: type and availability of employment, the
                                           price of land, and previous settlement in the same region by persons of
                                           the same nationality. As the immigrants and their descendants are
                                           assimilated these communities often lose their national quality. But
                                           even today certain parts of the city are considered German or Scandinavian,
                                           although these groups in Chicago have lost most of their
                                           distinctive features.
                                       All material which shows a tendency toward community segregation or
                                               the opposite should be coded or cross-reference here. This

                                           of the homeland, emphasis on religious differences, etc.

                                              In many communities there have been formed societies whose purpose,
                                                  in whole or in part, is the aggrandizement of their particular
                                                  nationalities. This may be accomplished through publicity,
                                                  education, propaganda, or direct pressure upon governmental bodies.
                                                  Such pressure may be used for many purposes: to secure legislative
                                                  approval for projected monuments and memorials, obtain changes in
                                                  the immigation laws and statues affecting aliens, or in an attempt
                                                  to bring about changes in internal policy (national prohibition of
                                                  alcoholic beverages). Persuasion has been exercised by petition,
                                                  personal appeals, and the ballot. The power of the foreign-language
                                                  communities and their nationalistic organizations is shown by the
                                                  care with which they are treated by all politicians.

                                              It must be remembered, however, that all societies and organizations

                                                  organizations whose purposes are international in scope in all
                                                  probability will have little interest in nationalistic goals. Some

                                                  nationalistic, are such in fact. Thus, the Polish and the Lithuanian

                                                  nationalistic in character. Many Zionist bodies have a philosophy of Jewish nationalism.

                                                         significance, if the festivals are primarily religious they

                                                         as religious holidays. In some cases it may be necessary to make
                                                         an investigation to discover the nature of the festival.

                                       Of course, none of the foreign-language communities has an established
                                           church. But certain denominations have become identified with various
                                           peoples to such an extent that they may be considered national churches.
                                           Thus, most Poles are Roman
                                               Catholic and the majority of Russians are Greek
                                               Orthodox. But we must not neglect other denominations
                                           identified with various nationalities, such as the Polish National Catholic
                                               Church and various protestant groups among the Russians. "National Churches and Sects"
                                           is to be interpreted as meaning church groups which are identified with

                                           should be of considerable concern to the foreign-language communities.
                                           This was especially true before the virtual suspension of immigration
                                           after the World War. Increased immigration meant greater strength for
                                           each colony. Many community businessmen dependent upon the patronage of

                                           negative, as among Russians forced to
                                           leave their country for political reasons. Occasionally the connection
                                           is maintained to promote revolutionary activity.
                                       Such relations are quite varied. They may involve exchange of students,
                                           financial aid to persons in distress, lecture tours, and many other

                                Translators and editors must make certain that the initials or first name of
                                    everyone selected for this file are in the note, so that they may be
                                    reproduced on a cross-reference card. If the translator has not given them
                                    the article must be returned to him for this additional information. In
                                    cases where this material was not included originally, the editor must
                                    enclose it in brackets. The following is an example: [J. M.]
                                            Konkowski. Such common titles as
                                    Doctor, Professor, Reverend, , must be given.
                                If editors doubt the advisability of including certain names in this file
                                    they are at liberty to question the article and return it to the translator
                                    for justification. Such a procedure should be followed when a large number
                                    of names is underlined, unless it is clear that the translator was justified
                                    in his selections. Editors are also entitled to ask translators why certain
                                    persons, who appear worthy of this designation, have not been included in
                                    this category. If the translator requires advice it can be obtained from a
                                    cooperating sponsor in his language group.
                                Great care must be exercised at all times by translators and editors to be
                                    certain that this file includes all individuals of sufficient importance,
                                     it must not be overloaded with relatively insignificant names. From
                                    time to time revised lists of the persons whose names are in this file will
                                    be issued to translators in each language group and to all editors, to aid
                                    them in selecting individuals to be included. Translators must watch for
                                    cases where names have been Anglicized, so that duplication may be
                                    prevented.

                                                  social classes and occupational groups in the country from which the
                                                  immigrants came. Most of the Russians in Chicago were peasants; therefore,
                                                  material bearing on their social class in the old country received
                                                  this code or cross-reference. Similar material relative to any other
                                                  social class or occupational group furnishing immigrants to this
                                                  nation should receive this code.
                                              Occupational groups will generally be found to be subdivisions of a
                                                  social class. Many Russians,
                                                  classified as peasants under Russian law, were in actuality factory
                                                  workers, either on landlord's estates or in the cities.
                                              Source material on this subject and the one
                                                      preceding is most important and care must be taken to

                                       Editors must be extremely careful in using this code. It should not
