<title level="a">THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It is rather difficult to write about something that is not there. Probably our readers are not all aware of the fact that the United States, a country that feels great pride in the fact that it posseses a large and completely manned and trained battle fleet, owns practically no merchant marine. Almost all the Merchandise of this country, that is transported through our ports, is handled by ships sailing under foreign flags. In times of peace, it is very costly, in time of war, it may result in great havoc, because then it will be almost impossible to hire foreign ships,at any price, but of the 37 ships supplying coal to the American fleet on their course from ocean to ocean, only nine are American, 27 are foreign. In time of war, these 27 ships can not be hired to coal our fleet, International Law would forbid their use.</p>
   <p>Japan owns 550 steamers which are fitted to transport armies, should the emergency arise. The United States however, does not even own five ships. The war department claims, that we would require 238 steamers to transport our army in time of war; but, at that critical moment of all the American ships that are found at home and considered sea worthy, we might be able to gather and fit out, at the most, about 38. The United States spends $100,000,000., annually, for the building of a merchant marine, which, in theory is intended to safeguard our American trade. But in an emergency, the 19 battleships now on the Pacific, would be defended by only eight American merchant-ships.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0888.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of all the countries which are actively engaged in politics and international trade, only the United States and Russia are without merchant marine of their own. One of the reasons advanced for neglecting our merchant marine is the high cost of construction in this country, and the very high duty on ships built in foreign countries. Therefore, American trade is satisfied to hire foreign ships, rather than to invest in the building of their own ships.</p>
   <p>What-ever the reason for this state of affairs, matters not; yet, there is no solid reason why it should continue; and the fact remains, that we do not own our ships, while our competitors, and possible adversaries, do. In a prosperous land like ours, something is wrong; the condition is abnormal and very unhealthy.</p>
