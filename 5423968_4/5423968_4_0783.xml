   <p>I have been awaiting the end of the Polish Falcon's convention with bated breath, as, I believe, other Polish women, for whom the fate of the homeland is of the utmost importance, have awaited it. I believed that real, not paper, action would be taken, that the decision would be made to form at once a legion of our young men, who are eager for action and willing to offer their lives, not just empty words, for the deliverance of the homeland.</p>
   <p>The decision which would have united all Falcons in readiness to strike the blow which would liberate Poland was not made. Procrastination now is a grave mistake, since this is the time for the Polish legion to act. Britannia rules the seas. She will allow our men to cross safely, because they are going to fight under her colors and those of France. After the conflict has ended--it may end at any moment--it will be too late for us to raise an armed protest against the decision of the powers, made without our participation in the <pb facs="5423968_4_0784.jpg" n="2"/>deliberations. The opportunity will have been lost. Our legion, if it should ever leave these shores, would never be allowed to land in Europe. It would contribute nothing worthy of inscription in the annals of the nation. After all, military action for the homeland is the chief aim of the Falcons. It is what entitles them to leadership among us and gives meaning to their organization. Could there ever be a more appropriate time than the present to fight Poland's ancient enemy, the enemy of all Slavic nations, to fight this second Grunwald, in a battle to which history calls us? We must not delay because the moment will pass. Let us throw the stacks of resolutions and paper plans into the wastebasket. Let our young men begin to act while they still can. You, brother Poles--free here in this free land--can do this. Our brothers across the sea are forced to fight in the armies of our annexers, without name or voice, and in the negotiations which follow, they will not be considered one of the belligerents. Our fate will be decided without us. This is horrible to contemplate! You alone, by forming a legion of volunteers and offering your lives, can break the deathlike silence of our war-torn homeland. All of you worthy and efficient men, who have been training for military service for many years in this free country, all of you who volunteered to fight against Mexico, a cause foreign to us, hurry now to form an heroic Polish legion. It <pb facs="5423968_4_0785.jpg" n="3"/>will be the first legion formed by the common people in the history of Poland, a legion of self-sacrificing, enlightened future citizens of independent Poland. Make this noble sacrifice on the altar of the rising homeland. Gather this rare flower of happiness, which blooms but once in a hundred years and which portends for us humanity's greatest treasure--liberty and freedom from subjection. But hurry, hurry, time will not wait. Financial resources--though shamefully small considering that there are three millions of us here--are in the hands of all sorts of collecting committees. They will suffice for the most immediate necessities. Furthermore, let us, also, do our share--we Polish women. It is true that we cannot offer our lives for the homeland. Distance and innumerable duties make this difficult. But we can strengthen, simplify, and expedite, this action of holy sacrifice for our brethren here. Let all of us earnestly take up the idea of forming a Polish legion in America. Let us make it as large as possible. Let us remove all obstacles and difficulties from its path.</p>
   <p>What part did the Polish women play in our national insurrections? They were like the burning flame which warms the coldest spirits and makes the most <pb facs="5423968_4_0786.jpg" n="4"/>reluctant want to fight. Like a spark, which when thrown on powder ignites and explodes it, they caused the flames to spread all over Polish soil. They were like the flaming, winged Nike which Wyspianski described so beautifully in his "Legion" as flying over streets, houses, reads, cities, and villages, rousing the men and filling them with heroic zeal, inspiring and guiding them toward action.</p>
   <p>Let such fiery, flaming Nikes of war rise among us. Let every Polish woman be a Hike to the men about her. Let them soar, calling loudly and constantly, "Go, hurry, to fight for the homeland."</p>
   <p>The great bell of Sigismund has sounded the alarm to call the people. What can we do to add to what is being done already? The homeland needs a great deal of financial help. At the moment it is getting its greatest help not from us, unfortunately, but from an American, a noble son of this free land. Our own wealthy people, it seems, cannot bear to part with larger sums of their money. We workers of today, whose future is uncertain, what can we give besides money? Let us contribute money by all means, but this alone is not enough. The wealthier among us posses objects which are like frozen assets: they serve only to give us <pb facs="5423968_4_0787.jpg" n="5"/>pleasure and to satisfy our vanity. Let us sacrifice these expensive toys and jewels, such as diamonds and other precious stones, on the altar of our ravaged homeland, without regret or complaint, rejoicing in the fact that we have them to give. What are treasures and jewels to us? Can we love them now, in view of the rivers of blood that are being shed, in view of the destruction of homes, nations, and the people's happiness, in view of the loss of civilization and culture? Let us tear these shining, expensive baubles from our persons, since our dazzled eyes now look toward the great, golden sun of life which is about to shine upon us, whose dancing beams will fall about us, warm us and our children, and bestow on them humanity's greatest treasure--a country! Let us remember that the stake is very high--it represents the freedom of our nation. In view of this, can anything else hold any meaning for us or distract our attention from the main issue, which is the independence of our country for us and our children forevemore? Let flaming Nike rise among us, call us to to action, and place her mark upon the brow of each of us. Let us make a great pile of our treasures, each giving what she can, and arrange a Polish national lottery. Such a lottery should be very popular; we should, no doubt, receive the support not only of our own people, but also of people of <pb facs="5423968_4_0788.jpg" n="6"/>other nationalities. A committee composed of representatives of all of the women's organizations could arrange this very successfully. We could then add our own personal contribution to the contributions of our society in general. Let us hurry! Let us act! Let us fan the flame of a strong will within us to give, to love, and to sacrifice. Time flies. The balance on which Poland's fate is being weighed, is swaying.</p>
   <p>P.S. I will offer my contribution to the committee, which I sincerely hope and believe will be formed.</p>
