   <p>One of the largest real-estate transactions of recent times was made yesterday, and since the property passed into Polish hands, it is with pleasure that we note the fact here.</p>
   <p>The Union Liberty Furniture Company, a corporation organized by the five Perlowski brothers thirteen years ago in Town of Lake, has, thanks to their energy and to the support of the Polish people, grown from one small store to such an extent that today it occupies five large stores in various parts of the city.</p>
   <p>One of the largest stores located at 1327-33 Milwaukee Avenue, will be moved to the newly purchased property, at present occupied by the Moeller Department Store. The property is located at 1272-78 Milwaukee Avenue, 1257-59 Mautene Court, and 1257-59 Paulina Street. These four-story buildings were purchased <pb facs="5423968_4_1638.jpg" n="2"/>by the Perlowski brothers.</p>
   <p>Thirteen years ago, the Perlowski brothers, Wenceslaus, Sigmund, Francis, Michael, and Valentine, opened their first store in Town of Lake with the aid of their father, Joseph. It was the first Polish furniture store in that section of the city. Today their stores are the pride of Polish communities. Their stores are located at 47th Street and Ashland Avenue, 35th Street and Archer Avenue, and three stores on Milwaukee Avenue, of which one will be moved to the new location which was purchased at a cost of $100,000. Rent for the land over a period of ninety-nine years will amount to $1,950,000.</p>
   <p>We wish our enterprising Polish businessmen every success in their new location.</p>
