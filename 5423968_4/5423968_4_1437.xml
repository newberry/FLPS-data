   <p>At the last meeting of the Polish Medical Society, a resolution was unanimously passed to participate in national politics and to give active support to those members of the Polish Medical Society who aspire (to be elected) to certain State offices.</p>
   <p>It was recommended that only members of the Polish Medical Society be selected and appointed examining physicians for the local groups and societies. In the second part of this educational meeting, Dr. K. Zurawski, professor at the University of Chicago lectured on positive methods of diagnosis and identification of syphilis, even when the disease does not show external symptoms. The diagnosis of syphilis is very important, because syphilis is not only contagious, but also hereditary. The sins of the father are visited upon the children of infected parents, who must suffer the so - called scrofulous diseases.</p>
   <p>The test, submitted by Dr. Zurawski, is based on the principle of immunization, namely, that of developing such physical condition which will enable the body to resist the disease. The test was begun twenty years ago, with the bacteriological theory of Koch, and was followed by the phagocytic theory of Miecznikod, and tested by the theory of Ehrlich. Today, many diseases can be treated with preventive serums. Dr. Zurawski demonstrated two serum tests, based on cases of his own practice.</p>
