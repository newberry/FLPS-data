   <p>Polish building and loan associations have acquired a place of importance and influence in the Political and financial world. The Polish Building and Loan Assn. held its semi-annual meeting at the Piast Hall, 1700 West Twenty-first St. About 200 representatives of building association of various parts of the city were present. The chairman of this meeting was Mr. John Czekala, and the function of secretary was performed by Mr. J. Niemiec. Following the reading of the minutes of the association, Mr. A. Wlodarski was requested to speak. As his subject he chose to analyze and clarify many new resolution adopted by the National Bldg. and Loan Assn. during the convention in Ashville, N. C. In his address he emphasized the many important factors which will have a tendency to increase the volume of business in the coming year.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wlodarski was followed by Mr. Rybicki, for the Polish Bldg, and Loan Assn, who said, that the association is daily increasing its influence and capital. Thanks to this associations the Polish name is receiving favorable publicity in many financial journals. Mr. Rybicki said: "The American people claim, that every Pole is vested with a keen business knowledge, in addition to being very thrifty." He also invited all to attend the state convention of the Bldg. and Loan Assn. which is scheduled to take place on October 11, 12, and 13, in Oak Park, Illinois.</p>

   <p>Mr. Albert Wahowski who is known as the father of the Polish Bldg. and Loan Assn., and who is also a well-known banker in Marshall Square, submitted very interesting statistics showing that growth of the association. He said, "Twenty-two years ago I attended a similar convention in Peoria, Illinois, the Polish association them had a surplus capital of $1,500,000. Today, the financial statement reveals a balance of $37,800,000." At this point, those present, at the meeting, passed a resolution to appoint a speaker for the convention in Oak Park.</p>
   <p>The Polish League offers a silver cup as a reward for the best address made at the convention. Following this meeting a dinner was served, after the dinner they danced into the wee hours of the morning.</p>
