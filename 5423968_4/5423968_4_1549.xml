   <p>Our attitude toward our young workers, the younger Polish-American generation, has always been one of the greatest interest and sympathy. After all, as we say, the future is theirs.</p>
   <p>One of the younger generation, an unusually pleasant individual, is Anthony W. Barwig, a typical Chicagoan and a typical St. Stanislas parishioner. He was born on April 29, 1885, in St. Stanislas' parish, the son of St. Stanislas' parish secretary of many years' standing, Mr. Ladislas Barwig. He went to St. Stanislas' School and was married on September 11, 1907, in St. Stanislas' Church to Miss Mary Schlapka, daughter of Francis and Eve Schlapka, old settlers in St. Stanislas' parish.</p>
   <p>They have three children; the oldest boy goes to St. Stanislas' College, and a <pb facs="5423968_4_1550.jpg" n="2"/>younger one attends St. Stanislas' parish school, even though their parents have been living for the last several years in a distant part of Chicago, Portage Park. In spite of that they belong to St. Stanislas' Church. It seems that the Barwigs could not get along without their old, beloved St. Stanislas' Church and parish; this is how Anthony and his family feel, and this is why they belong here to various societies and take part in all the social affairs and patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Barwig is a member of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, St. Cecilia Lodge Number Fourteen, of which he has been secretary for the last fourteen years. He is also a member of the Polish Alma Mater, the Knights of Columbus, the Koszciuszko Citizens' Club, which he joined when it was organized, and the amateur dramatic club of St. Stanislas' parish. Because of his great interest in music and his love for it he has been a choir director of St. Stanislas' Church for the last eighteen years; he is also a choir director of the above-mentioned Citizens' Club. Finally, for the last several years he has been <pb facs="5423968_4_1551.jpg" n="3"/>secretary and director of the Pulaski Bank. All these societies, clubs, choirs, and circles are naturally located in St. Stanislas' parish.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Barwig is a capable and energetic man. Although still comparatively young, he has acquired a great deal of business experience, which he used not very long ago to organize his own business, the Barwig Storage Battery Company, at 1355 Noble Street, where he manufactures and repairs batteries. Quite recently he enlarged his business by organizing the A. V. Barwig Manufacturing Company, which makes automobile parts and instruments. It is located at the same address. This concern is showing a healthy and rapid growth, and its owner is on the road to wealth, which we all most hearthy wish him to attain.</p>
   <p>As a great lover of music Mr. Anthony Barwig takes part with his quartet or his choir in many musical productions in our Polonia. In the recruiting for the Polish Army and in the American and later Polish loan drives his effective <pb facs="5423968_4_1552.jpg" n="4"/>help added much to the success of these patriotic campaigns.</p>
   <p>Good children of St. Stanislas' Parish, loyally attached to it--that is the Barwig family. When we emphasize this warm attachment, we do not mean to say that Mr. Barwig could not make his living somewhere else, for a capable and popular man can do it anywhere, but we wish to show our appreciation for his truly filial sentiment of fidelity and loyalty to this Alma Mater of all Polish parishes in Chicago. We regard this trait of character in him and in his family as truly admirable.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Barwig live at 5045 Cullom Avenue.</p>
