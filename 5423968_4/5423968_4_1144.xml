   <p>Poland has given much to American life. But she has contributed to mankind as a whole as well. For this latter contribution the whole world is her debtor. Who can hear or read the names of Polish heroes, statesmen, scientists, musicians, writers; the names of Sobieski, Copernicus, Sklodowska, Curie, Paderewski, Sienkiewicz, Conrad, without wondering what our life would be without these illustrious benefactors of mankind?</p>
   <p>But no Pole is so secure of a predominant, a living place, in American history, as Kosciuszko. No American can hear the name of Kosciuszko without remembering with the deepest gratitude his valuable service to his country.</p>
   <p>His name has been written in marble and bronze throughout our country; his deds of valor in fighting for a cause which he was great enough to take as his own, are written deep in the annals of our history; but the <pb facs="5423968_4_1145.jpg" n="2"/>true character of the man who a century ago fought for the ideals which have inspired and will ever inspire the progress of Poland and the United States, is enshrined in the hearts of all of us, and it is from our hearts that the call goes forth in salutation from our people, to the people of Poland: Kosciuszko lives!</p>
