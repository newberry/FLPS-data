   <p>Springfield, Illinois, March 22. Good news has come to us from the city of Springfield, capital of the State of Illinois. The state Legislature has passed, among other things, a resolution declaring itself to favor freedom for Poland, Ireland, and other small countries which up to the present have been under the domination of larger countries.</p>
   <p>A paragraph of this very important resolution which is of particular interest to the Poles reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, we decree in the name of our great community that we shall stand by the postulates and promises of our President of the United States and give him every aid in respect to his demand that freedom and rights be granted Belgium, Ireland, Poland, and other small nations, when the peace conference <pb facs="5423968_4_0622.jpg" n="2"/>is called at the end of the war. The matter of freeing smaller nations should be presented at the peace conference in accordance with the President's wish, and properly settled so as to grant rights to oppressed peoples."</p>
   <p>This resolution, together with other points important to the country, was accepted with enthusiasm and without a single dissenting vote.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously agreed to postpone the business of the meeting in order to hear and accept this important resolution.</p>
   <p>Further paragraphs of the resolution express praise of President Wilson for his manly stand, worthy of a great nation, in the matter of smaller, oppressed peoples, a stand which he expressed in his famous speech before Congress on January 22, 1917.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0623.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Further, in its resolution the Legislature expresses the opinion that there can never be a lasting peace as long as some nations are oppressed by other physically stronger nations, and as long as justice is not meted out to everyone. All nations are to decide their own fate and make their own laws instead of having these imposed upon them by others.</p>
