   <p>Polish welfare workers will hold a Polish Day on Wednesday, January 13, 1915, from 2:30 P.M. until 9:30 P.M., at the Health Exposition which has been in progress since November 30, 1914, at the [Chicago] City Club Building, 315 Plymouth Court, under the sponsorship of the Municipal Club.</p>
   <p>Every Pole desiring to co-operate in bettering our health and sanitary conditions should visit this exposition. Here he will find tables, charts, pictures, etc., showing the procedure he should follow in order to prevent sickness or check its spread; also the importance of sanitary measures when health is exposed to danger through uncleanliness. The mere fact that the exposition occupies six floors of the City Club Building will give one some idea of what benefits may be derived from visiting the place.</p>
   <p>A community dinner for Polish welfare workers and other guests wishing to participate will be held [on Polish Day], at 6:30 P.M., in the dining hall of the <pb facs="5423968_4_1332.jpg" n="2"/>building. The cost of the dinner will be seventy-five cents per person. Beginning at 8 P.M., there will be lectures and discussions on health and sanitation. Everyone is invited to attend. Admission is free.</p>
