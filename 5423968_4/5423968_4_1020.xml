   <p>Last Saturday afternoon (July 24) the new tariff bill, in the form accepted by Congress was sent to President McKinley for his signature, and signed without delay at 4:07 P.M.</p>
   <p>This bill,some of whose paragraphs are not favored by some people, has a good side to it, since it places a general limit on the uncertainty of the businessman and the manufacturer, who now find a basis for their inventories and are no longer in a state of uncertainty. They now will know which goods to import, what fabrics, and under what conditions they may be profitably purchased and brought into this country.</p>
   <p>The elimination of this general state of uncertainty will bring a marked improvement to business and industry and promises a brighter future. This change <pb facs="5423968_4_1021.jpg" n="2"/>is not going to be evoked by the new tariff alone, for, even without it, conditions would turn for the better, except for the constant opposition between the two parties and the constant propaganda pro and con the new bill and present-day tax laws. At present further propaganda should come to a stop. Every businessman and manufacturer knows what is good for him, and for every financier a field of activity opens upon definite given laws.</p>
   <p>All indications point toward better times. Industry will begin full operation, idle workers will find employment, business will become active, capital will be released, for the American people, convinced by the evidence of the last years of prosperity, are aware that sudden revolutionary changes in systems of taxation, as well as the substitution of certain tariff bills, undermine the prosperity of the entire country and threaten it with financial bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>If the present tariff bill is going to require certain changes, and it will require them without doubt, these changes will be brought about gradually in the future so as not to disturb the entire business set-up of the country, not to <pb facs="5423968_4_1022.jpg" n="3"/>mention the interests of the politicians themselves.</p>
   <p>H. S. Pingree, Governor of Michigan, is against certain items on the bill. Previous to the sending of the bill for the President's signature on Saturday, he had sent a telegram to Senator Burrows and Representatives Corliss and Spaulding. The telegram reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"I consider taxes on wood, hides, and sugar as unrepublican, unpatriotic, and unjust. Wood is mostly used for the building of homes for workers and farmers who represent the poorest classes, and is already taxed too much. A worker uses twice as many pairs of shoes as a millionaire. For what reason must the worker pay double for his wear than the capitalist? He uses as much sugar as the millionaire and again pays as much tax. It is one of the greatest wrongs to have the government collect from the poor worker the same taxes it collects from the rich. Tax property, not the stomach. Our personal property is under the protection of the government and for this protection payment is due.</p>
   <p>"H. S. Pingree."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1023.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There is a great deal of truth in the protest of the Governor of Michigan. It deserves a great deal of consideration.</p>
