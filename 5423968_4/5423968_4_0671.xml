   <p>In his conception of peace, as expressed in his address to the Senate of the United States, President Wilson has set forth his idea of a League of Nations. Recently a growing tendency on the part of neutral countries especially the United States, to push forward the idea of a just and lasting peace has been observed. These countries have taken this attitude not only because the war has had a bad effect on their business, but primarily because they want to take an active part in the formation of the peace treaty, so that it will be drawn up in a way that will be beneficial to them. The matter of the future peace has been up to now, one can say, primarily the concern of the belligerents. Now it is the aim of the neutral countries to make it a world-wide question.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously the entire concept of the future lasting peace has changed. From the viewpoint of the belligerents, the objective was to continue the war with <pb facs="5423968_4_0672.jpg" n="2"/>the conquered nations in the economic field in order to prevent the latter from renewing their military strength. In the light which President Wilson casts upon the subject, the future peace is not to represent a supremancy of one alliance over another, but the dissolution of all separate alliances for the purpose of establishing in exchange one great alliance composed of all the civilized nations. This proposed alliance would strike with all its might against any country or combination of countries which might break away from its union. The every possiblity of the formation of such an alliance of League of Nations presupposes the removal of all disputed questions between the nations, whether they be territorial pretensions or colonial or economic concessions. On the other hand, the League, as conceived by the neutral powers, would make all political influences, all forms of secret protectorates, and all rivalry for such influence utterly useless.</p>
   <p>This idea is still too new and insufficiently worked out to be accepted at once, to take root and to change completely the accepted direction of thought. Besides, it brings up several doubtful questions. Let us suppose, however, that at the <pb facs="5423968_4_0673.jpg" n="3"/>moment this idea of the League would greatly simplify the solution of disputed questions. Let us suppose, for instance, that through this expedient the German necessity for extending its protectorate over Poland would vanish, that this same necessity for extending its protectorate over Poland would vanish, that in regard to the Balkan countries would also vanish. From this example alone one can see how greatly the matter of establishing a lasting peace would be simplified; but only the matter of establishing it, not of keeping it. The mere existence of a League of Nations does not by itself constitute a state of eternal happiness. The future can bring with it the development of new antagonisms, new disputes. Who can guarantee that within the future League itself new alliances will not develop composed of disgruntled nations which have mutual interests? Even with the existence of a League of Nations it is not impossible to conceive that two equally powerful, mutually inimical alliances should arise, in the face of which the neutral members of the League of Nations might again show themselves to be a negligible quantity. Nevertheless, the League of Nations could be a factor which would greatly alleviate the chaos in international affairs which prevailed before the war. For this reason, without overestimating its possibilities, the idea of a League of Nations should be given <pb facs="5423968_4_0674.jpg" n="4"/>serious consideration if only for the reason that it offers a certain solution to the chaotic state of affairs, which are now so tangled that it sometimes seems that no solution is possible. The acceptance of the league of Nations as a starting point for the drawing up of terms for a lasting peace removes the necessity of giving precedence to the problems and strategic interests in the realm of politics, and to the problems of economic self-sufficiency in the event of war.</p>
