   <p>A meeting was held yesterday by a considerable number of depositors and other persons interested in the affairs of the Fidelity State Bank, which failed, or rather was closed by the authorities.</p>
   <p>The meeting, however, was an extremely stormy one. So far as is known at this time, the bank's deficit amounts to at least $140,000, although it was previously thought to be much smaller. Experts say that they see no way to save the institution, for its business was conducted in an unprofessional and unconscionable way.</p>
   <p>Those directly concerned turned to John F. Smulski, president of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank in hopes that he would take matters into his own experienced hands and save the situation, but Smulski refused, saying that he saw no hope for the [Fidelity State] Bank.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1669.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During yesterday's meeting, the president of the closed bank, Szajkowski [no initial given], was threatened with prosecution for abuse of the people's confidence.</p>
   <p>A financial report from the experts who are checking the bank's records was not yet complete. A receiver for the bank will undoubtedly be appointed in the very near future.</p>
