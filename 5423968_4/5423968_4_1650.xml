   <p>The present condition of Polish building and loan associations is in all respects satisfactory. The present war has had no ill effects; in fact, building and loan associations throughout the United States have reported an increase in membership.</p>
   <p>Our Polish building and loan associations deserve special recognition and support, for they have helped hundreds of people to raise their standard of living. There has been much co-operation, much time has been spent, and a great many difficulties have been overcome in persuading our countrymen to withdraw their savings from institutions other than Polish and hostile to them. A great deal of effort has been expended in convincing our people that Polish building and loan associations are able to conduct their affairs honestly and with profit to their members. Today it can be seen that our efforts have not been in vain, for they are already showing ample results.</p>
   <p>The war has had no ill effects on this business. In fact, the present critical <pb facs="5423968_4_1651.jpg" n="2"/>times encourage people to greater savings and our associations are gaining more and more members. But in order that our organization should continue its development, it is necessary that every Polish building and loan association become a member of our League, so that we can all work together. The field before us is still a large one, for there are still many of our countrymen who belong to associations other than Polish. They cannot say that those associations are giving them greater profits; in fact, their profits are smaller than those they would realize in our associations. Co-operation is indispensible to our organization; our gathering of representatives of building and loan associations is a fundamental necessity to our business interests. If we did not have our organization, we would not be able to exist. The state League has now been in existence for more than thirty-eight years. In its first beginnings, Polish building and loan associations were small--they had just begun to organize. There was no basic law concerning building and loan associations then. Permission to conduct a business of this sort was granted by the judges of the Superior Court. After a large number of associations, organized by unscrupulous Jews, had arisen, these Jews began to close out, cheating the people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1652.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Honest financial institutions, seeing that this was harming them, presented a bill in the State Legislature in 1887 making building and loan associations illegal. At this time, the State League [of Polish Building and Loan Associations] sent a delegation to Springfield to prevent the passage of this bill. The bill was defeated.</p>
   <p>In 1891, the State League presented a bill in the legislature providing for a state examiner for building and loan associations. The bill did not become law until 1893. All of the older residents remember how in 1903 and in the following few years a plague entered Chicago from St. Louis, Missouri. The company was incorporated in the state of Missouri, operating in Chicago, collecting money from house to house. The agents claimed to be members of our association. They promised mountains of gold, changing their company's name again and again. It seems that the last name used was "Teutonic." They had already cheated the people out of a large sum of money and would have continued their operations if it had not been for our State League, which saw to it that the State Auditor closed the corporation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1653.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Every citizen of this country knows that he must give an account of all income over a thousand dollars, and if he is single that he must pay an income tax on such earnings. In the same way, financial institutions must pay a tax to the Government. Only building and loan associations are exempt from this tax, for they are recognized as benefit societies. Our State and National League is to be thanked for this exemption, for it is through the efforts of its representatives that the exemption was effected.</p>
   <p>Our League of Polish Building and Loan Associations is always on guard over our rights. There should be no Polish building and loan association that is not affiliated with it, and there ought to be no Pole belonging to any but Polish associations. Every Pole should be a member of a Polish building and loan association; then our work would bring real results and would serve not only to promote prosperity among the American Poles but would serve as a foundation for prosperity in our newly risen [post-war] Poland.</p>
