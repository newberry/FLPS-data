   <p>It is a well-known fact that election costs in Chicago run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the hotly contested election just passed, reliable estimates have it that the Democratic party, supporting Harrison, spent at least a hundred thousand dollars; Allerton and the Republicans are supposed to have spent at least half a million dollars. A good part of this money goes to the groups of election workers that each party maintains at the polls.</p>
   <p>The question is: Where does all this money come from? Sometimes the party pays the campaign and election costs, but oftener it is the candidate himself, or a few wealthy private individuals, who meet the expenses.</p>
   <p>Pessimistic people have begun to fear that at this rate it will be impossible for any man who is not a millionaire to run for public office. It <pb facs="5423968_4_0088.jpg" n="2"/>may be. On the other hand, there have been occasions when the heaviest bag of gold served only to bring about the greater defeat of its owner. So it was with Allerton, and so will it be more than once in the future. It is difficult, if not impossible, to buy the votes of a whole populace.</p>
