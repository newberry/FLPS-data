<title level="a">FIRST VOLUNTEERS TO POLISH ARMY LEAVE FOR TRAINING CAMP</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The first contingent of volunteers to the Polish Army left yesterday evening for the training camp in Canada from the Polish Army recruiting headquarters, located in the Polish Women's Alliance Building, 1309 North Ashland Avenue. The Polish youths were merry and enthusiastic at the prospect of having a chance to avenge the bestialities committed upon Polish soil by the Prussians. They answered the call of their homeland and vowed to give it their active aid.</p>
   <p>Before the departure of the soldiers from Chicago, Lieutenant Skarzynski, chief recruiting officer for Chicago, addressed them, as did Michael Perlowski, president of the citizens' committee. Both addresses were sincere and direct. Lieutenant Skarzynski asked the men to conduct themselves properly during the trip, for they would be carrying with them the good name of the Polish army. The volunteers were sent to the training camp under the command of Sergeant Jagiello. As they left the recruiting station, Miss Emily Napieralski <pb facs="5423968_4_0491.jpg" n="2"/>gave each man an American flag in behalf of the Polish Women's Alliance of America. One of the recruits carried both a Polish and an American flag.</p>
   <p>A considerable number of people gathered at the recruiting station to bid farewell to the departing volunteers, our future heroes. A great dignity prevailed throughout, for everyone understood the significance of this moment.</p>
   <p>And following that first contingent that left yesterday evening in order to train themselves for the struggle against the Prussian hordes, there will be hundreds and thousands of others, and all will be led by the same thought, the same cry: "Give us, O Lord, our homeland, our freedom!"</p>
   <p>May these volunteers prove to the world that Poles know how to fight for freedom, that they understand the task before them and are ready to take their places on the field of battle.</p>
