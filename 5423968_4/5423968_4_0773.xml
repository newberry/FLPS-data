   <p>Today we have printed on the first page of our paper a photostatic copy of the cablegram sent from Bordeaux, temporary capitol of France, by prominent Polish citizens. They appeal to the Polish emigrants to form Polish Legions.</p>
   <p>Still another call from our compatriots in Europe should finally remove all doubt as to our political reasoning. With enthusiasm and firmness we should transform our daydreams into action. We should put aside quarrels and disagreements and unite in the one thought, that we must incorporate the enthusiasm of our young men in the one sweet-sounding watchword, legion.</p>
   <p>Everything depends on the consolidation of our parties and on concerted action. With strong faith in our future and our historial mission, which we have yet to fulfill, we should now, here in America, kindle the sacred flame of <pb facs="5423968_4_0774.jpg" n="2"/>enthusiasm for the cause and sacrifice everything that we possess on the altar of our mother country.</p>
   <p>Let all quarrels cease. Let all obstacles which block our way toward complete unity disappear and let their place be taken by harmony, which makes even the weak strong.</p>
   <p>We believe that the moment of such fraternization among us here, in America, is not far distant. We know that only a matter of hours separates us from that moment. Therefore, already we look toward the future with confidence, certain that all organizations and parties will again stand shoulder to shoulder and exert their united strength toward the same goal.</p>
   <p>When the old bastilles of hatred and disagreement which have divided us fall, when all of us exchange fraternal greetings and get to work in harmony, then the generosity of the masses for the most sacred causes will increase, and thousands will be contributed for the purpose of succoring our homeland, whose <pb facs="5423968_4_0775.jpg" n="3"/>most prominent sons appeal to us for help.</p>
   <p>There will then be no traitors to the cause. The entire nation will unite in one whole, and this whole will be as great and strong as we can make it. Therefore, it is time we started to work in harmony.</p>
