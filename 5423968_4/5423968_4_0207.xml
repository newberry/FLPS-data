   <p>At present, one of the most important acts in the historical drama not only of the Polish cause but of all the Slavic nations is being enacted in Washington. The Allies have come to the conclusion that if Russia's place is not taken by some other Slavic nation with sufficient strength--moreover, by a civilized nation inimical to Germany--then the Germans will, with the assistance of already helpless Russia, gain control over the whole world. The Germans can draw upon such immense resources from Russia, both in men and material, that the Allies will not be able to withstand the pressure on the Western front.</p>
   <p>And the situation is already so dangerous that the Germans will, in a relatively short time, have at their command millions of young Russians. It is rumored that they have already gone so far as to have recruited several hundred thousand <pb facs="5423968_4_0208.jpg" n="2"/>Russians into their armies. It is high time to take a decisive step and to answer the despairing Russian cries for intervention, as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>However, neither France, nor England, nor Italy have the means with which to resume activity on the Eastern front. In addition, Allied intervention in Russia must be of such a character as not to offend Russia and thus give the Germans easy grounds for stirring up all of Russia against the Allies. Thus, hated Japan cannot intervene--even Frenchmen and Englishmen would not be favorably received by the completely misled Russians. Only those whose interests are bound up with the Eastern question can intervene, or nations racially related to the Russians--the Slavs, for example, among whom the Poles are the leading group.</p>
   <p>In consideration of the fact that neither France, England, nor Italy have the means for intervention in Russia, the United States alone can accomplish it. The United States alone can support such an action not only financially, but <pb facs="5423968_4_0209.jpg" n="3"/>by placing a powerful and truly Slavic army in the field.</p>
   <p>The United States has something to proceed on, for there is already a Polish army of more than a hundred thousand men in Russia. And since there is also a considerable Czecho-Slovakian contingent, it will be sufficient to provide a half-million men and enough arms and ammunition. About this army will be grouped a great number of Polish troops scattered throughout Russia, and so many Russians who wish to save their country will unite with it that an army of not one, but two million men will arise to bar the road to German exploitation of Russia, and, in addition, offer a serious threat to German supremacy in the East. Only then can the victory of the Allies be complete and decisive.</p>
   <p>As we have already said, the United States has the means with which to intervene in Russia. Of all the Allies, only the United States has a Slavic population of many millions, from which a Slavic expeditionary force could be recruited.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0210.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There are four million Poles alone in the United States, and about three million other Slavic peoples. And so there is something to draw upon. Moreover, considering that such an expeditionary force would act primarily in Polish interests, that the Poles are the largest Slavic group here, and that the Polish nation is already at war with Germany, having an army of its own on the Western front, the Poles would comprise the majority in this Slavic army and would give the army its tone and character. The Poles then, with the help of the United States, would become the saviors not only of their own homeland but of all the Slavic peoples, and Poland could take its place as the eastern member of the Allied family, replacing Russia, which has shown itself incapable of existence as a state.</p>
   <p>And again Poland comes to the fore. The government in Washington has understood Poland's enormous significance in this war and is turning toward her. And if any doubts should still persist as to the sincerity of the Allies, then with the formation of a Slavic army, which must happen very shortly now, these last doubts would vanish. Were he living today, Wyspianski would cry still louder that Poland is a great force.</p>
