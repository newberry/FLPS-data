   <p>A group of Chicago Poles, numbering approximately a hundred men, have left this city for Camp Kosciuszko in Canada. They are all volunteers for the Polish army. After intensive military training they will embark for France and there fight for the liberation of their long-oppressed country, Poland.</p>
   <p>On August 19, 1918, the district known as the Town of Lake for the fifth time played host to Chicago's Polish volunteers. As early as nine o'clock in the morning the recruits with their families and friends began to gather before the recruiting station located at the pavilion at 47th Street and South Ashland Avenue. There they awaited the arrival of the recruiting officers. Shortly thereafter several hundred school children of St. John the Divine's parish made their appearance with bright-colored banners and flags. When it was ascertained that all the volunteers had arrived, a parade was formed, and all marched to the Church of St. John the Divine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0154.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The parade was led by the local civic committee and followed by banners of the Allied forces. Then came the band under the direction of Mr. Walter Lagocki, next a long procession of schoolboys and schoolgirls, and these were followed by Army officers. They in turn were succeeded by the newly organized volunteers. The parade was closed by literally hundreds of relatives and friends of the recruits.</p>
   <p>The procession set out from the recruiting station at 47th Street and Ashland Avenue, marching thence to 51st Street, from which it turned into Throop Street, proceeding to the Church of St. John the Divine. Here they found waiting a mass of people, members of the parish.</p>
   <p>Many who came to the church discovered that it was filled to capacity. So large was the attendance that the majority of those present were obliged to remain outside the building.</p>
   <p>A solemn mass was celebrated by the Reverend Stephen Szczepanski, assisted <pb facs="5423968_4_0155.jpg" n="3"/>by the Reverend Julian Grzesinski as deacon and the Reverend C. Pijanowski as subdeacon. The master of ceremonies was the Reverend Stephen Bubacz. The following pastors of neighboring Polish Roman Catholic churches were also present, namely, the Reverend Fathers L. Grudzinski, A. Klowo, and F. Karabasz. These occupied seats in the presbytery of the church.</p>
   <p>During the mass the church choir, under the direction of Mr. Frank Malinowski, the parish organist, offered well executed musical renditions appropriate for the occasion. Mr. Malinowski sang the beautiful offertory prayer.</p>
   <p>An inspiring and patriotic sermon was preached by the Reverend John Stoinski. In brief but well-chosen words this young priest and patriot called upon the young Polish recruits to perform their duty conscientiously there where thousands of our fellow Poles have already gone. In conclusion the reverend speaker gave points on how we Poles should love the land of our forefathers. He then bade a fond farewell to the recruits and gave them his blessing.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0156.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The ceremony was concluded by a solemn benediction, followed by the singing of our Polish national anthem, "God Save Poland," in which every one participated.</p>
   <p>With the termination of the religious ceremony the parade marched to the auditorium at Sherman Park. Here an appetizing banquet awaited the recruits, provided by the local civic committee. The guests were waited upon by young ladies of the local White Cross organization. The food and the service were of the utmost perfection.</p>
   <p>Before the banquet was served, the orchestra, under the baton of Mr. W. Lagocki, played the American anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner". The Reverend L. Grudzinski then said grace. Among those present at the table of honor were the reverend fathers who had participated in the religious ceremony, many civic bodies from various districts, recruiting officers, and members of the press.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0157.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Ater the banquet the first speaker was the Reverend I. Grudzinski, pastor of the local parish. On behalf of the local civic committee and the whole Town of Lake he greeted the volunteers and the guests. The speaker then called upon the Reverend Stephen Bubacz to act as master of ceremonies. The toastmaster, after bidding welcome to those present, called as the first speaker Mr. Leon Nowak, the secretary of the local civic committee. Mr. Nowak with vigorous enthusiasm turned to the volunteers, urging them ever to remember that they are Polish soldiers and as such should never retreat but always go forward and thus assure victory for the American as well as the Polish cause. The next speaker was Mr. Edmund Misiewicz, a member of the civic committee. In his speech he referred to the words of President Wilson that Poland must be a free and united nation, with access to the sea. He therefore urged these new Polish recruits to fight as our forefathers had fought before them. He was followed by the Reverend A. A. Klowo, a well-known Polish patriot and priest. On behalf of our Polish <pb facs="5423968_4_0158.jpg" n="6"/>clergy he promised the recruits that they as well as all the Polish people will ever remember the deeds performed by the Polish volunteers. The next speaker was Mr. John Przyprawa, a recruiting officer, who also left with this contingent for the training camp in Canada. The speaker delivered a really military speech interspersed with humorous passages, adding to the entertainment of those present. Turning to the recruits and his comrades, Officer Przyprawa reminded them or rather urged them to resolve not to return until the oppressors of Poland are vanquished, until Poland again takes its proper place among free and independent nations. In conclusion Officer Przyprawa on behalf of the new recruits thanked the local clergy as well as the civic committee for the reception accorded to the volunteers. He also thanked all those who have even in the slightest degree contributed to making the occasion a success.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Mr. S. Jankowski, a prominent Polish leader and a member <pb facs="5423968_4_0159.jpg" n="7"/>of the local civic committee. In brief but sincere words he bade a fond farewell to the recruits, wishing them Godspeed in their mission and hoping for an early and safe return.</p>
   <p>All the speeches were so well rendered and delivered with such enthusiasm that they were frequently interrupted by bursts of rousing applause.</p>
   <p>Finally the toastmaster, the Reverend S. Bubacz, bade the volunteers farewell, praying for their safe return. Following this all present sang the Polish national anthem, "God Save Poland," and the reception was concluded.</p>
   <p>At the termination of the program ladies of the families of the members of the civic committees gave appetizing sandwiches to the volunteers, and the members themselves presented cigars and cigarettes.</p>
   <p>After this the [local] civic committee, headed by Messrs. Bruno and Roman Kowalewski, well-known bankers in the Town of Lake, invited the recruiting <pb facs="5423968_4_0160.jpg" n="8"/>officers, the newly enlisted volunteers, the several civic committees, and the families of the recruits to enter waiting automobiles. The cars were decorated with bright bunting and flags. They left at a given signal, passing through Garfield and Michigan Boulevards and stopping at Grant Park. The automobiles decorated with Polish and American flags deeply impressed the spectators. Wherever the caravan of automobiles passed, American people enthusiastically greeted our Polish volunteers. The leading car had two standard-bearers holding an American and a Polish flag respectively. The second automobile contained six flags of the Allied nations. The third was occupied by officers of the central recruiting office. Immediately following the automobiles was a truck lent by the Perlowski brothers, noted Polish furniture merchants. This truck was occupied by the orchestra, playing continuously merry tunes and marches. Then came automobiles filled with the new recruits and their guests.</p>
   <p>After their arrival at Grant Park a procession was formed in the same order <pb facs="5423968_4_0161.jpg" n="9"/>as that previously described in connection with the march to Sherman Park. The parade marched on Michigan Boulevard to Randolph Street, on Randolph to La Salle, on La Salle to Jackson Boulevard, on Jackson Boulevard to Dearborn Street, and on Dearborn Street to the Grand Trunk Railroad Station.</p>
   <p>Wherever these Polish volunteers passed, the streets were filled with spectators They were greeted with tumultuous applause and hearty cheers. Upon their arrival at the railroad station the recruits immediately occupied their respective seats in the special cars awaiting them. Here they bade farewell to their families, their sweethearts, and their friends. During the entire time the orchestra continued to play cheerful tunes, endeavoring to lighten the burden of parting. Finally it played three national anthems, Polish, French, and American. Then followed final and fond farewells, and the train slowly pulled away, taking with it those brave sons of our country, of our Poland. They have gone to liberate our land from the chains of servitude in <pb facs="5423968_4_0162.jpg" n="10"/>which she was placed by our three worst enemies, Germany, Austria, and Russia.</p>
   <p>A vote of appreciation and recognition is due to Officer John Przywara. He has left his remunerative post as inspector to join the rank and file of soldiers. His sole aim is to fight for the liberation of Poland even if it costs his life. Sincere recognition is also due to the clergy of the Town of Lake, to the civic committee, to the ladies of the White Cross, and to all those who have in any way contributed to making the affair a success.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy might mention that the farewell affair of August 19, 1918, will ever remain a pleasant memory not only to the volunteers but to all who participated in the event.</p>
