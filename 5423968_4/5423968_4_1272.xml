   <p>Mr. W. J. Lauck, an official of the Department of Labor and Commerce, who is an American that really knows the conditions of various European nations and who takes great interest in the immigrants that arrive in the United States from various parts of the world, especially the immigrants from Poland, has praised the Poles very highly in the American newspapers.</p>
   <p>In the last issue of the Times Dispatch of Richmond, Virginia, Mr. Lauck wrote and article under the title of "Men From Poland Are Good Farmers".</p>
   <p>In this article the author remarks, that he is greatly interested in the Clover Bottom colony which is located in the state of Missouri, in the very center of Washington County. Four Polish families from Pike County, Illinois, arrived to this locality, which was a wild desert. They bought ground from the owners at six dollars an acre, then began a very hard task of cutting down trees, pulling out stumps, clearing the ground for cultivation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1273.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this same year three more Polish families arrived in Clover Bottom from Texas, and the following year eight more Polish families from Texas and nine immigrant families from Poland settled there.</p>
   <p>This small colony of Poles combined forces, and changed Clover Bottom from a wilderness to a very benutiful spot. It had taken some time and hard work, before these farms had given them any results, but as time went along they began to reap profits, and today this colony has become one of the best farming sections in the United States.</p>
   <p>Many more Polish families who lived in various parts of America settled in Clover Bottom, but did not remain very long, because they were used to the big cities and localities where Polish churches are nearby.</p>
   <p>At present there are thirty-six Polish families amounting to two hundred persons in this colony, and following the parents departure from this world, the sons and nephews do the farm work. They love this work and are happy, having achieved prosperity. The Polish language reigns there because some <pb facs="5423968_4_1274.jpg" n="3"/>of them are unable to speak the English language. In this small colony they live as one happy family, and can serve as an example to farmers of other colonies.</p>
   <p>These farms are now in good condition, and their value has increased very considerably.</p>
   <p>These Polish settlers built very beautiful homes and gardens; they live a good distance away from the large cities and do not have to worry about employment or income.</p>
   <p>Each Polish farm in Clover Bottom amounts to eighty acres; however, from this eighty acre farm a Polish farmer is not only able to support a family, but also saves money. On this same kind of a farm an American farmer would find it very difficult to support a family; also the American farmer would not care to clear wilderness, and would not have the proper farming tools for such work. But a Polish, German, Dutch, Swedish or Bohemian farmer is well trained in farming, and can make a small farm pay, even for the future <pb facs="5423968_4_1275.jpg" n="4"/>generations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lauck, writing further of Clover Bottom, adds that these Polish farmers, and Polish farmers everywhere, are very useful to America because they know how to produce a large crop of wheat on a small piece of land, while the American farmer could not produce as much wheat on a piece of land five times as large. Such immigrants are needed very much, and we should receive them with open arms to our country, and the government should help them to settle on farms, so they would not destroy their great strength in factories or mines, wher they would perish miserably.</p>
   <p>Not very far from Clover Bottom are two none Polish colonies, Cracow, and Owensville, in which sixty-one Polish families occupy farms, and they farm on what the American farmers call very poor land; yet they surprised these American farmers by proving to them, that they are able to earn a living on these farm lands.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lauck further writes that Polish immigrants are good farmers, industrious <pb facs="5423968_4_1276.jpg" n="5"/>people, energetic and economic, they are greatly needed and the gates of the United States should be open at all times for such immigrants.</p>
