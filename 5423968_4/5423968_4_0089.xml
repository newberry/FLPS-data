   <p>Chief of Police Mc Claughry has recently promoted two hundred second-class policemen, that is, reservists, to regular policemen. They have been placed on the payroll, for which money has been found.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, according to reliable sources, promotions will be made and higher rating will be given to those who will exert influence in the nomination and election of Aldrich. Only those will be accepted for promotion who will definitely prove that they are ardent supporters of Aldrich and Washburne. A suitable method has been reached whereby undesirable candidates will be eliminated. It has been put into affect effectively. Washburne has introduced a so-called civil service examination, which in reality is a farce, for by this kind of test it is easy to pass those that are favorable to the machine and disqualify those that are adverse. As soon as a Democratic <pb facs="5423968_4_0090.jpg" n="2"/>alderman posts someone for a promotion, the examination questions are made so complicated that it is impossible to pass them.</p>
