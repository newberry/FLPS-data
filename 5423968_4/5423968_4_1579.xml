  <body>
   <p>The American Tailoring Company, which was granted a charter on December 30, 1919 by the State of Illinois to do business in Chicago, Cook County, is a Polish organization. This concern is directly related to the American Tailoring Company in Poland. The employees of this Polish organization are Polish People who have had at least twenty years of experience in the tailoring business in American and Poland.</p>
   <p>The American Tailoring Company Manufactures ready-made clothes on a large scale in Poland. The directors, officers, and stockholders are individuals who have been in the tailoring business for many years. It was only after a lone discussion that the leaders of this company agreed to start a branch on American soil. All of the stockholders were familiar with the fact that many American tailoring corporations have been established <pb facs="5423968_4_1580.jpg" n="2"/>for many years and have built up a steady clientele. They knew that a number of them became million-dollar concerns. In the light of this [knowledge] they could not afford to experiment. Since Chicago harbored one of the largest Polish colonies in America, they chose to start their business here.</p>
   <p>The progress of this organization has not been what the Polish brotherhood of tailors and the Polish people expected. There are many reasons for this, the major one being the war.</p>
   <p>This company was organized in Warsaw during 1910. A solid foundation was placed under this enterprise. One of the finest buildings of its kind was built at 40 Zabkowski Street, praga-Warsaw [a section of Warsaw]. Although this building was erected before the war, it contains many modern conveniences. It has three large workshops and houses thirty <pb facs="5423968_4_1581.jpg" n="3"/>other business concerns. A part of the building remained unfinished because of the war. However, it has been recently completed. This new section is five stories high. The four upper floors are used primarily for making clothes, while the ground floor is divided into four large stores. The building and property are controlled by the American Tailors Stockholders Society.</p>
   <p>Everything that has been accomplished by this company has been considered a great achievement. It must be realized that the stock issued never exceeded the value of the enterprise. A great deal of cooperation was necessary, together with enduring patience. Capital had to be raised, equipment had to be purchased, and many sacrifices had to be made in order to attain the desired goal.</p>
   <p>The expenses or this company are comparatively small. All members of the administrative body work in the organization. No one receives a pension.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1582.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The books are always open to the shareholders and, especially, to the representatives of the Polish press. The American Tailoring Company in Chicago has twenty-three members; is has a capital of $30,000. According to one of the directors of this company, it has never been the policy of this enterprise to float more stock than has been declared. This company is working for the interests of its organizers, the Polish people, and Polish manufacturing. It is hoped that success will continue to attend this Polish company.</p>
