   <p>Other speeches were made by the Reverend Duzynski, who spoke in French, to which the delegate from the French government replied, speaking of the mutual aims of the Allied powers and of Poland's future; John Wedda, who spoke as representative of the Poles born on this soil, and I. Osostowicz, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, who also spoke in French in behalf of the Polish newspapermen.</p>
   <p>During the course of the banquet, telegrams were received from Bishop Paul Rhode, Ignace Paderewski, and from Circuit I of the Polish Falcons' Alliance, New York.</p>
   <p>[Text of telegrams omitted by translator.]</p>
