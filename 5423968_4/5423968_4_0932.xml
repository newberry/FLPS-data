   <p>The Supreme Court had scarcely finished recognizing the constitutionality of the Adamson Act, which grants railroad employees an eight-hour day, when the railroad companies set up a howl. They are now prophesying that they will have to raise both their passenger and freight rates immediately.</p>
   <p>Shedding crocodile tears, the owners of railroads cannot bear to have their employees work only eight hours a day and be paid for nine hours. With terrible howls and gnashing of teeth the railroad owners announce that the Adamson Act is lawlessness.</p>
   <p>"Through the Adamson Act we will lose, if we do not immediately raise our rates for serving the public--we will lose more than sixty million dollars yearly!"</p>
   <p>Thus the railroad companies howl. But whether this howl is justified or not <pb facs="5423968_4_0933.jpg" n="2"/>now becomes the important problem to be solved.</p>
   <p>They are losing, they say, sixty million dollars yearly on only a small concession to the workman. Sixty million dollars!</p>
   <p>Just how much their average "net" profit was, they do not mention. Neither do they mention how much net profit they could have after accepting the Adamson Act without raising their rates. Is this not the most definite indication that they fear that the people, astonished by the magnitude of their profits, will not allow themselves to be robbed of their hard-earned money, and will even attempt to have the railroads placed under government ownership?</p>
   <p>The clever and foxy railroad owner tries to justify each one of his actions with some sort of an argument. He wants to make money on everything, to take advantage of every decree and every situation. Even the Adamson Act is no <pb facs="5423968_4_0934.jpg" n="3"/>exception.</p>
   <p>The railroad companies know that without the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission they cannot raise their rates. Therefore, they are already starting to court the members of this commission in order to have their plans and proposals turned into legal decrees.</p>
   <p>Whether the commission will allow the railroad companies to extort high rates from their passengers, whether it will follow the promptings of insatiable individuals, we shall see in the near future. At any rate, the citizens should look into this matter and not allow a few score parasites to feed on them.</p>
   <p>The railroad companies should not be allowed to exploit their employees or to charge the public exorbitant prices. An itemized statement showing their income and disbursements should be demanded. Their business should be investigated <pb facs="5423968_4_0935.jpg" n="4"/>to see whether or not their net profit is too large.</p>
   <p>When everyone is convinced that the profits would be tremendous even if a seven-hour day were granted to the employees, that the arguments of the railroad companies are merely designed to pull the wool over the people's eyes--then the people will be able to stand up boldly against these social leeches and their crocodile tears.</p>
