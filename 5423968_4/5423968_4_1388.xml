   <p>The graduation exercises of the Chicago Medical School were held last Saturday evening in the beautiful salon of the Auditorium Hotel. At the conclusion of a program of singing, music, and speeches, Dr. A. Augustine O'Neil, president of the institution, gave diplomas to the graduates, bestowing upon them the degree of Doctor of Medicine and the confirmation that they have graduated from the aforementioned medical school. Five Poles, despite great obstacles - such as lack of funds and the fact that they had to work at night and study during the day - were among those who graduated with honors . Their names are Frank Sadowski, Daniel Sokolowski, S. Pieozynski, Frank Socha, and Aurelius Siemianowski. These for the most part are people who a few years ago came to the United States with barely an elementary education, but who, with an unyielding impulse and love for learning, worked during the day and attended public school in the evenings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1389.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After finishing both public and high school, these people were able to value the meaning of education in this century, so that with redoubled energy they undertook studies at a university, receiving their diplomas last Saturday, which gives them the assurance of a proper standing in society, and also providing for them materially.</p>
   <p>Our youth, whom we usually see hanging around pool rooms and wasting their time in similar places, ought to follow in the footsteps of these students who, at the time of their arrival in America, were in no better position than thousands of other youths, with the exception that instead of wasting their time, they gave themselves ardently to study, receving today their well-merited reward.</p>
