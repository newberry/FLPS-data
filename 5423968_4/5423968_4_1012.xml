  <body>
   <p>In the larger cities of the United States, there are special offices named employment agencies. The aim of these offices is to act as agent between employer and employee,i, e; to find for the employer skilled workers, and for the unemployed, suitable employment. If it were not for the fact that these agencies are based on swindle and fraud, they would render a valuable service to the unemployed. The majority of these offices are in charge of leeches and swindlers of the worst kind. We are in possession of much evidence which proves that these agencies rob laborers who are looking for employment, of their last pennies, without fulfilling even the slightest obligation. The majority of these victims are the recent immigrants who are without knowledge of the English language and ignorant of the customs of American people. These agencies extort to the limit, taking their last cent for services and transportation, whereupon the laborers are sent to another city, often several hundred miles away and when arriving, it is found that the proffered work does not exist, or that the contractor is dishonest and exploits them like slaves; finally, after a few weeks, he "throws them out," to make room for other victims.</p>
   <p>A few laborers from Chicago informed us how they were sent several hundred miles from Chicago, after $35.00 was collected from them for railroad tickets and commission.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1013.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When they arrived at their destination, they found there was no work, so they came back to Chicago on foot and by stealing rides; one of them was killed by falling from a freight train.</p>
   <p>When they complained at the agencies, they were thrown out. Swindled laborers were compelled to find justice in courts, but there again they found other leeches, in the person of crooked lawyers who demanded exhorbitant fees in advance; then,being out of funds, they gave up; while agencies continued to swindle other victims. Some agencies are in conspiracy with contractors and foremen in factories, railroads, mines or forests, with whom they split the commission received from the poor laborers, who are given work for a short time and then are thrown out to be replaced by other victims of the connivers.</p>
   <p>The Immigrants Protective League made an investigation in Chicago and found that 49 out of 56 of the agencies investigated were practicing exploitation of unemployed, sending them in groups to various cities, where there was no work or where they were underpaid for work of short duration, and for which they collected from $6 to $14. The League is preparing a bill be be submitted to the State Legislature, demanding that all employment agencies shall be put under the State control.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1014.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The proposed bill provides that all private employment agencies must be licensed by the State and controlled by a special State commissioner; commissions should be regulated by law, and where the agency is not able to supply employment, that it should be compelled to return all fees which have been collected. The proposed bill forbids also that commissions be split with contractors, and that foremen, in any case of violation of this law, be severely punished.</p>
   <p>All agencies should give a written contract in the language in which the applicant makes his application. The name of the prospective employer, his address, kind of work, wages and period of employment, must be given in said contract. If this bill is passed, then there will be no more exploitation by leeches, operating in the guise of employment agencies.</p>
   <p>True, there are a few honestly conducted agencies, which are fulfilling their obligations; but the majority are managed by cheaters and should be discontinued.</p>
   <p>The very near future will show whether our law makers at the State Capital are willing to solve this problem.</p>
