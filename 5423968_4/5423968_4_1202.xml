  <body>
   <p>The League of Polish Women has recently been organized in Chicago for the purpose of uniting all Polish women in patriotic work and preparedness for active service. All of our Polish women are always ready to serve and only await our country's [Poland's] call or that of our adopted country, the United States.</p>
   <p>In its appeal to the Polish women, exhorting them to attend its first meeting, the League of Polish Women emphasized that without flowery words, without empty, meaningless phrases, but with the warmth of true sincerity and loyalty to those who are kind to us" they must slowly but surely prepare for the work which undoubtedly all women, including Polish women, will have to face here in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1203.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This work is to be carried out in close co-operation with the Red Cross. Our Polish women realize that at a time when the entire United States is preparing for the day which is coming and which will come, it is not fitting for the Polish women to lag behind. They must take an active part in the preparations, and having rid themselves of all superstitions and past disagreements, they must all rally around the flag of the League of Polish Women.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the League of Polish Women, which was held at the Polish Women's Alliance Building, it was decided to get to work energetically to inaugurate a six-month training course for nurses, which will consist of lectures on hygiene and surgery conducted in both the Polish and English languages by Polish physicians. The lecture hall will be open to all comers. Classes will meet four times a week, both in the afternoons and evenings, at the Polish Women's Alliance Building.</p>
   <p>The League of Polish Women passed a number of resolutions at this meeting <pb facs="5423968_4_1204.jpg" n="3"/>at the suggestion of Dr. W. Kuflewski, president of the Polish Medical Society. This leads us to believe that the League is beginning its work with care and thought, and so must be counting on the success of its undertaking. We therefore assume that the efforts of the League of Polish Women will receive the support that they deserve from our community, and that Polish organizations will not refuse their help when they see that this work actually is going along on the right road.</p>
   <p>The problem is to avoid these "flowery words and empty phrases." The problem is to keep this work from becoming a pose and to keep from carrying it out in a dilettantish manner, or as recreation. As Dr. Kuflewski clearly stated, "the activities of the women who are undertaking public service are not play but hard, tedious work."</p>
   <p>If our Ladies present at the meeting of the League of Polish Women will <pb facs="5423968_4_1205.jpg" n="4"/>comprehend this, if they will proceed along the lines of this good advice, if they will think less about the outward effects of their undertaking and more about the basic idea of it, they will undoubtedly make a great success of their work, and in addition will have the satisfaction of knowing that they have done their duty toward themselves, their community, and their country.</p>
