   <p>On Sunday, December 10, at 4 P. M., there was a meeting at Mr. Krascewski's hall. Mr. [H.] Lubienski was called upon to act as chairman and Mr. Wrzesinski as secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman submitted an appeal from the sugar industrialists to the Polish workers and then introduced Mr. Gryglaszewski of Minneapolis.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gryglaszewski, after describing briefly the history of Polish colonization, pointed out that only farming could assure the Poles of a welfare cannot be shaken by financial and economic fluctuations.</p>
   <p>Ending his explanation, he stated that over sixty families in Minneapolis had authorized him to announce that they also were willing to colonize.</p>
   <p>Then the chairman called on Mr. [Vincent] Wrzesinski to report on his last trip <pb facs="5423968_4_1295.jpg" n="2"/>to northeastern Canada, where an American Mormon company had invited him in order to give an opinion as to whether that locality is good for Polish colonization purposes. Mr. Wrzesinski gave a brief description of the situation in these various localities--their climate, farming and economic conditions--and stated that the country there was suitable for farming, but only for those possessing large financial resources and able to raise cattle, horses and sheep on a large scale.....</p>
   <p>The terms for settlers were then discussed. Mr. Grzeskowiak made a motion that the terms be made easier for the farmers. The chairman assured him that his demand would be acted on as favorably as possible. Mr. Rakowski spoke in favor of planting beets. Mr. Rys suggested that no definite acreage be devoted to beets, but to leave this to the discretion of the farmer himself, and, furthermore, that there should be a guarantee against loss by the farmer in case the real-estate company should become bankrupt. The chairman assured him that the farmers could modify their contracts so as to allow them to pay in cash if the company should become bankrupt. Mr. Broel was of the opinion that certain <pb facs="5423968_4_1296.jpg" n="3"/>stipulations could be embodied in the contracts that would insure the farmers against loss of their farm investment. Mr. Sawicki inquired how much capital should a prospective farmer have, and the chairman explained that about five hundred dollars would be necessary, although a smaller amount might prove sufficient.</p>
   <p>After a few other speeches, the chairman adjourned the meeting. The next meeting will be held on Thursday, December 14, at seven in the evening, in the same hall.</p>
   <p>A committee will then be selected, which will make a trip to the lands in question and inspect them.</p>
