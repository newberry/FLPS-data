   <p>The work of developing Polish business and industry which has been taken up by the Poles during recent years despite enormous difficulties that have often arisen, has not been in vain as our enemies would have desired, but on the contrary, has been rewarded with the establishment of many Polish companies, corporations, and other business enterprises. Everyone who is interested in business can see this for himself, as can everyone who sees in Polish business the power that will rebuild our homeland from its present ashes and ruins, and the means by which we can assure ourselves of an important place amongst the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>In Saturday's issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, we acquainted our readers with the principal Polish business enterprises in Chicago. Today we shall write a few words about a Polish meat packing firm, of which it is possible not all of <pb facs="5423968_4_1685.jpg" n="2"/>our readers know. It would be well to add here that, according to our recently established custom, a reporter from this newspaper visited the firm personally, watched the processes of its work, and was given information as to its organization by the firm's officials.</p>
   <p>The Polish meat packing firm, known as the United Butchers Packing Company, is the sole Polish enterprise of its kind in Chicago. It is located on Fulton Street near Halsted Street, in a district dedicated exclusively to the fruit, vegetable, and meat products trade. It can be distinguished from the other buildings because it is larger and more conveniently located.</p>
   <p>Over its front door hangs a sign that reads, "United Butchers Packing Company". The smaller companies in the immediate vicinity are non-Polish--mostly German and Jewish. In their doorways one sees Jews, who do their best to attract Polish grocers. But the Polish grocer who has had several years of experience in the business always looks with contempt upon Jews, who try to sell inferior products for good money; instead, he deals with the Polish firm because he <pb facs="5423968_4_1686.jpg" n="3"/>knows that the meat there is kept under more sanitary conditions, and that he will be given honest weight and the best service.</p>
   <p>Upon entering the building that houses the Polish packing firm, grocers see a large stock of every kind of meat, including hams, sausages, at cetera. The exemplary cleanliness strikes the eye. Meats are kept in the refrigerator at a temperature of thirty-five degrees Fahrenheit. Slaughtered stock hangs on hooks and is numbered in the order in which it was slaughtered. Naturally, it is not slaughtered here, for the law does not permit that. Slaughtering is done at the world-famous stock yards, for which the firm pays a previously agreed upon price per animal. In another, somewhat smaller building of the firm, situated next door to the first, live fowl, supplied by the farmers in the vicinity of Chicago, are sold.</p>
   <p>Sausages and hams are produced on the first floor of the main building. Workers chop the meat, after which it passes to others who grind it to a mass in machines for this purpose, after which the meat is fed into carefully cleaned casings, <pb facs="5423968_4_1687.jpg" n="4"/>boiled, and sent to the refrigerator.</p>
   <p>The odor of meats prepared with vinegar permeates the entire building.</p>
   <p>There are not many Polish grocers in Chicago who do not buy hams, sausages, beef, and veal from this Polish firm. The firm delivers meat products to those grocers who cannot call at the warehouse themselves. The firm possesses a number of wagons and motor trucks for this purpose.</p>
   <p>According to the information given our reporter by one of the officers of the company, the firm has a considerable number of steady Polish customers. Non-Poles also buy meat products there quite often. From the figures supplied by the officer, sixty per cent of the firm's customers are Poles, and the remainder are tradesmen of other nationalities. Germans, Jews, Americans, Czechs, Italians, and others.</p>
   <p>After observing the manufacturing processes, our reporter interviewed the firm's <pb facs="5423968_4_1688.jpg" n="5"/>president, Jacob Sadowski, with respect to the company's financial standing and its prospects for the future. Sadowski gave detailed answers to all questions.</p>
   <p>"Our firm," said he, "was organized eight years ago. In organizing a packing company to compete with similar Jewish-owned enterprises, we knew that a continuous struggle with unfair practices awaited us. This did not frighten us at all, however, for we believed in the saying that Fortune favors the bold. We incorporated in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and, with faith in God, went to work. I will not attempt to describe all of our experiences. There were times when prospects were bright and cheerful, and again, there were times when everything was black and discouraging, as with every business enterprise.</p>
   <p>"Our business increased slowly. By supplying products of good quality and by dealing honestly with our customers, our firm earned a good name throughout the city. Today, it is firmly established. We do not regret that we entered the <pb facs="5423968_4_1689.jpg" n="6"/>struggle, and we would take every occasion to advise others to follow our example.</p>
   <p>"At present, we employ twenty-two people in the preparation and delivery of our products. We would not sell our business for $25,000. You can judge for yourself how good our business is from the fact that we have a daily volume of over three thousand dollars. On certain days of the week trade is much more brisk than on others.</p>
   <p>"Our corporation has twenty-two stockholders. One share of stock costs a hundred dollars, and each of the stockholders possesses several shares. Dividends, of which we cannot complain, are paid annually."</p>
   <p>The administration of the firm consists of: Jacob Sadowski, president; A. Kaczorowski, secretary; and W.Duzewski, treasurer. The board of directors <pb facs="5423968_4_1690.jpg" n="7"/>consists of: M. Najdowski, J. Sadowski, W. Duzewski, J. R. Zielinski, Anthony Suchonski, Joseph Mallek, M. Sadowski, J. Smieniewicz, and A. Kaczdrowski.</p>
   <p>Whoever desires further information concerning this Polish meat packing firm will find its administration always ready to answer any questions. The address is: United Butchers Packing Company, 33 Fulton Street. It can be reached by the Halsted street car line.</p>
