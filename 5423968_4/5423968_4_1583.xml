   <p>The recently organized Polish Business Men's Club in the neighborhood of St. Casimir's parish has played such an important part in the affairs of the locality that retailers are joining its ranks in order to garner some of the glory. The club is growing rapidly in membership and financial status. It is expected that within a few months all Polish merchants along Twenty-second Street will become members of this organization.</p>
   <p>To the Polish Business Men's Club belong the outstanding buyers, manufacturers, doctors, dentists, lawyers, pharmacists, etc. It is this banding together of outstanding professional men of this vicinity that not only added prestige to the club, but also is the drawing power that pulls new members to its fold. Their conscientious cooperation has made this newly organized association a success from the very beginning.</p>
