<title level="a">PLOT AFOOT AGAINST SOCIETIES</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Representative Barbour has introduced in the State legislature of Illinois a bill prohibiting the sale of liquor at social functions and excursions, regardless of whether they take place on Sundays, weekdays, or holidays.</p>
   <p>This is not only a plot against the personal liberty of the people of this country, but also a threat against the existence of fraternal aid societies, which strengthen their treasuries for aid to the sick by arranging social functions. This is the only source of income our societies have, an income without which they simply cannot exist.</p>
   <p>Protests should be made at once against this plot, which is against personal liberty and threatens the existence of our societies. The officers of Polish societies in Illinois should get together immediately and send protests to their district senators and representatives. We are giving here a protest form <pb facs="5423968_4_0930.jpg" n="2"/>in English which you can use:</p>
   <p>Place and date</p>
   <p>To the Honorable</p>
   <p>Name of Representative</p>
   <p>Springfield, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Sir: The Barbour Bill No. 281, which is now up for consideration by the House of Representatives, is a superfluous measure as far as the regulation of liquor traffic is concerned. It is a direct blow against the liberties so far enjoyed by organizations of a social character and threatens their very existence.</p>
   <p>Our society, an organization of (number of members) bona fide members, in existence since (give the length of existence) has always conducted its entertainments in an orderly manner, as prescribed by the laws of the State, and we <pb facs="5423968_4_0931.jpg" n="3"/>therefore ask you to lend your assistance to defeat the aforesaid proposed legislation.</p>
   <p>The various societies are the poor man's clubs and should be encouraged rather than antagonized in their efforts to provide recreation and innocent pleasure for their members and their families.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>(Signatures of the officers)</p>
   <p>(Seal of the Society)</p>
   <p>Societies, protect your rights and existence, because the danger is great!</p>
  </body>
