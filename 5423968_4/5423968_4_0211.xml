   <p>Washington, D. C., June 18, 1918.</p>
   <p>Henry Setmajer,</p>
   <p>1309 North Ashland Avenue,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>After weeks of painstaking and searching investigation of the activities of the K. O. N. and the principal leaders of that organization, the Military Intelligence Branch of the General Staff of the United States Army has formally advised the leaders to disband the organization immediately, or else to adopt resolutions in favor of, and to assist in the recruiting of the Polish Army. A notification of this decision has been sent to the attorney who appeared at Washington to defend the organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0212.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The officers of the Military Intelligence Branch of the General Staff of the United States Army, as a result of their investigations, have ruled that the organization is at least anti-Ally, and furthermore, that it has been doing work which substantially amounted to pro-German propaganda. It also established that, prior to the entry of the United States into the war, the organization was pro-German. Warning is also issued that the Government will not be trifled with, and that efforts to obstruct Polish Army recruiting and other Allied war aims will be promptly and vigorously dealt with.</p>
   <p>The investigation, which has been in progress for some time, was climaxed when K. O. N. leaders from New York appeared with counsel before the Intelligence Branch in Washington. The examination lasted for two hours, and the finding given above was the result. The United States officers reached their decision because of the anti-Allied attitude of these leaders as disclosed during the cross-examination, and because of the character of the resolutions adopted at the K. O. N. convention in Philadelphia in May, at which allegiance <pb facs="5423968_4_0213.jpg" n="3"/>was pledged to the Council of Regency in Poland, and because of their central opposition to the recruiting of the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>The United States officers held that, in as much as the Versailles Allied Declaration in favor of Poland made the Polish cause an Allied war aim, and in as much as the Polish Army opened a way to mobilize man power which would not otherwise be available, the opposition activities of these gentlemen were close to seditious and must be stopped. In the course of the examination, the letter from Secretary of War Baker to the Polish Associated Press endorsing the Polish Army was of large effect.</p>
   <p>Before the close of the hearing, the attorney, who was accompanied by the three men from New York, agreed with the conclusions of the military officers and so expressed himself. The issue which has been laid down is, in brief, that the K. O. N. must reverse itself and support the Polish Army, or disband.</p>
