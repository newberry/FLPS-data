   <p>Mr. Ladislas Sajewski was born in Congress, Poland, in 1873. He came to America in 1892, and five years later married Miss Helena Wykowska in St. John Cantius' Church, where he was at the time a very active parishioner.</p>
   <p>Since 1906 Mr. Sajewski has conducted a music store. Two of his sons, Edmund and Alvin, work with him in the store, while the third son, Alexander, is studying dentistry.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sajewski is regarded as one of the outstanding merchants in the Chicago Polonia. He is also known for his sincere willingness to relieve social wants; for instance, the musical club in the Polish college in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, is indebted to his generosity for its musical instruments and equipment. Children in the Polish orphanage of St. Hedwig will long remember him for his generous help in supplying their band and orchestra.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1563.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Sajewski was one of the organizers of St. John Cantius' parish as well as one of its first parishioners. Through his efforts the St. Casimir the King Society for youth was organized.</p>
   <p>For five years he lived in the Avondale section of our city, and since 1902 he has been living in Holy Trinity parish, where he is well known and well liked for his courtesy and his sincere, frank, happy disposition. He participates willingly in all patriotic affairs. In the bazaar held in the auditorium of the Polish Women's Alliance for the benefit of the victims of war in Poland he held the office of cashier.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sajewski has been a member of the Polish National Alliance for the last eighteen years. He was also one of the founders of the Polish Businessmen's Club and of the Polish Chamber of Commerce in Chicago. He is an active member of the Modern Woodmen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1564.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He has two sons besides those mentioned above and three daughters. He lives above his beautiful music store at 1017 Milwaukee Avenue. We must also mention that he has published a great deal of Polish sheet music and many Polish books. These works cover a wide range and are extensively used by Polish amateur dramatic clubs.</p>
