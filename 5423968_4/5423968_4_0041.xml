   <p>It is true that the streets of Chicago still remain dirty and full of mud and trash, that some of its buildings are falling apart and do not present an esthetic view, yet the city is cleaning up some of its other messes, messes which have detracted even more from it than the trash and the dead horses, cats, and dogs that often lie for days in the streets.</p>
   <p>At last action is being taken to purge the police department of those depraved guardians of the public safety who give protection to the owners of houses of prostitution, to the gamblers and to other dregs of society; who accept bribes wherever they can get them; who get drunk in the saloons even while on duty; who themselves gamble and visit houses of questionable reputation; who, finally, arrest and beat peaceful citizens while they leave <pb facs="5423968_4_0042.jpg" n="2"/>undisturbed the ordinary criminals with whom they live in accord, sharing in the loot obtained from the pedestrians.</p>
   <p>Of such dirt our city is cleaning itself! And when these dissolute and venal policemen are removed from the department and replaced with real guardians of the public safety, other kinds of dirt will be cleaned up. Then the number of robberies, murders, and attacks will decrease; the orgies that go on in horrible dance halls will cease; dens of iniquity will disappear, and gambling houses will cease to function.</p>
   <p>The practices now followed by the citizens of the Emerald Isle who have been provided with clubs, will be ended. They will no longer break open the heads of peaceful laborers who struggle legally for their existence, and exemplary order will reign at every step.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison has come to the conclusion that the state of affairs existing <pb facs="5423968_4_0043.jpg" n="3"/>in our city can no longer be tolerated. Besides, being showered from all sides with complaints and protests against the disorder and corruption of the police, it has not been difficult for him to determine where the seat of the evil lies, and he has hit the mark by setting after those policemen who are responsible for this state of disorder and corruption.</p>
   <p>The commission chosen by Mayor Harrison and the Chief of Police has been conducting investigations for the past few weeks, examining the complaints against policemen of higher rank and questioning witnesses. It is said that when the investigation is completed all the worst offenders will be dismissed. The commission, which is guided by justice and impartiality, is not after scapegoats among the ordinary policemen. It is after the larger fish, such as captains, inspectors, sergeants, and lieutenants, who may be found guilty of corruption.</p>
   <p>Chicago, then, is cleaning up. Let us hope that better order will be brought <pb facs="5423968_4_0044.jpg" n="4"/>in. After the dismissal of corrupt policemen, all sorts of dens of iniquity will be cleaned up, and the number of crimes will decline.</p>
   <p>Up to now no one could be sure of his life and property even in broad daylight. The Mayor will be doing a great deal for the inhabitants of Chicago and will deserve their esteem, if he will be able to clean up completely this state of affairs and remove other filth, of which there is not lack here.</p>
