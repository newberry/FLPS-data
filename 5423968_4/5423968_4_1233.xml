   <p>Representatives of all Polish women's organizations, as well as all Polish women who occupy a prominent position in the national movement, met on January 14, 1915, at the Polish National Alliance Hall. Among the more outstanding leaders present at this meeting were Mrs. Anna Neumann, Miss Emily Napieralski, and Mrs. Lucille Wolowski, president, secretary and treasurer, respectively of the Polish Women's Alliance; Mrs. Marie Osuch, and Mrs. Frances Czata, vice-president and director respectively of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Mrs. Obarski, Mrs. Sakowski, and Mrs. W. Chodzinska, of the Polish National Alliance; Mrs. Lillian Kadow, of the Polish Welfare Society; Mrs. Victoria Szymanski, Mrs. F. Dankowski, Mrs. Martha Petkowski, and Mrs. W. Wleklinski, of the Polish Women's Central Society; Mrs. W. Danisch, Mrs. Harriet Smulski, Mrs. Rosalie Kwasigroch, Mrs. Agnes Nehring, Mrs. Harriet Fritsch, Mrs. Pearl Dyniewicz, Mrs. A. Hibner, Mrs. A Busch, Mrs. Valorie Perlowski, Mrs. Helen Setmajer, and Mrs. Clara Plucinski, of the Polish Falcons Alliance; Mrs. Josephine Zembal, Mrs. Magdalene Milewski, <pb facs="5423968_4_1234.jpg" n="2"/>and Mrs. Jeanette Dunin, editor of the Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy; Mrs. Helen Szymanski, and Mrs. Adelle Ryll.</p>
   <p>The Foresters' organization was represented by Mrs. Anna Korzeniewski. There were also numerous women delegates from branches of the Polish National Alliance and from the Polish Women's Alliance. In short, it is estimated that about two hundred prominent Polish women were present at the meeting.</p>
   <p>Others present were Mr. [A.] Majewski, Mr. Orlowski, and Mr. Graczykowski, president, secretary, and treasurer, respectively, of the Central Tag Day Committee; Mr. J. P. Szymanski, president of the Holy Trinity Parish branch of the Polish National Alliance; Mr. Stanley Lesner, of the St. Adalbert Parish branch; Mr. [F.] Poruczek, of the St. Hedwig Parish branch; and Mr. John F. Smulski, chairman of the board of directors of the Northwest Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>After a cordial greeting by Mr. Majewski, president of the Central Tag Day <pb facs="5423968_4_1235.jpg" n="3"/>Committee, the election of officers followed and Mrs. Harriet Smulski was the unanimous choice for the presidency. Anna Neuman, Marie Osuch, Mrs. Obarski, Mrs. Chodzinski, and Victoria Szymanski were elected vice-president; Mrs. J. Dunin was elected secretary.</p>
   <p>The following women were named members of the committee: Mrs. J. Smulski, Evelyn Hibner, M. Sakowski, W. Danisch, H. Fritsch, Czaja, Roth, Adelle Ryll, A. Nehring, A. Hibner, E. Napieralski, and Gorecki.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy but interesting discussion, the gathering decided unanimously to send the following plea to all Polish women in America:</p>
   <p>"An Appeal to Polish Women</p>
   <p>"The horrible news that reaches us from the fields of old Poland, where battles have been raging for the past several months, fills our hearts with indescribable anguish. It has become almost impossible to read the newspapers because <pb facs="5423968_4_1236.jpg" n="4"/>of so many touching details that tell of the thousands of our brethren who have perished in battle, of the tens of thousands of wounded, of our Polish peasantry dying of hunger, of infants slowly dying on the laps of their despairing mothers because of lack of milk and other immediate necessities of life.</p>
   <p>"Now that we have succeeded in obtaining a permit from the mayor of Chicago to conduct two tag days on January 23 and 24 in order to collect contributions from homes throughout the entire city for the relief of our brethren, for the rehabilation of the ruined homes of our people abroad, to dry the tears of the unfortunate, we should get to work energetically, appearing in large numbers on the tag days and giving our best efforts to this worthy and honorable cause.</p>
   <p>"We therefore call upon you, Polish women, to forget your personal differences and arguments; we urge you to stand together in peaceful, mutual, and diligent work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1237.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Hunger and death do not distinguish between their victims in our motherland; consequently, neither should we now have differences when our national work is concerned. Every Polish woman should consider it an honor to do her part in collecting contributions, if health and circumstances permit her to do so.</p>
   <p>"All right-thinking Polish women are urged to enroll at the Polish Women's Alliance, the Polish Women's Central Society, the neighborhood committees, or the Central Tag Day Committee.</p>
   <p>"Special announcements will direct you to the addresses, and a good heart will direct you to them immediately, dear sisters.</p>
   <p>"Let us not request great formalities in invitations. The misery of our brethren begs for a little effort and civic zeal on our part, and that for only two days. Let us stand as a brave Polish army on these two days, and and contribute our share in alleviating the misery and sorrow of our brethren <pb facs="5423968_4_1238.jpg" n="6"/>in Poland and thus be instrumental in our motherland's resurrection.</p>
   <p>Harriet Smulski, president of the Polish Women's Committee</p>
   <p>Anna Neumann, president of the Polish Women's Alliance</p>
   <p>Victoria Szymanski, vice-president of the Polish Women's Central Society</p>
   <p>Marie Osuch, vice-president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union</p>
   <p>Jeannette Dunin, secretary"</p>
