   <p>The public is fully aware of present conditions and the importance of American agriculture; and is amazed at the indifferent attitude of the United States Congress. Statistics pertaining to agriculture, collected by the Department of Commerce, prove unquestionably that agricultural activities, instead of increasing, are gradually decreasing, and, that with the continual increase in population, America will find herself in a grave situation if some remedy is not found in the near future.</p>
   <p>For example, let us take the State of Louisiana, where statistics are complete. In the last five years, the total farm population in this state has been decreased by 90,000 people. In the same period, the mortgage debts with which the farmers have been burdened, have increased $10,000.000, while the farmlands value are but $2,000,000, Lousiana differs from other southern states which depend on cotton raising, because it possesses vast sugar-beet plantations, it has rich soil, and is noted for its rice and tobacco growing, from which a prosperous industry has been developed. However, if agricultural activities decrease in a state like Louisiana, then what are conditions in other agricultural states. Congress displays malicious irony toward this important situation. Manufacturers receive $4,000,000,000 annually for tariff protection.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1271.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Financiers of banks established a solid foundation by creating the Federal Reserve System; railroads have the assurance of a large profit, through the passage of the Esch-Cummins bill; merchant marine companies gained monopoly of transporation on American waters; various laws and limitations of immigration were intended to improve labor conditions; and states desiring to improve their roads, can secure the aid of our government.</p>
   <p>Agriculture is the most important branch of industry; but yet in spite of its great importance it seeks aid in vain. Every proposed law, designated to increase agriculture created an objection, that points to an economic vision, that is unhealthy, unconstitutional and impractical. Perhaps agriculture would be surrounded with the protection it has earned, if farmers would unite, and organize, as, for example, the manufacturers do. Our practical employers take in consideration the power, that may build or destroy their interests; finding themselves secure under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, they do not concern themselves over the possibility of a great shortage of agricultural products, which would eventually, necessitate the purchase of such products from abroad.</p>
