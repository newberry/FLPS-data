   <p>Tomorrow will mark the 138th year since the thirteen American colonies renounced their political allegiance to Great Britain and proclaimed their freedom and independence by the so called Declaration of Independence, adopted on the fourth day of July, 1776. The thirteen Colonies were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
   <p>The war between the American colonies and England had a very sympathetic echo in Europe; numerous prominent leaders and soldiers hastened across the ocean to offer their weapons, blood, and life to the defense of the new country. Among such were Tadeusz Kosciuszko and Kazimierz Pulaski. Pulaski sacrificed his life at Savannah, in the state of Georgia. Kusciuszko was the spirit of <pb facs="5423968_4_1121.jpg" n="2"/>the entire colonial war, giving inestimable services to the new nation as engineer, building intrenchments and forts which exist until to-day (West Point), and which give testimony to the genius of our national hero and his commander-in-chief.</p>
   <p>Every year the inhabitants of the United States celebrate the Fourth of July as the day of independence of this blooming and highly developed country.</p>
