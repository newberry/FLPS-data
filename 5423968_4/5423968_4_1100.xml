   <p>The picture of Poland as a land of freemen surrounded by autocracies should not vanish from the mind of the student. For here we find the explanation why the Pole, after scores of years under foreign autocratic rule, is an indomitable lover of liberty--the eternal freeman. Often an American student of Polish history, looking over the old history of Poland, will find that all the inhabitants of that land were not strictly free. Some of the lower classes lived in bondage, and in Lithuania in the early centuries, slavery was known. The republic was a republic of nobles, or "Szlachta," not a republic based on universal suffrage.</p>
   <p>But we Americans all regard the Declaration of Independence as a genuine document of liberty, as the monumental record of a free people's freedom. We all know that the Declaration was written by a slaveholder, Thomas Jefferson; that the general of the American armies who became the president of the Constitutional Convention and the first President was a slaveholder, George Washington.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1101.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And all the free peoples of the world look back with thrilling hearts to the dawn of a certain June morning a Runnymede on the Thames, in the year of 1215. There we know that the barons of England with their armed forces, christened as the army of God and the church, forced King John to sign the Magna Charta. And we still regard that Magna Charta as a priceless treasure, a safeguard of liberty, though the barons who signed it were feudal barons whose lands were tilled by serfs. And we are not wrong in cherishing the Magna Charta. We are not wrong in revering the Declaration of Independence. The great leaders of the Army of God and church were believers in liberty. They made as bold and as great a stroke for liberty as they could. They established forever the status of freemen, the principles of justice, and all that later generations had to do was to extend to all classes the rights gained by the Great Charter.</p>
   <p>The greater leaders of the Continental Congress were believers in liberty. When the movement for the abolition of slavery was started, its leaders drew great words of inspiration from declarations by the founders of the republic, even from men who held slaves. The founders of the American republic-- <pb facs="5423968_4_1102.jpg" n="3"/>Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Jay, Marshall, Madison, Adams--all perceived that the logic of the Declaration of Independence meant the removal of this national inconsistency of African slavery.</p>
   <p>It was the spirit of freedom triumphant in English hearts on that June morning in Runnymede that made possible all the later advances, made possible the Commonwealth of Cromwell and the steady expansion of freedom. It was a spirit of freedom in American hearts which expressed itself in the Declaration and later in the great moral crusade which culminated in the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
   <p>Both the Pole of today and the outside admirer of the Polish historic spirit knows that the old Kingdom-Republic was less free than the Republic of Paderewski will be. But the Pole knows also, with a proud realization, that the great principles of his forefathers are to be the principles of the new Republic. The outside student of Polish history must recognize with reverence <pb facs="5423968_4_1103.jpg" n="4"/>that the old Kingdom-Republic did establish some of the same principles of liberty which are more precious than life to the subjects of Great Britain or the citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>The spirit of freedom was in the Polish constitution and in the very fundamentals of the Polish political structure. It was limited, now and then, by growing institutions and the pressure of outside nations. But Poland was never feudalized into small and large lordships like France and Spain. Poland never had a nobleman who could be called a kingmaker, like the irresistible Earl of Warwick who first enthroned and then dethroned Edward IV. All the members of the nobility were kingmakers, for all voted on the kingship; but none could enthrone a king over the rest, for that king could have no title unless it was bestowed on him by the votes of the nobles.</p>
   <p>And who were these nobles? They were not dukes and earls and counts and barons in carefully arranged ranks. The writers on Polish history had difficulty in explaining the character of the Polish nobility until a German, Von Moltke, <pb facs="5423968_4_1104.jpg" n="5"/>wrote a cold but illuminating study of the destroyed republic. Von Moltke, himself an imperialist, saw clearly that the Polish principle was the principle of the freeman. "Poland," he exclaims, "preserved down to the nineteenth century the old social organization of the Goths and the Kelts where all freemen were noble and all noblemen were equal." He remarks also as a military authority that the Polish army was an army not of soldiers, but of knighthood. He dwells on the great military achievements of the Polish horsemen and the comparative smallness of the infantry in the early Polish wars. Thus in Poland nobility did not mean a great castle and immense fields. It merely meant freedom. The nobles were men who were not the subjects of any other man. They were neither serfs nor slaves. They might be rich, very rich owners of plains and villages, or they might be poor, even penniless. But poor or rich, holding vast lands or holding nothing, all were equal.</p>
   <p>Each had one vote in the Diet. Each had one vote in the election of the king. Each had the same rank. Each felt himself the peer of any prince in Europe. And the plainest man outside the "Szlachta" class might be raised to that rank <pb facs="5423968_4_1105.jpg" n="6"/>for bravery. There were whole villages of nobles, and in one heroic story a regiment was made noble for a heroic deed.</p>
   <p>These principles were the principles of no small group. The nobles were much more numerous than the nobility of any other land. At one royal election 300,000 male adults voted. As centuries elapsed and greater principles of liberty grew in the Polish hearts, and after the fierce struggles for liberation came, the Polish thinkers sought for principles of liberty and found them in the rights of the Polish nobility.</p>
