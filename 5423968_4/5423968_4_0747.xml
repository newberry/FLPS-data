   <p>While the greatest war in the history of mankind is raging in Europe, while day after day the death-bearing shots of artillery fire wipe the existence of thousands of human beings off the surface of the earth, Uncle Sam, with the playful smile of an old and experienced merchant hunting for new customers, strokes his beard and conducts a bloodless war for the purpose of securing new markets for American industry.</p>
   <p>To the accompaniment of European cannons whole mobs of agents of all sorts of factories and manufacturing firms are running about South America trying to oust German and English industry from their position of dominance.</p>
   <p>The Germans, who considered themselves the actual masters of commerce in the other half of America (and who in reality were the masters), have no inkling of the extent of the losses which they suffer day after day at the hands of <pb facs="5423968_4_0748.jpg" n="2"/>people whose only weapon is a pencil and an order book.</p>
   <p>All branches of America's powerful industry have declared war on the well-known label "Made in Germany" and have determined to place banners with the inscription "Made in United States" throughout South America.</p>
   <p>It appears that we shall not be false prophets if we forecast victory for the United States along the entire line, although it may be only for a limited time.</p>
   <p>We shall not be disloyal Poles when we wish the United States this victory with all our hearts. Since South America seems incapable of producing her own large industry and must be dependent on other countries, then let the United States be this producer, not Germany.</p>
   <p>That our deductions are correct and that our wishes have a realistic basis <pb facs="5423968_4_0749.jpg" n="3"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/> <pb facs="5423968_4_0750.jpg" n="4"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/> <pb facs="5423968_4_0751.jpg" n="5"/>long as her commerce and industry do not return to normalcy, she will be America's customer instead of being purveyor of exquisite products and the worst sort of junk stamped "Made in Germany".</p>
   <p>Therefore, if the United States is able to develop its industry sufficiently it will be able, for a considerable period of time, to be the provider of South America, Europe, and almost the entire world.</p>
   <p>Whether the United States will be able to meet this exigency is, however, another matter.</p>
   <p>If the past standards of Uncle Sam's economic politics are to continue, we cannot even dream of the conquest of so large a market. The United States must change her politics if she wishes to do anything to benefit her people. Party quarrles, petty politics, and battles for jobs and lucrative sine-cures <pb facs="5423968_4_0752.jpg" n="6"/>must give way to capable economic administration of colossal magnitude.</p>
   <p>Large industrialists must then accept the principle that the victory of United States industry does not depend on the amassing of millions by individuals but on the economic well-being of all of the people.</p>
   <p>Uncle Sam can hope to exert world-wide economic influence only when all people have the right to economic benefit and when all people in the country see that their interest lies in the development of this influence.</p>
   <p>This is not only the prerequisite to achieving the goal but the goal itself, because only when it is reached will the constantly fomenting dissatisfaction and the feeling of injustice be removed from the labor sphere.</p>
   <p>The war will not pass over the laboring masses without an echo, because they, too, will see in it the renewal and reform of the old world.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0753.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>
    <gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/>

   <p>Advantages and privileges should be granted the newcomers. We should not push away from America's shores those who would contribute muscular strength to help American industry conquer the label "Made in Germany".</p>
   <p>In considering the immigration question, one must not forget that as soon as the war is over feverish work will be begun to bring industry back to its former stage of development. Then the battle for laborers will begin and Europe may sharpen her emigration laws in order to prevent laborers from leaving to enrich America.</p>
   <p>European industry will suffer great losses through the war and will remain in a state of lethargy a long time after it; but it will not lay down its arms. After the war the industrial battle will rage along the entire line and America may be opposed by a commercial tariff alliance of all of Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0757.jpg" n="11"/>
   <p>Then why renew now some sort of anti-immigration bill and be taken in by the shortsighted chauvinistic agitation of the American Federation of labor.</p>
