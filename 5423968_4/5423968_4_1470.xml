   <p>In December, 1930 a group of Polish grocers got together in order to discuss the means and find the way to meet the competition of chain stores. The competition of the chain stores was showing its deadly effect and the future or the independent grocers was at stake.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that one of the principal reasons why the independent grocers could not make any profits was that they, buying individually, had to pay too nigh prices to the wholesale grocers for goods. During the discussion it was decided that in order to be equal to the present conditions, new methods of conducting the business, based on sound economic principles, should be adopted.</p>
   <p>Several meetings had been held before it was finally decided to follow a <pb facs="5423968_4_1471.jpg" n="2"/>constructive plan by buying cooperatively at wholesale and by using the same method of retail selling.</p>
   <p>The plan was put into effect by incorporating, in January 1931, a wholesale grocery, Midwest Grocery Company, while the name of Midwest Stores was given to stores owned by independent grocers belonging to the Midwest Grocery Company.</p>
   <p>The Midwest Grocery Company is owned by the members, each owning 20 shares of stock, the profits on which are paid in form of rebates on goods bought from the wholesale house.</p>
   <p>The administrative offices are located in the wholesale house. Midwest Stores is the name given to stores owned by the members of Midwest Grocery Company. In order to give an identity to stores belonging to the cooperative, it was agreed that the exterior, and if possible the interior, of the stores should present similar appearance. The signs of the stores are alike and are painted orange. There should be at least two blocks between two Midwest Stores.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1472.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This business venture proved to be an immediate success. In the first five months of its existence the business of the wholesale house reached the $400,000 mark. But the business of the member grocers showed also a remarkable improvement. The increase of business of individual stores in the first months was from 10% up and in one case it was as much as 320% within one month.</p>
   <p>The members of the cooperative hold the meetings once a month, when the president of the cooperative presents a detailed report for the last month. Taking part in these meetings are the representatives of large manufacturing concerns, offering either suggestions for conducting the business, or planning sales and advertising campaigns.</p>
   <p>In order to stimulate the business an extensive advertising campaign is being conducted. Every week at least 110,000 circulars are distributed to homes in the neighborhood of Midwest Stores, announcing the weekly sale. Every Friday a half page ad is placed in three Polish, one Bohemian, one Lithuanian and one English paper (The Daily Times). The radio is also being used to advertise the <pb facs="5423968_4_1473.jpg" n="4"/>weekly sales. The business is conducted on a strictly cash basis.</p>
   <p>There are certain rules governing the members of this organization. Every member agrees to buy everything for his store from the Midwest Grocery Company; the members must also agree to sell certain specified products at the price set by the wholesale house for the weekly sales. The sales list is sent to every store a few days before the day set for the big sale. Each member must contribute $2 per week for advertising expenses.</p>
   <p>The members of the cooperative has a right to seel his store, but the membership in the cooperative is dependent on the decision of the organization. When a member sells his store and the new owner does not care to conduct a Midwest Store, the price of membership in the cooperative is returned.</p>
   <p>The policy of the cooperative is based on the simple principle of truth in advertising, high quality of goods, and low prices.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1474.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There are 362 Midwest Stores belonging to the Midwest Grocery Company. The business of the wholesale house is growing so fast that the present quarters have become too small.</p>
   <p>The new quarters were bought for $350,000, covering 41/2 acres, where 21 railroad cars can be unloaded at the same time, while in the present location only four cars can be handled at the same time. This new warehouse will be the largest warehouse used by a cooperative grocery organization.</p>
   <p>All products sold in grocery stores are handled by the wholesale house, except milk.</p>
   <p>The amount of business done by the wholesale in 1936 was about $2,750,000.</p>
   <p>The officers of the organization are: Mr. A. Janik, President; Mr. Joseph Skowronski, Secretary, and Mr. Stanislaus Dunin, Advertising Manager. They have been with the organization from its very beginning and have contributed <pb facs="5423968_4_1475.jpg" n="6"/>to the growth of the organization more than any other members of the administrative board.</p>
   <p>The offices of the Midwest Grocery Company are located at 2434 S. Western Avenue.</p>
