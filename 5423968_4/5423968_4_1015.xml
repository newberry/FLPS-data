   <p>Because of the murderous attack by an anarchist upon the life of the Chicago chief of police, much has been said and written in the last few days about freedom of speech.</p>
   <p>Special attention was drawn to the case of Emma Goldman, well-known anarchist agitator, who demanded her right to speak publicly in Chicago. This right, however, was denied to Miss Goldman because of the public's demand that police stop all public speaking on street corners.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, public opinion is against policemen depriving the people of their constitutional rights, and threats have been made that this right will be protected cost what it may, police or no police.</p>
   <p>Freedom of speech is a precious acquisition won after centuries of hard <pb facs="5423968_4_1016.jpg" n="2"/>struggle and many sacrifices and should, therefore, be jealously guarded and protected against even the smallest violation.</p>
   <p>It is indeed unjust to put the stain of crime in the hands of a worthy cause. Many as have been the crimes committed in the name of freedom, its principles remain unchanged. The same is true of religion; yet it remains beautiful as always.</p>
   <p>We should, therefore, maintain the proper attitude toward freedom of speech and realize that it is not necessary to abolish or restrict it because of a few individuals who are against it.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, free speech at street corners, halls, and other places should not be barred merely because some one may say something opposed to our individual views. Besides, such restriction of free speech is unconstitutional. Rather than condemn free speech, we should see that <pb facs="5423968_4_1017.jpg" n="3"/>no abuses are committed against it by people who look at human rights from their own side of the fence.</p>
   <p>Every civilized country has laws against abuse of free speech. To incite others to commit a crime is an abuse of free speech. If there is no law against these abuses, one should be enacted. Such law should be worded so as to point out very clearly what is the limit in free speech, so that we may determine what constitutes a violation. Because of the absence of a more specific law, absolute freedom of speech is implied.</p>
   <p>Let us use common sense in all actions and remain within the boundaries of the law. We should, therefore, not limit the rights of citizens just because we think that some one might abuse us.</p>
