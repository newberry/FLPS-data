<title level="a">HUGE MASS MEETING AT ST. ADALBERTS PARISH</title></bibl>

   <p>Through the efforts of Mr. S. Krzywonos, the well-known Polish army organizer, a huge mass meeting was held on Thrusday, August 15, 1918, at Pulaski Hall. The meeting was held for the benefit of the Polish army. The hall was filled to overflowing. This may be attributed to the zealous work of Mr. Krzywonos. He, together with several recruiting officers, helped to make the affair a success by giving to it wide publicity.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a success in every respect. The program as presented by Messrs. B. Rybowiak, M. Domanowski, and S. Kujawski and Mmes. Wanda Paczkowska, Sadowska-Zaja, and C. Kulczycka helped to contribute to the success of this affair, and the orchestra under the baton of Hibner added to the impressive effect. This orchestra is ever willing to contribute its efforts voluntarily and without remuneration when a Polish cause is concerned. Public recognition is hereby given to all the participants who have so willingly contributed their time and their efforts to making the success of this affair a reality.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0164.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The songs and the other musical numbers unquestionably contributed to the variety of the program. The most impressive factor of the entire evening was the speech of Mr. S. Krzywonos. Despite his hoarseness, the result of numerous previous engagements in behalf of the Polish cause, he talked during the intermission of the program. He was the sole speaker of the mass meeting. We firmly believe that after Mr. Krzywonos' speech St. Adalbert's parish will awaken and renew its efforts to supply recruits for the Polish army. Thus far this parish has been remiss in supplying its proper quota of volunteers.</p>
   <p>Those who were present at the mass meeting have promised to co-operate with Mr. Krzywonos in his organization work. In view of the enthusiasm that prevailed at the meeting it can be said that the Polish army will gain a considerable number of new recruits. This action will assure a strong military force for the Polish cause. It must be remembered that the stronger the Polish army becomes, the sooner will a free and independent Poland become a reality--a Poland with free access to the sea.</p>
   <p>An appeal is therefore made to all Poles living in the vicinity of St. Adalbert's <pb facs="5423968_4_0165.jpg" n="3"/>parish to concentrate their efforts to gain as large a number of volunteers for the Polish army as possible. It is certain that should any assistance in that direction be needed, Mr. Krzywonos will do everything necessary.</p>
