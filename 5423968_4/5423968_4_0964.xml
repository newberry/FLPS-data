Gompers declares further, not without reason, that paying workers a pension only after they have reached the age of sixty-five or seventy is unfair, because only a very small percentage of workers attain that age, and those who do attain it will not enjoy their pensions very long. A laborer born out with hard physical labor becomes unfit for strenuous work by the time he has reached the age of fifty; besides, a person who has worked hard for society for thirty-five years deserves a rest, and should cede his place to a younger and stronger person.</p>
   <p>The injustice on the part of the employers, which Gompers brings to our attention, is illustrated by the fact that the companies which have adopted the pension system refuse to hire laborers who have reached the age of forty, even though they are strong and healthy. The railroad companies will not hire men over thirty-five, which is villanous, because one cannot sentence a laborer of this age to poverty and death from starvation. This will be the issue between labor and capital, and we trust that organized laborers will know how to defend their rights and will not suffer their fellow workers to be mistreated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0969.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The matter of adopting a pension in the entire country is widely discussed among labor groups, and sooner or later this project must become an actuality. Organized labor will surely look after its business in Washington, and see to it that no injustice is perpetrated against Government employees in any branch of service.</p>
