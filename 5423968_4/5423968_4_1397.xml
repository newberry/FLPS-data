   <p>We are notifying our readers that Mr. E. Zolkowski, director of the Palatine corporation, has opened his own law office. Mr. Zolkowski received his business training at Northwestern University and his legal training at the Lincoln College of Law. After finishing the law course and passing the state examination the received in February 1920, a license to practice law in Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zolkowski worked for several years as bookkeeper and notary public in the real estate department of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, and for five years he was employed as an auditor and statistician by the State Public Utilities Commission and by the Department of Roads and Communications of the State of Illinois. In the World War he served in the American Army.</p>
   <p>For several years he was office manager for the Palatine motor bus corporation, the main office of which was moved last year from New York to Chicago. As secretary and treasurer of this corporation he had contributed very much to <pb facs="5423968_4_1398.jpg" n="2"/>the solid foundation of a motor bus corporation in Poland which operates at present sixty busses.</p>
   <p>The fact that Mr. Zolkowski is a public accountant with several years' practice and is an expert in real estate, corporation, and federal income tax law makes him an excellent legal and business counsellor for Polish businessmen and industrialists especially in matters having to do with taxes, since frequently one can save a considerable sum of money by properly filling out the income tax report.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zolkowski conducts a general law practice. He receives his clients in his downtown office, 29 South La Salle Street, Room 1040, daily from 9 to 12 A.M. In the afternoon, from 2 to 5, he may be found in the building of the Palatine corporation, 1521-1525 Haddon Avenue. For the convenience of those who are employed during the day his office is open Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday from 6 to 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>
