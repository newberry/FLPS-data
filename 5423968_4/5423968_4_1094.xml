<title level="a">FATHER OF THE FOURTH JEFFERSON, THE TRUE FRIEND OF LIBERTY AND THE ENEMY OF ALL FORMS OF DESPOTISM</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The father of this country is George Washington, but the father of the Fourth of July is Thomas Jefferson.</p>
   <p>Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence the fourth of July, 1776. Forever thereafter that day was and will be the Glorious Fourth. The Declaration of Independence was a special plea for the rights of the individual. The whole life of Thomas Jefferson was a protest against the old time tyranny which sought to limit the development and action of individual man. Jefferson loved liberty and despised despotism. He was the principal pioneer of democracy in all the world. On this account all that he did and said an wrote, his manner of living and working, his home and his surroundings, are of interest to the world.</p>
   <p>So far as real human interest goes, the home of Jefferson was and is more <pb facs="5423968_4_1095.jpg" n="2"/>fruitful of entertaining anecdotes and reminiscenses than the home of Washington. Both homes are in Virginia. Jefferson's home, which he called Monticello, shares with Mount Vernon the reverence and homage of Americans who have inherited the priceless blessings of republican government, for which Washington fought with his sword and Jefferson with his pen.</p>
   <p>Monticello is one of America's shrines of pilgrimage. The house shown below is three miles from the town of Charlotteville, Albemarle County, 115 miles from Washington. Fewer persons visit it because it is much more remote from the main traveled roads than is Mount Vernon, almost within sight of the national capital.</p>
   <p>At Monticello Jefferson lived nearly sixty years. Within a stone's throw he spent his entire life, for he was born on the estate, and though he was absent for several years in France as American minister, and for eight years as President of the United States, and while holding other offices, that was always his home. He loved it above all other spots on earth, from <pb facs="5423968_4_1096.jpg" n="3"/>the cradle to the grave. There his cradle was rocked and there his grave was made, when after eighty-three years of labor for the rights of man he died on the Fourth of July, exactly fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It was given to him to experience half a century of the fruits of his own efforts toward a more equitable form of government, something new to human society.</p>
   <p>History of Monticello</p>
   <p>In 1769 Jefferson began the construction of his mansion on the mountain above Charlottesville. On New Year's day of 1772 he took thither his bride, the beautiful young widow, Mrs. Skelton, whose husband, Bathurst Skelton had died when she was in her nineteenth year, leaving her a considerable fortune. She was about twenty-three when Jefferson married her. Mrs. Jefferson was a singularly beautiful woman, with auburn hair to match the red looks of her famous husband. She lived only about ten years after her second marriage.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1097.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Jefferson never took another wife. His daughter was the mistress of Monticello and likewise the mistress of the executive mansion when Jefferson was President of the United States. Jefferson survived his wife by 44 years.</p>
   <p>For the last 50 years of his life Jefferson was hopelessly insolvent. From time to time his precious estate and home were in imminent danger of being sold over his head. His debts were due to various causes.</p>
   <p>For one thing he put his name on notes for friends and was held responsible for large sums. Then he was an extravagant entertainer. His house was perhaps the most commodious and manorlike in America. He was famous on two continents. Every person of distinction who came from Europe to visit the United States made Monticello his chief objective. He must see the "Sage." It cost the "Sage" money, of course.</p>
   <p>The chambers occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson are most interesting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1098.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Jefferson, a radical in all things, a progressive in an age that was not particularly progressive, had ideas of his own with regard to household furniture. Heretofore people had slept in massive, cumbersome beds with great posts or frames at the foot and head. Jefferson changed this for himself and his wife. He built two rooms connected by a wide archway. In this archway he placed the Jeffersonian bed, which was merely a large couch of simple design minus the unnecessary foot and head work. The bed closed up the archway, there being no other communication between the two rooms. In one of the chambers Mrs. Jefferson made her boudoir. In the other Thomas Jefferson studied and wrote. When Mrs. Jefferson was ready to retire she disrobed in her boudoir and climbed into the bed from her side. When Mr. Jefferson sought the refreshment of Morpheus, he disrobed in his study and climbed into the bed from his side. It was all very handy.</p>
   <p>Jefferson's Monument</p>
   <p>The epitath on the original monument over Jefferson's grave was written <pb facs="5423968_4_1099.jpg" n="6"/>by Jefferson himself. It reads: "Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and Father of the University of Virginia." It thus appears that Jefferson was more proud of these three achievements than of being President of the United States, as he does not even mention the latter distinction.</p>
   <p>From a hilltop near Monticello one may see the birthplaces of three men whose work and wisdom added to the United States nearly one half of its present territory on this continent. These men were: Jefferson, George Rogers Clark, and Merriwither Lewis. Through the efforts of Clark, the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and part of Michigan were added to our domain. Merriwither Lewis, with a younger brother of George Rogers Clark, was sent by Jefferson on the famous trip of exploration and discovery which many years later resulted in giving Uncle Sam the title to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
