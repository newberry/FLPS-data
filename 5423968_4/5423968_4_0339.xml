   <p>The Polish press will support the Third Liberty Loan of the United States and will conduct a campaign to sell as many bonds as possible. Such a resolution was taken up by The Polish Press Club in Chicago at a meeting held on March 27th. On that day in the hall of the Polish Press CLub a meeting of the members was hed at which it was considered upon to carry on an energetic propaganda with the aim of helping the United States government to sell as many Third Liberty Loan bonds as possible. It was resolved that all the Polish dailies and weeklies in Chicago, as well as those outside of Chicago, should begin a most energetic agitation, so as the readers would buy liberty bonds and help in this way the American government and the Allies in winning the war.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved to send the following telegram to the Secretary of the Treasury, William McAdoo:</p>
   <p>Hon. Wm. G. McAdoo</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D. C.</p>
