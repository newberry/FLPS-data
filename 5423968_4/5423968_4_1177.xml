   <p>Some people claim that there is no longer a "married women's problem", but that there remains a girls' and widows' problem as far as their places in business and professional fields are concerned. But the important point is that women are employed, and that they must continue in employment; because of this parents should prepare their daughters as well as their sons for some useful work.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget, however, that it is not yet fifty years since woman has begun to take this part in the struggle for existence. To be sure, there were women in the past who supported themselves, but they were exceptions, not the general rule.</p>
   <p>All[married]women, girls, and widows who are now employed on a par with men, <pb facs="5423968_4_1178.jpg" n="2"/>either at home or outside of home, whose work takes up all of their time and thoughts, need someone to provide them comfort at home just as employed men do. For example, could this or that young girl do the difficult work of a teacher or an artist if she did not have a loving mother at home to see that she was properly fed, and so on? Could this or that married woman or widow, who has been forced to seek employment, perform her duties conscientiously if she did not have someone at home to take her place with the children and to manage the household?</p>
   <p>Naturally, there are good and conscientious "substitute mothers", but what with the present day desire for "freedom", there are not many such women. And it must be added that women only in the rarest cases, as, for instance, famous artists, authors, or singers, earn enough money to satisfy all the demands of a governess. In most cases we find the mother of the working woman acting as her helper and substitute. No one else in her place, even though she is often advanced in years, would take upon herself the entire <pb facs="5423968_4_1179.jpg" n="3"/>management of the home, nor would they conduct it so economically as one's own mother. Then too, no one else would give the children the same care as a grandmother gives her grandchildren, and no one else but the mother would shield her daughter so carefully from the daily domestic cares. Instead of spending her declining years peacefully and quietly in "grandmother's room", she is aging amid the troubles of everyday life because her daughter who works for a living has other duties. And in spite of this, she is only a secondary figure in the household. She is a help and a support in the home, but first place belongs to the daughter, especially if that daughter is "famous." Very few people, when paying homage to such a "famous" daughter, think of how much she owes to her mother--that "old woman of bygone years" who never was anything but a mother and a housewife. And the daughters, whether they are geniuses or just average working women, forget too, how much their mothers mean to them. Nobody talks about it.</p>
   <p>"The household is conducted by Mother!" Naturally, it is understood that it could not be otherwise. But it must not be forgotten that beside this working <pb facs="5423968_4_1180.jpg" n="4"/>mother, a new generation of working women is growing up--her daughters. And when grandmother becomes weak and ill, or, what is worse, dies, what then? Who then will manage the household?</p>
   <p>If everyone engages in the struggle for existence, if mothers, still young and strong, cannot or will not give up their work, who will care for them at home? For home to the working woman, just as to a man, is the quiet refuge of peace and happiness. No recreation, no outside activity, can take the place of the quiet peace of home. But working women owe their peace and happiness mostly to their mothers--the women of yesteryear. These mothers are indispensable to their daughters, making everything easier for them, and in many cases making it possible for them to find outside work.</p>
   <p>Despite all this, unfortunately, it often happens that these "mothers of yesteryear" are spoken of as something out of place. They do not earn money, so they do not count at all. It must be called to mind, therefore, that these uneducated, unfamed, simple mothers of long ago help their daughters <pb facs="5423968_4_1181.jpg" n="5"/>earn their living by untiring love and care.</p>
   <p>The rising generation of daughters, already trained professionally, may say one day, when their mothers fail to render the same sort of service in the home:</p>
   <p>"How good Grandmother was! Too bad she is gone--too bad mother isn't like her!"</p>
