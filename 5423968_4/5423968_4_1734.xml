   <p>On the 23rd of August, 1915, the Insurance Department of the State of Illinois approved the charter of the Polish Union Fire Insurance Company with a reserve capital of one million dollars. According to the law, this reserve was to be accumulated within two years of the approval of the charter. Since the two-year term is nearly ended, and we have accumulated only a hundred thousand dollars, plus interest, and since the state does not permit reduction of the reserve fund before the company begins to operate, we are forced to submit an application to form a new company under a different name and with a smaller reserve fund.</p>
   <p>Acting upon the advice of the superintendent of the Insurance Department of the State of Illinois, Mr. Potter, we have submitted an application for a charter under the name "Polonia Fire Insurance Company," with a reserve capital of one hundred thousand dollars. This new name seems to us even <pb facs="5423968_4_1735.jpg" n="2"/>better than the first, and describes our aim perfectly.</p>
   <p>The incorporators of this company are as follows: N. L. Piotrowski, J. F. Smietanka, federal collector of internal revenue, F. H. Helinski, cashier of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, the Reverend F. Wojtalewicz, Joseph Magdziarz, treasurer of the Polish National Alliance, J. S. Konopa, secretary of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Paul Drymalski, director of the Home Bank and Trust Company, Joseph Sadowski, Albert Nowak, County Commissioner, and others.</p>
   <p>The law further demands that each person who purchased shares in the Polish Union Fire Insurance Company give his written permission that his money be transferred to the new company, that is, the Polonia Fire Insurance Company. This is mandatory. In view of this fact, we request the shareholders to sign, without delay, the document for this purpose which will reach them through the mail or through one of the company's agents. When this formality has been attended to, a meeting of stockholders will be held, at which a complete report <pb facs="5423968_4_1736.jpg" n="3"/>of the trustees' activities will be given and a board of directors elected. The company will then be organized and ready to begin operations. The sooner these formalities are attended to, the sooner this new Polish enterprise will be an accomplished fact. The stockholders' funds are safely invested, according to the requirements of the law, in bonds and in real estate mortgages.</p>
   <p>On this occasion, we would like to say that our enemies, to whom everything Polish is "salt in the eye," are spreading all sorts of false rumors about our company, often using Polish hirelings. Pay no attention to these lies. With the good will of our countrymen, we shall build an organization that will be the pride of American Polonia.</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski,</p>
   <p>F. A. Kwasigroch,</p>
   <p>J. J. Sadowski,</p>
