  <body>
   <p>During the last session and examinations of attorneys, which are held in Springfield, Illinois, every two months by the State Examination Committee, sixty Chicagoans took the lawyer's examination. Of these Chicagoans three were of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>All three of these new Polish lawyers are members of the Polish National Alliance, and they are very active in the life of this organization.</p>
   <p>F. P. Garbarek, John S. Rybicki, and Roman Felix Welzant are the three fortunate young men to become attorneys.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Garbarek is a secretary of Group 1340 of the well-known Polish National Alliance Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Roman Welzant is a member of the Polish National Alliance, Department <pb facs="5423968_4_1432.jpg" n="2"/>of Education, and works very ardently for this well-known organization.</p>
   <p>Special attention must be given Mr. John S. Rybicki, who is a well-known member of the Polish Falcons, vice-president of the Polish Falcons of America, and also a member of the Polish National Alliance, Department of Education.</p>
   <p>Mr. John S. Rybicki, in spite of his youth, has already made a name for himself in society by his continuous and strenuous work for the good of his nationality.</p>
   <p>Mr. John S. Rybicki, will open his law office at 18th Street and Ashland Avenue, in the vicinity of Saint Adalbert's Church, in the neighborhood where he was born and reared.</p>
