   <p>Meeting of Polish bankers at Chicago! Is this a fable or is it not a fable? Because wherefore the Polish bankers? We have known only one or two. But why this meeting of Polish bankers in great numbers?</p>
   <p>But, nevertheless, such a meeting took place last Monday, as we informed you in yesterday's edition of our newspaper. About forty six persons participated in this meeting. About thirty of these were bankers, or in the strict sense of the word, connected with the banking industry.</p>
   <p>This was the first, as far as we know, meeting of this kind, and the first in the presence of an official representative of the Republic of Poland.</p>
   <p>The bank generally is the foundation of the economical development of every community. Without a bank, neither commerce nor industry can be developed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1523.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The banks are the symbol of prosperity in every country, and the more solid banks a country has, the more powerful and richer it is.</p>
   <p>If the Poles in America would have the right amount of rich banks in proportion to their population, it would not be swept around as it is today by other nationalities in America. We would occupy then higher offices in politics, commerce, and industry. We would be influential in directing the affairs of the country. We would offer proof of our vitality and independence. Without our own banks we are tools in the hands of others. Others are operating our money, in a great measure to our disadvantage, and we seem to be satisfied with any sort of percentage.</p>
   <p>That is not all, if we would own more banks in America, we would be able to have stricter commercial and industrial relations with Poland, which is in great need of capital. The Polish banks could take over into their own hands control of export and import between Poland and America.</p>
   <p>Not having any banks, our good desires in regard to Poland do not represent any meaning.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1524.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And why do we not have as many Polish banks as we should? We see two reasons--the first is that the Polish community in America does not know the true value of Polish banks. They are not sufficiently informed; they do not possess any knowledge in this respect. The other reason is that the Polish bankers, which we have had up to this time, do not unite; did not support themselves mutually; did not make it easier for others to establish banks. The field for Polish banks is large, because there is a shortage of bankers.</p>
   <p>The meeting of last Monday has this for itself. It brings closer, unites, and directs to one point the Polish bankers. Exchange of opinions, talk about Polish business and about tying relations on the financial path with Poland is so great and unusual in our relations that we do not hesitate to consider this fact as the beginning of a new era in our industrial and social life in America.</p>
   <p>We place the meeting of the Polish bankers in Chicago, not among fables, but into the live history of the Polish emigration.</p>
