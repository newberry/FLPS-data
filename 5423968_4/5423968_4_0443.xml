   <p>The government of the United States issuing War Saving Stamps and Thrift Stamps gives opportunity to the people to win the war. You don't have to be rich in order to buy a bond. You can help the government by buying 25c Thrift stamps. Every time you do that you buy a little 25c stamp you may be convinced that you are doing something for the country. Appealing to the people; to women who manage our households, to the children, to laborers, and to workers in general, the government is more generous than to large investors, who loaned billions of dollars and will lend more. So called Baby Bonds are backed by the rich resources of the United States, same as Liberty Bonds andpay interest of 4% quarterly. Do not hesitate to buy War Saving Stamps for every extra dollar you have, because United States Government made such arrangement that you may get your money for them in a few days if you need it. The Baby Bonds constitute golden opportunities for the children. How often your son or daughter wanted to know what to do in order to help the government to win the war. How often they tried to imitate soldiers in trenches or nurses taking care of the wounded soldiers. Now is the opportunity. When a child buys a Thrift Stamp at the post office, it most <pb facs="5423968_4_0444.jpg" n="2"/>probably furnishes means by which the lives of the American soldiers will be saved. By denying himself or herself candy , gum or toy it serves the country, like a soldier who bears arms! Such child, not only helps to supply the army in the field, but also helps to release some workers doing unnecessary work in factories. The year of 1918 will be known in history as a Saving for War Year.</p>
   <p>Before you buy something, think if you could not get along without this particular article. If so, use that money for buying Thrift Stamps. The United States government expects about $20.00 from every man, woman, or child in the country. Let us see how quickly, every one of us can supply our government with $20.00. Do not delay! You are able to buy two or three times as much.</p>
   <p>If you are able,buy more because there are those who are too poor to buy and again there are those who are indifferent. Remember that by helping your government you are helping yourself. You will also notice that this is the easiest saving system of any that has been tried. When you get old you will bless our government for giving you such golden opportunity to save and invest your money.</p>
