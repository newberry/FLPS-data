   <p>The campaign of the Record against immoral houses along Milwaukee Avenue and on the West Side of Chicago has met with a temporary setback--but it will be continued none the less energetically.</p>
   <p>We are informed that Chief of Police Badenoch and his assistant, Mr. Ross, who visited the places exposed by the Record, did not find sufficient evidence on which to arrest their owners. This was undoubtedly due to the fact that the owners of the places mentioned, were warned in advance--and were prepared accordingly. All of the places were practically empty. On the other hand, the citizens of our wards have decided to give their aldermen an opportunity to act and to show us what they can do in this serious matter. For this reason, the Record informs us, tomorrow's mass meeting at the Bradley Street hall has been canceled.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1033.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are further informed that another reason for this action is the fact that the Forty-Hour Devotional Services will begin tomorrow in the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, and consequently no meetings can be held in the hall there. Therefore, there will be no meeting tomorrow in the Bradley Street hall. Instead, the Record announces, a meeting will be held at four o'clock in the afternoon in the Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>One way or another, the campaign begun by the Record will not fail.....It will be carried on to the end--and we will find a way to rid the community of the rotten immorality which has begun to spread in our midst with such alarming speed.</p>
