   <p>Everyone must help if we are to win. The soldiers must obey the orders or there will be no army. The people must be one or there will be no nation. Therefore, wishing to win, all of us must obey orders. This is your war guide for use in your home. It tells you what foods you must save in order to provide ourselves and our Allies; it tells how we can stretch our supplies so every one will have enough without any harm to your health or your strength. Your government does not ask you to give up the three square meals a day - nor even one. All it asks is that you eat less of the foods we need to keep the armies going, and eat all you want of the other things of which we have plenty. Eat plenty - keep up your strength and you will help to win the war. You have dedicated to the nation everything that you have; you are asked now to give up, just some habits of the kitchen and the table. America and her Allies must not run out of wheat, meat, or fats. If we let that happen, Germany will win the war. We must save sugar, use every drop of milk and we must learn to follow directions.</p>
