   <p>Yesterday evening a serious group of our ladies, together with representatives of the ugly sex, met at the Polish Press Club, 2138 Pierce Avenue, in order to discuss with Mr. Virden, official of the State, about obtaining a charter for the newly organized Society for the Protection of Women. This society, which will engage in a wide field of humanitarian activities, will bend every effort to help poor girls and women immigrants from Poland in order to save them from dishonor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Virden, after learning of the aims and purposes of the new society, promised that he would do his best to see that an appropriate charter is granted the society. He said the State would aid these noble efforts.</p>
   <p>Mrs. F. Janiszewski was chairman of the meeting. Mrs. Helen Setmajer read a discussion of the problem in Polish, and Mrs. Klarkowski read a discussion in English. The discussions were conducted by Mrs. Mary Sakowski, Mrs. Magdalene Milewski, Mrs. A. Neuman, and others. Among the male speakers were <pb facs="5423968_4_1201.jpg" n="2"/>Judge E. K. Jarecki and Attorney Klarkowski. It should be mentioned that representatives of all of our publications were present, and that they promised to discuss this matter widely in the press. We will do this in the very near future.</p>
