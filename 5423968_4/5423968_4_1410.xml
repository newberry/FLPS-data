   <p>Every association of professional men must fill a certain general need in its particular field and on this basis alone it is responsible to the public. For this reason, we feel it our duty to make a report of the first year of our activity.</p>
   <p>The Polish Dentists' Association was organized through the efforts of Dr. W. Koniuszewski. At its first meeting, the organization took over the charter of a similar organization which had existed for a few years (the active members were Doctors Nowacki, Zielinski, Wybraniel, and W. A. Gorny). At the next meeting, a constitution was drawn up and accepted and officers were elected. Since then, meetings have been held every month. At each meeting scientific and technical matters in the dental field, arising out of lectures presented by members, have been discussed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1411.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the outside, the Association's members have spread the theory of mouth hygiene through the Polish press and through their so-called bulletin, "In efforts for health".</p>
   <p>Those who have full membership in the association are as follows: Dr. S. Gorny, 19th Street and Ashland Avenue, member of Press Committee; Dr. Kobrzynski, president, 801 Milwaukee Avenue; Dr. F. Kubiak, 11411 South Michigan Avenue, Pullman, Illinois; Dr. J. J. Liss, treasurer, 1401 North Ashland Avenue; Dr. W. Nowacki, vice-president and librarian, 2891 Milwaukee Avenue; Dr. H. Ordan, 1052 Milwaukee Avenue, censorship committee; Dr. F. Pelka, 1609 West 13th Street, membership committee; Dr. J. Strozewski, 2028 North Robey Street; Dr. N. S. Trafny, 5129 West 31st Street, Cicero, Illinois; Dr. E. J. Urbanowicz, secretary, 4644 South Ashland Avenue; Dr. H. J. Urbanowicz, South Chicago; Dr. J. Zabrocki, 25 East Washington Street; Dr. J. Zielinski, 1152 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>Dr. S. Lepak, C. D. C., Chicago, Illinois, and Dr. S. Chadlupski, 1207 50th <pb facs="5423968_4_1412.jpg" n="3"/>Street, New York City, New York, are members extraordinary.</p>
   <p>Student members are as follows: A. M. Jozefczyk, 2137 North Hamlin Avenue; P. Kruszynski, 1849 Warren Avenue; A. S. Lepak, 1822 West Monroe Street; S. M. Mioduszewski, 2137 North Hamlin Avenue; W. Osowski, 1840 West Adams Street; B. B. Pawlowski, 2214 West Lorel Avenue; S. Pacer, 4644 South Hermitage Avenue; A. Piekarski, 3036 North Hamlin Avenue; J. Skowron, 1739 North Lincoln Street; W. Ulanowicz, 1822 West Monroe Street; Z. Zagorski, 2137 Haddon Avenue.</p>
   <p>Any Pole licensed to practice dentistry in the State of Illinois who is a member of the Chicago Dental Association--in other words, any Pole who is an active member of a professional association and abides by the code of ethics--may be a full member. Any Pole practicing dentistry under the above conditions outside the State of Illinois may be a full member extraordinary. Any Pole studying dentistry at a recognized school may be a student member.</p>
   <p>Because of these restrictions, the Polish Dentists' Association has not been <pb facs="5423968_4_1413.jpg" n="4"/>able to include all of the Polish dentists, while those who could meet the requirements evidently do not recognize their public duty in connection with their professional work. We have hopes, however, that our membership list will grow in proportion to the spreading of our influence and the understanding of our principles. The aim of the Association is twofold: mutual advancement in the professional field and honest treatment of patients, and the spreading of the theories of mouth hygiene among laymen by individual effort, through the press, by lectures, and so on.</p>
   <p>The first year of our activity has brought about a mutual understanding, a certain harmony of action, an understanding of the duties of professional men to the public.</p>
   <p>On these principles, we can expect a great deal more useful work in our second year, and obvious results.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we feel it our public duty to thank the editors of this paper <pb facs="5423968_4_1414.jpg" n="5"/>for their kindness in giving us space in their columns. We hope for their continued co-operation.</p>
   <p>For the Press Committee,</p>
   <p>Dr. Stephen S. Gorny.</p>
